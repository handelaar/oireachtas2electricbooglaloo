      <P>Tá scéala faighte agam ó Cheann Comhairimh Toghcháin an Uachtaráin á chur in úil dom go ndearna sé, an 9 Samhain 1990, a dhearbhú Mary Robinson a bheith tofa mar Uachtarán ar Éirinn.</P>
      <P>I have received a communication from the Presidential Returning Officer informing me that he had, on 9 November 1990, declared Mary Robinson to have been elected President of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the President-elect, Mary Robinson.  It is appropriate that the various groupings in the Seanad be allowed an opportunity to express their good wishes.  Before we deal with the Order of Business, I will call on the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what we can say in regard to the events of last week is that we had three very fine candidates seeking election to the Presidency of Ireland. Any one of them would have played an important role in that particular field.  We can offer our commiserations to Brian Lenihan and his family and to Austin Currie and his family.  But on the day, 7 <Col N="1350" /> November, it was the votes of the people of Ireland who chose Mary Robinson to be our next President.  She is my President, she is your President.  The officeholder of the Presidency deserves our respect, our loyalty and our support.  I have no doubt that she will have that in abundance from Members of this House.</P>
      <P>My memory of Mary Robinson &mdash; she was a Member of this Seanad for approximately 20 years &mdash; was that of a person of great intellect.  She was highly articulate, she was very much an independent person.  Those are some of the qualities that persuaded so many people to cross their own traditional party lines to ensure what can only be described as a remarkable success.  On the day, of course, we were electing a person to what is a symbolic position rather than, say, to an office of real political power.  We were not in fact electing a Government. Indeed, the polls suggest that the majority of Irish people would have shown satisfaction with the performance of the Government if there had been an election on that particular day.  What happened on the day showed that Mary Robinson was a good winner and a clear winner.  The Irish people in their wisdom wished to elect a different kind of President. I think the major task now for the President is to translate into action the great groundswell of goodwill and the obvious desire for change that abounds throughout the land for her, to translate the Presidency into a resource for the people, to bring a new freshness and a new dimension to Irish life.  On your behalf and on my own behalf I warmly congratulate Mary Robinson on her success and wish her a highly successful and enjoyable Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the Leader of the House in offering our mead of praise to the candidates Austin Currie, Brian Lenihan and indeed to Mary Robinson.  It is a matter of particular joy to me as a long-serving Member of the House to find that at last a distinguished colleague, who rendered such valiant service to the State and to the people of Ireland here in our own Chamber, should <Col N="1351" /> be elected as Uachtarán na hÉireann.  I want to join with Senator Fallon and with all my colleagues in offering her our warmest congratulations and assuring her of our full loyalty during her term of office.</P>
      <P>It is particularly joyous for the Members of this House to see a colleague so honoured by the people.  Those of us who worked with her, who knew her dedication to the job and the depth of research that she put into all of her speeches, can look forward to a President who will be extremely meticulous and who will carry out her functions as the Constitution demands.  In some of her speeches she said that she would like to extend the bounds of the Presidency as far as possible.  Looking at television last week it occurred to me that it would be nice if we had a State opening of the Seanad, even if it was only after the Seanad elections.  Perhaps since the Standing Orders of the House now provide for VIPs to come and address the Seanad, it would be nice if we could have a State opening of the Seanad each year. Again, may I wish the new President every happiness and success.</P>

      <P>Just before I call Senator Brendan Ryan I want to point out that we want to ensure that every group has an opportunity to express their good wishes.  There are lady Members of the Seanad and we should afford them an opportunity in a special way because of the fact that the President is a lady.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm cúpla focal a rá faoin a tharla sa tír seo an tseachtain seo caite.  Tá sé scríofa sna nuachtáin gur ainmnigh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre, Páirtí na nOibrithe agus Páirtí an Chomhaontais Ghlais Mary Robinson, agus tá sé sin fíor.  Mar fho-líne don stair <Col N="1352" /> agus b'fhéidir gan aon fháth eile, tá anbhród ormsa go raibh m'ainm féin ar an bhfoirm ainmiúcháin dí chomh maith le mo chara an Seanadóir Norris.  Is beag an tionchar, ta mé cinnte a bhí agam féin &mdash; ní fheadar faoin Seanadóir Norris &mdash; i rogha an phobail ach ba é mo ráiteas féin faoin Uachtáranacht a bhí taobh thiar den rud beag sin a dheineas.</P>
      <P>I do not want in any way to go back over the events of the Presidential Election. It is, I think, a considerably good reflection on the stability and maturity of our democracy that Mary Robinson's election is now accepted as a good thing and a welcome thing, and that the relative merits of the other candidates are not in dispute but that the choice of the people has been a good one.  As one who has been on the losing side of far more battles in politics than on the winning side, I am still happy to record a view that I have recorded when I have often lost; that I have a great respect for the judgment, perception and intelligence of the Irish people.  That is something I have said long before this Presidential Election.  I said it when I was losing and I am happy to say it now on the one occasion on which I have been on the successful side.</P>
      <P>I think it is an exciting and a promising period of Irish history in which a different view of Ireland has been endorsed by the people, and however peculiarly we arrive in this House, we are all servants of the people.  I do not want to overestimate my own influence, so I will say quite simply, as a footnote to history that I am very glad that my name, along with that of Senator Norris, was on her nomination paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought on an occasion like this I could speak without interruption from the other side.  I have deliberately avoided making remarks that were in the least bit offensive to anybody else and I do believe the Members opposite could have shown the courtesy that I have attempted to show on this matter and not bother to heckle just for once.  I was saying nothing in the least bit provocative, I was trying simply to <Col N="1353" /> explain that I do not want to gloat over what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say quite simply, in conclusion, that it was one of the particular pleasures of my political career to have had my name associated with that campaign and whatever little effort and whatever influence I had associated with that campaign.  I know that President-elect Robinson has the support of everybody in the House because that is the tradition of our democracy and I know it will be true on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to extend my congratulations to Mary Robinson on her election as President of this country. I think she will be a President who will be worthy of the office and indeed worthy of all the Irish people.  She has had a very distinguished record; indeed a very distinguished record in this House.  I think her election marks something of a new order.  She is the first President in this country who comes from the left wing frame of attitude.  She is of course the first woman to be elected President.  That is certainly a landmark and a very important breakthrough.  She is also the youngest person ever to be elected President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Member of the Labour Party, it is a matter of great pride and delight for <Col N="1354" /> us.  It was our Leader Dick Spring who first approached Mary Robinson.  It was our party, along with other parties, who nominated her.  I think her election symbolises a new maturity and an emergence of new values in Ireland, and those I certainly welcome.</P>
    <P>I would like to sound a note of commiseration to the other two candidates.  I think both of them conducted themselves very well and with great dignity throughout the campaign.  Despite whatever elements of turbulence did arise, I certainly think that the two other candidates conducted themselves with great dignity. If either of them had been elected I would certainly have had no hesitation in accepting and acknowledging that they too would have been worthy Presidents. There had to be a winner and of course it was great that Mary Robinson was that winner and I certainly want to wish her every success and happiness during her Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of myself and the Progressive Democrats I would like to concur with the previous speakers in congratulating Mary Robinson on her election as President.  There is no doubt that it is a very definite statement by the Irish people in wanting to look forward as an emerging nation and it sends a very clear message to the youth of Ireland. That is what is at the centre of the election of Mary Robinson.  It augurs well for the future, it brings out hope and it sends a very clear message to those young people who have left this country, that Ireland is changing and that it is looking forward. How young Mary Robinson is, has already been referred to.  This will send a very positive message throughout the world from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need, in times that are changing, in the development of the EC, to have a very forward looking view.  We in the Oireachtas must take heart from the message that the Irish people have sent forth in the election of Mary Robinson. The changes that are possible now in Irish politics are unbounded.  We look forward to supporting the President.  I also agree with other speakers in commiserating <Col N="1355" /> with the other two fine candidates that stood.  Somebody had to win and the people were the final arbiters in the matter.  We look forward now to the future and to the potential for change in Irish politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would like to agree with everything that has been said regarding President-elect Robinson gomg to the Park.  I hope I would not be wrong in claiming that I might have put it into Deputy Dick Spring's head that a woman should go to the Park.  The difference between Deputy Spring and my own party is that he listened, mine did not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, through you, a Chathaoirligh, to convey to President-elect Robinson my warm good wishes. Mary Robinson, from the first day I came here in 1977 until the day she decided to stand down from this House, was a very good and close friend of mine.  At times, when I needed advice, I asked Mary for it.  We certainly did not hold the same views on a lot of things, as everybody here in this House is well aware, but that did not stop us from being very close and good friends.  Nobody was more happy than President-elect Robinson when I was appointed Cathaoirleach of this Seanad by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>So, without long speeches, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to convey to Mary and to her family my sincere good wishes and good health to serve in the Áras.  I was lucky a way back years ago to visit there.  In recent times I have not been there too often, but I maybe there in the future again.  I will not state the date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that it is because I am a woman that I am being <Col N="1356" /> given the opportunity to get up and say a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you are being afforded an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say it is nice to have a little act of discrimination in favour of women for a change.  I never have subscribed to the view &mdash; I know Mary Robinson never subscribed to it, nor, I am sure, did any of the other women in this Seanad &mdash; that you vote for a woman because she is a woman, as was a view held some years ago by the Womens Political Association.  Mary Robbinson was elected President probably overwhelmingly by the women of this country but it was because she was an outstanding candidate and because she was held in very high esteem.  I would not like to say that I took her seat here; she resigned but I sit in the seat which she probably sat in.  That is something of which I am very much aware, and I realise how difficult it would be for me, or for anyone else, to live up to the very high standards which she maintained and to the contribution which she made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that she was elected because she was the most independent of the three candidates that went forward for election.  She needed, of course, to have party support.  She could not have been nominated &mdash; there simply were not sufficient Independents to do so.  I am interested to hear, and to know now officially, that Senators Ryan and Norris nominated her or put their names to her paper.  I know she had 20 without them. I say that because it is interesting to note that it is not possible to find out &mdash; it is a secret document &mdash; the nomination papers of the candidates.  I tried strenuously on more than one occasion and Mr. Sexton, the returning officer, is not prepared to tell you who signed the nomination paper.  I did, of course, in fact know because these two gentlemen told me, but I do think that that is an extraordinary situation, that the public, a Member of the Seanad and somebody who has nominating powers cannot find <Col N="1357" /> out what names were put on the various nominating papers.  I think it is something which should be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, I just want to remind you that the content of what you have been saying is not forming part of the words of congratulation that we intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>My wholehearted wish is, above all, to congratulate Mary Robinson and to join with the other speakers in wishing her health and happiness in her years in the office.  I think that the Irish people showed on this occasion, as was said by Senator Fallon, that they differentiate between other elections and the election of the President, that they can go out and vote for a non-party person.  I think it is a pity that the parties hold this as a barometer of the support for their particular party and that all the subsequent happenings took place.  That is an unfortunate position but the parties dominate in this country not only the Presidency but also this House and all the county councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminding you again, Senator, and in fairness to every other Member of the House, if we do not have the co-operation of one another we will have a lot of difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish with one last remark.  I would like to thank the incumbent President, President Hillery, and to congratulate him on 14 excellent years of office.  He did the country proud. I certainly feel very proud of his contribution and I would like to thank him for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely delighted to congratulate President-elect Mary Robinson here today.  It comes very close to my own heart because she actually occupied the position I occupied myself, which is President of the Women's Political Association.  I think that Mary Robinson succeeded in attracting votes from all across the divides of Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> It would be remiss of me not to congratulate the other two excellent candidates for their campaigning, their efforts and indeed their dignity in the final stages.</P>
    <P>I think that President-elect Mary Robinson will indeed be a resource for the people, as she said she wishes to be. I hope that the goodwill that we hear this afternoon will follow her also in her endeavours in the Park.  I think particularly for women it is tremendous that a woman has been chosen, a young woman of such enormous ability, somebody who was a Senator, somebody who has had such an excellent track record.  I think she will be a badge of courage for Irish women.  I hope that they will take that on board and that they will realise that with her election as President the horizons are widened for every woman in Ireland.  I sincerely hope that that message will come through, particularly to all those women who voted for her. That is one reason why I am so proud to congratulate her and to wish her well in the coming years.  Also I would like to say how much I congratulate her husband for his support and also her family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity of offering my wishes of congratulations to President-elect Mary Robinson.  Mary is an inspiration now for all the people of Ireland, not just women, not just young people, but for all.  She was elected by the majority.  She is a person who is now carrying the banner for the whole of Ireland.  But she carried the banner at a time when it was most unpopular for somebody to come out so strongly in areas of social legislation which would have been controversial at the time.  She did that as a young woman against the tide.  She is now a person that all of us should be very proud of, for her courage, for her personality in the conducting of her campaign where she came across as a credit to Irish people, a credit to the people of 1990.  She has changed the direction of Irish thinking because she is there as somebody who took on what people thought initially was <Col N="1359" /> going to be an uphill battle.  As it happens, she set out, she won the people of Ireland and she will continue to win the people of Ireland.  I hope she will be an inspiration for more women to begin their political careers with the county councils but particularly in Seanad Éireann from which she started at a very young age.</P>
      <P>I would like, too, to congratulate the other two candidates.  It was a very interesting occasion for Ireland.  She will continue to be a leading light for us not just here but also right across Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to say that it is important to bear in mind that it was not just women who voted for Mary Robinson, perhaps I speak as an example, like Leopold Bloom, of a new womanly man, claiming that I also voted for Mary Robinson.  I hope this does not violate the secrecy of the ballot.  As Senator Jackman said, it is a particularly important election for the women of this country because the fact that a woman has achieved the highest office of this State establishes a new role model for women &mdash; the highest offices of this State are now clearly attainable by women. I hope that this will lead to a greater participation by women and the allowance of a greater participation by women at all levels of Irish life and Irish society.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me this opportunity to speak, although I know that you had wished perhaps to restrict the discussion because we have other business to get on to, but I have known Mary Robinson for almost 30 years.  We entered college in the same year, we were both elected to a foundation scholarship in 1965 and when she was elected first of all to this House I had some small official role &mdash; I think I was something called her election agent at that time.  Then it was my privilege to engage her services professionally in a number of legal cases some of which, I hope, have left some small mark on the fabric of this society and with at least one of which, Sir, I think you are also acquainted yourself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that you would not wish to be dissociated from them either, but I will not involve you in a wrangle about them.  I merely wish to indicate that it has been my privilege to secure the services of somebody who was a very distinguished barrister and representative and who has served this country well not just in the Irish courts but also in the European courts.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan said, it was a great privilege also for me to be one of the signatories to her papers.  Senator Hederman indicated, first of all, that she was unaware officially but she was aware unofficially for quite some time, as I made it clear to her when she invited me to sign her own papers, but I had already committed myself to signing those of Mary Robinson.</P>
      <P>Mary Robinson brings to this office qualities of courage, integrity and honesty and she is also bringing something that has developed as far as the perceptions of a number of people are concerned.  She always had these qualities. She always had intellectual qualities. People may have mistaken her as a very distant person, but I think the affection and the emotion with which her campaign was received throughout the country reflected itself on her and allowed her &mdash; and I think she is quite a shy person in her own way &mdash; to display that warmth and that affection back to the people of Ireland.  This was clearly reflected in what was a regal attendance at the RDS.  Perhaps it was this that suggested to Senator McDonald that she might perform an opening of the Upper House of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to finish by making one comment, which is not I think at all controversial but puts it into a certain context. I think we the Irish people are at heart overwhelmingly a decent and tolerant people.  That was shown throughout this election, not only in the support for Mary Robinson but also by the deep affection and sympathy with which the troubled candidacies of the other two <Col N="1361" /> candidates were regarded.  Unlike other countries such as the United States of America, where there was a recent Presidential Election in which the world &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; was traduced, and those people of the United States of America permitted this to happen, the world &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; by the election of Mary Robinson, has been resoundingly vindicated and I thank God for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the President-elect, Mary Robinson, on her election as the first woman President of Ireland.  Like a lot of people here I do not know her very well.  I know her slightly, but from what I know of her she will be a very visible President.  On that account she will be a role maker for the women and the youth of Ireland.  I would like to take this opportunity to wish her well in Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>

I felt it appropriate to say something because I was a Member of the Oireachtas with the President-elect, Mary Robinson, for a number of years. I was a member of the first Oireachtas Committee for Secondary Legislation on the European Community with her in 1973-77.  I was also a member of the International Commission with her for about 10 years.  Knowing her background I know she will be a great credit to this country.  I take pride in the fact that her origins are in my own county of Mayo, and I wish her every success.  In saying that I would like to commiserate with Deputies Lenihan and Currie.  They fought a good fight and I wish them both every success and health in the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in best wishes and congratulations to Mary Robinson.  I knew her as a fellow Senator.  She was indeed at that time a very able front bench spokesperson for the Labour Party.  My recollection is that at that time she occupied one of the front bench seats here.  She was always an exceptionally courteous person and also <Col N="1362" /> had a very thoughtful and imaginative contribution to make to our debates.  I am sure she will carry that dignity and courtesy through to Áras an Uachtaráin now that she is the first citizen of this country.  I wish her and her family well.</P>
      <P>I would like if I may also to join in a word to the other candidates, the candidate from my own party, who, in defeat, as he did in illness, showed great magnanimity and courage; also the other candidate who had a very difficult situation and also acted with great dignity.  We must all be very pleased on all sides of this House that we had three such excellent candidates for the office of President.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to join in the congratulations to Mary Robinson on her marvellous success.  It is a historic moment and it augurs very well for the kind of society that she has projected and the ideals in her campaign.  She has over many years been associated with issues, particularly social ones, which have been to some extent marginalised in our society but which I believe have always been central and now are seen to be central in the minds of the people of Ireland by the enormous vote they have given her in electing her to the highest office in the land.  I believe we will benefit enormously by the ideals and the integrity which she will symbolise for us in our society, and democracy as a whole is certainly well and truly vindicated in this particular case.</P>
      <P>I would also like to commiserate with the other two candidates and state that they fought a very courageous campaign in difficult circumstances at times.  To the outgoing President we also owe a vote of congratulations for the very fine way in which he performed his duties over the last 14 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very good and welcome sign that the President-elect has already indicated <Col N="1363" /> her awareness of the importance of the Irish language in the life of the nation. That in turn illustrates her awareness of the rich complexity of this country.  I would like to say that this bench of university Senators is particularly pleased at her election.  I recall her kindness to me in 1977 when I was first elected here in showing me the ropes.  She was then an old hand as it were.  We on this bench are particularly pleased and I might suggest that the rest of the House should regard this bench with a new respect.  Who knows what further greatness waits to be born &mdash; President Norris in 1997?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take particular pride in offering congratulations to Mary Robinson in this House of the Oireachtas.  In working with Mary Robinson in the House over a period of 17 years I got to know many of her qualities.  It was not until she really went out amongst the public over a very sustained period that the public came to recognise the qualities that a few of us had the privilege of knowing she possessed.  In offering congratulations to Mary Robinson I am doing this with over 800,000 people who actually rejoiced in her success.  As the months passed by the balance of the people who took part in that election will in fact also have cause to rejoice if they are not already rejoicing.</P>
      <P>From my own knowledge of Mary Robinson I am clearly satisfied that she will demonstrate how her actual independence will be the greatest possible evidence of how best the Constitution can be protected.  She has also shown that faith in people and a belief in oneself can pull down barriers no matter how high they are erected.  To Mary's tenacity, courage and ability I would like to say thanks very much.  With regard to her family who stood by her I would like to offer them the thanks of the nation, because they played a role in helping the nation to elect such a President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other two candidates, it was a sad occasion for me that something went wrong.  I was very sorry because I was very friendly with Deputy <Col N="1364" /> Brian Lenihan.  I did not know Deputy Austin Currie that well but I agree with what is being said here.  They made a great effort in the campaign.  We should take the Taoiseach's advice about putting things aside and forgetting them.  He said that on the day Mary Robinson was declared President-elect.  I would also like to join with Senator Costello in thanking the outgoing President who was a very fine President and performed the duties of office very capably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the words of congratulations which have been expressed by all sides of this House to former Senator Mary Robinson. There is a particular pleasure for these benches in that it shows that any Independent Senator can reach the highest office in this land provided he or she serves 2 years' apprenticeship.  Mary Robinson has achieved that and is to be congratulated on doing that.  To be realistic, all of us thought what she achieved was impossible six months ago when she launched that campaign. Nobody really gave her a chance and she achieved what appeared to be politically impossible at that time.  There is a lesson in it for us all which I hope not only ourselves but the political parties will take, that is that there is a wind of change blowing across Ireland which some in this House and in the other House seem, as a result of recent events, reluctant to accept.  It is a matter which we will all have to take into account even though it was a non-political election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that, in particular, the concern which she has shown for stretching her hands across the Border in a non-political way in meeting people North and South and bringing them together in a non-political way is something which she will follow up and which the Government, the Opposition, and everybody here will give her the greatest assistance with.  I would like to agree with those who said it was a healthy election in that we had three very good candidates.  I can say without any shame or difficulty that I would have felt very comfortable if any of them had been elected President of <Col N="1365" /> this country, and that is a healthy thing for Irish democracy and Irish politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be repetitive but I wish to place on the record my delight at the election of Mary Robinson to the Presidency.  In addition to the factors that have been mentioned already, that she is relatively young, that she is a woman and indeed that she is also a lady, it should also be noted &mdash; and it has not been noted already &mdash; that she is about to become our first citizen and the embodiment of our State.  In that respect it is appropriate that this House should reaffirm its loyalty to our present first citizen and to one who is to become our first citizen, and thus reaffirm its loyalty to the office of the Presidency.</P>
      <P>Mary Robinson conducted an excellent campaign.  She won fair and square through an electoral system which has served this country very well over many years.  I would also join in the tributes that have been paid to the other candidates. Like Senator Ross I would have been perfectly happy to have seen any of them in Áras an Uachtaráin.  We wish Mary Robinson well over the next seven years.  I hope that the objectives and aspirations which she has expressed over recent weeks will be fulfilled to the utmost.  We can assure her of our loyalty in this House.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to offer my congratulations to Mrs. Robinson on her election as President.  She can be assured as President of this country that she will have our complete support and loyalty.  I would also like to congratulate the other candidates on the manner in which they carried out the election.  I regret that my own party candidate was not elected but nevertheless I feel that Mrs. Robinson will be a very good President and that she will carry out the duties as required by the Constitution in an excellent fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say &mdash; I feel I should say this &mdash; that of all the three candidates I thought that Austin Currie was magnificent in that each morning, in spite of the fact that he knew the polls were <Col N="1366" /> against him, he showed tremendous courage in going out, meeting the interviewers from RTE and the media generally, meeting all the people throughout the country and keeping a bold face on it.  His family were equally staunch.  He was absolutely excellent and I would personally like to offer my congratulations to him on the courage he displayed.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party owe Deputy Currie a lot, and I would like to think that there is a great future for him in politics this side of the Border.  For anyone to suggest that people should not vote for him because he was from the North is absolutely ridiculous.  He is a first-class Irishman and such a suggestion should not be tolerated.  The words of praise I have used in regard to Austin Currie is not taking from Brian Lenihan or Mrs. Robinson.  I wanted to say that about him because I was so impressed by his spirit and great courage.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader <Col N="1367" /> of the House to clarify the situation about the length of speeches on the statements under item No. 2.  I understand there was a suggestion that speakers should be confined to 15 minutes but my colleagues and I believe that on such a wide-ranging subject, covering very important legislation dealing with the European Council, 15 minutes is totally inadequate. Therefore, we respectfully suggest that it should be either left open or at least extended to 30 minutes.  One understands that some Members will not need that length of time but some latitude is called for and I would ask the Leader of the House to grant that.</P>

I stress the words &ldquo;to initiate in this House&rdquo;.  I particularly plead with the Leader of the House not to list for us legislation which will be arriving to us secondhand from the other House.  I would appreciate a list of the legislation which will be initiated in this House in this term.</P>
      <P>There is the other issue which I raised with the Leader of the House recently and which he assured me he would be able to respond to by today, that is, my request for a debate on the crisis in the education service.  We have touched on many aspects of Irish life over the last number of weeks.  We are discussing Europe today but there are aspects of Ireland which still need to be discussed and I would appeal for a discussion on that point as well.</P>

He was President of that Association and served it with distinction as a secondary teacher.  I would also like to support Senator O'Toole's request to the <Col N="1368" /> Leader of the House to make time available for a debate on education.  There is a crisis in education and a whole range of areas need to be addressed.  It is a matter that merits discussion in this House and I would like to ask the Leader to consider making time available at an early opportunity.</P>

      <P>The European Economic and Monetary Union and indeed European Political Union will have profound effects on this country and I suggest that the Oireachtas has not been particularly vigilant in assessing decisions of the European Communities; indeed, the whole question of democratic accountability will need to be looked at.  I am suggesting that item No. 2 is extremely important for this country, that the Oireachtas has not been playing its full role in scrutinising decisions of the EC and that adequate time should be made available to all those Senators who wish to discuss it.  If the list of speakers is not completed tonight, time should be made available for further discussion either tomorrow or next week, because the matter has profound implications for this country.</P>

Having said that, I rose to ask the Leader of the House, regarding item No. 1 on the Order Paper when he proposes to move the Second Stage of the Altamont Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had some time on our hands in this House since July.  We did not sit last week and the previous week we sat for a very short time.  Will the Leader of the House say when we will get some legislation?  There seems to be an extraordinary mix-up in the priorities as to where legislation goes first.  I plead with the Leader of the House to go to the Government and ask them, &ldquo;for God's sake give us some legislation which is meaningful, that will be introduced in <Col N="1369" /> this House this week or next week so that all legislation does not go first to the other House&rdquo;.  What happens every session, what happened in the summer and what has happened year after year is that too much legislation goes to the Dáil first and it all comes here in a rush just before Christmas and we have to send Bills through by guillotine, late sittings and all sorts of disorganised order of the House late in the day.  It would be far better if we got legislation before the Dáil in certain cases, and we do justice to it and not rush it through as happened at the end of the last session.</P>
      <P>I would also like to endorse what Senator Costello said and support the plea for a debate on education.  I am not sure that there is any reason why we should not sit on a Tuesday to debate special subjects like education or other subjects which do not come under the heading of legislation.  We have time on our hands at the moment and such subjects should be debated, and we can sit extra days as well.</P>

It is interesting that there is a high percentage of people here who are still teaching or have taught, not that I am saying that education is the domain of teachers only. Over the past 12 months the only time I have got any chance to mention education has been asking on the Order of Business whether it was a franchise for universities or whether it was items on motions on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House, in support of my colleagues, what has happened. I have spent long, unreported &mdash; so that I cannot be accused of any publicity seeking &mdash; but very fruitful days in this House dealing with Committee Stages of legislation introduced by the Government.  It seems to me that that flow of legislation introduced in this House has decreased almost to a trickle. It used to be major legislation as in the form of the Companies Bill, the Insurance Bill, and then at an earlier stage, the Status of Children Bill.  We have had major substantive legislation which was central to the affairs of this country dealt with in this House with considerable attention by both Government and Members on both sides of the House.  Why it is that, as legislation apparently continues to back up more and mroe in the other House, to the extent that legislation passed in this House upwards of a year ago, still has not managed to get through there and legislation continues to back up in the other House which could be introduced here.  We are capable of dealing with legislation in a responsible, intelligent and non-partisan fashion and have done so frequently.  I ask the Leader of the House if there is somebody somewhere, perhaps outside this House, who is reluctant to allow legislation of a significant nature to be introduced here.  If there is I suspect it is somebody that the Leader of the House has more influence over than I have, and I suggest that he deal with him and insist that this House be treated with the dignity it deserves.</P>

      <Col N="1371" /> I would also like to draw your attention, Sir, to the report of the last sitting of this House in which remarks which you said &mdash; and I accept your word &mdash; you did not hear are reported in the Official Report.  May I suggest that time be made available to Senator McCarthy on this occasion to stand up, do the proper thing, withdraw the remarks and have the record corrected?

      <P>First, I would like to say that I was interested in Senator Haughey's remarks about the lack of importance given to the question of developments within the European Community and the consequent urgency of taking this today with some seriousness. I welcome his remarks but I am afraid, over the last few years I have seen this <Col N="1373" /> House treated with anything but seriousness. In fact, I have seen it treated with increasing contempt.  As my distinguished colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, has said, there are a number of gauges for this that relate directly to the ordering of business and to the Order Paper.  The absence of significant legislative proposals is one.  The times at which we meet are another.  I recall being brought back here for ten minutes to discuss an item of legislation that benefited principally one company in this country.  Today we are meeting at 4 o'clock.  It would perhaps be unworthy of me to speculate as to whether there was a relationship between this and a certain athletic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like simply to refer to what Senator Ryan said.  I am not looking for any remarks to be withdrawn.  I do, however, sympathise with the holders of office in this State because it seems to me that there is a development of auricolitis politicos which affects principally the left ear, with variable but sustained deafness and affecting the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>

I did signal that I would be proposing such an amendment but after consultation with my colleagues I have decided that the proposal be taken third so that even were it to be passed it would not significantly interrupt the proposed business of the House, because it is my wish to be constructive. I await this being seconded. Senator Ross has indicated that he will second if he can do so, having already spoken, Senator Upton has indicated he will do so.  In any case, I would ask them, please, to articulate clearly so that they can be heard without any question of contradiction.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Senator Rory Kiely in his remarks in relation to time.  I ask the Leader of the House, to please, try to avoid the situation which we had here a fortnight ago where one Senator spoke in the statements on agriculture for well over an hour and subsequently the Acting Cathaoirleach made an appeal to other Senators to curtail their contributions, with which we tried to co-operate as best we could.  I share the view that this is a very important matter on European Union and on monetary union and that adequate time should be given, but I ask the Leader of the House to see to it that we regulate our affairs in some order so that those who wish to speak can do so.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to point out to the Leader of the House, if he does not already know it, the importance of item No. 2.  As I gauge it at this stage, we will have at most two and a quarter hours to discuss this most important item and the most important thing that is happening for this country since we joined the Community.  As other Senators pointed out, we had the debate on agriculture and, of course, it was unfortunate that some of us got only five <Col N="1375" /> minutes while others could speak for one and a half or two hours.  I would ask the Leader of the House to consider carrying over this debate into next week, because this is the single most important item we have discussed since this Seanad first met over a year ago.  It would be treating the matter almost with contempt just to brush it aside in a little over two hours.</P>
      <P>I plead with him to allow time next week to give all people a chance and to have a thorough discussion on it because we are dealing not only with economic and monetary union but with political union as well.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in the congratulations to the Minister, Deputy Wilson on his appointment as Tániste. Coming from the neck of the woods as he does, I am delighted for him.  I also would like to support Senator Rory Kiely on his mention of the amount of time given to each Senator in this House.  I am not suggesting that it should be 15 minutes but an amount of time should be given to each Senator and I ask the Leader of the House, whether it is 20 minutes or 30 minutes, that the time be shared equally between Senators and that some Senators would not be allowed to go on for over an hour or two hours, as has happened in this House quite recently, and other Senators would be reduced to five minutes.</P>

      <P>I formally second the proposal by Senator Norris that item 79 be taken third.  I would also like to say that I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Rory Kiely in the predicament he found himself in last week.  It is beyond my understanding as to why people find it necessary to go on and on in speeches that they make.  If the Leader of the House is making the suggestion that contributions on the European Union statement be confined to 15 minutes I certainly think that is a good idea and I feel that if people make a small effort to edit what they are going to say and to think about <Col N="1376" /> it it should be possible to get the substance of it into 15 minutes or indeed into a shorter period of time.</P>

      <P>On a different issue, I want to ask the Leader of the House a question.  I heard a rumour and it is one that deeply worries me, that a translation unit is to be installed in the centre of the VIP gallery.  I accept that it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or whoever has responsibility. It would be a good idea if we were asked for our opinion on this.  I accept that we need the translation unit in the House. Rather than have it installed either in that corner or where the monitor is, I understand there is another way of providing a translation service in this Chamber. It would be sad if such a unit were to destroy the appearance of the Seanad. I understand it is to be put there.  The ordinary backbenchers' opinions should be asked about it.</P>

      <P>Could I inquire as to why the House did not meet until 4 o'clock today?  As many speakers have <Col N="1377" /> said, we meet for little enough time as it is.  We had a very extended summer vacation; we came back for one week and did not meet last week.  It is disgraceful that we did not meet last week.  I do not see why the business of this Chamber, which is supposed to be nonparty political should come to a standstill because there is an election for the office of President. This week we meet at 4 o'clock.  I do not know what the reason is.  I suspect it may be because there was a European Cup match.  I do not know if that is the case. I would not like anyone to think that I am not interested.  I went to the trouble of going to Rome for the World Cup.  It is not that I am not interested but if that is the reason it gives a disgraceful example to the rest of the country.  If I am wrong in that and if there is another reason, I would like to know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald and indeed, many other Senators referred to the length of speeches and the debate on item No. 2, Statements regarding European Economic/Monetary Union and European Political Union.  I think Senator Raftery summed it up when he pointed out that last week when we had a debate on agriculture, for which there was a great demand, some speakers got two hours; others got two minutes.  That is true and I think it is wrong.  We tried, and it is preferable at all times to get agreement with the Whips for an orderly conduct of the debate if each speaker were allowed ten minutes, 15 minutes or 20 minutes everybody would get a fair amount of time.  For that debate we tried to get 15 minutes or thereabouts for each speaker and the Whips indicated that, unfortunately, agreement could not be reached.  Having said that, I just make this point, that the proposal was to finish the debate this evening at 9.30 p.m.  I certainly have no problems at all in asking the House to agree to an extension of the debate for next week, as was suggested by many Senators.  Some speakers like to go on for hours and half hours and so on. It is possible and I am not trying to curtail any debt but we should try to curtail our <Col N="1378" /> speeches to 15 or 20 minutes or thereabouts or less.  I am giving you a commitment here and now we will continue this debate next week because of the importance of it and the Whips will meet to decide on the appropriate times for next week.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole certainly, a fortnight or thereabouts, asked for a debate on education and I have it very much in mind.  Other speakers also referred to a debate on education.  I have gone out of my way since I became Leader to get debates which are of interest to all Senators, agricultural, EC matters and other matters, and I will pursue the matter of having a debate on education. However, there is no difficulty in the world for the Fine Gael Party, the Independent group or the Fianna Fáil group or the Labour group in putting down a Private Members' Motion dealing with all aspects of education.  In that way they will get three hours debate on that subject. That is another way of proceeding.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello offered congratulations to the Minister, Deputy John Wilson.  I totally subscribe to that.  I have no doubt he will be a very successful Tánaiste.  Senator Costello also asked for a debate on education and I have already replied to that.</P>
      <P>Senators Haughey and Staunton asked for an extension of time and I have given my reply to that.  Senator Staunton also inquired about item No. 1 on the Order Paper.  That, as he probably knows, is Private Business and I will discuss it with him at a later date and see what progress can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross and others referred to initiation of legislation.  I have to say that I am certainly trying to get extra legislation initiated in this House.  I have met the Taoiseach, as I said previously, and I am confident it will come.  Already, in the last few weeks, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, the Contractual Obligations Equal Law Bill and the Court (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill were initiated here &mdash; three Bills in a very short time.  I hope that trend continues.  I do not wish to be unfair to anybody; I know the day in <Col N="1379" /> question was, if you like, an unreal day in the life of both Houses of the Oireacthas but, the Second Stage of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill passed with only two speeches.  I do not think that is good enough.  I would ask Senators to be more attentive to their business and to debate Bills that come to this House. If is something that has been thrown at me from time to time that when we do get legislation we do not give it the time that it deserves.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackman also asked for a discussion on education. Senator Ryan referred to the translation problem, as did Senator Honan.  The problem there is, as the Cathaoirleach has outlined, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges dealt with this.  It was intended that there would be a remote control system operated from Setanta. We are told by the Office of Public Works that for absolutely technical reasons that is not possible and that it must be placed somewhere behind here.  In view of what has been said by Senator Honan and others it is something the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I am sure, will discuss again.  It is something appropriate to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan also referred to another issue involving Senator Séan McCarthy. I would like to talk to Senator Ryan privately about that and I will do so this evening.  I have noted what Senator Rory <Col N="1380" /> Kiely said regarding the extra time and hopefully that can be resolved.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe O'Reilly also referred to a debate on education.  I would again stress that Fine Gael or any other group can, at any time, have a three hour debate on education.</P>
    <P>At this time there is no proposal for a debate on the health services.  Again, Senator Norris referred to an extension of time.  I do not know what he means by this House not being treated with respect. Certainly, we go out of our way to respect all Members of the Seanad; I certainly do that and I know the Cathaoirleach and others and the Government generally have absolute respect for this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman asked why the time fixed for today was 4 p.m.  I would remind Senator Hederman that this House agreed to a 4 p.m. start.  It was in response to a request from a number of Senators on all sides of the House.  There is no point in hiding it: it was purely because this very important match was on at 1.30 p.m.  Some Senators wanted to go to the match; others wanted to see it on television. That was the thinking behind it. However, we are extending the sitting to 9.30 tonight.  Therefore we are not losing time by starting at 4 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity today to inform this House of the most recent developments in the process of preparation for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conferences on Political Union and on Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>We are engaged in the creation of a greatly enhanced degree of integration and dynamism in the community both as an inevitable follow-on to the process which saw the adoption of the Single Act in the mid-eighties and the pressure of events in Central and Eastern Europe in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is useful to recall the extent to which the relatively modest objectives of the Single Act have been amply achieved in the last three years: the completion of the Single Market is well on target with nearly three quarters of the necessary proposals adopted or close to adoption; the cohesion dimension of community policies has been established and additional funding is now on stream with the doubling of the resources of the structural funds; the Community has adopted a substantial profile in the environment area which has assumed such vital importance as a major world-wide <Col N="1382" /> preoccupation; an effective research and technological development policy is being developed enabling action to be taken at community level thus increasing the efficiency of the community in this vital area; the reform of the decision-making procedures has allowed the Council to take decisions by qualified majority thus speeding up the process. It has also allowed the Commission to improve its implementation procedures and has given the European Parliament a considerable degree of real influence in the legislative field; and finally, the provisions on political co-operation have enabled the member states to co-operate effectively in the sphere of foreign policy reflecting the influence which the member states possess in international issues.</P>
    <P>The success of the Single Act which was, as I have said, greater than we might have expected three years ago, was bound to create a demand for a more ambitious approach to closer integration. The initiative launched in June 1988 at the Hanover European Council to revive the movement towards economic and monetary union culminated in the decision to commence negotiations next month on the shape of the union.</P>
    <P>The initiative on economic and monetary union encouraged a similar initiative to seek closer political union.  During our Presidency in the first half of this year, we were able to lay the foundations for the work of the second Intergovernmental Conference which will consider the Treaty amendments required to bring about closer political union.</P>
    <P>Events in Central and in Eastern Europe have given added urgency to the process of closer integration.  One cannot but be struck by the fact that little more than 12 months ago most of the regimes which had been imposed on the countries of that region seemed solidly entrenched and unlikely to be easily removed. Indeed, the former German Democratic Republic was celebrating its 40th anniversary with full ceremony and confidence. Within a matter of weeks the whole political landscape had changed <Col N="1383" /> completely and relations with the region became an even greater priority for the community.  It was essential to support the new democratic governments which were emerging and needless to say the Community, which was already taking action to support Poland and Hungary, again took the lead in co-ordinating the international effort on behalf of the other countries.</P>
    <P>This work and in particular, the unification of Germany was a major theme of the Irish Presidency.  At the first Dublin European Council in April, we were able to give a warm welcome to the new Germany and to express satisfaction that unification was taking place under a Community roof.  The member states recognised the importance of unification for the Community as a whole and for that reason were prepared in Council to speed up their examination in the Council on the interim measures required to accommodate the former East German provinces in the Community.  Work has also proceeded rapidly on the detailed transitional measures which are now virtually agreed.</P>
    <P>The commitment of Germany and of Chancellor Kohl in particular to the process of closer economic and political integration played no small part in achieving the understanding and full co-operation of partners in the unification process.</P>
    <P>It is not only the countries of Central and Eastern Europe which are looking to the Community as a model for future development.  The last year has seen an intensification in relations between the Community and the countries of EFTA. Negotiations are at present under way on the European economic area or, in other words, the virtual extension of the internal market to those countries.  Furthermore, Austria has announced its candidacy for accession to the Community and there are indications that other EFTA member states such as Norway and Sweden are reassessing their positions on the question of accession. Needless to say we welcome these developments.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I <Col N="1384" /> would now like to consider the process of closer integration, economic and monetary union and political union.</P>
    <P>The Italian Presidency has announced that the Intergovernmental Conferences on these issues will open in Rome on 14 December.  It is worth recalling that at the June European Council in Dublin the member states agreed, in effect, that the negotiations should be finished in time to allow national ratification procedures to be completed and to enable the results of the conferences to come into force by the end of 1992.  I am sure that Senators will appreciate that the timescale involved is quite tight and I am glad that today we have the opportunity to have an initial look at the key issues involved.  I am sure that we will be discussing them again on a number of occasions in the next two years.</P>
    <P>The Strasbourg European Council agreed to convene an Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union.  The Conference will draw on the very considerable preparatory work which has been done during the Irish Presidency and so far under the Italian Presidency.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union was a major issue on the agenda of the Rome European Council on 27-28 October.  At that meeting, eleven member states were able to agree that the preparatory work done so far constitutes a basis for the Intergovernmental Conference.  These member states, of which Ireland is one, agreed on the principle elements which should guide the work of the conference &mdash; the United Kingdom was unable to go along with the majority.  The eleven agreed on a number of fundamental issues: we settled on the main aims of economic union which include greater economic cohesion; for the final phase of monetary union we accepted the need for a new monetary institution.  This will comprise the central banks of the member states and a new central organ and will exercise full responsibility for monetary policy.  In the final phase of EMU, exchange rates will be irrevocably fixed and the Community will have a single currency &mdash; the ECU; the second <Col N="1385" /> phase of EMU will start in January 1994 subject to certain conditions being fulfilled. Real convergence between the economies of the member states is one of these conditions; at the start of the second phase the new monetary institution will be set up with certain interim tasks; and a procedure has been established for preparing the move to the third and final phase of EMU.  Before this happens there is to be a report to the European Council on the operation of the second phase, in particular, the progress achieved on real convergence.</P>
    <P>The Irish approach to economic and monetary union has been one of very strong support for the process.  We attach major significance to two factors.  First, we give equal weight to the economic and monetary aspects of integration.  If monetary union were to go ahead more rapidly than economic union it would not be in our interest and it would not serve the Community's interest either.  Thus we will be pressing to ensure that this crucial parallelism is recognised in the course of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we take the view that integral to economic and monetary union is a commitment to effective policies at Community level to achieve economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to economic and monetary union is complete.  In line, for example, with the analysis contained in the NESC Report on Ireland in the European Community, we will be seeking an outcome to the Intergovernmental Conference which will ensure that the periphery is afforded the same opportunity to benefit as the centre.  There can be little doubt that the centre will benefit from greater integration.  The experience of the last three years with the completion of the internal market has underlined this fact.</P>
    <P>Structural funding is important and we welcome the ideas put forward by the Commission on a possible widening of the eligibility criteria for access to the funds.  However, I would stress that we regard cohesion as a dimension which, as the Single Act provides, should inform all of the Community's common policies. <Col N="1386" /> The funds on their own perform a vital function and will continue to do so but it is important to avoid the temptation to assume that the Community's commitment to cohesion ends with the funds.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the circumstances in which the community's commitment to political union led to the decision to convene an Intergovernmental Conference next month.  This decision was taken in Dublin in June and since then the preparatory work has proceeded.  The Commission has produced its formal opinion and Parliament's opinion will be considered at this month's plenary session in Strasbourg next week.  Together with the discussions by Foreign Ministers and Heads of State and Government at the European Council, the preparatory work is now well under way &mdash; though it is still, understandably, behind the progress achieved in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>During our Presidency four broad headings were established for the work on political union: the overall objective and scope of political union; the democratic legitimacy of the union; the efficiency and effectiveness of the Community and its institutions; and the unity and coherence of the Community's international action.</P>
    <P>Before I comment on each of these issues I would like to touch on the principles of our approach to the negotiations on political union.</P>
    <P>First, we believe that a fundamental principle of our policy is that the development of the European community should be based on a growing community of interests in the economic and social field. Secondly, nothing in the current exercise should diminish the Community's role as a unifying force in Europe based on its commitment to democratic values, success in improving the living standards of its peoples, its commitments to international peace and prosperity and its openness to the rest of Europe and to the wider world.  As far as Ireland is concerned this is a vital role.  It is one which has proved its value especially in recent <Col N="1387" /> years and it will have to be maintained during the forthcoming negotiations.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the two IGCS should contribute to the effective operation of the Community.  This will involve a significant and coherent advance in the internal efficiency of the Community and in its ability, together with its member states, to work more closely and constructively with the other countries of Europe and internationally.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, as I explained in my remarks on economic and monetary union, we attach considerable importance to a strengthening of the Community's economic and social cohesion.  An extension of the role of the Community and of its competences must take account of the cohesion dimension and of the need to provide the means &mdash; not only financial means &mdash; required to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Looking more closely at the four subject areas being considered in the preparations for the intergovernmental conference next month I would like to refer briefly to the issues involved.</P>
    <P>As regards the scope of political union, Ireland will consider a widening of the competence of the community very carefully. It has been suggested that they should be a move away from the existing arrangements for unanimous voting.  I would observe that the move to greater use of majority voting under the Single Act has proved beneficial and while each case will be considered on its merits this experience will have to be borne in mind. We will also look carefully at the other issues which arise under this heading &mdash; subsidiarity and citizenship where we feel there are positive implications for the development of the Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to spend some time on the issue of democratic legitimacy which will be of interest to Senators in the light of the meeting in Rome later this month of the Congress of the European Parliament and National Parliaments.  This Initiative by the European Parliament is very welcome and in line with the forward position which the Parliament has adopted in encouraging the movement <Col N="1388" /> towards closer integration in the Community. After all much of the progress in recent years stems directly from the initiative of the late Altiero Spinelli and his colleagues in the Parliament when in 1984 they produced a Draft Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>This work is being continued in the present Parliament and its Institutional Affairs Committee has now produced draft proposals for amendments to the treaties in a number of areas.  These proposals, once they have been considered by the full Parliament in plenary session, will form an important contribution to the work in progress to prepare for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Parliament stresses in particular the need to rectify the democratic deficit in Community decision-making &mdash; a theme which is likely to be taken up at the congress in Rome.  Naturally the Parliament argues that it should be more directly involved in the Community's decision-making procedures even to the extent of a right of co-decision.  In Parliament's view the evolution of powers from the member states to the Community has been to the benefit of the Council of Ministers and at the cost of parliamentary control.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union new provisions will be adopted to increase the Parliament's involvement in decision-making. However, two points are worth bearing in mind in this regard.</P>
    <P>First, the members of the Council are members of their national Governments and thus responsible to their national legislatures.  In most cases they are also members of those legislatures.  The Council has, therefore, a full democratic mandate.  Secondly, from the point of view of a member state such as Ireland, our relative share of the membership of the Parliament is small and the degree to which we can influence decisions, though valuable, is less than that available to us at the level of the Council.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Community, in my view it is vital that the <Col N="1389" /> Community, which now plays such a crucial role in the lives of its citizens, should be able to respond effectively to the tasks which it has assumed.  This will involve a review by the Intergovernmental Conference of the operations of the institutions.  We will be able to consider improvements but these should not be at the expense of the existing balance between them which we feel is correct in the light of developments in European integration in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of the debate on political union, and one which will be considered by the Intergovernmental Conference, is the proposal that the unity and coherence of the Community's action <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rest of the world should be enhanced, including by the adoption of a common foreign and security policy.  The European Council at its meeting of 28 April agreed that the Community would act as a political entity on the international scene.  The examination by the Intergovernmental Conference of a possible foreign and security policy is in the logic of that decision.</P>
    <P>The past two years have seen fundamental changes in Europe.  The end of the Cold War and progress by the Central and Eastern European countries towards democratic government, a market economy and full respect for human rights have made possible a dramatic reduction in tension.  Military forces are being reduced and the two alliances which confronted each other during the Cold War now face basic questions about their future role.  The CSCE process has played a vital part in helping forward these developments and has provided a framework within which it has been possible to move towards a new concept of security in Europe.  We believe it can continue to make an important contribution and are in favour of providing it with institutions and giving it a role in areas such as conflict prevention and verifying military and security commitments.  It can also provide a forum for disarmament negotiations among the 34 member states.</P>
    <P>We are therefore at a time of new problems and new questions, and we and <Col N="1390" /> our partners in the Community must look at the area of foreign and security policy in a new and quite different perspective.</P>
    <P>At the European Council in Rome, 11 member states of the Community, including Ireland, were able to agree that these new developments required us to subscribe to the objective of a common foreign and security policy with a view to strengthening the identity of the Community and the coherence of its action on the international stage.  This will be an action open to the world and will give a special role to development policy.  The Community will also seek to strengthen its links with other European countries and will look for closer structures for co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Presidency's conclusions after the European Council made it clear that while there is agreement on the overall objectives, the content and the detailed rules of the role of the Community in relation to a common foreign and security policy are yet to be defined.  The process of definition will be a gradual one and will be without prejudice to the obligations arising out of security arrangements to which member states are already parties. The position of the Government, and of successive Irish governments, is that if the community were at some stage to embark on arrangements for its own security and with its own security concept, then Ireland, as a fully committed member state, would be willing to consider participation.  Developments in other areas are building up an increasingly powerful bond between the member states and peoples of the Community and leading towards a territorial unit with increasingly close economic, social and political ties.  The question to be addressed is whether there is now emerging a common security interest of the Twelve also and whether a structure can be found which would give that interest expression.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act already refers to political and economic aspects of security.  The notion of security might also cover aspects of disarmament or the defence of the community and its citizens from international terrorism.  There are <Col N="1391" /> different views as to what should be included.  A common security policy is however unlikely to include military or defence aspects for some time, since a number of the member states most concerned see this as an area for NATO or the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Questions such as what a common foreign and security policy could cover, how such a policy could be introduced in terms of the treaty and given existing obligations of member states, how decisions should be taken and what institutional and structural changes will be needed to enable the new policy to be implemented effectively, will be addressed by the Intergovernmental Conference.  It will be open to us, as well as to others, to put forward our views in the negotiations at the Conference.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the range of issues to be discussed by the Intergovernmental Conferences our approach in any one area, such as this one, will be determined by the progress made across the whole integration front; specifically, the degree of concrete solidarity shown in what is decided will be a very important element in determining our position.</P>
    <P>I have tried to sketch out the main issues arising in the crucial negotiations which are about to commence.  The process which is now under way towards much closer European integration will have a major influence on how the Community develops as we move into the next century.  I look forward in the course of this debate to hearing the views of Senators on the issues which I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for delivering the Government's viewpoint on this very important topic.  We are facing an entirely new situation since we joined the Community with the move forward to economic monetary and political co-operation.  According to the Delors report, economic union has four basic components: the single market with the freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital; a competition policy and other measures to <Col N="1392" /> strengthen market mechanisms and increase their transparency; common policies to restructure industry, foster regional development and reduce regional and social disparities; the coordination of macro-economic policy including binding budgetary rules.  In effect we are losing, and we have to admit it, a considerable amount of our sovereignty. I do not regret that; I am just pointing it out.  Hiding it would be dishonest. Citing in its turn the 1970 Werner Report the same Delors report states that monetary union implies that the three conditions which must be met are: (1) the guarantee of full and irreversible convertibility of currencies; (2) full freedom of capital movements and the complete integration of banking and other financial markets; and (3) the elimination of margins of fluctuation and the permanent fixing of exchange rates.</P>
      <P>Meeting these three conditions and particularly the third implies a degree of convergence in the economic and monetary policies of the 12 member states which appears Utopian without the transfer of significant national powers to Community economic and monetary authorities.  Once this transfer has been or can be achieved a single currency should be introduced immediately.  The benefits of monetary union are maximised when it is pushed to its logical conclusion through the imposition of a single currency.  I remember when Dr. Kael Otto Pohl came to see us in the European Parliament about six years ago, a small group who were discussing economic and monetary union.  He stated quite clearly that there would be no single currency in the Community until other countries brought their economic and monetary policies into line with that of the Federal Republic of Germany.  He went on to say that the gains that were made in Germany were not going to be lost, that we must retain the gains that we had made and build on that; that if other countries brought their economic and monetary policies into line with the Federal Republic, then he would be the first to support a single currency.  That is what the man said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> If there is only one currency and therefore a common pool of currency reserves, the constraints imposed by the need to keep member states' balance of payments in equilibrium disappear.  This increases Governments' room for manoeuvre in respect of economic policy.  They can maintain growth policies which are not currently feasible under EMS.  They may no longer raise interest rates thus putting a brake on investment in order to stop capital outflows or to reduce imports. The fact that Governments may no longer print money in order to finance public account deficits restores to the capital markets the responsibility of carrying out the transfers of savings forced on national authorities who are unable to balance their budgets.  Under this market mechanism the member states will regain a freedom of action whose abuse may be penalised by an increase in the cost of borrowing money. However, the politically thorny problem for a Community authority of imposing fiscal and budgetary standards on states jealously protective of their sovereignty in these areas also disappears.</P>
    <P>In a single currency European monetary union, the member states would have greater budgetary freedom than are enjoyed by the Lander in Germany or the individual states in the United States since the Community budget represents only a tiny fraction of national budgets.</P>
    <P>As regards the benefits of monetary union, the first and most obvious benefit to the layman is the elimination of all transaction costs connected with the transfers from one currency to another in the Community.  If you take your money around the Community at present and transfer it into the other 11 currencies and back again into Irish punts, you would end up with about 45 per cent of what you started out with, having purchased nothing and gained nothing, only keeping bankers happy.  Inter-Community transactions in goods and services cost £600 billion ECU per year for the 12 member states.  The cost of one exchange transaction may vary between 5 per cent for the tourist and 0.2 per cent for very large commercial transactions.  Given an <Col N="1394" /> average rate of 0.5 per cent this produces an annual cost of about 3 billion ECU without counting the cost of capital transactions whose volume is much greater than the commercial transactions.</P>
    <P>The second and less easily quantifiable but equally considerable benefit is that generated by a reduction in speculative transactions between European currencies which seek to exploit interest rate disparities and exchange rate fluctuations even when the latter are within the margins laid down by the EMS.  The third benefit, also difficult to measure, results from the uniformity of prices of goods and services throughout the Community, enabling traders to profit from rising output, larger markets and increased mobility of labour and capital.  The single currency produces greater transparency of costs and prices by making them comparable right across the Community, thus increasing competition.  We have all seen recently how important, useful and consumer beneficial competition is.</P>
    <P>The fourth economic benefit is the cost reduction resulting from the simplification of accounting operations.  This is interesting and probably something that the layman has not thought of: the cost of all accounting operations in all firms which keep accounts or conduct transactions in several currencies.  In the case of firms operating throughout the Community these costs represent not much less than one per cent of the overall administrative cost expenditure.  The most significant benefit of all results from the removal of the major constraints on economic policy imposed by the need for Governments to maintain balance of payments, price and exchange rate stability.</P>
    <P>Finally, the last in the list of benefits of monetary union would derive from the ECUs evaluation to a status of international reserve currency potentially more solid than the dollar.  The Community is a much more abundant source of savings than the United States.  Its share of world trade and its currency reserves considerably exceed those of the United States.  With the ECU becoming a reserve and trading currency more stable <Col N="1395" /> than the dollar, European importers and exporters could invoice a growing proportion of their transactions in ECUs, thus reducing proportionately the exchange rate risks which they currently accept or are forced to cover in transactions denominated in dollars.  The drawbacks to a country of its currency becoming a reserve currency &mdash; less control over internal stability &mdash; are more easily withstood the larger the country.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an ECU area parallel to and as large as &mdash; it would rapidly take in EFTA countries and in the future the countries of Eastern Europe &mdash; the dollar and yen areas would greatly facilitate attempts to use international monetary policy instruments to stimulate the economy or at least make the co-ordination measures currently taken at G5 and G7 more effective.</P>
    <P>In order to have monetary union take shape or survive monetary stability has to be ensured.  I do not have time to develop that because I want to deal with political union.  It will be absolutely essential to establish a European central bank.  In order for that central bank to be effective it must be completely free from political interference.  It must be autonomous.  If you look at the economies of the world which are most successful, they have had the benefit of central banks which were autonomous or nearly so.  Take the examples of the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, USA and to a lesser extent The Netherlands, Japan and Taiwan.  The policy of expanding money supply which many of us do often engage in acts like a little drug but the initial euphoria quickly gives way to agonising withdrawal symptoms.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on from that to what the Minister had to say, and I have some points to make on political union. I firmly believe that a stronger, united Europe with strong political institutions, a single currency and a common foreign policy will be able to play a leading role in the world in the 21st century and contribute to international stability, Third World development and a narrowing of <Col N="1396" /> the gap between the rich and poor countries. It will establish relations with the United States and Japan as an equal partner and will set up a defence system guaranteeing its independence in its alliance with other organisations.  It is time that we acknowledged our duties and responsibilities in relation to the defence of the Community and I was pleased to hear the Minister say, and I quote:</P>
    <P>At the European Council in Rome 11 member states of the Community including Ireland were able to agree that these new developments required us to subscribe to the objective of a common foreign and security policy with a view to strengthening the identity of the Community and the coherence of its actions on the international stage:</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The position of the Government and of successive Irish Governments is that if the Community were at some stage to embark on arrangements for its own security and with its own security concept, then Ireland, as a fully committed member state, would be willing to consider participation.</P>
    <P>That is nothing new from the Government side, although it has been lost in recent years.  Commitments were made by former Taoisigh such as Jack Lynch, Seán Lemass and indeed the present Taoiseach when he was a member of the Government in the sixties, that we would play our part in the defence of the Community. I am glad to see that we are returning to that kind of sensible approach.  If we are a member of a community we should be prepared to defend it.  I have always held that position.  It may not be a very popular political point of view but it is a more honest one than the bogus kind of neutrality we were shouting about all those years.</P>
    <P>I believe also that for the European Community to become a European union, that is, a federal Europe, four objectives must be pursued: (1) balanced, coherent progress on all fronts <Col N="1397" /> towards political union; (2) transfer of sovereignty from member states to the union and distribution of powers on the basis of the subsidiarity principle; (3) improvement in the Community's ability to take decisions and to act upon them both within its boundaries and beyond; (4) a guaranteed democratic basis for the Community.</P>
    <P>Our future lies in Europe but, for me, the political future of Europe must be all-embracing and be based on a balanced society in which all sections work together towards European union.  For me, the ultimate aim of European integration is that the first stated principle in the preamble to the European Community Treaty in 1957 to establish &ldquo;an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, the sense of common purpose regarding the vital economic interests&rdquo; laid the foundations of this union. However, economic success is not an end in itself but a means to creating a society based on individual freedom and mutual support.</P>
    <P>European integration means more than economic integration and I hope that message will get through, particularly to Prime Minister Thatcher.  In any case the Community has over the years intervened in areas which were not strictly economic in nature, a development which I welcome.  Furthermore the Single Act has explicitly confirmed or strengthened the Community's authority to intervene in social matters, technological development, the environment and regional balance.  It has also established and facilitated European political co-operation.  That is something to be welcomed by all of us.</P>
    <P>At present, economic and monetary union draws gradually closer whilst renewed efforts are being made towards whatever form of political union we will have.  With this in mind I stress the urgent need, first, to promote a model for social development in Europe.  We will never have a successful political union unless some of the disparities which exist are ironed out.  That necessitates a determined effort, despite the resistance of Prime Minister Thatcher, to have proper <Col N="1398" /> social development in the Community. Secondly, steps must be taken towards having a common foreign policy and a combined European defence system.  Let us be honest, we cannot have two armies, a Community and an Irish Army.  It is illogical.  If we have political union we have to be part of the defence process. Thirdly we must give the Community's two founding principles, political and cultural co-operation, a leading role in European integration.  I consider that political union on federal lines must protect Europe's characteristic and historically derived richness and diversity and at the same time ensure, when circumstances require it, a common approach to solving problems.  It would be a sad day for the Community if we were to have a uniform Community destroying the richness of diversity which makes the Community so unique.</P>
    <P>These days no crucial question can remain a purely national matter.  To carry out their duties at home the member states will in future need European solutions more than ever before.  That is a fact that we have to face up to and I think we are beginning to face up to it.</P>
    <P>I had intended saying a lot more but I would be unable to develop the points in the time available to me.  I stress that for the Community to be a permanent and successful political union it must do more than just develop economic matters.  It must ensure that the wealth generated by the economic and monetary union will be distributed equally throughout the Community and within the different regions of the Community.  Anything else will result in an unstable Community.  It behoves us, in the interests of Ireland as a whole, to ensure that regional disadvantaged areas, not just Ireland but Portugal, Greece, parts of Italy, parts of Britain, are helped by the richest areas in the Community.  It behoves us as a national Government to ensure that we solve the problems of unemployment, poverty and the various other ills that are hitting our society.  Otherwise total political union would be on very shaky foundations.  Our best hope of achieving all that is to be good members of a good <Col N="1399" /> Community and, as members, to ensure that it is a good Community.</P>

      <P>I wish to move the following motion under Standing Order 29:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its concern that in recent times many Irish citizens charged with political offences have not received fair trials in the British courts of law, that the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act is the most appropriate means of dealing with such offences, that where extradition proceedings are undertaken a <i>prima facie</i> case should first be presented and sustained in an Irish court and that extradition should not take place until all available avenues of appeal are processed including application to the European Commission and the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter as one of specific and great urgency because of recent developments in relation to a Finglas man, Dessie Ellis, who has been on hunger strike for some 36 days and has just been extradited to Britain.  It is in that context that I feel we should have the opportunity of debating this issue in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to review the legislation relating to the generation and disposal of waste with particular emphasis on the implementation of regulations which would enable local authorities to enact by-laws which would define whether waste would be disposed of or recycled.</P>
      <P>These days just about everybody has heard the word &ldquo;recycling&rdquo;.  Nature has been recycling all along.  Everywhere the process continues.  Should we humans think the way we live is exempt from these laws of nature?  The creation of waste and its disposal are part of the same cycle.  Things we throw out do not just disappear.  Last year we, households and industries, threw away over one million tonnes of refuse.  Waste management entails erasing the legacy handed down to us by several generations who were ignorant of or unconcerned about even ordinary public hygiene.  We need a policy consisting of minimisation of waste at the production stage as well as the use and disposal stages.  It has become apparent the world cannot afford the throw away society.  As landfill sites fill up, the rubbish will have to be transported over greater distances, so costs will rise.  Pollution problems at dumps, including gas produced when the rubbish rots, force local authorities to set up expensive monitoring programmes.</P>
      <P>Some kinds of waste are extremely dangerous.  It can in fact pose a real public health hazard.  They do not always come from industrial plants.  Products such as car batteries, solvents, even oven and drain cleaners, farm chemicals etc. should be treated with great care.  A special hazardous waste site is needed to dispose of this waste.  The main problem caused by this waste is contamination of ground water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burning of rubbish, incineration on a large or small scale, should be avoided. Pollutants are released into the atmosphere, such as highly toxic gas and <Col N="1401" /> fumes.  Income from reclaimed materials can help pay for the safe disposal of the unavoidable non-recycled waste.</P>
    <P>Page 44 of the EC document <i>The European Community and the Environment</i> states:</P>
    <P>It has become apparent that this generation must recognise and face up to the responsibility that all of us share in order to pass on to our children a world fit to live in and fit to enjoy.  We must take measures now to safeguard natural resources since they provided the very soil in which the routes of future growth take root.  There is not a choice between environmental protection and economic growth.  They are inter-independent.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment through several circulars in the past few years has urged local authorities to promote and assist recycling in the context of their waste collection and disposal services and by other supportive measures. As stated in the February 1989 circular, the most important support service which a local authority might give to a local recycling organisation would be a depot or collection point facility.  The Minister requests each local authority to take positive steps to develop a recycling mentality in their area and is very appreciative of measures taken by the Kerry recycling group.  I know this from correspondence I have seen from the Department.</P>
    <P>Recycling has benefits for both the environment and the economy.  It saves energy and raw materials.  It reduces import bills, the amount of land needed for waste disposal sites and waste disposal costs.  Many industrial processes are capable of utilising reclaimed materials.  The Irish glass industry uses 25 per cent cullet as raw material, but could use far greater amounts if there were adequate recovery channels.  The paper industry uses reclaimed paper on a major scale, though most of this is imported.  A great deal of the waste packaging which ends up as litter on our roads, open countryside and even waterways, and which has serious consequences for our tourist industry, contains valuable raw materials.  Four <Col N="1402" /> point six million drink cans were consumed in Kerry last year.  To date, the Kerry recycling group are achieving high levels of recovery, but there is much room for improvement.  The spin-off in jobs from recycling operations could be significant.  By its nature recycling is labour-intensive and any increase in recycling levels will increase the potential for long term employment.</P>
    <P>There is a specific need for information to be made available to the public to explain the necessity for and encourage participation in collection of recyclables and the purchase of recycled products, thereby ensuring a market for the materials collected.</P>
    <P>The throwaway mentality is today a part of the modern lifestyle of Irish people.  With increased economic activity the amount and variety of wastes we dispose of, both in our daily lives and from industrial activity, is ever-increasing.  Do bear in mind that these dumped materials contain large quantities of useful, reusable resources.  To throw away materials as simply &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; is in actual fact too great a waste.  Recycling provides an available alternative and accessible raw material; reduces imports of primary raw materials and finished products; provides an efficient service to waste generators with cost-effective clearance; protects our environment from salvageable waste which otherwise would go to landfill or incineration; saves energy, creates employment and contributes to the preservation of our environment for the present and future generations; conserves our resources and reduces pollution and litter; creates porfitable industries; provide funds for charities; engenders a sense of community pride and imbues each individual with an increased sense of self worth, because each person's contribution counts.</P>
    <P>Waste minimisation consists of: (1) source reduction and (2) recycling.  From an environmental perspective source reduction is usually preferable.  In terms of emphasis I would recommend a waste management strategy which places source reduction first, recycling second, <Col N="1403" /> energy from waste third and landfill as a last resort.</P>
    <P>If one looks to the recently issued EC <i>Green Paper on Urban Environment</i>, one sees therein a strong concern that recycling benefits are not overlooked.  The Commission's waste management sets two priorities, prevention and recycling. The Green Paper makes the vital point that effective environmental management requires (1) issue integration and (2) procedural integration.</P>
    <P>Between policy making, problem analysis and impact assessment, planning, financing and implementation, all sectors of our Government and all sectors of our society are affected by the situation.  Coordination is vital on the ground in community collection efforts straight through to Government Departments, especially the Department of Industry and Commerce, Environment, Finance, Education etc.</P>
    <P>According to the paper, &ldquo;The weakness of our present (EC) environmental legislation policies is such that economic growth is likely to lead to increases in pollution and pressure on the environment. At the heart of the conflict, however, is the fact that the market economy currently does not internalise the environmental costs.  It does, however, have the potential to do so&rdquo;.  As the paper states, the consumer and producer choices can be guided through economic and fiscal measures which rely on market forces.  This policy, it says &ldquo;has considerable potential as a means of contributing towards compatibility environment and economic growth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a definite need for Ireland to involve itself in research &mdash; I congratulate the Department of the Environment on the work they have done to date &mdash; demonstration schemes and vocational training and technical training for aspects of recycling.  The EC has a funding project for the exchange of information between countries.  Germany and the UK, for example, could be very useful contacts for increasing and exchanging expertise.  The Community is also considering the creation of a new <Col N="1404" /> financial facility to support environmental actions in urban areas and they state there is scope also for assistance for a range of initiatives at the local and regional level.</P>
    <P>As already stated, there is need for co-operation at all levels, central government with local authorities, with industry, with State agencies, with community organisations, with schools, with voluntary groups, with the media, etc.  Consider ship dumping at sea.  Much damage has been caused to wildlife.  It may be possible to restrict port admission only to ships who save and sort their rubbish.</P>
    <P>Waste management involves the handling of industrial waste, toxic waste, sewage, packaging, medical waste, construction and demolition debris and household waste.  Within the heading of household waste exists materials and cardboard, newspapers and mixed waste, papers, magazines, notepads etc.  Glass colours need to be separated for optimum recycling.  Aluminium cans, steel cans, plastics, many different types, textiles, possibly batteries, come under household waste.  Up to three-quarters of the average output could be recycled.</P>
    <P>To set a fairly realistic target of recycling, approximately 30 per cent of the recycable content of domestic waste is conceivable, given adequate organisation and effort.  There are also many other recycable materials with their specific individual factors, such as vegetable oil, vehicle oil, textiles, batteries, scrap cars and safe industrial waste used to supply a resource warehouse for craft uses for schools etc.  With a sample listing of the wide range and scope of the topic of recycling, it is quite apparent that a forum is essential in order to bring together the many varied participating areas and individual topics to discuss and investigate appropriate courses of action. There is also a need for a recycling assistance programme, a recycling advisory agency and a solid waste information clearing house.  Business and industry needs its own guidelines and assistance. Consumers need an advice assistance source provision of a waste exchange service which could aid waste reduction <Col N="1405" /> countrywide.  Every county council should be involved.  There are different requirements for urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Within the context of a coherent comprehensive recycling plan there is need to consider: local authority rebates for tonnage removed from waste stream; provision of CFC recycling at dump sites; education in school curriculum, newsletter, leaflets, videos, awards and anything that would highlight the situation. There should also be the question of tax incentives, separate hazardous household waste dump sites, recycable labelling, possible deposit systems, reverse vending, fund research into recycable products &mdash; for example, insulation board from paper &mdash; recycling methods for materials etc.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer in particular to the Kerry recycling group who have done tremendous work over the last 18 months to two years.  They have got excellent assistance from the Department of the Environment through Kerry County Council and Tralee UDC.  They find, however, that it is impossible for them to carry on because at the outset they were doing it on a voluntary basis and then they found that they lost their employment assistance and they are now being subsidised through their community welfare officer, which I think is wrong.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to the collection of household recycalbles, there are various systems: sited banks or drop-off depots; mobile banks half way between a permanent bank and door to door; kerbside collection, all materials mixed in one box or certain materials in certain bins.  Accurate data are needed on types and amounts and seasonal variations of materials.  An EC directive on all packaging materials will soon be circulated and will include recycling targets.  The general trend, which would work effectively, would be central government and private sector finance and transport. Local authorities would provide sites and major retailers would do main promotion efforts.  Community business and the voluntary sector would handle local ground collection work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Domestic and industrial waste recycling has hidden benefits that, if properly figured into the costs, makes recycling an attractive activity on social grounds as well as economic grounds.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the work being done by Kerry Recycling Co-op.  I would hope to see this extended throughout the country and that the Kerry initiative would be used as a pilot scheme.  They see their project as one of great potential benefit for rural Ireland as a whole and they feel it would be ideal to properly fund their project to serve as a pilot project, as I have already referred to.  With adequate political interest this could become a reality.  The public interest and support exists.  The EC mandate exists. To quote the EC document <i>The European Community and the Environment</i> 3/1987, page 44: It has become apparent that this generation must recognise and face up to the responsibility that all of us share in order to pass on to our children a world fit to live in and fit to enjoy.  We must take measures now to safeguard natural resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe the time is opportune to take practical steps to reduce waste and to increase the promotion of recycling nationally.  In order to significantly reduce the volume of waste we produce the Government Departments of the Environment, Trade and Industry, Education, Tourism and Finance should: (1) develop a coherent national policy with a co-ordinated campaign by industry and local authorities; (2) appoint an official with overall responsibility for recycling in all Government Departments with a specific budget; (3) set targets for local authorities to undertake recycling schemes; (4) encourage consumers to recycle; (5) promote the use of a waste exchange; (6) support research into uses for reclaimed materials; (7) create a climate for recycling by taxing primary resource use and rebate use of recycled materials, using its purchasing power to create a market for recycled paper into all Government Departments; encourage design of products that can be recycled and tighten planning controls for waste disposal sites.  The need is for <Col N="1407" /> waste minimalisation, regulation and recycling.</P>
    <P>There should be special funds made available for the various recycling groups. While they are subsidised to an extent by FÁS schemes, it is very important that they would be assisted by way of capital outlay.  The generation of waste is an integral part of daily life.  However, waste disposal is a major problem currently being experienced by the local authorities. These problems include, <i>inter alia</i>, (a) public objections to having waste disposal facilities in their neighbourhood; (b) the low priority given to waste disposal over the years and (c) lack of finance available to the local authorities for a service.  I believe this is something that has to be considered.</P>
    <P>The time is overdue when by-laws should be introduced at local level.  This would allow local authorities to make by-laws to permit them to classify wastes as recyclable and non-recyclable.  It would allow local authorities to charge for the provision of waste disposal facilities and allow them to charge different rates for recyclable and non-recyclable waste.  It would allow them to return a certain proportion or all of the revenue generated from the disposal of recyclable waste into the recycling industry, and allow local authorities to refuse to accept recyclable wastes if in their opinion the waste should not be disposed of.</P>
    <P>There are other speakers and I do not wish to delay.  I know the Minister is very interested in this and I want to congratulate him for coming in here for this very important motion.  I have no doubt that he will make sure in due course that the various recycling groups will be sufficiently funded so they can continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the motion before the House: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to review the legislation relating <Col N="1408" /> to the generation and disposal of waste with particular emphasis on the implementation of regulations which would enable local authorities to enact a by-law which would define whether waste would be disposed of or recycled.&rdquo;  As the motion stands, I do not think anybody would disagree with the principle of it. However, I listened very carefully to Senator Foley, who obviously has put quite a lot of thought into this and has obviously had first hand experience of it. He did refer to experience in Kerry.  I also note, of course, one major defect with the resolution as it stands.  That is, of course, that it again places another burden on local authorities without providing additional finance.  Unfortunately, in the past successive Governments have imposed new legislation on local authorities without additional finance to back it up: for example, the Derelict Sites Bill, which went through this House very recently and under which there are certain responsibilities on local authorities to carry out certain works.  We had the Water Pollution Bill, which went through some years ago.  I am not disputing the merits of the Bill, but what I am saying is that the local authorities should not have to provide the funding to monitor those schemes without getting compensation from central Government or from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As every Member of this House knows, unfortunately the amount of money from central Government is reducing as a percentage <i>vis-a-vis</i> inflation each year.  That is a fact of life. Again, of course, we had the Abattoirs Bill which is another major problem for local authorities and again another major cost.  I noted that Senator Foley, in some of the points he made towards the end of his contribution, emphasised the need for an officer in each county to monitor this. Again, we are talking about additional cost there.  I have no doubt that, if more legislation is imposed on local authorities without funding, local authorities will not be able to carry the burden and funding must come if additional legislation is <Col N="1409" /> imposed on local authorities.  That is one difficulty I see with this motion.</P>
    <P>The principle of the motion, of course, is a good one: that we should if at all possible recycle.  If we only take into consideration the cost of maintaining our dumps and of providing new dumps, it is very expensive for every local authority. If we could cut down by 50 per cent the amount of materials going into those official dumps &mdash; I am talking about official as distinct from the unofficial ones &mdash; it would be a major saving for local authorities.  Senator Foley put his finger on the problem when he said that they had this scheme going in Kerry but they were not able to profit and that was the major difficulty with it.  Unfortunately, if you try to recycle it will have to be a subsidised industry &mdash; that is a fact of life &mdash; and I would go fully along with any Member in this House who would suggest that bottles, cans, any of those things, should be recycled; but unless it is an economic proposition nobody is going to do it.  You are left with a situation where that industry will have to be subsidised.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about the potential of job creation in it and that it certainly would prevent imports if we had an adequate recycling industry here either in the line of bottles, cans, batteries, or old cars &mdash; how often do we see them dumped in our bogs and not gathered up? Again they could be recycled and utilised. I believe there is scope there for Senator Foley's proposals, but my difficulty with it is that it will need funding and with the mean attitude of the Department of the Environment at the present time I just cannot see that additional funding coming through unless we are able to link into something like social employment schemes or the same avenue that money comes through for those schemes.</P>
    <P>I think there is a certain merit in what Senator Foley suggested about trying a pilot scheme in a particular region and I do not see any difficulty with it.  It is something that is well worth trying. There is certain merit in it because we have, as citizens of this country, an obligation to ensure a healthy and clean society and to eliminate pollution as far as <Col N="1410" /> possible from whatever source it comes. Senator Foley referred to a wide range of elements of pollution.  I noted he did not refer to the MMDS system, which is certainly causing major problems in parts of the west of Ireland.  The Minister and, I am sure, Senator Finneran will be aware that there is major concern with regard to health hazards and health risks as a result of that system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole area of pollution, we have of course major problems right throughout our country with group water schemes which have been polluted.  A very high percentage of them, I understand in some counties, have been polluted over the last number of months.  Again, that would come from another form or probably the failure of a proper form of waste disposal probably of farm waste, more likely than anything else, and again it is a huge problem.  We have those problems and we as a community are going to have to deal with them.  Some 20 or 25 years ago the amount of domestic waste was far smaller in a household because you had not the plastic bottles, you had returnable bottles, you had not the cans that so much stuff comes in today and a lot of the containers then available could be disposed of by way of burning.  That is not the situation today with very many of the containers that come with goods today. They have to be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Senator Foley said that people should have to pay for waste disposal.  As far as I know, in most counties they are paying &mdash; perhaps not here in Dublin, but outside it they are certainly paying for waste disposal and in some areas they are paying quite a considerable amount.  I can see great difficulty in trying to distinguish between refuse that cannot be recycled and refuse that has to be disposed of. Overall, there is a certain merit in the proposal put forward by Senator Foley that, despite that, the pilot scheme should be tried out &mdash; I cannot see huge costs involved &mdash; to see if it could eliminate and reduce the amount of waste being disposed of, and on the other hand recycle a product which would prevent <Col N="1411" /> imports and maybe create employment in doing that.</P>
    <P>I have absolutely no doubt, like Senator Foley, that there will have to be Government subsidy in it but I am not so sure, that there is a spirit for that in the Government.  We look forward to the Minister's reply to see if he is prepared to entertain a pilot scheme.  The idea of a pilot scheme is a good one and should be examined.  Under the social employment scheme maybe something worth while could be put together in a pilot project, see how it works for 12 months and reevaluate the situation then.  Anything that reduces the amount of waste disposal, the cost of maintaining dumps and the provision of dumps by the local authorities is to be welcomed and is a worthy proposition.</P>
    <P>My only difficulty with it is that I see it requiring another piece of legislation to be operated by the local authorities. Unless local authorities get additional funding from the Department of the Environment to try to cover the cost of implementing the new regulations that have been imposed on them over the last ten years &mdash; I mentioned just three Bills that have come down to the local authorities to deal with additional funding &mdash; they will not be able to operate without it.  Apart from that there is quite a lot of merit in the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion but I do not believe it goes far enough.  If you read the wording carefully you will see that there is an assumption built into it that waste is inevitable, that it is inescapably there but, like the weather, waste is not inevitable on the scale it is currently at.  A national policy which focuses only on disposal or recycling would be deeply flawed from the word go.  A huge amount of so called inevitable waste is preventable at source whether we talk about domestic, farming or industrial waste, but we are not doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is that?  For starters we are packaging addicts.  The more elaborate the box the larger the container, the more <Col N="1412" /> likely we are to be attracted to the product. Now we are coming up to the time here which generates more domestic waste based mainly on packaging, than at any other time of the year.  The old notion of Christmas as a children's festival is very pleasing but Christmas in the 1990s is a packaging festival.  The amount of cardboard, plastic stiroform, paper, which will be carted away by our local authorities to add to our already chock-a-block landfill sites is enormous.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government have made enormous strides in ensuring that the polluter pays but we need to go further.  We need to take that principle, the polluter must pay, and bring it down to what is small and local.  The fast food store in the neighbourhood that sends out stiroform burger boxes and coffee cups to be strewn all over the pavement is an indirect polluter. The larger franchises like MacDonalds and the Seven Elevens should be taking more public responsibility for the waste which is implicit in their operation. I do not just mean substituting papier-maché containers for the stiroform, although that is very well worth doing.  I mean doing clean ups several times a day or night in the area surrounding their branch so that packaging discarded by their customers is not allowed to destroy the local environment. We should be talking about waste management, not just waste disposal.</P>
    <P>Supermarkets have already given a lead in making recycled paper bags available but they should be leaning on manufacturers who use excessive or inappropriate packaging.  Householders should be helped to segregate their rubbish into recyclable paper, plastic, glass and cans and given information on garden use of left-over organic materials.  The end result could be that the sheer amount of domestic waste going to our landfills could be greatly reduced.  If this country addressed the management of waste in a coherant way, then we would also be encouraging householders not to waste energy.  The more fossil fuel we burn, whether or not it is smokeless, the more damage we do to the world's climate.</P>
    <P>We have inefficient heating equipment <Col N="1413" /> and insufficiently insulated homes.  If we got our act together on this one we could not just do the world a good turn, we could help our family budgets too.  This brings me to the question of industrial waste.  The need to reduce industrial waste tends to be met with the argument that yes, it is a good idea but it would cost too much from the industrial point of view, which is a load of nonsense.  It is misleading and self-serving nonsense.  If they do not produce as much waste industries can obviously avoid all the costs and risks of storing it, treating it, transporting it and disposing of it.  If they do not produce as much waste industries can obviously save taxpayers the costs of the local authorities doing all of those things.</P>
    <P>I would not say that is pie in the sky and it is not green idealism without a practical base.  On the contrary there are examples all over the world to show that coherent waste management by industry not only does not bankrupt industry but quite often saves industry money.  I will give a few examples.  The Three M Company in the US launched a programme throughout their operations in 1975 called Pollution Prevention Pays.  The Three M company claim to have halved their generation of wastes and saved about £200 million in the process.</P>
    <P>In Sweden you will find a pharmaceutical company called Astra by means of improved implant recycling and substitution of water for solvents managed to cut toxic wastes by half.  The Dupont plant in Venezuela put in new solvent recovery systems which eliminated the disposal of solvent wastes and saved them about £150,000 each year.  A metal company in New Jersey put in a treatment plant that cut water use by 96 per cent, save themselves $53,000 a year and paid back the investment in three years.  The lesson from those is absolutely clear.  Reducing waste at source can contribute to the bottom line of the company which does it while greatly improving the overall environment.</P>
    <P>Why are we not showing a lead in this? I cannot understand it.  Here we are sitting pretty in this green and pleasant isle having missed out, thanks be to God, on <Col N="1414" /> the worst of the industrial revolution.  We have modern plants, modern technologies, we are conscious that the success of our food exports depends absolutely on the pristine cleanliness of Ireland the exporting country.  Whilst Japan is recycling more than half the waste it generates, whilst France is promising to cut its waste production by two thirds over the next ten years we are not even being dragged kicking and screaming into good waste management; we are being dragged silently and grudgingly. Very few industries are standing up and announcing that they are putting in waste management programmes which will reduce the waste they create.  The environment action plan developed by the Department of the Environment and announced almost a year ago specifically said:</P>
    <P>Each local authority will be directed to prepare a recycling scheme for its area by the end of June 1990 identifying recycling possibilities and setting out how it will facilitate and promote such activity.</P>
    <P>Where are the plans, have they been produced?  If they are good why are the local authorities not crowing about them, using them as a way to educate industry in their area and using them as a way to educate children?  As part of that environment action plan, which was greatly informed by the Progressive Democrats thinking, the Industrial Development Authority were instructed to undertake feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing new industries based on recycling of paper, plastics, etc., and to promote and support commercial waste recycling projects.</P>
    <P>I very much hope that we will hear from the Industrial Development Authority quickly and regularly on their progress in this area.  The Progressive Democrats have always stood for tax reform, but not just tax reform in the sense of removing the disincentive of individuals being overtaxed, but tax reform as a method of achieving national objectives.  The environment action programme promised a study of how the tax <Col N="1415" /> system might be adapted to encourage waste recycling on a commercial basis. This is an important promise.  Too often our tax system is used punitively, uncreatively. This is an opportunity to use it productively, positively and creatively.</P>
    <P>I trust that the study is now complete and that we can look forward to seeing the end result figure prominently in the next budget and if there are tax incentives for becoming environmentally friendly then, perhaps, industry will begin to look at their concerns in a slightly wider way. Every corporate brochure or annual report of every manufacturing company in this country should include a clear detailing of that company's waste management plan.  It should indicate how waste is being reduced by conscious action.  It should indicate how employees are encouraged to participate by the placement of recycling bins in canteen and other areas.  It can be done.  West Germany's polluter tax is regarded internationally as a very good way of stimulating industry to control pollution, which is often the same thing as waste at source.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for more prominent consciousness-raising labels on packaging, a strong case for companies which use recycled cardboard to say so very assertively, a strong case for companies, which make containers with a shelf life of hundreds of years, to give a warning on that package as to proper disposal.  We put warnings on cigarette packets, we do not put warnings on plastics which, if shoved into a domestic fire, emit fumes which are suspected of having enormous negative health implications.</P>
    <P>The pharmaceutical industry voluntarily includes in its advertising on radio a line to the effect that the product should only be used as directed.  There is a case for manufacturers of other products to add a line about the disposal of the waste the product carries with it in the form of packaging.</P>
    <P>Rereading the wording of this motion suggests one other matter to me.  Our dumps are problem areas.  Nobody wants a dump near them.  There is a fear of <Col N="1416" /> disease, there is a fear that chemicals are leaching into the ground water near dumps and there is a fear of items ending up in dumps which should not end up in dumps.  We can think of how the ESB, one of our most publicly responsible State-sponsored bodies can fail to dispose of asbestos properly when that asbestos is waste from a decommissioned plant, there is justification for the fear that less responsible entities may be doing much worse, only we do not know about it.</P>
    <P>Our dumps are assets waiting to be exploited.  The only people right now who do serious exploitation, serious recycling of materials in our dumps are the travelling people who scavenge reusable items, very intelligently, on dumps around the country.  The settled community do not seek to turn dumps into an asset.  We should be trying to organaise proper segregation of rubbish in every county in this country to facilitate recycling. Recycling, if necessary, implants right beside the land fills.</P>
    <P>We should be trying to educate individuals and groups generating waste to think in terms of recycling.  Just this week a scheme was announced in Britain designed to gather up and recycle huge amounts of the plastic sheeting used in farming.  We should be trying to use the methane generated by landfill waste for fuel.  Less than a week ago a British TV programme showed where methane gas from a landfill site was being used to power part of a factory.</P>
    <P>We should be getting started on a positive management of waste from start to finish, not just looking at how we should cope with unnecessary waste after it has been generated.  Above all, we should be looking at this whole area in an imaginative, positive, comprehensive way, not in a patchy <i>ad hoc</i>-ery way, not as something which matters only when the waste is toxic waste, not as something to be solved by policing but as something to be solved by educating and incentivising first and foremost and policing only when those methods fail.  We need to do it quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate <Col N="1417" /> because I believe that it is a topic that has not received nearly enough serious consideration.  I am delighted that we have the Minister here with us this evening and that we will be able to hear from him at the end of the debate what he has in mind for improving the situation. There is a great need for improvement. I compliment the Minister on his efforts. Having said that, I do not think that they go nearly far enough or that they are nearly enthusiastic enough.  I do not think there is sufficient commitment to the whole idea.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that it is exclusively a question of money.  I believe it is very easy to throw that around as an excuse. It is continually said the problem is that local authorities have no money and therefore they can do nothing.  I do not take that view and I do not wish to indulge in any party political speech which would be, I feel, unhelpful and unproductive.  I believe that resources are required and I believe some money is required.  I am not saying it can be done without any money but I believe there are other things which are far more important, that is, an educational programme to alert people to what the issues are involved in all this.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a great deal that can be done by the Department of the Environment and by the local authorities in highlighting this.  I always believe that in a local authority &mdash; there are 52 members on my local authority &mdash; every member could be used as a PR person to go out and sell whatever has to be sold in the way of a new idea.  There are four or five local representatives in each area and if they were getting from the Department of the Environment, perhaps to the managment and it was coming through to the local authority members, we in turn could go out and talk about these things in our communities, in our residents' associations and so on.  Sadly, of course, the situation is far from that in local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may be allowed to deviate from the point for a moment, I wish to draw attention to what I believe is at the heart of all this.  I know the Minister will get up now, and I am quite sure he will wring <Col N="1418" /> his hands in despair and say that he tried to do this with the local authorities.  I see that the Minister said that the Department of the Environment have told the local authorities that the time is long overdue for an emphatic new thrust to increase the recovery potential for waste materials, glass, paper, cans and plastics. I am sure the Minister will say that the local authorities are not responding adequately.</P>
    <P>I am not singling out the Minister because he is not that long in the Department. I am 16 years in a local authority and I have seen a good few Ministers come and go and we go on forever in the corporation.  The situation is that the Minister's Department treat local authorities, in my opinion, disgracefully. They treat them abominably, they treat them like schoolchildren, and because they are treated like schoolchildren they behave like schoolchildren.  If the Department of the Environment gave local authorities responsibility, if they let them off the lead a little bit about a whole range of things, then when they want them to respond to something like this they would find the local authority members ready do it.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister one example because I feel certain he does not believe what I am saying.  I hope the Minister will forgive me if I said this to him before but it describes the situation to me so vividly and so accurately that I feel nothing else need be said after that.  My local authority on one occasion, long before my colleague Senator Olga Bennett was there, introduced a no smoking arrangement in our council chamber.  We may have been ahead of our time ten or 12 years ago and it was decided unanimously there would be no smoking.  The following month a member lit a cigarette and it was brought to the attention of the Lord Mayor and to the Town Clerk who was requested to ask the member to put out the cigarette. We were told that it had not become law, it had not had the imprimatur of the Department of Local Government.  We cannot even change our standing orders in Dublin City Council and bring in a no <Col N="1419" /> smoking regulation until a Minister says &ldquo;you can do that, that is all right&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the attitude of the Minister's Department over successive years.  I beg him to understand that he of course, is excluded from these remarks.  They refer to previous Ministers but, above all, they refer to the officials in the Department who treat our local authorities with contempt. They do not reply to serious issues which we bring to their attention.  When they do not reply and they do not take it seriously, then local authorities start sending in things to the Department because they know that they pay no attention to them anyway and it is good for the politics, it is good locally because you get your name in the paper.  You know perfectly well that the Department will not do anything about it so it does not really matter.</P>
    <P>I believe that the problems of the environment, which I know are dear to the Minister's heart, and I compliment the Minister for what he has done with regard to the smog and these other things &mdash; will not be solved until he solves the fundamental problem of the attitudes in local authorities and that he encourages them to be responsible and allow them to make mistakes.  The Minister's Department makes mistakes from time to time.  If local authorities are allowed the freedom to do what they are going to do in the field of recycling or whatever else it may be, of course they will make mistakes but is it any worse than the mistakes that are made down in the Custom House?</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessors, I am sure, came up through a local authority &mdash; I thank the Minister for nodding his head &mdash; and know from the bottom up what the situation is like and no doubt when the Minister was in a local authority he felt as frustrated as I do in my local authority, yet when he gets to the top and he is in a position to do something about it nothing is done.  We have had no changes.  In all the time that I have been in the corporation, the situation has only deteriorated.  It has been exacerbated because of the whole funding question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> The whole area of local government is crying out for reform and that is absolutely germane to all of these things.  The solutions to the environment are not macro solutions.  They will not happen by the Department bringing in some plan like the wonderful glitzy, glittery plan the Minister brought in.  I have not got it here with me unfortunately.  It was beautifully produced and there was tremendous PR put into it.  It was on a glossy, wonderful paper which somebody told me is the most environmentally unfriendly paper. It was tremendous for the image of the Department and for the Minister's image.  I hope the Minister will deliver on it but it does not really do very much because it remains a marvellous document we all look at and admire and we respond to the sentiments in it and say &ldquo;would it not be lovely&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The solutions to the environment and ecological problems will not be macro solutions.  They will be made up of a whole plethora of mini solutions.  It will be individuals, local groups, the Irish Housewives' Association, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, a whole range of people at different levels who want to do something.  While this motion to a certain extent inspired me I am a little confused as to what exactly is meant by it, but I believe people are interested in recycling and are concerned about the environment.  That was manifested when the Green Party TD was elected.  I hope there will be many more of them elected. I do not think the Minister should show his opposition to that.  If he was genuine about concern for the environment he would want lots of local Greens elected to every local authority in the country.  It might mean there would be fewer Fianna Fáil councillors there, but it would mean that the solutions the Minister is looking for would be much more likely to come about.  If he was more interested in solutions to these problems than in party politics we would probably have a better result.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem comes back to us.  We must have local authorities controlled by parties because they in turn elect the Seanad and they in turn control <Col N="1421" /> the nominations for the Presidency.  They control everything so we cannot have more Greens and there is wincing when I say we should have them and have more people who are interested in the environment on the local authorities, but that is the way to get solutions to these problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to forgive me if I seem to be slightly going over the top. I so genuinely believe that that I feel other things I may say are fairly peripheral and inconsequential.  The fundamental way solutions will be found is by encouraging responsibility amongst the local authorities and encouraging responsibility at the lowest level.  It is a question of small being beautiful.  In relation to the whole area that we are discussing here this evening I am absolutely convinced that that is the way forward. We need to develop people's individual responsibility.  The role the Department can play and are starting to play is in alerting people to what the issues are in the whole area of recycling and bringing attention to the extraordinary amount of litter we create.</P>
    <P>I am talking here about domestic waste, I know less about commercial waste and other toxic waste.  It is not that I am unconcerned about them but I feel I know more about domestic waste as somebody who runs a house and somebody who has been in a local authority. Each year two million tonnes of rubbish are accumulated in this country.  That is approximately half a tonne per person. It is like trying to cope with the water situation here in the city.  We are appealing to each individual to economise.  If each individual economises a little the situation will be greatly improved.</P>
    <P>The waste problem is exactly the same. It is terrifying to think of each individual producing half a tonne of waste.  I know the improvement that can be brought about.  I once did a mini experiment at home.  I have a fairly large house and a fairly large household.  I used to have three dustbins going out every Monday morning pretty well packed.  I started composting my domestic waste &mdash; every banana skin, every apple skin, potato <Col N="1422" /> core, everything.  Nothing was thrown out, all the waste from inside the hoover etc. went into the compost heap.  Now I compost regularly and my garden is the better for it.</P>
    <P>I then started bringing my paper to a place for recycling.  I brought my bottles to a bottle depot.  I got Dublin Corporation to institute a little bottle bank in Rathmines long before the rehabilitation people were on the scene.  We got a little pilot scheme going there.  I was able, by my own efforts, to reduce my bins from three down to one.  If I was able to do what I am telling you about with my paper and my glass others could do it.  I used to squeeze down tins because I was not able to bring cans to the places you can bring them to now.  I was able to go from three bins down to one bin.  I was able to reduce waste by a third.  Senator Foley spoke about reducing it by 30 per cent.  The Greenpeace people would tell you that 80 per cent of domestic waste could be recycled, 80 per cent less going into the tiphead.  Sixty per cent is probably a reasonable figure and is generally accepted.  We have one of the poorest records in Europe.  Ireland is at the bottom of the recycling league.  I am glad to see the Minister nodding his head.  It is most helpful because I do not have to travel that point any longer as I know that the Minister accepts that.  The Department have given modest grants. In 1989 they gave £250,000 and that is up to £500,000 now.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the benefits and the economies that are made &mdash; they were refered to already by a previous speaker &mdash; in the reduced cost of running these massive tipheads.  Senator Helen Keogh said nobody nowadays wants to live beside a tiphead.  One of the most consistent points of agro in our council is the Dunsink tiphead.  Never a month goes by without an argy-bargy at the council meeting.  Which of us wants to live beside a tiphead, which of us should be asked to live beside a tiphead or on the road to or from a tiphead?  In Dublin we have run out of opportunities for landfill.  We are doing relatively little about it.</P>
    <P>I now cannot find anywhere to bring <Col N="1423" /> my paper.  It is piling up and I dread to think of the consequences of a fire.  I believe there is somewhere in Marrowbone Lane but it is very far away.  I would never be accused of being a lazy, indolent person.  I cannot face into trying to take the paper out of my house.  For recycling to be successful it must be collected on the doorstep.  It is not really fair in this day and age to expect &mdash; I do not consider myself elderly, I consider myself young &mdash; elderly people to bring piles of paper to a particular place.</P>
    <P>The only way recycling can be done is the way it is done in Germany, Sweden and Denmark where the paper, bottles and glass are collected regularly.  I know there is a lot of goodwill out there, I know that the young find it.  You go around to schools and environmental weeks and they are always into projects about recycling and so on.  That is a resource which the Minister could tap.  I know that housewives would be prepared to help as would organisations such as the Irish Housewives' Association, from whom I first learned about recycling 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>At the annual general meeting of the Irish Countrywomen's Association this year a woman made in an eloquent speech in which she suggested that once a month every housewife in Ireland, after completing her shopping, should, as a protest, leave behind in the shop or supermarket all the superfluous packaging to which Senator Helen Keogh referred.  We could suggest that once a month they might dump it at the Minister's Department and let him see what is involved.  I do not mean that as a protest but to let the Minister see what we are talking about, and the excessive packaging there is in the hope that he might prevail upon the packaging companies not to curtail production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already seconded the motion.  I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  We are delighted to have him here on such an important topic.  The reason the motion was put down was that Fianna Fáil Senators were conscious of <Col N="1424" /> the need for environmental protection. That is why the debate is taking place.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Flynn, has an excellent record in the area of environmental protection.  We can all be castigated for what was not done or should be done but not long ago we had the Water Pollution Bill and recently we had the Air Pollution Bill.  The ten year programme for the environment, which was castigated to some extent by Senator Hederman, identifies activities that need to be carried out over the next ten years to protect and enhance our environment.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on that because, obviously, there was a conscious decision by him to embark on such a programme.  Put the paper work together and present it to the Irish people.  It is a blueprint for him and his successors and indeed, for all who wish to be part and parcel of that development.</P>
      <P>I was very conscious of the Minister's involvement as the Green President during his term as President of the Council of Ministers when this country held the Presidency of the EC.  That was brought home clearly to me as a member of the Consultative Council for the European Commission.  I had firsthand experience of the involvement of the Minister in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers.  He was well thought of during that period.  It is acknowledged by people in the Commission that it was a very successful period for him.  In the ENVIREG Programme he put forward views that were of benefit financially to this country.  Part of our ten year programme is tied up in the ENVIREG Programme which some people thought would be a whole Mediterranean set-up. However, thanks to our Minister and his staff, that was not the case.  This country is availing of, and will avail of benefits from that European Commission programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are conscious of the environment and the need to protect it and that is why the motion is being debated.  We want to impress on the Minister the need to consider further measures.  One of the measures we consider opportune is recycling. Other Senators mentioned recycling <Col N="1425" /> pilot programmes and development in different parts of the country but there does not seem to be any great cohesion or liaison in this area even though the Department of the Environment provided grants in the region of £500,000 this year.  There is an opportunity there.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten said that this could prove to be a burden on the local authorities. I take his point that it is possible that legislation introduced over the years may have proved to be somewhat of a burden in so far as what may have started off relatively cheap, with the employment of one officer or agent, progressed to become a charge on the rate support grant.  County councillors and corporation members are conscious of that and I do not doubt that the Department are conscious of it also.  This new proposal does not have the same danger of imposing a charge on local authorities or a charge at a later stage because a recycling programme can be a recycling industry.  It represents an economic proposition for job creation.  It could be profit making if it is handled properly.</P>
    <P>I am more concerned about indiscriminate, illegal dumping, dumping that defaces our countryside, interferes with the quality of our waterways and rivers. This is where I see one of the big dangers. It is a blot on all our copies that our neighbour will go to the nearest by-road, bog road, lane or stream and empty sacks of domestic waste without being conscious of the damage he or she is doing to the countryside.  It is not somebody else's property.  A map may show that the registered owner is A, B or C but it is everybody's countryside too.  The countryside belongs to all of us.</P>
    <P>Public awareness is important.  This problem was not addressed properly at local authority level.  In some counties there are litter wardens but there is something offensive about the term &ldquo;litter warden&rdquo;.  It implants in the mind the image of somebody who will give a ticket or impose a fine.  We have never been great to respond to that type of approach. I would prefer to have people employed by local authorities as environmental advisory officers and the public perception <Col N="1426" /> of them as such would be educational. They could go to our schools and expound on the care we should take in regard to the disposal of waste and generate on awareness of our own countryside. We should educate people to perceive them in that way rather than as trying to catch somebody throwing an empty cigarette box on the ground and as sticking a £20 or £500 fine on them. That type of perception of a person does not enhance their standing.  The educational side of it is more important.  Perhaps local authorities should consider removing the tag of litter warden and replacing it with the title &ldquo;environmental advisory officer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is great concern about this problem and that can be seen in the many Tidy Towns committees all over the country. They play an important role in the maintenance and development of the countryside. They put in an extraordinary amount of voluntary effort.  They are conscious of the general appearance of their villages and towns and there is a competitiveness among different communities which, in itself, enhances these areas.  They liaise with local authorities and that is important.  It is important that local authorities have Tidy Towns awards.  It gives recognition to people for their work.  It establishes in the public mind that people who are conscious of the area are known to have done something and that local authorities at a particular time, following marks being given out, award prizes and acknowledge the involvement of local communities.</P>
    <P>Another area that has already been mentioned by some Senators is that of industrial and toxic waste.  It is difficult to identify and quantify what amount of moneys or resources industries are putting into the disposal of their waste.  They would like us to believe, of course, that they are conscious of industrial waste and are attempting to put a certain amount of resources into it but I do not think they are winning the public relations battle on that.</P>
    <P>As a local authority member I believe &mdash; I am sure other local authority members and Members of this House <Col N="1427" /> would agree &mdash; industrialists will only put in as much as they have to.  They will try to get away with as much as they can and they are not environmentally conscious to the extent that they would put the protection of the countryside, the waterways and our seas ahead of making a &ldquo;buck&rdquo; for their own company.  That is a perception that people on the ground have <i>vis-a-vis</i> industrialists.  That may not altogether be the case but I am open to contradiction on that.  However, it is my perception of industrialists, and I know it to be the perception of other people. There is need for education on that side of it too but we also need a facility.  We do not have at the moment a recognised facility for dealing with toxic waste.  That is something that has to be dealt with. People are concerned about whether such development would be near where they live and I appreciate that.  However such a facility must be considered and, hopefully, it will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister, during my term as chairman of the general council of county councils, indicated that he had proposals on that and I have no doubt that the proposal put forward here this evening by my party will be considered on the basis that it is put forward with the good intention of protecting the environment for this generation and for generations to come and, indeed, protecting all our present assets.  One of them mentioned by Senator Naughten was our group water scheme network which was put there at a large cost to the State, to the local authorities and, indeed, to the people themselves.  It is important that that massive network be maintained right around the country, from north to south and east to west and maintained free of pollution.</P>
    <P>I will abide by the time limit put on me.  Senator Hederman said that if there were fewer Fianna Fáil councillors, obviously there would be more Greens. I will take that as a compliment, as obviously she associates Fianna Fáil policy with green policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OlgaBennett" hpid="Mrs. Bennett Mrs. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's <Col N="1428" /> environmental action programme, in one of its objectives, seeks to promote greater activity in the recycling of waste and initiatives were proposed to encourage this activity.  They include the preparation by each local authority of recycling schemes for their area &mdash; and this has already been mentioned by a number of Senators &mdash; an increase in grant assistance to £500,000 for the promotion of recycling projects; the provision for the IDA; feasibility studies or possibilities for the establishment of new industries based on recycling of paper, plastics, etc., and support for commercial waste and recycling projects.</P>
      <P>As a member of Dublin Corporation, we welcome these initiatives.  Dublin Corporation monitor on an ongoing basis the opportunities that arise for recycling and we participate in a number of projects. I would like to mention a number of these projects because many Senators spoke earlier about tackling the problem at source and we have gone through all these points.  We have started on Dublin Corporation &mdash; possibly as my colleague said, we are not doing enough, but we have made a big start &mdash; and we hope to extend it further with the closing of the tiphead in Dunsink next year.  We will certainly have to look at how we will dispose of our household waste but at the moment, we have some good schemes in operation and I will mention a few of them.  Abandoned cars are a problem in Dublin and the corporation provide a free service to the general public for the removal of unwanted or abandoned cars in the city.  The cars are collected and brought to a crushing plant where the steel is sent for recycling to Irish Steel. The number of cars recycled in the last three years has been 2,800 in 1987, 2,240 in 1988, 2,345 in 1989, and it is expected that 2,500 cars will be recycled during 1990.  The cost to the corporation of this service has been about £40,000 and hopefully, somebody will take it on as a concern. We are just testing out the viability of some of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is glass recycling in Dublin.  A glass recycling centre operated by Rehab was opened in October 1987.  In that year, <Col N="1429" /> 29 bottle bank sites were operational in the city.  There are now a total of 47 bottle banks in operation and it is expected that an additional ten will be in use before the end of 1990.  Rehab collected a total of 164 tonnes of glass in 1987, 935 tonnes in 1988, 1,750 tonnes in 1989 and they are targetted to collect almost 2,500 tonnes of glass in 1990.  The glass is collected and recycled by Irish Glass.  Dublin Corporation actively support and promote Rehab in this venture and in 1989 we provided them with grant assistance of £5,000 but at a recent meeting of the community on environment we had a look at their operation and it was decided to increase their grant to £10,000 in 1991. It was also recommended that a commitment be given to them that they get this grant on an annual basis for five years so that they can continue their programme.</P>
    <P>Paper recycling was also mentioned here.  Newspapers, magazines and cardboard are the main forms of waste paper used for recycling, but there is a serious over-supply of both newspapers and magazines which is normally collected by voluntary groups.  The lack of a stable market and the uneconomic prices offered make this a very unattractive venture for those involved.  Commercial operators collect and recycle approximately 700 tonnes of paper and board from the industry.  The corporation have commenced a pilot project.  They intend to closely monitor this project, evaluate its viability and quantify the amount of material that can be used for commercial recycling.</P>
    <P>My colleague also mentioned aluminimum can recycling as part of our promotions. A co-operative in Tallaght, called Recoverable Resources were started by a group of unemployed people. The corporation gave a grant of £3,500 in 1988 to assist the co-operative in the purchase of plastic bags and tripods for use in school yards throughout the city for the collection of cans for recycling.  In 1989 a grant of £3,000 was given to fund the construction of can bins for use in city areas with a capacity for 1,000 cans.  The operation has proved highly successful. The target of collecting three million cans in 1989 was exceeded by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> They actually collected 4.5 million cans, 120 tonnes.  Recoverable Resources Coop. are at present expanding their operations. Last year a competition involving 27 schools with 10,800 pupils resulted in the recovery of 1.2 million cans.  This year's competition to date has involved 150 schools with about 65,000 pupils participating. In addition, the co-operative have purchased a second truck and now have one truck serving their collection points on the north side of the liffey and another serving their collection points on the south side.  Their recovery target for 1990 is 7.5 million cans.</P>
    <P>Used oil can be recycled.  Dublin garages, for the most part, now collect waste oil and Dublin Corporation have helped to fund waste oil collection at their tip-heads on the outskirts of the city.  This oil is recycled in the midlands.</P>
    <P>An area worth looking at in which we are not deeply involved but which we are investigating extensively is plastic recycling.  Some European countries, and the United States, have passed laws controlling the type of plastic packaging used.  The Italians intend banning some forms of plastic packaging next year and the Danes are thinking of banning it totally. The amount of domestic plastic recycled in the EC, and in Ireland, at the moment is very small.  It is not economically viable, apparently, to recycle the plastic found in our day to day rubbish although some companies in the UK, I understand, are recycling the plastic from industry and turning it into water tanks. The UK Government have called on all their local authorities to recycle half of all their recyclable waste by the end of the century.  I would like to think that this will be achieved in Ireland, not only in Dublin, so that we can ensure our national environment is fully protected and enhanced for future generations.  Our natural environment is the concern and heritage of all our citizens.  We must act and co-operate to defend and improve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take my full time because there is a number of Senators who wish to contribute.  I am glad this House is debating these very important issues of Economic/Monetary and Political Union.  In the past we have dealt with more European matters than the other House.  Id am glad this House continues to fulfil its role by debating our involvement in Europe and the changing political and monetary thinking in Europe.</P>
      <P>Since we last discussed this matter there have been profound political changes on the world scene.  The changes in Europe are profound and will have a major effect on the issues we are discussing here.  The reunification of Germany has changed utterly our concept of what will happen in Europe.  When the programme for economic, monetary and political union was drawn up and 1 January 1993 set as the date for the conclusion of negotiations and its implementation, nobody expected that East and West Germany would come together.  This reunification has changed drastically the parameters of our discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though we all agree that the reunification of the German people is very welcome, it creates problems for us on the periphery of Europe that we could not have foreseen.  We have become more peripheral because of the changes that have taken place.  Changes have also taken place in other states in Eastern Europe.  While we all rejoice that there seems to be a semblance of democracy in these countries, we will have to wait for many years to find out whether the changes that have taken place will bring real democracy to the people or if changes were forced on the leaders because their economic situation was totally out of kiltee and there was no way they could have survived economically. It might emerge in the future that what seems to be the democratic wish of the people might have been the wish of the rulers in certain countries to run away <Col N="1432" /> from the effects of their bad economic, monetary and political policies.</P>
    <P>In Eastern Europe the potential breakup of the USSR could cause major economic and political problems which could impinge upon western Europe to a large degree.  Nobody knows exactly what will happen in the USSR but it seems that the breakup there is associated with nationalistic tendencies.  There is absolutely no doubt that people want to get back their own nations but there is the economic background to the changes that are taking place.  Certain states within the USSR are extremely wealthy but other states will need the support of the wealthy states within the body of nations which make up the USSR.</P>
    <P>As I said the changes that have taken place in Europe are enormous.  We are looking at the matter of political reunion against a background of East-West <i>détente</i> where what were two Super Powers got together and instead of having an east-west political and economic row, there is to a degree an East-West coming together.  There are difficulties which could be associated with that; instead of having a cold war between East and West one might see a South-North conflict exacerbated.  If the union of East and West is cemented, they will have to play a major part in ensuring that the North-South conflict does not grow to the same degree as the East-West cold war.  It is necessary in political and other terms to try to bring the world together as one union.  Those who have should share with those who have not rather than as happened in the USSR and other European countries where the haves had it all and the have nots had nothing.  There are huge agricultureal areas in Eastern Europe which could provide any amount of food needed if properly organised. This could create problems for producers of food in Africa.</P>
    <P>There are problems associated with the current political situation but what we are concerned with this evening is not so much the international economic scene but rather the impact that 1993 will have on our economic, monetary and political situation within the European Community. As a trading nation we are very open to changes which take place on the <Col N="1433" /> world market.  The downturn in the economies of Great Britain and the USA is having an effect at present on our potential as a trading nation.  At present three-quarters of our exports go to Europe and two-thirds of our imports come from Community countries.  As so much of our exports go to Community countries we must ensure that we are able to maintain that ratio.  The trading nation with which we do most business is Great Britain and if that economy runs down we are in trouble.  The removal of non-tariff barriers to trade within the European Community is of immense importance to us. There is a huge challenge facing Irish business firms in the run up to 1993.</P>
    <P>Firms which put into place market knowledge, capabilities and strategies will be able to get involved in expansion within the Community of an unprecedented nature.</P>
    <P>Ireland is producing people in the marketing and commercial areas who will be able to compete with anybody in Europe but they have to be helped.  If firms do not take up the challenge their continued existence is in jeopardy.  Our partners in Europe recognised our position as a less developed region and we have achieved through tough negotiations a significant increase of Structural Funds.  The national programme for industrial development, prepared within the Community's support framework agreed between Ireland and the Commission of the European Community, will make an important contribution to this objective. We must continue to upgrade our transportation and communications networks with the help of the Community and we must improve our training programmes for managers and workers.  We have seen up to 1989 a rapid growth in output in Irish industry but we have not seen an increase in jobs to match that.  Between 1983 and 1989 there was a substantial reduction in the number of industrial jobs but since 1989 we have seen a change. The decline in manufacturing employment was reversed in 1989 and since then we have seen a significant increase in manufacturing employment.  This is extremely important.  That is remarkable when compared with the average netfall in employment of 4,000 per year which <Col N="1434" /> occurred in the industrial sector in the early eighties.</P>
    <P>There will be spin-off effects to other sectors of the economy arising from the expansion or output in the industrial sector.  The manufacturing sector, with sales of over £15 billion per year, stimulates expenditure in Ireland of nearly £10 billion per year in supportive industries, supporting an estimated additional 150,000 jobs in service related activities. There has been in the past number of years a very impressive export growth by firms which are modern and primarily foreign owned with very significant output and export sales.  These firms have increased their industrial output at an average rate of 16 per cent per year since 1980.  It has to be said that they could not have achieved this growth without the substantial efforts of Irish Governments who helped them to set out their plants in a modern manner nor could they have done so without the co-operation of the Irish workforce which has proved capable of adapting to conditions in modern factories.</P>
    <P>The performance of the traditional sectors of Irish industry has been generally very poor and investment levels have fallen.  There were many reasons for this. Many of those industries have outdated equipment and, irrespective of the amount of work put in by any worker in them, they would not be capable of good production levels.  We have seen factories with equipment which should have been replaced 20 years ago still operating. Workers in such factories are often blamed for low productivity levels.  Low productivity levels are a problem but the major problem is a lack of investment in new equipment.  There has been a lack of interest in diversification in some industries which need to diversify.  That does not mean that diversification is always the answer as we found out recently when a very successful firm in the agri-sector decided to diversify into other areas.  We saw the results of that.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the relative share of the two sections of the economy &mdash; one-quarter modern and three-quarters traditional &mdash; employment given in the modern area has not been sufficient to make up for the loss of employment in the three-quarters <Col N="1435" /> traditional businesses and because of that we have seen up to 1989 a downward trend in employment.  Thankfully, that position has been reversed.  There are many structural constraints on Irish industry which must be addressed if we are to survive post-1992.  One of our major problems is that we are located on the periphery of Europe and this problem will become more acute when the tunnel between Great Britain and France is opened.  There are huge extra costs involved in delivering goods from Ireland to continental Europe as compared to trading within the mainland of Europe. We have to export by sea or air and, because of the small scale of Irish industry and the distances involved, the cost of transport is extremely high.</P>
    <P>Another major problem is that 90 per cent of Irish industrial firms employ fewer than 50 people and less than one-half of 1 per cent of firms employ more than 500 people so we do not get in Ireland the scale advantages that one gets in countries where there is a bigger population base.  We have a very small domestic market.  Incomes are only two-thirds of the Community average.  This is something that must be looked at and we must ensure that even though we are small in size and in market importance we are not at a major disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Import penetration has been significant. Competing imports account now for 44 per cent of the domestic market compared with 20 per cent in 1979.  As the economy has improved over the last two to three years, the market share for imported goods has increased and, of course, as more disposable money becomes available people look for goods which, unfortunately, are imported &mdash; what we would call &ldquo;high class&rdquo; goods. We are capable of producing goods of a higher quality than anybody else in the world but, unfortunately, a number of companies will not develop manufacturing units here because our domestic market is so small.  Even the incentives they are offered cannot make up for the very small size of the market.  We have a very bad marketing.  We must address the development of a strong market capability and focus Irish industry on this <Col N="1436" /> aspect.  This is being done in many ways. A start has been made, in that Irish colleges at third level colleges are taking up the challenge of producing people with marketing skills.  There are groups who train graduates and give them some marketing experience.  Experience in marketing products is just as important as or more important than the excellent academic qualifications which they get.</P>
    <P>We must improve our technological capacity as it lags very much behind that of other member states.  The cost of research and development and technological innovation is enormous.  Only firms which are highly profitable can afford to invest in research and development. If we do not become involved in research and development firms that locate here will use the research and development facilities available elsewhere. We must expand the science and technology section of the Department and use the excellent technological and educational abilities we have available to us in that area.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the Community has contributed to various structural improvements here.  Our export markets have been diversified.  The UK market, now under threat from economic factors, is there still and is our most important market.  It has declined in importance as we have doubled the share of our market in Europe.  As a result of market diversification within the EC we have strengthened the capacity of Irish industry to compete more effectively on world markets outside the EC.  The competitive element of our use of world markets outside the EC is extremely important and that we must go after these markets.</P>
    <P>There is the huge market in South America that unfortunately we are not really capable of going after because we would have a language problem.  We are not yet teaching languages to a sufficient degree in our schools.  Hopefully language classes will become more and more important.  We must look at the languages used in international commerce. English is one of the main languages that is used.  French is another. German is used only in Germany.  While the German market will improve and increase dramatically, nevertheless it <Col N="1437" /> might be more beneficial for people to learn Spanish or Portuguese if we want to develop our exporting capabilities. Countries which use spanish as a main language generally do not use English as a second language as readily as do the Germans or French.  There is a language barrier.  You buy in your own language but you sell in the other person's language and that is something that people forget. They think that because they speak English people should speak English to them when they are selling.  If I am selling something, I have to sell in the language of the person who is buying.  If I am buying it does not make any difference what language I speak.  The person has to learn my language because I am the person paying the money.</P>
    <P>Support from EC funds has helped improve the position, as has support from the RDF.  That support was in the region of £195 million for industrial projects. We must ensure that the increased level of structural fund moneys available are used to give Irish industry a new market for technologically based development &mdash; an impetus which will help industry to be more competitive in the environment which the internal market is bringing into place.  We cannot over-emphasise the fact that education towards selling is of paramount importance, that language is the most important element in selling anything.</P>
    <P>Traders traded throughout the world for many years before marketing became important but in the world of today Ireland has to have marketing capabilities or else we will be left behind even if we have products and crops which are capable of being sold because of our green environment.  We must create a strong and competitive industrial structure by establishing a wide range of industrial firms, both Irish and foreign, but with attributes which would enable them to compete successfully in international markets and particularly in the more competitive environment being created by the EC programmes.  We must ensure the creation and maintenance of increased value-added both in the industrial and other sectors.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the development of our considerable natural resources as a <Col N="1438" /> foundation for increased industrial development by promoting, in particular, development based on our natural resources including food, timber and fish. We must also promote regional development by helping different parts of the country to realise their full potential to create employment and to develop economically. The setting up of the regional co-ordinating committees will fill a major role in these objectives.</P>
    <P>The National Programme for Industrial Development has addressed itself to the objectives for Ireland in 1992.  Thirty million pounds will be spent by the IDA and SFADCo on small business development measures up to 1993 to create 27,000 additional jobs.  Decentralisation of decision-making in this area is to be especially welcome.  Enterprise development measures will be intensified in international services, and mentor services will be used widely to improve our chances of survival.</P>
    <P>The Irish Productivity Centre needs to be supported.  Business innovation centres at Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick will provide a new joint public and private developed resource of advisory services with incentives available for the promotion of small business ventures. Medium firms must be incentivised by way of advisory support and financial asistance.  Overseas investment must be encouraged.  To this end, over £240 million will be spent by the IDA and SFADCo on the development of this sector to create 45,000 additional jobs. The Gaeltacht areas are not to be forgotten and new business must be attracted to this end.  There will be investment of £22.8 million, of which the ERDF will contribute £13.33 million, for marketing development.</P>
    <P>We are on the way to 1993 and at this stage 60 per cent of the 279 directives in relation to 1993 agreements have been achieved at this stage.  There are problems in Europe which are not being addressed at present.  There are problems in the Mediterranean area which are not being addressed.  Our close neighbours in southern Europe and North Africa will need developmental help from Europe. <Col N="1439" /> There will have to be a greater co-ordination of effort in production, in marketing, in sales and in transfer of technology in the Maghreb-Mashraq and the southern European areas.  The political unifying of Europe is something people will say is well on its way, but there are huge problems associated with political unification.  There are other people who will take up this point that we have to have both monetary and economic union.</P>
    <P>The other major matter that has to be involved is the protection of Europe from outside and inside elements in terms of terrorism, looking at terrorist activities which have happened throughout the world.  Very close to home we have our own group of terrorists, throughout Europe we have terrorists and we have terrorists coming in.  The protection of our people is of paramount importance and there is now way we can get away from becoming involved in making certian that terrorists do not have a haven in any country within Europe, whether they be from within or outside Europe.</P>
    <P>The issue before us is one of major importance and I feel that we should talk about it as often as is possible.  Probably, at some stage, we will have to break it down into individual components and have debates on individual aspects of European Union, whether it be monetary, economic or political.  A start has been made here this evening and I am glad so many people will be able to get involved in the debate over the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with the final point made by Senator Lanigan. The matter being discussed is so broad and so wide that people just have not been able to relate to it.  I intend dealing with just three particular areas.  First, I want to take up the point Senator Lanigan has made, with which I also agree about the need for an educational service in Europe which will reflect the needs of a new Europe.  I also want to discuss the question of currency and the Central Bank issue.  I also want to approach an issue which I hope will be discussed more fully at another time, and <Col N="1440" /> that is the neutrality of individual countries in a European political union.</P>
      <P>On the question of education, obviously people will be quite aware that education is rather close to my heart and it is also the area in which I spent most of my life.  This week, on behalf of the trade union centres of the OECD countries and with the employers and business representatives of OECD countries, I made a presentation to the OECD General Council on the developments that should take place in education. I want to make one petty point about that.  People will be aware that the OECD represents almost all of Europe and many influential countries outside like Japan, the US, Canada and Australia etc.  Every country at that meeting was represented either by its Minister for Education or its Ambassador to the OECD, every country except Ireland and one other.  I must say I was ashamed.  I do not know the reason for it, but there were only two empty seats at top level discussions and we were the ones who were missed.  In a sense that reflects some of our double think about international and European affairs.  This is mainly a European body but we do not seem to be there when it counts.  It was important because it was an education for many people there to hear people making their case.  The person sitting beside me making the case for education was the chairman of IBM Europe.  He was making the case that I am tired of making in this country about the need to invest in education, not just on the basic question of languages, which Senator Lanigan so ably outlined and with which I agree thoroughly, but also on the whole area of training and retraining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I discussed with the employers and business people of the OECD the needs of their industry.  I also put forward my views on the need for an educational service in whatever country.  One thing is clear to me.  It is absolutely certain that we can no longer be satisfied producing a product through the educational system, when somebody can say &ldquo;O.K.  Now I have my leaving certificate, my BA, my B.Comm. my B.Ed., and that is it.  I am educated and I will go on working for the rest of my life&rdquo;.  I give the example of <Col N="1441" /> somebody working in the computer industry as a career.  Let us take the case of somebody now in his or her late fifties who would have begun his or her career in computers almost 40 years ago.  That person will have come through four generations of computers.  That person will have had to be trained and retrained or educated or re-educated &mdash; whichever word we want to use &mdash; four or five times. That is the trend.  Technology is flying ahead.  Discovery is expanding.  Knowledge is growing at a rate over which we have no control.  In order to keep abreast of any job, what we need to have are people who can accept retraining, who can accept re-education, who are adaptable and flexible, people who can create a climate of learning.</P>
    <P>What are the skills we need in the business of new Europe?  We need people who can communicate.  We need people with good interpersonal skills.  We need people with customer skills.  We need people who can change.  We need people who are flexible.  We need people who can train and who can be retrained.  We need people who can create a climate of communication and development from which the economy will eventually gain. The reality is that we in Ireland must prepare our service for &ldquo;Europeanisation&rdquo; in order to exploit the opportunities of Europe, which is really what we are talking about here tonight. When Senator Lanigan was talking about selling, that was a code word.  He was talking about exporting Irish goods to the rest of Europe, and why not?  We all know that if we are going to share benefits we must create wealth and therefore exportation becomes very important.  It is important that we say it without putting a tooth in it.  The selling Senator Lanigan was talking about was Irish people selling to Europe.</P>
    <P>Let me give one example.  Our worst balance of payments ratio with our European partners is with Italy and, coincidentally, Italian is the least taught language in our schools.  His case is made in that sense.  If we are going to sell we have to sell in the language of the people we expect to be buying.  In order to do that we have to introduce it to our schools.  If we are going to introduce it to <Col N="1442" /> our schools it is going to cost but we must recognise that we will get that investment back a hundredfold.  We must insist that we get it back a hundredfold and to do that we must make that investment.  We must assemble an education system which will efficiently and effectively prepare our youth for the challenge of Europe.  Teachers and parents demand a quality education.  They demand a product which is excellent for our pupils and the State must respond by the provision of adequate resources.</P>
    <P>Without a doubt, investment in education, particularly basic education because that is what leads to steps in every other direction, is an imperative for economic growth.  I did not make that up.  I never met any student of economics who would not go along with that.  At my first lecture in economics I learned that a healthy, educated work force was the first predeterminant of any economic development. We seem to have forgotten that in the way we have cut back on health and education over the years.  Nevertheless, an investment in education is an imperative for economic growth.  An investment in education is a first priority of economic development and without a shadow of doubt investment in education will be the final determinant of economic success. Everything that we say about balance of payments, selling and sales, will come back to that basic point.  Unfortunately because politicians in the main demand a sort of instant gratification and immediate returns, the State has been slow to provide finance resources for the educational service.  Politicians know that the rewards from the investment in education are reaped in the long term rather than before the next election.  Therefore we have always had to fight for those kinds of resources and investments to be made.</P>
    <P>A recently issued OECD statistical report which I was studying about a month ago has Ireland with Greece firmly at the bottom of the European league in terms of public expenditure on basic school pupils.  I do not want to misquote the report, but I think in general terms I can say the same about post-primary education.  I do not have the book to hand, but it is the OECD statistical report published in December 1989.  There will <Col N="1443" /> be a new version published by the end of this month which will give us the up to date position, which will not show a great improvement in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Ireland's education service indeed can learn from Europe.  As far as I am concerned &mdash; and I said this before &mdash; the new three R's for Irish primary education might well be: resources for education, the first R; reducing class sizes, the second R; and retirement options for teachers who feel they need a break and a move from the job, the third R.  These are things which have to be addressed and everybody agrees they have to be addressed, but it will not come cheap and in order to gain from Europe we must invest in those terms.</P>
    <P>The Government could begin moving on that and also on the question of languages.  Take our unemployed teachers.  We have 2,500 primary and 2,000 post-primary teachers with the skills to begin, for instance, a programme of language teaching in our schools.  That might be a start in response to what was said earlier by Senator Lanigan.</P>
    <P>On the question of the currency, the first point I want to make &mdash; and I hope somebody will contradict me before the end of the night &mdash; is that nobody knows where we are going in terms of European currency; nobody understands how it will be controlled; nobody has explained how we will have political accountability in terms of a Eurobank; and nobody can explain how we are going to face or begin the introduction of a Eurocurrency.  The row going on in Britain at present is obviously very interesting and very close to the discussion that is taking place in Ireland.  All I know is that we require the Central Bank to be answerable, not to be controlled but to be accountable, to those we elect to be in political control of the country, the Government.  There was a certain independence, but they were answerable and accountable, and that is the way we would want it.  I cannot understand how that is going to work in a single Europe or in a European union.  How do we control things like interest rates?  How do we control what are at the moment matters for the Central Bank?  Every <Col N="1444" /> prognostication that I have seen in this matter has been disproved.</P>
    <P>Remember the discussion last year about what would happen when the two Germany's came together?  It was going to do that to our interest rates; it was going to do that to our balance of payments; we were going in all sorts of directions all at the same time.  The only person who was saying otherwise, in fairness, was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  I was one of the few people who agreed with him at the time.  I did not agree with the prophets of doom who were saying the whole thing would fall apart.  A most casual examination of what was going to happen made it clear that the amount of money that would have to be printed in order to accommodate the Ostmark into Europe was no more than 5 per cent of what was circulating in the West German economy anyway, and with a 12 per cent leeway to play with &mdash; even if that whole 5 per cent was going to be used on imported and consumable products &mdash; then all it would do would be to slow down the German economy, which might be to our benefit. That seemed very obvious to me.  In the heel of the hunt, what has happened is that when the East Germans got their hands on the Deutsche Marks they proved to be very careful indeed about how they spent them and most of them came out of one bank and into another. Those people who thought that the people from the East were going to buy televisions, fridges and consumer items imported from Japan found that the birthday party did not take place for all the consumer product companies of the world.  It did not happen.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to the discussion that took place about the introduction of a European currency, there was a major row early this year when Prime Minister Thatcher was putting forward a viewpoint that we would go on a step by step basis into Europe.  Other people were saying other things.  At the moment, there is no clear line being put forward to me about how it would work but I am certain of one thing and I would certainly like a response to this if anyone can offer me one: I cannot see how we can have 12 central banks with a Eurocurrency. <Col N="1445" /> It cannot happen.  We cannot have 12 central banks.  It is the same currency and even within the Treaty of Rome, which demands that there will be free movement of, among other things, capital, and that means having a central bank for each country, it will not work despite the fact that there is going to be a Eurocurrency. We certainly need to address that point. I also want to know how the political responsibility will be tied into it and to whom they will be accountable.  It seems that where we are going in Europe in terms of money is not really being addressed.  What is the value of a stock exchange in Dublin at the moment?  Is not the reality that I can buy on the Cologne market, on the Amsterdam market or on the London market through the screen?  I wonder what our independence is at this time?  Having said all that, I want to say it is not that I have any great ambitions to protect the capitalists of our society, it is not that I have any great ambition to protect our banks from the ravages of Europe &mdash; to put it quite bluntly, I would be as happy to be answerable to a French bank as I would be to an Irish one, I do not see any great difference in it from that point of view &mdash; but it is simply on the political level.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about neutrality. Considering what it implies, there is no word at the moment which can get backs up quicker than talk about neutrality. I have given this a lot of thought myself.  I wonder where we might be in moving towards a closer European political union.  I have found the view of many people on the left of Irish politics to be over-purist; I have found it to be contradictory. I have found that many of my colleagues on the left of the political spectrum who would celebrate, quite correctly, and wish to participate in some way after 50 years with those people from Ireland who, say, went to Spain and fought on the correct side in the Spanish Civil War, are the same people who, the same day, at the same conference would say &ldquo;We will not fight for or defend a united Europe&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will have nothing to do with any kind of a defence pack in Europe.  We are neutral.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  The reality is that we have never defined neutrality.  I am told that we are <Col N="1446" /> neutral.  I have never noticed it myself.  I have heard the principal bleatings from all sides of the political spectrum.  I have heard a politician from a western county saying that we should join NATO and produce 30,000 jobs in Clare &mdash; that was his interest in it.  I have heard others saying that we should involve ourselves in the arms industry, that there were a lot of openings there to create jobs.  In other words, I have heard people from all sides of the political spectrum who have their own views and believe that we could be neutral and do all these things at the same time.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of neutrality and I intend to define that in some way, but neutrality in Ireland has never been a principle but it has been a pragmatic response to world situations.  That is as I see it.  I reject the sort of confused and confusing noises that are made by people who to my mind have never distinguished between sovereignty, pacifism and neutrality. There is no distinction made between sovereignty and neutrality and they are all tied up with pacifism and with this other ides that peace is something that can be achieved without fighting for it.  In the words of a Scottish folk singer, Dick Gaughan, &ldquo;Peace will never come by words alone.&rdquo;  That is the reality: peace will never be brought by speaking for it.  The truth is that the essence of Irish neutrality has always been, however, to be neutral on the right side.</P>
    <P>Let us look back at our history.  This is what worries me about going into a European union.  We are the country which has a shameful record of alleged neutrality.  We have a shameful record of countenancing the Irish version of neutrality. As we have practiced it, it can be nothing but shameful.  We have proudly and in splendid isolation stood idly by. How can we explain to future generations, or even to the present generation, a policy which meant that we stood and watched while Hitler slaughtered a nation in his bid to eliminate Jews, gays, handicapped and so on? How can we explain that we stood by and watched while Stalin murdered millions in his purges?  How can we explain that we stood and watched while Pol Pot <Col N="1447" /> massacred millions of workers, intellectuals and others?  That is what our neutrality has given us.  I do not want people to turn that around and say we should accept responsibility for those happenings either, but I do want to put it firmly on the record that those things happened in the lifetimes of people who are active in this country at the moment and we did nothing about it and it is nothing about which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>That is the only point I want to make, no more.  I am not attaching blame, but I am saying that it is nothing that we need to be proud of.  If that is the policy of neutrality, I want no part of it.  In short, we have given neutrality a bad name, because neutrality is not a passive state. It must be a vibrant, responsible and positive position; but, above all else, it must be active.  The only action I can remember us ever taking under the heading of neutrality was when De Valera rushed around to the German Embassy to sign the book of condolences on the death of Hitler, which I consider was negative and irresponsible at that time.  That is a subjective view, but I state it for the record anyway.</P>
    <P>Nowadays we have worked with and aligned ourselves with different groups and many different peoples &mdash; the Yanks with their foreign policy wrecked Central America; the British and their foreign policy led to the whole Malvinas catastrophe; the French have countenanced the proliferation of arms and involved themselves in affairs such as the sinking of the <i>Rainbow Warrior.</i></P>
    <P>The problem with discussing neutrality however is the lack of role models.  Where is the neutral country?  Have we seen one?  Have we come across one at any stage?  In the European context the one that is most normally thrown at us &mdash; the one I heard about going to school &mdash; is Switzerland.  The one I have heard about in recent times in Sweden.  Let us have a look at both of those countries.  Switzerland &mdash; the &ldquo;I'm all right attitude&rdquo;, look after No. 1, we will take the money of every criminal and mafia man and disruptive and degraded regime the world over, we will take their money, launder it and clean it up.  That is Switzerland's <Col N="1448" /> neutrality.  It has added nothing to world peace; it has added nothing to world development and has in fact facilitated crime and regimes of the worst types in many countries of the world.  Then there is Sweden, the more modern role model; Sweden, to which we have looked towards for more progressive policies; Sweden, which I have regularly quoted myself as being the role model for many progressive liberal and positive pieces of legislation.  Sweden has become wealthy on being an arms dealer to the world, selling arms to both sides of any war anywhere.  That is not neutrality.  That is not pacifism.  That is certainly not what I would see as being a role model.  It is easy to be a pacifist until somebody holds a gun to your own family or until somebody holds the country to ransom.  I do not know what pacifism is about.  There are very few people who would not kill to save a loved one.</P>
    <P>It is always very easy to be neutral until we are invaded.  It was very simple to be neutral while people were trampling over the Netherlands, Belgium and overall Europe through the Second World War. What would we expect of Europe if the West threw up a Hitler or a Stalin or Hussein tomorrow morning, who decided some morning before lunch to take over this little island of ours?  What would we expect of the rest of Europe at that stage? How would our neutrality policy stand us at that time?  How would we then remain neutral when we had just been taken over by some lunatic, and the world will continue to throw up the lunatics who may well be in positions of power at any time?  History will continue to throw up these people and one of them might some day decide that this is the country that he or she wants for strategic reasons.  What do we expect of the rest of the world at that time?  What do we expect of Europe at that time?  The world will always produce these people &mdash; leaders with policies and determinations of aggrandisement, expansion and empire building.  True neutrality must defend the weak.  True neutrality must be active, positive and strong.  True neutrality must be prepared to fight for peace.  True neutrality must be an international rather <Col N="1449" /> than a national initiative, and that is one of the keys to it.</P>
    <P>In recent years Ireland's heroic contribution to UN peacekeeping forces is for me the beginning of an acceptable role model in what international neutrality and peace keeping is all about. We must be prepared to do it for peace as well.  What it means is that we have to shift.  We have come to a decisive stage in the Cold War in regard to the power blocs on each side, East and West.  We now hear people saying &ldquo;NATO is no longer relevant&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Warsaw Pact is effectively finished&rdquo;.  But the danger is that we will say &ldquo;O.K. let us now move from NATO and set up a Western European defence pact&rdquo;.  To me, that is just the same under another name.  That to me is unacceptable.  It is an error and is the danger that we will fall into.</P>
    <P>I have gone to some lengths to explain what neutrality is and what it is not, but I am certain that we must shift the power from the war room of the Pentagon building to the peace room of the UN building.  That is where the shift must take place.  I want to give the justification for that.  In this city tonight &mdash; peace keeping city, peace keeping people &mdash; we had gardaí out there in riot gear trying to keep peace on the streets.  That is just a microcosm of the world.  What we saw on O'Connell Street tonight might be the desert of Saudi Arabia tomorrow.  At the end of the day somebody has to keep the peace.  In the same way as it would be unacceptable and impossible to operate a country without a police force, it would be impossible to have an international peace without somebody to police that peace.  The questions we have to ask ourselves are: (1) who will do that policing and (2) what is our involvement in it? Once we have established that to our satisfaction, that is where our neutrality will be and that is where our sovereignty will be, because our sovereignty will be strengthened by our dependence and inter-dependence on the nations of the world, because we will be doing it with those people in order to create a better world &mdash; in other words, we will be fighting to keep, make and create peace.  But the exchange of the British Khaki or the US green berets or whatever colour the <Col N="1450" /> French wear for the blue of the UN would be the first move in that direction.</P>
    <P>I think I made my views on this known in my first contribution to Seanad Éireann in April 1987 when we were discussing the legislation that went through at that time on the European Act.  It is a danger that we have to look at.  We have to establish a directive for ourselves.  We have to understand what we are going to do and we must recognise that we have a right to defend ourselves and others.  We have no right whatsoever to stand idly by and not make a positive active contribution to world peace and in that way to assert our neutrality as a very positive thing indeed.</P>
    <P>I would finish up by saying I have touched on three points, education, very briefly the economic matter and neutrality and sovereignty. I agree completely with what Senator Lanigan said, that this subject is too broad to be comprehensive way in this discussion and, therefore, the nature of his contribution will be that people will pick and choose various aspects of European development and say their piece on it.  I certainly hope that some of the things we have said tonight will lead to a more detailed debate on those aspects in the future.  It is also important that the views we are putting forward here go to the test in a confrontational way perhaps.  We put the case, hear the agruments and in that way make some progress towards a better Europe.</P>
    <P>We have proved beyond a shadow of doubt, despite what the prophets of doom say, that we can hold our own in Europe with any group.  We have nothing to worry about, about being submerged.  We have nothing to worry about, about being isolated culturally.  We have nothing to worry about regards losing our culture. These things will not happen.  I have confidence in ourselves as a nation and as a State that we will assert ourselves positively in Europe but we also need to exploit Europe.  In doing that, in order to create a better life for our people, we have to have the creation of wealth.  As somebody from the trade union side of <Col N="1451" /> things I say for the record, as I say consistently, that we cannot share wealth until we create wealth.</P>
    <P>The creation of wealth is a matter for all the social partners and it can only be done by having a clear objective of that wealth creation.  The tension takes place between the different groups, the workers and the manufacturers are the people who control the means of manufacturing in terms of who gets what portion of the cake.  At the moment the Government are policing that in the sense that they are overseeing the discussions that take place on it.  There is a huge world out there which need hold no fear for us, a world which is full of opportunities, a Europe which is growing and developing, a Europe that has a place for Ireland and a Europe where Ireland is held in the highest regard.  We must now, however, put or infrastructures in place. I spoke only about one of those, the education service.  I could have spoken about others.  These are things we need to do.</P>
    <P>An example of one thing we have done so efficiently and effectively over the last five years has been the development of our telecommunications.  Telecommunications in Ireland is as forward and far ahead as any system anywhere in Europe.  We can do that in every other field as well &mdash; in computerisation, in information technology, in communications, productions, etc.  It goes on and on.  With the population profile we have, we have a generation that no other country in Europe has.  That generation could be the key to European control and influence for Ireland over the next 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to what Senator O'Toole has said, particularly in regard to education.  I did not intend to speak on the education issue at all but Senator O'Toole and myself are bedfellows to the extent that both of us are involved in the education field.  We have a common interest in education.  I can share his sentiments with regard to the expansion of knowledge and indeed in the development of technology and how important selling to Europe is as was <Col N="1452" /> emphasised extremely well by Senator Lanigan in his contribution.</P>
      <P>I can also understand that; as secretary of the National Teacher's organisation Senator O'Toole would be very concerned about the level of investment in education.  While everything he says is extremely desirable, he indicates that the cost factor would, in fact, be met by the benefits derived therefrom.  I can understand all of that but I can also understand that the level of cost to any Government would obviously be prohibitive if we were talking in terms of providing the type and range of language training that we need. We can talk about developing the Eastern market, we can talk about providing language training in Chinese and in Japanese without ever even talking about Europe at all.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with the Senator with regard to the Italian market.  Up to recently German was all the rage.  The potential for exports to Germany and the resulting job creation was impressive to say the least but now with the coming together of the two Germanies, that is a question to be pondered.  Perhaps Ireland should look to both the Italian and the Spanish markets by way of language training.</P>
      <P>There is a number of questions I would like to pose arising from Senator O'Toole's contribution.  I would like to ask what contribution private enterprise is making to language teaching and, in particular, what percentage of their profits they are putting into this area, given that a fair percentage of those companies are involved in export growth.  We hear every day of the importance of selling consultancy and professional services but one must ask what contribution people involved in that area have made to the development and training in languages for export growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would need to have a debate on funds coming in by way of the European Social Fund and indeed the Regional Fund.  As somebody involved in third level education I must ask, in regard to the regional colleges, the universities and the higher education institutes, for how many of their courses is language training a prerequisite and part of their curricula. Have we ever quantified, for instance, <Col N="1453" /> the number of students who graduated in the engineering, the electronics and computer sectors and went on to be involved in marketing?  Likewise, it would be interesting to learn how many of them had language training while going through college.  Under the European Social Fund perhaps a prerequisite of making grants available for courses in regional colleges is that there be a foreign language dimension to the various courses.</P>
    <P>There is also a dilemma for us with regard to the money coming from the Regional Fund <i>vis-a-vis</i> training.  What balance is there between training and eduction?  From an Irish point of view, we would need to look at what contribution training funds can make to the development of languages.  We would all agree that we would need to look at the courses being provided and the relevance they have to what we would term an export growth economy.  We would find many of these courses deficient in that sense.</P>
    <P>I also ask, having again some knowledge of the Marketing Institute of Ireland and their courses, having a knowledge of the various federations, how many of these people are concerning themselves with language and with export growth.  This is a vast area.  I agree with Senator O'Toole it is something we should look at more fully on another day. The result of any such discussion should be very fruitful from the point of view of the Irish economy in the long run.</P>
    <P>I wish to go back to what I set out to speak on.  With the advent of the European Economic Union I believe it is necessary to set the scene by examining closely the economic entity in Ireland prior to taking a plunge into partnership with other member states.  By doing this we can establish how amenable union is and how prepared we as a nation are for it, what advantages can accrue to our economy and, indeed, the pitfalls that we as a small nation would need to avoid.</P>
    <P>Last year showed substantial growth in output and employment.  There is moderate inflation and there is certainly further progress on the budgetary fund.  The up-to-date figures indicate that the domestic output increased by almost 6 per cent while GNP itself grew by 5 per cent. <Col N="1454" /> Personal consumer spending increased by 5 per cent and investment grew by 12 per cent.  All of these are positive barometers. The composition of the growth in 1989 was very much employment-intensive. The private sector expanded rapidly, whereas unemployment continued to fall right across the economic spectrum.  Our balance of payments remained comfortably in surplus last year.  While inflation increased somewhat, that was due to the external influences. Nevertheless the domestic costs in income developments were moderate and led to a further improvement in the economy's competitive position.</P>
    <P>When we look at the prospects for 1990 they show that economic growth still remains satisfactory though obviously the accelerated pace of expansion will be slower than in 1989.  World economic growth has been slowing down from the very buoyant rates of last year, and it certainly goes without saying that the Gulf crisis adds considerable additional uncertainty to any forecast of economic prospects for an open economy in the short to medium term.  Apart from all these uncertainties, however, the prospects for our economy in 1990 are still favourable.  Economic growth still remains relatively strong with GNP likely to expand by over 4 per cent this year. Consumer spending again is growing by 3 to 4 per cent, investment is expanding at a rate of about 10 per cent and inflation remains at 3 per cent.  That is even allowing for the recent increase in oil prices. It compares extremely favourably with the UK rate of interest, which is almost 11 per cent.  If we look at industrial output we will see that the growth is likely to be about 7 per cent this year, following 12 per cent last year.  Exports again remain buoyant and we expect to have a very healthy trade surplus at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately jobs always are the last link in the chain of economic recovery.  I am glad that that now is beginning to come right and that employment over the three year period to 1990 has increased by an average of 13,000 per year, and over the past three years the increase in the non-agricultural private sector employment has averaged well over <Col N="1455" /> 20,000 per year.  On top of all that the interest rate recently has been cut by ½ per cent bring the total reduction for the year to date to 1½ per cent.  This cut, it should be remembered, was facilitated by our strong external reserves position and by the strong currency policy which the Government are pursuing within the EMS.</P>
    <P>We should also be mindful of the calm response to the Irish money market, to sterlings recent entry into the exchange rate mechanism rate of the EMS.  That surely, in my view, must be a further indication of the growing maturity of our financial markets.  It also confirms the fact that the Irish economy is being judged on its own merits rather then by reference to the UK, something we all had reservations about over the years.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that Irish interest rates and inflation have tended to converge with those of stronger European economies over the past few years. We still have some way to go on interest rates.  It is worthy of note that the diffential between the Irish and the German three month interest rates has improved by over 7 per cent since 1987.  There is absolutely no reason to suppose that further progress cannot be made in this regard.  I would also like to remind the house that the Bundes Bank recently increased its key official rate by 0.5 per cent.  This received considerable publicity because it led to speculation that there would be consequent pressure on interest rates here.</P>
    <P>The German official rate having being increased, it transpired that the French authorities actually reduced their rates by 0.5 per cent.  There is no reason to conclude that the option of the Bundes Bank should have an impact on our interest rates.  On the contrary, I suggest it would be necessary again to point to the strength of our external reserves.  At the end of September, to show Senators what the figure was like, it was of the order of £3,700 million, which is an historically high figure.</P>
    <P>We have certainly more uncertain conditions facing us in 1991.  I am pleased that the Minister for Finance has spelled out again that bedgetary discipline and <Col N="1456" /> cost containment are essential prerequisites for progress.  It is only right that we should wish the representatives among the social partners success in the negotiations that are now under way and that will be so important to our economy. I issue an important reminder to all of them.  Nominal pay rises are not a sacrifice. In fact they can be translated into higher real incomes and more rapid employment grawth in the future.</P>
    <P>There is major confidence in the economic management.  Economic management, now that we are thinking of monetary union, is even more important than ever because that confidence has been successful in attracting funds.  It is interesting to note that up to one third of Irish gilts are in the hands of nonresidents. This definitely is an indicator of the growing confidence in our economy. It serves also to sound a warning as to how fragile the balance can be and how easily outflows can lead to severe disruption if confidence in the management of the economy began to falter.</P>
    <P>Monetary union has been in mind since 1950, it is not a new concept.  It was the ultimate objective for those who had a united Europe in mind.  Since the oil crisis in the seventies progress has been retarded in that companies within the EC became very defensive and inward looking towards their own economies. With the passing of the Single European Act and, particularly, now with the findings of the Delors Committee, a solid basis for further work has been put in place.</P>
    <P>One of the most important features of the report is the special recognition of the difficulties pertaining to the poorer and the peripheral regions.  While not making specific proposals it acknowledges that the Community policies in the regional structural field will be necessary to bring about the best allocation of resources and spread those gains throughout the Community.  The contention is that the peripheral regions may fall behind unless appropriate counteracting measures are put in place.  It will, in my view, require further action designed specifically to close the development gap between the rich and the poor regions.  This, in turn, may even require <Col N="1457" /> an increase and a broadening of the Community budget to strengthen existing policies and to develop new ones in support of cohesion.  It is gratifying to note the Commission's recent idea of a scheme of grants or loans to help member states overcome their difficulties with major policies and it is something that must be welcomed by everybody here.  One of the main problems that will arise from Ireland's point of view is the question of tax harmonisation.  The House is aware that there is a great variety of tax regimes and tax practices throughout the Community. There has not been great progress to date in achieving uniformity. However, at long last, there is a realisation, that harmonisation is essential and that the matter must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>Progress over the last year can be reported in the area of VAT.  The new system will allow imports and exports to move freely without border controls. Discussions are now centred on the technical arrangements to make this work. What has yet to be decided, however, is the level of VAT and excise rates to apply after 1992.  It is quite clear that our rates, will have to approximate closely to those in Northern Ireland if serious diversions of trade are not to occur.  I suggest that any such distortion would be contrary to the Single Market philosophy but the process of bringing our rates into line with lower UK rates will be an extremely expensive one: It is estimated that it will be something like £600 million annually. Obviously, the Government and the country must look to the Community as a whole to assist in a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Members will also be aware that barriers to capital movements are to go before the end of 1992, I will revert back for a minute to 1987.  At that time we had an extensive range of controls over capital movement, particularly over portfolio investments overseas.  Today virtually all of these restrictions have been removed with the exception of those on the opening of foreign currency accounts by private residents.  We have gone down the road quite a long way and my understanding is that the Minister intends to put proposals to the Government shortly <Col N="1458" /> to provide further interim relaxation of controls leading to the full removal of these by the end of 1992 at the latest.</P>
    <P>We are now four months into the first stage of economic and monetary union and there is no doubt there is a great degree of progress to report in preparing for the Inter-governmental Conference. There is broad agreement concerning the basic principles which would form the budgetary monetary aspects of the union which is in its final stages.  The proposal for common monetary policy will involve the creation of a new independent institution, possibly entitled the European System of Central Banks, with price stability as its principal objective.  I should like to refer to what Senator O'Toole said about the Central Bank and indicate that my understanding is that basically we are going to have one new institution and each national central bank will be basically a sub-agent for it.  If we are talking about economic, financial and other unity then total integration is a must in this regard.  I hope that will get over any fears the Senator might have.  I am conscious that other speakers want to get in and I will conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few general observations in relation to our position versus Europe.  I want to project impressions I developed as a result of visits, first of all, to east Germany in recent times and, subsequently, to the European Commission in Brussels.  I want to advance reactions I found there in relation to our situation and, particularly, in relation to certain points the Minister made.</P>
      <P>I accept that progress is irreversible now.  The Single Market, as the Minister said, is well on its way to completion.  He spoke of the cohesive dimension of the Community which is also well on its way the fact that the qualified majority aspect of decision-making, has been brought in and that economic and monetary union is irreversible.  It would appear that the only personality who might be in a position to put a brake on that is at risk at present.  That is what confronts us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had, on the occasion of both of those visits, an opportunity to assess the political and industrial attitudes to what the <Col N="1459" /> Europe of the future will be.  German unification, as we all know, has been resolved in a very peaceful and satisfactory manner.  Fortunately, for Ireland in particular, the resources of West Germany were sufficient as it were to finance the absorbing of what was East Germany into the present German State.</P>
    <P>We have ongoing developments in Central Europe, all of which happened in the last 12 months.  The trend that ran through the projections of many of the people I spoke to was that the economic powerhouse of the Europe of the future was in central eastern Europe.  The new Germany, together with Austria and Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have the work ethic, the industrial tradition and background.  There is a capacity there for economic development that is not available elsewhere.  I would expect because of that attitude which I found in influential quarters, that with any funds which become available within the Economic Community there will be a tendency to go in that direction with them.</P>
    <P>The eyes and the interests of what I accept as influential people in both the political and industrial sectors are looking eastwards and particularly at that grouping. It was also made quite clear by them that countries such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary and, to a certain degree, Austria, in time will require aid to achieve the economic progress that was spoken about.  Poland was looked on as a kind of after thought.  What crystalised that thinking and brought it into focus for me was that one of those people, looking up at a map of the world, said: &ldquo;It is fine to talk to people from Ireland, there it is up in the north-western corner of <Col N="1460" /> Europe, a remote island out there&rdquo;.  It was worrying to discover that attitude among people who have influence in the political and economic fields.  Something else that caused a certain element of fear was that on my drive through East Germany I looked at the rolling miles of farm land, land with a tremendous capacity to produce food.  Certainly, where volume production is concerned, we are not at the races on this island.</P>
    <P>There are serious implications for the economic development of our country. The Minister said &ldquo;we will be seeking an outcome to the Inter-governmental Conference which will ensure that the periphery is afforded the same opportunities to benefit as the centre.&rdquo;  I fully support that.  I know it is the attitude of the Minister and the Government.  I know it is the attitude of every responsible person in this country but to me that attitude may well find itself in competition with the attitudes that I encountered and that I referred to.  We are that island out on the north western corner of Europe.  I do not want to say that in relation to Europe we are in a somewhat similar position to the Aran Islands <i>vis-a-vis</i> Ireland but the thinking of some people, as expressed to me, left me with that distinct feeling.</P>
