      <P>I have notice from Senator Liam Naughten that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Health to outline any changes in his plans since 1 January 1990 for general hospitals, psychiatric, geriatric, community care services in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate facilities for the assessment of teenage girls with conduct disorders who have been before the courts.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to enable Dublin Corporation to continue its programme of upgrading its housing stock.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for <Col N="214" /> the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>

    <P>I also received notice from Senator John A. Murphy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to reverse the decision to withdraw field staff in the Ordnance Survey service.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give a specific date as to when contractors will be appointed for the building of an extension to Lisnagry National School, Richill, County Limerick, when work will commence and an approximate date for completion of same.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Naughten, Upton, Costello, Ross, Ó Foighil, Murphy and Jackman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Naughten and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Upton, Costello, Ross, Ó Foighil, Murphy and Jackman may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House whether the matter I raised last week in relation to the European Court judgment of last October was discussed by the Whips as promised to me by the Acting Leader of the House at that time?  May I also ask the Leader of the Houe if he would consider, please, for the Order Paper next week a debate all day next Thursday on the storm and flood damage in our country?  It is past the stage of being dealt with at Private Members' Time, in any party's Private Members' Time, and I would like consideration of such a debate.</P>

      <P>We had a debate here some time recently on the Middle East. There have been a lot of developments in that area in the meantime, particularly the present question of the resettlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied territories. I ask the Leader of the House to consider whether it would now be appropriate to have a further debate in that area.  I would wish to hear his views on it.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business recently, the Acting Leader of the House made a point about the difficulty of agreement at Whips meetings.  I would like to make the point to the Leader of the House that I am not attending Whips meetings at the moment because I was seriously misrepresented at a recent Whips meeting on the matter of the setting up of committees. It becomes impossible to have a proper ordering of business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the interests of all Senators in the House I will not continue to tolerate that and you should know this already.  You have many opportunities to discuss the matter with me and you are very well aware of my intentions.  If you want to be the person who will break the rule, then you will pay for it.</P>

      <P>The position is that I sat here last week while an issue was raised. I tried to raise it and you made the point to me that there was no reply on the Order of Business.  I accepted your ruling.  I waited until this week to make the point which I had to sit and listen to last week about agreement at Whips meetings.  I am now being deprived of that opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that ruling and I have always accepted the ruling that Whips' meetings are not a matter for the Order of Business.  What I find astonishing is that the Acting Leader of the House last week was allowed to have at least five minutes of a discussion on matters that should have been arranged and agreed at the Whips meetings.</P>

      <P>I would like to strongly support the call by Senator Doyle that we have an all-day debate next Thursday on the storm damage.  Our abhorrence of the statement of the Minister, Deputy Kirk, today when he said that there was not a problem should go on the record of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business.  I want to propose that Item No. 81 be taken as the first item.  Item No. 81 refers to the provision of a proper assessment and therapeutic unit for girls with severe behavioural disorders.  This matter has been discussed in practically every other forum except the Seanad and it is now high time that we discussed it.  There are quite a number of things to be said in relation to what the Minister announced yesterday, particularly the fact that he did not set any timescale for the provision of the services which he announced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Upton in his plea for the establishment of the long-awaited detention <Col N="218" /> centre and also to express dissatisfaction about the discrimination against women where the over-16 year old female is not being facilitated in terms of a detention centre unlike her male counterpart who can be detained in St. Patrick's Institute. I support Senator Upton on the point he made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the amendment from my colleague, Senator Upton, in relation to the provision of accommodation and treatment facilities. It is a matter that has been dealt with in just about every single forum in the country, except this forum.  Indeed, it was debated yesterday in the Dáil even though we were told the matter was <i>sub judice</i>.  Matters relating to it could not be debated in this forum and that is a scandalous situation.  It was raised here first but we did not debate it.  It is typical of what has been happening.  We seem to be kowtowing to the Dáil and we are afraid to take on controversial issues even though they are highly relevant.  Secondly, I would like to say that the statement from the Minister is entirely pertinent and that is one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move my amendment but, before I do so, I wish to mention another item, namely, Item No. 32, and to ask if in the light of the bombing of Newry railway station last weekend and of the continued bomb threats, the Leader of the House will consider facilitating the House with an all-party motion on the threat to the disruption of the rail services connecting the north and south of this island.  I believe it would be noncontroversial and I think it would be helpful.</P>
      <P>I would like also to move an amendment in the light of the continuing total flagrant contempt of the European Court ruling, that Item No. 30 regarding the European Court judgment, now 18 months old, be taken today as Item No. 1 of business.</P>

I think it is monstrous that the Government should show such contempt for the European Court of Human Rights by continuing to evade its obligations in this regard.  I am supporting Senator Norris and I do so gladly, as an inveterate heterosexual, I may add.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the point <Col N="221" /> that was raised by Senator Upton and the challenging of the Order of Business, we thoroughly support the point he made.  I think he had a request to have a debate on the Adjournment today which was not successful.  Conscious that Senator Harte was at the Whips meeting last Thursday when the order of today's business was agreed, I ask if perhaps the Leader of the House would consider slotting in Item No. 81 as the first item tomorrow morning before the proceedings that you mentioned here today.  We want orderly proceedings and I am just suggesting that perhaps this is a way to deal with the critical issue that has been raised and still be orderly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters have been raised and I will first take the last one.  That item can be taken under Standing Order 29 if the Cathaoirleach agrees that it be taken as a special item. If not, it can be taken as an urgent debate in Private Members' time and I think the Labour Party are the next group who will be able to avail of that.  However, in view of the support that has been given for that debate, I will refer the matter to the Government and see what response can be got from them.</P>
      <P>With regard to Item No. 32 raised by Senator Norris on the bombing of Newry rail station and the need for a debate on that, I do not see that there should be any difficulty in arranging a debate on that matter and on the detrimental effect to life and commerce throughout our country.  Again, I am not going to give a date for that but I do not foresee that there should be any difficulty in having an early debate and I will look for support for that.</P>

    <P>I dtaobh na ceiste a bhí agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil, nílim in ann freagra a thabhairt air.  Tá an córas aistriúcháin á phlé le míonna anuas sa Teach seo agus sa Teach eile, agus i mórán áiteanna eile.  Nuair a bheidh an freagra ceart agam don Seanadóir, beidh mé ríshásta, <Col N="222" /> agus tá súil agam go mbeidh seisean ríshásta ina thaobh sin freisin.</P>
    <P>I would say to Senator Costello that we have never been afraid in this House to take matters of controversy.  We have done so on numerous occasions.  In my time as Leader of the House and during the time of my predecessors we have addressed controversial matters.  There has never been an attitude in this House that we were not able and willing to take on matters of controversy.  I am not accepting the amendment to the Order of Business.  Senator Jackman supported Senator Upton.  The same reply applies.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly and other Senators raised the question of storm damage. Obviously storm damage and what is happening all over the country is a matter of concern.  I will raise that matter with the Government to see when we can have a full debate on it.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges are meeting on various things. With regard to Senator O'Toole's reference to difficulties with the Whips, I suggest that he should meet the Government Whip immediately after the Order of Business to discuss this matter and see if there can be a resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to a debate on the resettlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied territories, I had a meeting with members of the Supreme Soviet last week on this matter and I will relay their attitude towards it.  I know the attitude of various other people and if I relay to Senator O'Toole the views of the Supreme Soviet on this particular problem, then we can decide when it might be appropriate to have a further debate on the Middle East. There are some Members of this Chamber who would suggest we have had too many debates on the Middle East.  Nevertheless, if there is a need for an urgent discussion on matters such as that we can come back again.  The Minister has no problem with that.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the European Court judgment, I believe the matter was not raised at the Whips meeting.  I am not too sure why it was not raised: possibly it was forgotten.  We are not taking that <Col N="223" /> item today but I will ask the Government when they will be taking steps as a result of the European Court judgment.</P>

      <P>It is with regret that I rise to propose a vote of sympathy of the House to the family of the late John L. O'Sullivan, who served this House extremely well when he was here and, indeed, served the other House for very many years.  Apart from serving in the Houses of the Oireachtas, he served in many public bodies throughout his long years of public life and, even though he was quite elderly, he remained active in public life until very recently.  He was a man who had seen the formation of this State and he served the State.  After he left the Houses of the Oireachtas, he continued to serve at local and national level.  To his family I propose a vote of sincere sympathy.  Go raibh rath Dé ar a anam.</P>

      <P>I second the Leader's motion of sympathy to the family of the late Councillor L. O'Sullivan. John L. was a tremendously colourful character throughout his long life.  He served in the Houses of the Oireachtas, as has been said, from 1969 to 1977, including a term here as a Senator.  He was a member of the much esteemed Old IRA, a man who took up arms for his country, a man who was sentenced to death, a man whose life was spared because of the Treaty. Indeed, many a colourful story he told to those of us who knocked at his door over the years for advice and support, and for electoral support when the time was right.  He was, indeed, a wonderful local councillor, chairperson of his county council, as well a parliamentarian in these Houses.  He was a true Corkman, a man of very strong views, a man of great character but, above all, he is the last of a generation and a great Irishman.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with this vote of sympathy to the O'Sullivan family.  Of few people can it be said that they were a legend in their own lifetime, but I believe that can be said of the late Councillor John L. O'Sullivan.  He served his country fearlessly from an early age and he served on the local authority and Cork County Council right up to his death.  He was a remarkable man, who did not suffer fools gladly, a man of integrity and of extraordinary courage.  To his family I would like to extend very sincere sympathy.

      <P>I, too, would very much like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the family of the late John L. O'Sullivan.  I met John L. O'Sullivan just once, during the Seanad campaign at the Cork County Council offices and I thought at that stage he was a truly remarkable fellow, given his age.  It was wonderful to meet somebody who had been around since before the foundation of the State.  He was exceptionally courteous and kind to me.  One of the things which particularly struck me on that occasion was the way the other councillors, of all shades of political opinion, looked after him and took him around. What was perfectly obvious to me was the tremendous respect in which he was held by people of every shade of opinion in the Cork County Council on that day last June.

      <P>I would like to join in the expression of sympathy on behalf of the Independent group.  I asked especially of my colleagues that I should be allowed this honour and privilege, which was graciously yielded to me, even though Senator John A. Murphy would have liked to speak, a real recognition of the fact that this was a great Corkman.</P>
      <P>The reason I particularly wanted to speak is because I had some slight personal acquaintance of John L. O'Sullivan. He was a big man in every way.  I first met him at the General Council of County Councils in Ballybunion, County Kerry, when I was invited to speak by a member of the Government party.  I always believe in speaking my mind, and speaking the truth, and it caused some little controversy.  At the end of the meeting a very large man advanced upon me and I was not quite sure what were his intentions.  He stretched out a hand and said: &ldquo;You are a great little fighter&rdquo;.  I felt he was a big-hearted, generous person, somebody who was a fighter, a clean fighter, a decent fighter in the early days of this State and somebody who maintained this very honourable tradition throughout his parliamentary career.  It is a great sadness to me that he has passed away.  I was unaware he was ill.  His death has caused a genuine feeling of regret on the Independent benches.</P>

I am very happy to say these few words in his memory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In pages 5 and 6, subsection (1), to delete lines 43 and 1 to 3, respectively and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;structure&rsquo; includes any building, dwelling, erection, excavation, or other thing, constructed, erected, or made on, in or under any land, or any part of a structure so defined, and where the context so admits, includes the land on, in, or under which the structure is situate;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We should clearly specify exactly what a &ldquo;structure&rdquo; is, and define it clearly so that it may not at some later stage be misinterpreted in law.  It is important on Committee Stage that we clearly and precisely spell out exactly what the structure is with regard to the legislation before us. There is an onus on us to clearly specify this and that is why I have moved this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to take it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>For me at this stage, section 2 of the Bill presents a major difficulty.  In relation to the amendment Senator Naughten has proposed, I support the observations he has made on it.  It is simply another indication of the difficulty that I have.  There may be a procedural problem here and I will try and explain what it is.  Section 2 is the interpretation section of the Bill.  It says that a derelict site shall have the meaning assigned to it by section 3.  There is a further problem arising then in relation to the owner other than in section 15.  I have a major problem with both these interpretations and I am looking for guidance here.  As I said, until I understand <Col N="232" /> what we are talking about clearly and until I know what is involved in a derelict site, I do not know what interpretation we will have on it.</P>
      <P>May I elaborate on my problem?  I argued this with the Minister when he was here.  Today, we have the Minister of State taking Committee Stage of the Bill.  My difficulty is that my interpretation, with which the Minister did not agree, is that every green field, whether there is a structure or anything on it, under this legislation has the capacity to become a derelict site, with consequent compulsory acquisition.  If I could get a clarification on that point.  I would know where I was going from there.  That is my difficulty with this section at the moment.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the amendment because I think it is important that legislation of this kind should come into operation within a specific time period and the time period prescribed by the Bill is vague and imprecise.  The limit, which is three months after the date of the passing of the Act, seems to me to be a realistic one.  If the Government are serious in their intention in this legislation &mdash; and I deliberately use the conditional &mdash; then the very least they can do with this totally defective piece of legislation is, at least, say when it will come into operation.  We have already seen what the limitations are and amendments are not accepted.  Of course, I have to defer to the Cathaoirleach's ruling in this matter, but even parts of the Government's agreed programme with the Progressive Democrats are not allowed to be included.  The very least we can expect is a date by which this totally defective Bill will come into operation.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  It is important that the definition be extended in the widest possible terms and that the interpretation is helped by extending the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; to &ldquo;includes&rdquo; and that the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; be inserted.  It is an improvement on the original statement.  We have seen in previous legislation where we had no problem at all in using catch-all phrases. It is important here that we include all of the structures which create a derelict site. For that reason I believe the amendment would benefit the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind Senators that the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, is one of the Bills targeted for enactment as part of the Government's environmental action programme. As Senators know, this programme is a wide ambitious one but practical measures, such as today's Bill, also have been part of it.  It is right that we should promote them.  In regard to Senator Norris' remarks, to put the Senator's mind at ease, the section he is talking about will come into law as soon as the President signs the Bill.</P>
      <P>I will deal now with the amendment moved by Senator Naughten.  This amendment attempts to improve the drafting of the definition of &ldquo;structure&rdquo; but I would have some reluctance in departing from the original definition in the Bill.  This is expressed in identical terms with the definition of &ldquo;structure&rdquo; which is set out in section 2 (1) of the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963, which is established in law and in judicial interpretation of land use issues of some 25 years now. The only additional element in the amendment is the reference to &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. I am satisfied this would in any normal circumstances be fully comprehended within the definition as it stands.  I am talking there about a structure. Say, for instance, it was to be a house; a house and a structure are two different things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here, as the Minister has responded, is that he is not happy with the use of the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. He prefers the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo;. We may be splitting hairs here but there is an implication inherent in a &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. It implies that somebody is dwelling or living in the particular structure.  It may well be the owner, or the occupier or it may well be a squatter.  If the Minister fails to include the term &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; and if somebody, who is neither the owner nor the tenant happens to dwell in this dilapidated structure, then has he not denied himself by failing to include it, the option of dealing with it by virtue of the <Col N="235" /> fact that somebody dwells there who may not be the owner or a tenant in the strict sense of the word but nevertheless dwells in it?  If the Minister excludes the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; from the section, then if the structure is being dwelt in, if it is in a dilapidated and unacceptable state and is an embarrassment on the landscape, the street, town or village, is he not limiting his authority to deal with the situation under this Bill?</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a good point.  Nevertheless, there is validity in the Fine Gael amendment because it is defined here that the structure means any building and it is not necessarily an exclusive list.  It would be better to rephrase it to state that the structure includes the list that is there.  In the structures that are listed there, we do not necessarily cover all the possibilities. That is why I would prefer that the word proposed by the Fine Gael Senator was changed from &ldquo;means&rdquo; to &ldquo;includes&rdquo;.</P>

I have no problem with the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; because, as the Minister said, it is defined in the 1963 Act and I believe &ldquo;structure&rdquo; includes all those things.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 8, after &ldquo;area&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;(and specifically includes sites assembled for the purposes of property development)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment because the gross defect of the Bill includes the fact that it exempts from its operation the assembly of sites for the purpose of property development.  This was included in the Minister's speech.  I wish particularly to include this because it seems quite <Col N="237" /> clear that one of the principal sources of blight in urban terms is the assembly of sites for the purpose of property development. I direct the Minister's attention to the situation with regard to Nos. 6 and 7, Bachelor's Walk, where there has been the assembly of a site for the purpose of property development and one of those buildings, which are list one buildings, has subsequently been destroyed.  It seems to be vitally important if we are serious about protecting listed buildings, that we include the principal sources of that dereliction.</P>
    <P>I am concerned because the Bill, as it stands, excludes from its operation the two principal sources: (1) property speculation and (2) the impact of local authorities with compulsory purchase orders with the intention of creating motorways. I cannot understand how such a Bill can have a serious intention if at the head of its operation, it excludes the two principal sources of blight and dereliction.  I urge very strongly that the Minister takes this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this amendment precisely for the reasons outlined by Senator Norris.  I could add to the examples he gave.  I refer the Minister to a long-standing blight which afflicted the city on the corner of St. Stephen's Green, when over a very long period a site was being assembled for what is now the St. Stephen's Green Shopping Centre.  This probably went back 12 or 15 years.  A very large site was assembled there.  Modern thinking on planning has now moved away from what is called comprehensive redevelopment for the very reason that it takes so long to assemble these sites.  In many instances there is no blame on a developer doing that.  We need in this legislation to make it unattractive for a property developer or a property speculator to try to put together such an enormous site.  If the sites are curtailed there will not be the problem of dereliction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that by excluding from the Bill sites assembled for the purposes of property development we are actually encouraging dereliction because we are <Col N="238" /> saying to developers: &ldquo;It does not matter; you can assemble sites, you can go in for comprehensive redevelopment if you want, going over ten, 15 or 20 years and this Bill specifically excludes you&rdquo;.  By its very nature it is saying to them, that we are giving them <i>carte blanche</i> to do that. I believe that is a very defective element of this Bill and I cannot understand why this is the position.  Quite clearly, it is reasonable for a developer to put together a site, particularly if it is in an old area of a city, but he must do it in such a way that it goes ahead quickly and he must be able to keep the buildings he has acquired in such a state that they will not cause dereliction.  I do not see why the Irish people, and indeed the visitors we are doing so much to encourage to our shores, should be treated to eyesores of this kind, derelict sites to facilitate a developer.  This amendment is one of the best amendments which has been put down and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to strongly support the amendment proposed by Senator Norris.  It is a very useful amendment where it extends the definition to cover in an urban area property that is assembled for the purpose of development, particularly property development. A number of examples have been cited.  They are evident throughout the city where speculators, either of a private or public nature, have got their hands or are in the process of getting their hands on parcels of lands and have kept them in a derelict state for years and even decades.</P>
      <P>A number of areas were mentioned.  I mention specifically in terms of private speculation, Mountjoy Square, which would be one of the finest squares in this city if it had not been allowed to fall into the hands of speculators; the dereliction there has gone on for well over a decade. I also mention the road widening at Summerhill and on Parnell Street where houses have been acquired under compulsory purchase order for years and nothing has been done.  This is being done by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> It is extremely important that we deal with the body or the individual who acquires property for the purpose of waiting until such time as some perhaps vague or tenuous plan of the local authority will at last come to fruition, or in terms of a private speculator until such time as the market prices have gone up sufficiently to make it sufficiently attractive to proceed with that particular development.</P>
    <P>The important thing the Bill seeks to do is essentially what this amendment is about, that it restores respect for the city, that the public will be respected, and individuals or bodies, of whatever nature, will not be entitled to cause blight in the city.  Also, it is most appropriate that this Bill be passed very quickly &mdash; next year we will be the cultural capital of Europe &mdash; so that we can at last begin to compel those individuals who are assembling properties which are eyesores in the city to clean up their act very quickly.</P>

      <P>This amendment is unnecessary.  The definition of urban land, no matter where it is, comes under the Derelict Sites Bill.  It would run contrary to normal drafting to make a special mention of this kind of case when it is already fully comprehensive by the generality of the definition.  All urban land, if it is derelict comes under that definition. If urban land is derelict, then it is derelict, and it will come under the full terms of the legislation.</P>

I am delighted the Minister says he agrees with the principle.  He says it is covered already.  I am a simple naïve man.  I will be here for a very long time this afternoon arguing the point, hammer and tongs, so why does he not very graciously allow the amendment to go through?  He will have no conflict of conscience because he says the Bill already does this.  The Minister for the Environment apparently does not seem to think it does because he talks about bona fide site assembly.  I do not want us to spend the entire afternoon parsing and analysing the standpoint of various political parties on what bona fide site assembly might be.</P>

Because I start from that position I believe the Department and the Minister must wish to ensure that this Bill makes it mandatory on local authorities to take effective action against property speculators or anybody else who may be contributing to the dereliction.  It is fair to say that when the Minister, Deputy Flynn, was here he seemed to give them a let out in the phrase &ldquo;special arrangements may also be operated at the discretion of the local authority for bona fide site assembly&rdquo;.  I suggest to the Minister who is here today that if this Bill goes through as it is without this amendment, even though it may not be the intention of the Department of the Environment that this should be the case, it will give those local authorities who may not wish for one reason or another to implement the provisions of the Bill, a let-out and they will be able to quote the Minister's speech in support of their case.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25 of the Bill reinforces the argument that urban land <Col N="243" /> does include a derelict site under site assembly.  It is based on the premise that the derelict sites levy does in principle apply to derelict redevelopment of sites. That is the position.  I think Senator Norris got a little confused between the sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas under section 25, as the Minister points out, a local authority can deal with the assembly of sites for bona fide property development and it is appropriate to have that as a specific part of the Bill, what are referred to in this amendment are two things.  It refers first to the private property developer and, secondly, to the local authority or other property developer.  We saw not so long ago where Dublin Corporation, a local authority, acquired a lot of land along the Liffey known as Wood Quay. A great deal of dereliction was caused by the local authority in the acquisition of the land over a long period of time and there is no specific provision in this Bill which prohibits a local authority from acquiring sites for development purposes, property development purposes I may well add as well.  What is intended in the second part of the amendment is not covered by section 25.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the history of the situation where there has been very conspicuous dereliction, and that has been caused by the activities of property developers in assembling sites. I am concerned that where special arrangements may be operated for what is described as bone fide site assembly, this could be construed as being assembly <Col N="244" /> for the purpose of redevelopment.  We have only to look at Mountjoy Square, Dorset Street, Eccles Street &mdash; I could spend a whole afternoon listing and categorising areas of the city where there has been devastation caused by what could be interpreted as bone fide site assembly.</P>
      <P>It may be quite difficult to detect the precise section of the Bill which gives operation to this but the Minister, Deputy Flynn, has said this; he has opened the gate and, having opened the gate and it is on the record of this House, basically, the message is, property speculation is all right and the cowboys can return to the city of Dublin.  We do not want that.  If people like myself and Senator Hederman, a former Lord Mayor of the city of Dublin, feel so strongly about the matter and if the Minister says there is no contradiction between the amendment and the main purpose and function of the Bill, why can he not short-circuit the debate by accepting that amendment, because it is not going to damage the Bill?</P>
      <P>I had thought other arguments might have been raised but they have not and I am not going to feed them to the Minister. However, I invite him and plead with him to take this amendment on board.  If he does not, what will happen is a signal will go out that it is open day in Dublin once more for dereliction and for the devastation of the city by property speculators.</P>
      <P>The whole country is opposed to the devastation of our heritage by property speculators.  The Minister has no difficulty with the principle that is enunciated here.  Can he not allow us to get on to the next series of amendments by accepting something to which he has no moral or intellectual objection and reassure the people of this country that we have put an end, or we are genuinely in an all-party fashion trying to put an end to property speculation?</P>

      <P>I must defend the Minister, Deputy Flynn, here with regard to the much quoted part of his address to this House.  I do not think the Minister intended to open any gates in the fashion suggested.  I intend to defend the Minister in his absence even though the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, is here. Senator Norris is away ahead of himself but that is no bother to him.  He should forget about the amendment and let us get on with the Bill.  All his problems might well be solved on section 25.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get involved in any personal argument between Senator Honan and Senator Norris, amusing and all as it may be, because this is a very serious issue.  It is a failing of mine to give people credit and always to think the best of them.  If the Minister is telling me he intends that these property speculators who are assembling sites will not be excluded from this Bill &mdash; the Minister is nodding his head so we know we have his agreement on that &mdash; he would simply be copperfastening the situation, he would be leaving it open to no doubt.  I have no wish to attack the Minister in his absence. I think Senator Honan is right, that he did not intend to open up any loopholes but the reality is, and it is on the record of the House, unintentionally he may have opened up some loopholes by saying &ldquo;special arrangements may also be operated at the discretion of the local authority for bona fide site assembly&rdquo;. Unfortunately, that has happened and we cannot extract that; we cannot remove the words from the record.  In the light of that, the Minister who is here today might consider it a good idea, because unintentionally this door may have been opened, to close it here at this moment by accepting this amendment which would specifically include sites assembled for the purpose of property development. If the Minister has no problem with it, <Col N="246" /> because that is what he intends, would he not be strengthening the Bill by accepting the amendment and we could get on, as we all want to, to other aspects of this very important Bill?  I would urge the Minister to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the wording that is in the section at the moment.  With regard to the Minister's Second Stage speech, he was dealing with the matter in a general way as one deals with any Bill on Second Stage.  As I stated last week on the Building Control Bill, when it comes to the nitty gritty it is dealt with accordingly.  When the Minister of the day puts a Bill through the House, he decides to delete or to add, as the case may be, depending on the drafting and on what the situation is.  I am satisfied with the section and I want to say to Senators Norris and Hederman that on section 25 I will deal with all they are concerned about in a very comprehensive manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris dealt with a number of points in regard to the compiling of land, in the Dublin area especially.  That has always been a difficulty but I am glad to say that here on the quays where major development is now being put together Dublin Corporation &mdash; and I highly commend them for it &mdash; have done a wonderful job through the urban renewal team there, for which I have special responsibility.  The members of that urban renewal team of Dublin Corporation have done splendid work and I am glad to have this opportunity to thank them for it.  They have created millions of pounds of work there, which is not easy when you are dealing with legal title and all of that.</P>
      <P>Two persons will not be involved or two owners; there will be one owner only. I am happy that that is the right way to go about it.  On section 25 I will deal with the matter in more detail.  I am sorry I cannot agree with Senator Norris on the amendment he has put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister very much.  When he congratulates Dublin Corporation on the quays of Dublin I <Col N="247" /> believe the shade of Jonathan Swift must be entertaining itself somewhere on a little cloud.  Has the Minister seen the quays recently?  Is he aware of the conditions there.  I do not wish to impugn all the members of the various groups in Dublin Corporation, because that is such a very wide brief, but the Minister, I am sure intentionally and with the puckish sense of humour for which he is so renowned, has drawn our attention specifically to precisely the kind of concerns that those of us on this side of the House at least have in mind when we talk about property speculation.  I was not quite sure whether the Minister was suggesting that he might in fact insert on our behalf our amendment at section 25 where it does not currently exist at all.</P>
      <P>I would like also to ask would the Minister accept that the function of legislation is twofold?  One is to secure, in the most legalistic and comprehensive terms, what the ambition of the Government is. The second is similar to it, to communicate to the great mass of the Irish people what the Government's intention is.  By accepting this amendment the Government will clearly be signalling to the people and to property developers what their intention is.</P>
      <P>I have one other thing to say.  It was not my intention to impugn the honour of the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and I was not intending to speculate about what his intentions may or may not have been. I was dealing simply with the concrete reality of what he said and trying to tease out the implications of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, for example, is he aware that not very far from this building, in No. 29, Clare Street, a site was assembled which was principally one building, a List 1 building, one of the most important buildings in our heritage and, despite the personal intervention of the then Lord Mayor, it was devastated?  Can the Minister assure me that this situation could not happen under this Bill?  He seems strangely satisfied with the operations of authorities like Dublin Corporation, who we all know, do absolutely nothing whatever.  They never <Col N="248" /> intervene, they do not even use the powers they already have.  It is, I quite agree with the Minister, an absolute public scandal that they do not.  This Bill, if our amendment is accepted, might actually do something.</P>
    <P>I do not want this to become a kind of partisan thing.  That is why I would like if, for example, the Fianna Fáil Members might just consider it as, through the Cathaoirleach, I would invite the Minister to do so again, because it is such an important matter.  We will wish to continue to tease it out for some time, particularly in view of the Minister's good grace in attempting to lead us on in the matter.</P>
    <P>It would be very gracious of the Minister if he could accept this amendment because he has already said that it does not damage, detract from or alter the Government's intention.  I would say that we do not represent the log jam here this afternoon.  The apparent intransigence on the Government's side which, I am sure, we can overcome by argument during the course of the afternoon, an apparent intransigence which I have no doubt will weaken eventually, could be overcome if the Minister would include this amendment and, as I say, there seems to be no conflict between us.  I have indicated a problematic area in the Minister's speech.  It would be impertinent for me to speculate about his intention &mdash; I am not going to do that &mdash; but my doubts can be resolved if the Minister can do something that should present him with no difficulty.  As my distinguished colleague, Senator Hederman, has said, it will merely copperfasten what the Government intend.  So may I plead with them to allow us the honour of inserting just one little nail in the coffin of property speculation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with considerable interest to the points raised by Senators Norris and Hederman.  I sympathise with their point of view and I believe they have a genuine fear.  One way of resolving their fear would be acceptance by the Minister of the amendment. We have spent a considerable time <Col N="249" /> on it; I am not suggesting it is not important but it has been argued to the extent that it can be argued and very effectively. It is a question of whether the Minister accepts it or not.  I may not have said the most popular thing now as far as the Senators on the backbenches are concerned but there are two other observations I would like to make in relation to the debate as it has developed so far.</P>
      <P>What is very evident is that there is a Dublin problem and the Minister is attempting in this Bill to resolve that problem.  However, in attempting to resolve that Dublin problem we are going to create problems later on.  There are other counties apart from Dublin that will be confronted with problems as a result of this approach to dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to an extract from the Minister's speech and certain interpretations have been put on it.  What the Minister was actually doing &mdash; I am not defending him; I am defending something I have felt strongly about over the years &mdash; is that he was giving to the elected members of local authorities the power and authority to make certain decisions.  The majority of those of us here today have been members of local authorities and over the years we have decried the removal of power and responsibility from us.  Are we at this point saying to the Minister, &ldquo;We are afraid of facing up to this issue; for God's sake take another bit of responsibility from us&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I am not without sympathy for the points made.  It would be a very simple way of resolving the issue and if I were in the Minister's shoes I would be doing this.  However, I cannot make the decisions.  The Minister is attempting to resolve a Dublin problem with a piece of legislation which will create other problems with which we will be dealing later this evening.  I do not want the further diminution of authority and power of members of local authorities.</P>

      <P>My motion refers to the need for the Minister for Education to begin work immediately on the long promised extension at Richhill National School, Lisnagry, County Limerick, in view of the destruction of one prefabricated building last Monday and the continuing danger to the pupils who, fortuitously were on a day off when the prefabricated building was blown down.  Considerable damage was done to the rest of the school.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister, Deputy Connolly, to the fact that this is a derelict site from an educational viewpoint and from a building viewpoint. In light of this I ask that the Minister for Education would have contingency plans prepared.  A number of the pupils are now off school because they have no school to go to.  I would like if the Minister would come here and address this issue immediately for the sake of the 250 pupils in that school.

      <P>I have no wish to prolong unduly the debate or to be in any way obstructive but I would say to the Members on the Fianna Fáil benches that there is no point in our rushing on to other sections if we omit to remedy a fundamental defect in the Bill.  If we are going to allow private speculators to continue to create dereliction, if we are leaving a loophole for the local authorities not to take action and if, in addition, we are going to allow local authorities to put together sites for major roads, then we may as well give up now and spend our time more profitably doing something else because this Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on.  I urge the Members on the other side not to assume we are taking up time here over some trivial item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is saying that the amendment we are discussing would be more suitably considered under section 25 I would be prepared, provided Senator Norris was quite happy that that was the right place for it, to defer the discussion until then but that does not seem to be the case.  I did not fully hear what Senator Howard said but he mentioned something about problems in Dublin.  I would like to place on the record that Dublin is the capital of Ireland.  It is not some <Col N="252" /> isolated town or city; it is the capital of this country and, as such, it plays an extremely important rôle.  I do not think we should be provincial, and I do not think it was the intention of any Senator here to be provincial, in our approach. Dublin is where the seat of Government is located; it is a very fine capital city and any amendment which can be introduced here which benefits the capital city, even if it does not benefit any other town or city in Ireland &mdash; which is not the case &mdash; should be introduced.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation, of course, is that it is not specific to Dublin.  Senator Ross, Senator Norris and myself referred to Dublin because we obviously refer to places about which we have personal experience, I do not start talking about places in Ennis because I would not have the experience and I bow to the knowledge of a Senator from Ennis.  However, I am absolutely satisfied that I know enough about cities like Galway, Limerick, Cork, and even Ennis, to realise that the problems about which we are speaking from personal experience in Dublin also exist in other places.  For that reason we must look at this Bill in great depth.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention 29, Clare Street.  Senator Norris put a question to the Minister which is quite simple to answer.  The reality is that 29, Clare Street would get out of the loophole here; it would get out of the net.  I urge anybody who has not seen it to go down and have a look at it and to ask ourselves if that is what we want?  Do we want 29, Clare Street lying in dereliction?  Senator Norris with his poetic flair described it better than I could describe it.  Do we want to leave loopholes in this Bill which will allow somebody simply to say: &ldquo;I am putting together this site for development&rdquo; and, therefore, they cannot be touched?</P>
    <P>The Minister keeps saying he is happy with the Bill.  I ask him to tell us how or why he can be happy with the Bill if his intentions are as he states, when the Minister for the Environment said that it will be possible for the local authorities to use their discretion to create these <Col N="253" /> loopholes?  I would like to put on record that there is no Senator, no public representative in this country, who is more committed to local democracy than I am.  I am all for giving local authorities far more powers and I am not going to have it thrown at me by any other Senator that I supported an amendment which would in any way curtail local democracy. I do not know whether the Minister of State is or ever was a member of a local authority but I am and have been for 16 years.  I know the utter frustration which I have had to deal with, and I am sure that other Senators who are members of local authorities, will have experienced this too.  I know what will happen.  As sure as we are here today, what will happen, if this legislation goes through as it is, when I or some other member of Dublin City Council urge, beg, entreat, ballyrag the city manager and his officials to take action against some derelict site or derelict building&mdash;let us say 29, Clare Street &mdash; the answer will be, &ldquo;We cannot do that.  We would like to do it but we cannot do it because that owner is putting together a site for development&rdquo;.  If pressed a bit harder, they will produce this Bill and say that under section 14 local authorities must allow bona fide site assembly and therefore they cannot do anything, and we will be right back where we are.  We will not be one step better off than prior to this legislation.</P>
    <P>I apologise if I am getting a bit worked up about this but I have had to sit for 16 years listening to officials &mdash; not the democratically elected members &mdash; but the officials, I am sorry to say I do not blame some of them.  They are as frustreated as everybody else about the whole thing and they take the easy way out. Perhaps it costs money.  They are looking for an escape route and here they have it, a perfect escape route.  They say to themselves; &ldquo;We cannot do anything.  We will not do anything.  It is wasting our time and public moneys to take action here because the developer will simply answer back to us that the Minister said local authorities must allow bona fide assembly.&rdquo;  A man could own 20 houses in a derelict condition and he could <Col N="254" /> simply say, &ldquo;I am putting these together&rdquo;.  It is bona fide site assembly and he is off the hook and there is nothing more than can be done.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell me how he can be happy with the Bill.  He may have been happy with the Bill until the Minister, Deputy Flynn, came in here and said that.  He cannot take it back. Perhaps in the light of what has now come to his notice the Minister would reconsider this amendment.  If he can tell me one bit of harm this amendment could produce I will certainly reconsider my support for the amendment and, if not, I would ask him to reconsider his support.</P>

      <P>I want to explain a few things and I want to allow for the fact that Senator Hederman has not been long in the House and she may not understand Bills too well.  I am sorry I have to say that.  For over 20 years I have been a member of a local authority and I know all about it.  Senator Howard hit the nail on the head when he said that under this Bill local authorities are now to get a say but do the Members only want the nice things?  We cannot have our loaf and eat it.  We are talking about the definition of urban land.  This applies to all derelict sites in urban areas subject to certain stated exemptions.  Site assembly for property redevelopment is not one of these exemptions.  Therefore, the definition clearly extends to sites under assembly.  There is no need, from a legal point of view, to make any further provision in this section to cover site assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care where the site assembly is, let it be Clare Street or Mountjoy Square or on the quays or in Roscommon town, with all due respect to Senator Naughten, I do not mind, or in Ennis for Senator Howard, or in Limerick for Senator Jackman, or in Cork.  It does not matter.  The local authority will have powers under this Bill.  I do not think the Senator really understands what I am saying.  I, or anyone else in my position, can make a Second Reading speech, <Col N="255" /> giving a broad outline of a Bill, but it is the Bill as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas that becomes law.  We must remember that.  It is not the speech of the Minister of the day or my speech or anyone else's speech that counts.  I hope the Senator understands what I am saying.  I am finding it hard to get through to Senators on this issue.  I want to enlighten them because I have been a long time on a local authority.  I would not like to be partisan or anything like that.  I would like to treat all the country equally.  I have a great knowledge of the Dublin area since my early days, going to Croke Park and playing there.  We are attempting, not alone in the Bill before us today but in a Bill we will be bringing in, to ensure that the local authority will have the teeth to do it.  But how many times, in the Dublin area and in other areas, will you receive representations from somebody who is carrying out undesirable development saying: &ldquo;Go easy on me&rdquo;?  We have seen it many times.  As far as I am concerned, this Bill is here to clean up the Dublin area and all the country as well.  Senator Howard put his finger on it and I compliment him for it.  He said that the local authorities were getting powers for which they were crying out.</P>

I have seen them in both Houses of the Oireachtas too.  I am satisfied, I have a good knowledge of legislation and a good knowledge of the interpretation of this Bill.  You can switch words any way you like but it is the Bill passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann that will be law, not the Minister's speech or my speech.  Far be it from me to dictate to the Chair and I want to be as helpful as possible but this discussion would be more relevant under section 25 of the Bill.  I want to make it very clear that I am not accepting the amendment.  The <Col N="256" /> situation is clear as far as I am concerned. In my view, in the view of the parliamentary draftsman and in the view of the Attorney General's office it will be good. In my opinion it is going to be excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has trenchantly expressed his views on this and that is to be welcomed.  He made the point that what will come out of the Oireachtas is not anybody's opinion but the actual words that are written down in the Bill. That is really what we are at here.  This is an area which in the past has been exploited to an appalling degree to the detriment particularly of the capital city. Loopholes in previous legislation allowed property speculation.  Property development would be the nice marketable umbrella it would go under but it is, in fact, property speculation.  This has happened on a very widespread basis particularly in this capital city and I think Senator Hederman is correct in saying we have a particular responsibility to Dublin because it is the national capital.  As Senator Howard said, it is not the only part of the country and we have a lot of other cities and towns throughout the country where there is also a very considerable degree of dereliction.  We must take that on board.  The Minister must remember that what we are trying to do here is to close off what we perceive to have been loopholes in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to redevelopment and property that is under assembly at the present time.  I am not sure what he means.  Is he talking about property that is under assembly at the moment or property that will be under assembly in the future and what do we mean by redevelopment as distinct from development? The Bill only refers to development of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the section gives power to the local authority.  That is extremely important but what we need to know is what is bona fide property development. This can go on for a period of five years. All somebody has to do is to pay the basic levy of 3 per cent starting off and then they have the period of five years for accumulation of a derelict site.  If sites <Col N="257" /> are derelict for that period of time, how do you satisfy the local authority that it is a bona fide property development?  Will that be spelled out?  Is it the case here, as Senator Hederman said, that you are letting the local authorities off the hook? I would not quite put it like that but I feel that the local authority would be put under undue pressure.  Certainly the remarks made by the Minister, Deputy Flynn, would suggest that the property developers are being given the nod that this Bill is not all it appears on the surface. That is where the big concern is &mdash; what is being said by the Minister and what our experience in the past has been in relation to property development.  There have been very fine bona fide statements from the people concerned but they are not into property development for the good of this capital city, as we have seen from a lot of the development that has taken place.  Property developers are in the business for profit.  That is the type of loophole the Senators on this side are attempting to close off.</P>
    <P>May I also refer to a previous point I made and I do not think the Minister answered it in his comprehensive reply. He said the amendment should properly be made to section 25 but section 25 does not put any obligation on the local authority which is also an accumulator of property for redevelopment and for development purposes.  Are we to understand that the Minister would be willing to accept an amendment to section 25 to the effect that the derelict sites levy would apply to the local authority as well when it was in the business of accumulating property for the purpose of development whether it is road development, a construction of one description or another, and that the maximum period of five years would be imposed?</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on that other great body that causes derelict sites, namely the local authority in this city. We have experience of this and we know that it has been happening.  If the Minister would look again at the section where that amendment was to be inserted, he will notice the exemption it seems to give to the local authority.  It provides that <Col N="258" /> urban land means a derelict site in an urban area which has been entered on the register but does not include any occupied dwelling or land owned by a State authority or by a local authority within its own functional area.  That seems to me to be a clear exemption in relation to what we would regard as proper statutory obligations on the local authority.  The local authority will have to be satisfied in relation to any individual property developer but there is no obligation on the local authority itself to account for its conduct.  Is the Minister now saying he would regard section 25 as an appropriate place, where the tenor of the amendment by Senators Norris and Ross, and ably supported by Senator Hederman, could be introduced?  If the Minister was prepared to give a commitment in relation to that we could, no doubt, have a reasonably conciliatory conclusion to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that my colleague Senator Hederman also wishes to speak and I would regret if the debate were to be closed off at this point because I want to refer to a couple of points, and in particular one raised by Senator Howard which seems to have fairly general acclaim.  I refer to the question of <Col N="259" /> the powers and responsibility of local authorities.  I certainly believe in democracy and the powers that are appropriate to a local authority.  I have the greatest respect for elected members of local authorities, be they in Dublin or throughout the provinces, but I would remind Senator Howard, for whose opinion I have the highest estimation, of a judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Webb and another <i>v.</i> the Attorney General and the State of Ireland where, for example, the finding of the Derrynaflan hoard was determined to be of such national importance that the rights of the people to their heritage superseded all other rights, including the right of the ownership of property.  If the Supreme Court can hold the view that there are certain views accruing to the heritage of all the people I do not think anybody could suggest it was an insult to local authorities to say that if there are buildings that are on list No. 1, that they are regarded as part of our national heritage, that national interests should supersede the motorway schemes of a local council or corporation.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to place that on the record.  I have no doubt that Senator Howard, when he reflects upon it in the light of this judgment, and surely we must in this House pay some deference to decisions of the Supreme Court, may very well find he is able to come around and agree with this point.  I am also very reluctant to criticise local authorities but there are occasions when I must.  The Minister, as he has told the House, has had a great deal of experience of local authorities and of people coming and going and coming and going in both Houses.  I hope he would not wish me to go but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I know the Minister could not possible aspire to independence. The Minister, in the light of his very wide knowledge of local authorities, must have some experience, for example <Col N="260" /> of section 4 planning permissions, a subject on which I have had occasion to address the General Council of County Councils in Ballybunion some time ago. It is a directly analogous thing because it illustrates how particular interests are capable of abusing the procedures in the interests of certain specific developments and upsetting the function.  There is no guarantee against such behaviour in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, too, that I echo what Senator Costello said that if the Minister were prepared to contemplate the insertion of this amendment in section 25, since he says it is more appropriate, I will certainly then be happy to agree in order to allow him time to consider the arguments, because he is a fair and reasonable man.  If I can have an undertaking, since we probably will not finish this Bill today, we may not get to section 25 or if I could be given some guidance that we may table this amendment for section 25, I will give an undertaking that there will not be a filibuster at that point and then I will withdraw it at this time.</P>
      <P>I would like, finally, to support what Senator Costello said about some material that occurs in very close conjunction to this disputed area and that is the following sentence in the Bill:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Urban land&rdquo; means a derelict site in an urban area which has been entered on the register but does not include any occupied dwelling or land owned by a State authority or by the local authority in whose functional area the land is situate or land in relation to which &mdash; (a) a compulsory purchase order (other than a vesting order under this Act) has become operative, or (b) a development objective exists for the purpose of reserving the land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to have the opportunity to move an amendment to delete all that because it specifically provides for the kind of <Col N="261" /> local authority development that is inimical to the heritage of this country and again I place on the record the judgment in the case of Webb where the Supreme Court held that there were certain objects of such national value that their preservation took precedence over the right of property.</P>

      <P>I do not like interfering in the debate but I think one amendment has been ruled out of order and it cannot be taken.  I think it is amendment No. 3.  You have been notified it is out of order and therefore cannot be discussed.  At the moment you are speaking to that.</P>

      <P>I am rather confused as to which one it is.  I am extremely grateful to you.  In that case, this represents my only opportunity to draw the Minister's attention to it and ask for a ruling on it. This amendment has been ruled out of order and I have not received notice of this so I am, technically, not in breach.  I have not received notice of this because it puts an additional potential charge on the revenue.  I cannot understand how the deletion of a phrase from a Bill can add anything.  How can subtraction equal addition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will just, if I may, sum up my objections because I indicated that I thought the Bill was defective.  That is the context within which I place these objections, that apparently we have got exemptions about one of which we are apparently not entitled to do anything under the wonderful rules of democracy and the Minister will not accept our arguments on the other, and it is not tendentious, we really do not wish to be difficult and, may I say the Minister, although he is a most genial and good natured person, really is almost suggesting we are rather stupid over here. If he is, I wonder if he realises that the implication of that is that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is also stupid because he appears to have contemplated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will.  I do not want to be tedious.  I understand Senator Hederman has points in answer to matters that were raised.  My final point is that it was clear that the Minister in making this reference had a situation in mind which bears very directly on the amendment that I have placed on the Order Paper.  I am not at all impugning the intelligence or motivation of the Minister; in fact, I am greateful to him.  But, in the light of all that has been said and in the light of the very strong feelings of every single person who has spoken and who has experience of the Dublin situation, would the Minister not really just do the decent thing and accept the amendment?  It does not damage his intention in the Bill.  It is not going to have any perceivable negative effect and even accepting that I may not have understood the sophistication of his argument, it will appease me.  It would really hearten those people who have fought over decades to preserve the inner cities &mdash; our heritage.  It would be a legislative support for the judgment of the Supreme Court. All the Minister is saying is that it is not necessary.  He may be right that it is not necessary legally, but it is obviously necessary to quell, calm and dispel the fears of this side of the House.  Could he not find it in his heart simply to give us that little bit of leeway?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House accepts that both Senator Norris and I and all the other speakers on this side of the House are genuinely and sincerely concerned about the great heritage of this country, of the capital city, of other cities, of places like Ennis or of any town or village.  I am not indulging in this exercise for any other reason than in the hope that the Minister, his advisers and Members on the other side of the House will concede the point and, as Senator Norris says so eloquently, will realise that perhaps this could add some little advantage to <Col N="264" /> the Bill and that we do have serious concerns and reservations.</P>
      <P>I believe we are making progress and I believe the Minister is probably coming round to accept this because, I do not want to misrepresent the Minister but I think he said that perhaps this would be more suitable under section 25.  This would lead me to believe that basically we are probably right but that we have it in the wrong place.  I would like the Minister to indicate if that is the position, that he basically agrees with us but he wants it done under section 25.</P>

      <P>I just want to put the Senator's mind at ease.  What I said was that section 25 was more relevant and, being a helpful individual, I agreed to allow elaboration in section 25.  What the Senators are talking about now can be dealt with under that.  I did not give any undertaking.  What I said was that we could debate that more appropriately under section 25.  I want to put it clearly. There is no humming and hawing about me.  You know where you stand with me. With due respect, I am satisfied with the wording in the Bill and I see no need to insert Senator Norris's new wording.  We have spent an hour and a quarter debating this point, and it is only right that we should debate it in detail.  It is more practical that we should discuss it under section 25 but I am not giving any undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to the Minister that I appreciate the attention he has given.  Indeed, if all Ministers gave as much attention to the contributions of the Senators this would be a very happy place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Members on the Fianna Fáil benches who have been here and who have listened to the debate so far.  I am a newcomer to this House and I am <Col N="265" /> not so experienced with regard to legislation, drafting and so on.  I am extremely indebted to my colleague, Senator Norris, because he put down these amendments which I might not have been able to do.  I know what the Minister said is true, but it is what is in the Bill when it is signed by the President that is important. The loophole was drawn to my attention by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, when he came into this House.</P>
    <P>There is probably no Bill that will come before this House for a long time which will be of such personal interest to me as this Bill.  I combed through it and I did not advert to this loophole.  However, when the Minister, Deputy Flynn, came in and eloquently spoke of the special arrangements that would be operated at the discretion of the local authority for bona fide site assembly, that was the moment I realised we were in trouble and that members of the local authorities were going to be in trouble.  It is because I believe in local democracy and because I am committed to the members of local authorities &mdash; many Senators, Senator Honan, myself and others, are members of local authorities &mdash; that I want the local authorities to have the power, if they want it, to take effective action against derelict sites.  It is not because I want to take the power from a local authority or to circumscribe their area of manoeuvrability.</P>
    <P>I am convinced now by the explanation given by the Minister, Deputy Flynn, in his opening remarks that if this amendment does not go in the members of a local authority who want to take solid, strong action about dereliction in their area will find that their powers will be lessened by this.  I am not going to have any Senator trying to intimidate me by suggesting that I want to curtail the powers of local authorities.  Far be it, but I will speak about that on another day. As a member of a local authority I know the problems.  I have 16 years' experience and I do not want to have another 16 years' experience &mdash; if God is good to me and my voters re-elect me &mdash; and find <Col N="266" /> that when this Bill is enacted into legislation and when members of my local authority or any other members of a local authority want to get their officials to take action about derelict sites in their areas &mdash; something like 29, Clare Street or others that have been mentioned &mdash; we are hamstrung unwittingly by this Bill. I accept the Minister's bona fides.  He is quite happy but through an oversight this section was not tightened up and was allowed to slip through.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one reference to something the Minister said earlier.  He paid fulsome compliments and praiseworthy tributes to Dublin Corporation for what they were doing in regard to the assembly of sites in the designated areas. He complimented them and patted them on the back for the very good work they were doing in assembling these sites.  I would like to thank the Minister for those words of praise, none of which referred to me personally but referred to our officials.  But I want to ask; who created the dereliction in the first place?  Why is there all this dereliction?  Why did the Government have to bring in extremely attractive tax incentives to deal with the designated areas in Dublin, Limerick and other cities?  Precisely because dereliction was allowed to develop in these places.</P>
    <P>I have heard Minister Flynn speak about this in other places.  The Minister is on the record castigating local authorities for their lack of commitment to cleaning up the derelict sites in their areas.  I am saying to the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and to Minister Connolly, who has just left, that if they want local authorities to be effective and to take action with regard to dereliction &mdash; and I want that as well &mdash; they must give us pretty well watertight powers and they must not allow these loopholes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I draw the attention of the Senator to the amendment? It seems obvious to me that the Senator has strayed from the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I did not intend to stray.  I was really replying to <Col N="267" /> comments made by the Minister.  So to that extent I may have strayed off it inadvertently and I will therefore come back specifically to the amendment.  The Minister said to us that he was happy with the Bill.  He kept repeating that he was happy with this Bill as it stood and that there was no need for the amendment. He referred to the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman and others whose wisdom in this was much greater than ours.  I do not intend to be intimidated by any references to Attorneys General, parliamentary draftsmen or anybody else.  They may not have the experience that Members of this House have of trying to take effective action on foot of legislation which brilliant parliamentary draftsmen draw up.  I am sure they spend months and years brooding over it, but the reality of the situation is that we are the footsoldiers.  In the final analysis, we are the people &mdash; members of local authorities &mdash; who have to try to put effective measures into operation.</P>
      <P>That is why I would appeal, beg and beseech them to give us the powers we want and I appeal to the Members on the Fianna Fáil benches.  I do not know how many are members of local authorities.  I know that Senator Honan has been a very illustrous member down in Ennis.  I am also concerned about Ennis.  There was a very fine mill wheel in Ennis.  I used to go out of my way to pass through Ennis to see this beautiful mill wheel.  One day I arrived in Ennis and, lo and behold, it was gone.  It had vanished without trace. I had enough interest in Ennis &mdash; I am not exclusively concerned about Dublin &mdash;to find out what had happened.  I discovered that the local authority in Ennis had given permission for its demolition. I looked up the papers to see which members of the local authority had voted for it and who had voted against it.  I am not going to mention here who voted either way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish up now. It does seem to me that the Minister has left a little chink of light, a little area of hope.  We need not go out in total despair because what the Minister seems to have said to us &mdash; and I am not going to misinterpret him; I know it is on the record quite clearly &mdash; is that perhaps this amendment would be more pertinent, suitable and relevant to section 25.  I understand that he has given no commitment. He has given no undertakings, no indication that he intends to or will reconsider it.  But at least he has left open, as I see it, the opportunity for everybody here to go away, because I do not imagine we will reach section 25 tonight, and that calmly, out of this Chamber, they can consider the points made here that they may, when we reach section 25, be prepared to come back and allow some amendment similar to this one which would be suitable under section 25 and which would have the same objective as Senator Norris had when he put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much appreciate the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have stuck it out this afternoon since we started this. I would like to say to them and to the new Minister who has arrived, Deputy Gallagher, that I have contributed to this debate, not out of any anxiety to cause any argy-bargy but quite simply because, like other speakers here, I care and I care desperately about the heritage of this country.  I see it being eroded, unfortunately, sometimes by unscrupulous, developers who have no interest whatsoever and who, as my colleague, Senator Costello, said a moment ago, are simply motivated by pure profit and do not care about our heritage.  I would say to the Minister that we should remember the debate here on tourism not very long ago and be aware of the contribution which these fine buildings, built and worked on by Irish craftsmen down through the years, can make.  We should give local authorities every possible help in carrying <Col N="269" /> out the obvious intention of the Department, of the Minister and of the Government in introducing this.  That is the only reason why I am here this afternoon.  I do appreciate the attention of the Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say, before we go any further, that there has been a tremendous amount of time allowed on this for Senators to put forward their arguments?  If one has regard to the amount of time spent on it, it is obvious that a discussion is developing on the Bill generally rather than on the amendment. I do not want to stifle any debate but it is at that point now.  There was an appeal earlier by one Member and I have allowed the debate run on half an hour beyond that.</P>

      <P>Looking at this Bill, as a member of a local authority I am as interested in the heritage of the city and country as anyone else, lest there be an impression that some people are more interested than others.  Section 2 is the definition and interpretation section. If Senator Norris and Ross withdraw this amendment, it will in no way prejudice the situation.  I will just repeat what the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly said.  He is not suggesting that he would accept the amendment on section 25, but what I am suggesting is that it will in no way prejudice section 25 if they allow the amendment to be withdrawn.

      <P>All of the remarks I have made have been, I hope, pertinent; they were intended as such.  I do not think there has been any intention on this side of the House to be obstructive.  The two Independent Senators, Senators Norris and Hederman, have a long track record of concern and experience in dealing with this matter and in dealing with the whole area of dereliction in the city of Dublin. There are not two more experienced people in the city of Dublin in relation to this matter.  So, instead of curtailing a discussion on an extremely important matter, it is important that we tease out the full implications.  We should be very thankful that we have people who have not just talked about these thngs but who have actually worked on the ground in relation to improving the heritage of the city and in relation to improving the whole area of dereliction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The longer we go on and the more I hear the arguments to and fro &mdash; I acknowledge the Minister has come in here with the best of intentions &mdash; the more important this amendment becomes.  It is an amendment that goes to the heart of what we are trying to do.  It states that the definition would specifically include sites assembled for the purpose of property development. That is at the core of what has been happening to this capital city of Ireland and that is why it is so important.  If we can be satisfied that it is covered in some other way, that an amendment or a further amendment of the spirit of this amendment would be allowed to be inserted, we would be quite satisfied with that.  We have not been given that commitment so far.  Perhaps the Minister will tighten up the remarks that he made <Col N="271" /> there, firm them up, so that we could make some progress here.</P>
    <P>When I look at this amendment and at section 25, and I look again at the rest of section 2 with the sections that are being deleted in relation to amendment No. 3 &mdash;I am merely referring to this; I am not going into a debate on it &mdash; I see that this amendment is all the more important because it specifically exempts the entire area of State authority and of the local authority in whose functional area the land is situated.  Where land is acquired by compulsory purchase order, where the development objective is for the purpose of reserving the land for roads or parking places &mdash; parking places, mind you &mdash; or any other purposes, the entire local authority and State authority is exempt from the definition of derelict sites. Therefore, you have a situation where a local authority or State authority can accumulate derelict sites without any penalty being imposed.  We have been told that is going to be deleted.  In my opinion, we have not been given a satisfactory reason other than that it would be an extra cost.</P>
    <P>The entire Bill is intended to deal with a situation where not just the beauty of our city has been blighted but millions of pounds worth of fine architectural heritage has been blighted.  I am not satisfied with a simple blanket statement of cost. What it means in practice is that there is a whole area exempt from being treated with the definition of dereliction and that all the more emphasises the need for a specific amendment in the terms that are included here, an amendment which will incorporate both the responsibilities of the public authorities and of the private developer.  That really underlines the importance of this amendment.  As we go on, it seems to be more and more important, and the arguments that have been adduced here by my distinguished colleagues from the Independent benches are arguments that are adduced from experience, not from theory.  I think that is all the more reason we would be very anxious for the Minister to take them on board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> The Minister said he felt that to some degree the amendment would be more appropriate to section 25.  When one looks at the entirety of section 2 it is difficult to see that it is.  If amendment No. 3 is going to be deleted <i>in toto</i>, it takes a lot from the intention of amendments Nos. 2 and 3, which is to tighten up the loopholes so that nobody, either a corporate body or a private individual, through property development, is able to cause dereliction in this city.  As I said at the outset, this is at the core of this Bill; this is at the heart of the matter.  We must be able to get legislation that effectively covers the areas that are at present causing dereliction in this city; and there is no greater area of dereliction being caused other than through the accumulation of property for development purposes as it is put or, as I would say in many cases, the accumulation of property for speculative purposes, with a view to profit rather than to improving the heritage of the city and, indeed, of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not address it in his remarks the last time round, but I referred specifically to a local authority or a statutory body.  We saw where a local authority is covered to a degree in section 25, where the local authority deals with an owner of urban land who is seeking to carry out a scheme of property development and where the local authority must be satisfied.  I am not satisfied there are sufficient criteria to determine whether that is adequate because it will allow property to be accumulated over a period of five years with fairly small penalties being imposed.  However, could the Minister address the point as to whether, not just the local authority is to be satisfied on the matter, but what is going to happen about the local authority itself.  Who is going to be satisfied in relation to the local authority?</P>
    <P>It has been said here again and again that the local authority has in many instances been one of the worst accumulators of property and has allowed that property to fall into dereliction.  Are we going to have the same terms applied to the local authority?  Is the local authority going to be allowed to hoard land for <Col N="273" /> whatever purpose for a period of five years and to hoard it in a derelict condition for that period?  Is the local authority going to be subjected to any penalties for the duration of that time? Who is going to be satisfied that the local authority has done so for a valid reason? We have seen the local authority in this city and elsewhere come up with a multitude of plans and proposals.  For example, if I may be allowed to exemplify the point, we have a major plan for an eastern by-pass to cover the city from Swords through to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the amendment. I am pointing out to the Minister an area which is covered by this amendment but does not seem to be covered under section 25 and which section 25 does not seem to deal with.  Can the Minister tell us how we are going to be satisfied that it is a bona fide scheme that the local authority is going to put together, because we know from experience, local authorities have put together schemes that they have subsequently jettisoned? The eastern by-pass has been with us for the past 20 years and nothing has taken place in terms of its actual fulfilment.  Is property going to be compulsorily purchased under this new scheme?  That is what I want the Minister to address himself to, so that we will at least know that section 25 will be allowed to be subject to amendments to extend the coverage of somebody looking for a scheme of property development to the local authorities and the State authorities as well as the private developers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two queries on section 2.  On page 5, line 10 it states: &ldquo;the Minister means the Minister for the Environment&rdquo;.  It then states: &ldquo;occupier in relation to land, includes any person in or entitled to immediate use and enjoyment of the land, any person entitled to occupy the land and any other person having, for the time being, control of the land&rdquo;.  It is quite possible that all three people could be separate individuals in contention for the same piece of land at the same time.  There is a presumption on reading the section that we are talking about one person right through but we are not.  There could be three separate individuals filling the three different descriptions that are there, each of whom would be in contention.  How do you distinguish who the occupier is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator knows, we deal with all land equally.  There is always an owner.  There will be no problem, for instance, in serving notice on an owner and it will be served on one person. All land is included and all interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Later on in the Bill &mdash; I am simply referring in general terms &mdash; exceptional care has been taken to deal with a situation where it will not be possible to identify ownership, where confiscation becomes a reality.  I am trying <Col N="277" /> to define here the three categories of people referred to.  There is a presumption that the Minister is dealing with one individual there while in reality it could equally fit the description of three separate individuals in contention for the same piece of ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be so kind as to clarify a matter of parlance towards the end of section 2?  I am extremely concerned about something which I fully accept it is not, apparently, possible to amend, that is the question of the definition of &ldquo;urban land&rdquo;.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;urban land&rdquo; means a derelict site in an urban area which, has been entered on the register but does not include any occupied dwelling or land owned by a State authority or by the local authority in whose functional area the land is situated or land in relation to which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a compulsive purchase order (other than a vesting order under this Act) has become operative or</P>
      <P>(b)  a development objective exists for the purpose of reserving the land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>I would like an explanation of this because I accept that as the current procedures are this, apparently, cannot be deleted.  Deletion would appear to be a fairly simple method of dealing with it but apparently it is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the fact it is not possible could the Minister kindly explain to me the intention behind it, because urban land in common parlance quite clearly includes all these things.  The reason why a very specific legal import is given is in order to alter the meaning of plain English.  I would like to know why there is the necessity to exempt local authorities, State authorities and so on, from the operation of this Bill.  It seems to be a <Col N="278" /> most extraordinary procedure, I would like to have the opportunity to come back on this and tease out the reason for this particular definition.  I am addressing the whole section very directly.  This is a cardinal point of the section.  The section means nonsense if we do not understand this definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Senator Howard's point about &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; there are a number of different elements in the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  First, it includes any person in or entitled to immediate use and enjoyment of the land.  This concept is based on rating law and the occupier in this instance would be broadly equivalent to the rates occupier for rating and valuation purposes.  Secondly, the concept of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; includes any person entitled to occupy the land, depending on the circumstances.  This could refer to a lawful owner, a lessee or any other tenant lawfully entitled to occupation.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; includes any person for the time being having control of a premises.  In addition to the types of occupation already mentioned, this concept could extend even to non-lawful instances of occupation, for instance by trespassers or their invitees.  The second and third elements of the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; drawn from corresponding definitions from the Litter Act, 1982 and the Air Pollution Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 32, which we will discuss later, provides a procedure whereby a person served with a notice may apply to the District Court to resolve any problems caused where a person refuses him consent to carry out measures required of him under the Act.  He may also, under that section, recover any cost to which he is entitled.  This is my knowledge of it in many places throughout the country, especially in my own constituency.  Some of these lands or property are unoccupied maybe for years but remember if an individual goes in there, I can assure him he will not be in a hot hour.  I know all about it.  I will use a slang expression, they will come out of the woodwork very quickly then.  The matter I have referred <Col N="279" /> to will deal adequately with that.  I know Senator Howard's concern in regard to this matter but the local authorities will have power to deal with that.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Senator Norris. Urban land is land to which the derelict sites levy will apply.  It means a derelict site in an urban area which has been entered on the register subject to a number of exceptions.  The first exclusion is for occupied dwellings.  I appreciate that there can be arguments against this exclusion.  My view &mdash; it was the Minister's view on this and it was not challenged in the Dáil &mdash; is that the imposition of the levy in these instances could have problematic housing consequences.  For instance, for tenants to whom landlords might pass on the levy.</P>
    <P>The second exclusion from the levy is State property and property owned by the levying local authority.  The reason for this exclusion is the practical one of preventing pointless circular transfers of public finances.  The levy would, of course, apply to semi-State property or to a property of a local authority other than the levying authority.  Finally, the definition of urban land excludes land affected by a CPO or a planning reservation. Landowners in these instances will be under the same obligation as everybody else to keep their property from becoming derelict.  However, it would seem unjust to subject them to the levy when their rights to re-develop their properties have been openly curtailed by the local authority in pursuit of some intended public purpose.  I hope I have given Senators a detailed explanation.  If I went on a bit Senators will please bear with me because I wanted to be helpful to both Senators in these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, indeed, been extremely helpful and I am grateful to him.  I do not want to be tedious; I would like to be helpful in return and explain my difficulties with this entire section of the Bill.  The Minister's definition with regard to the question of occupied buildings is very loose.  Precisely <Col N="280" /> what constitutes occupation?  Is it occupation for residential purposes or is it occupation for the purposes of conducting a business, for example?  Does it have to be legitimate?  I will give an example and I would like the Minister and his advisers to consider it.</P>
      <P>Not very far from where I live there is a listed building which is occupied.  It is occupied on one floor by a legitimate business that does not have a legal tenancy and on another floor it is occupied by a brothel.  I wonder if the Minister is securing the rights of brothel owners in this very loose and vague definition? Could the Minister not tell me that as somebody living in this vicinity I have a right to have my property rights vindicated at the expense of the proprietor of a brothel?  That is my first question: what kind of occupation, because the definition is very, very vague.  I do not see why the rights of somebody in the line of business I have indicated should be upheld at the expense of the historic value of a house that is going derelict because of this kind of occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point was about this business of housing.  It seems to me the Minister is talking about very problematic housing indeed.  Surely he will accept that there is a responsibility on the State, which has been traditionally understood, that people should be in reasonable housing.  If I understand him correctly &mdash; and perhaps I do not understand him correctly &mdash; he is reluctant to move against people who are occupying houses that are totally unfit for human habitation because this might displace them onto the local authorities.  What does that say about the conscience of our Government? Should they not be displaced?  I believe they should and I think the local authorities, about whose wonderful virtues we have heard consistently throughout the afternoon, should accept this responsibility.  Are the members of local authorities present in this Chamber this afternoon pleased or flattered to be told, as I understand it, but perhaps again I am wrong, that we cannot disturb these people from dreadful conditions because <Col N="281" /> it would create a charge on the local authority?  That may be what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very direct and most helpful when he explained why this section had to stand without alteration because he said it might put a charge on the levy, and he then said &ldquo;circular funds&rdquo;.  As I understand it &mdash; and I am a most simple man &mdash; circular funds are those that go round and round and round, and I do not see in that notion any diminution. Where precisely in a circular fund, a revolving fund, is the diminution? It may be rather tedious for a local authority to have every so often to pay a fine to itself, but it is not going to cost them anything and should they not pay a fine? Suppose local authorities are in gross dereliction of their duty; should they not be publicly exposed by being fined, especially when this does not cost anything? The Minister has used the word &ldquo;circular&rdquo;. Fine, I accept that.  He also spoke of &ldquo;circular transfers&rdquo;.  When the Minister speaks of expense, is he thinking of the expense of the material upon which these fines are written and may I ask whether he is talking about the central Exchequer or local authorities?</P>
    <P>My final two points concern the question of the development objective of councils, reserving space for development, such as motorways and so on and that this should be an exempt function. Why?  May I point out, the Minister invoked the question once more of property rights.  The Minister may be aware of what the situation actually is with regard to motorways and how these things operate but perhaps he is not and may I place on the record exactly how this operates in areas like, for example, Clanbrassil Street, where precisely this kind of thing has been in operation, which is why I am so absolutely determined against this section.</P>
    <P>What happens is that a local authority will slap a CPO on a building in a strategic position and, quite deliberately, will allow it to go derelict.  That then has a multiplier effect upon all the surrounding property.  The local authority goes in five or ten years later and acquires the rest of the property at about 25 per cent of the <Col N="282" /> market value because by their action they have destroyed the financial base of the property values of the people involved. That is why I am against this section.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party were traditionally the party of the plain people of Ireland.  I use that phrase with no sense of irony; I respect them for it, I believe at one stage they were and I think they safeguarded the rights of ordinary, decent little people and their small houses and their small shops.  I see some distinguished Members of the front bench nodding.  I hope that perhaps I have exposed an area where there is a contradiction that must be painful to the decent core of Fianna Fáil.  I would like the Minister, perhaps with the advice of his professional advisers, to direct his mind to the property rights of those who frequently have been affected, in the cities of Dublin, Waterford and Kilkenny.  I do not know so much about the other cities.  In Dublin the Minister has only got to go to Clanbrassil Street and I am sure many other Members in a non-partisan way will have to agree with the truth of what I say.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will consider that series of points.  I will list them again: There is the question of occupied buildings.  What does this mean?  What kind of occupation is being protected here and why?  There is the question of problematic housing.  Is it appropriate that we should be afraid to dispossess people, to place them as a responsibility of the local authorities to provide decent houses for them?  There is the question of circular funding and how this can create a charge on the Exchequer.  Then there is the question of the property rights of those along the line of a motorway.</P>
    <P>This legislation, as it exists now, makes a total, complete and utter mockery of the attempts of local authorities themselves to list buildings.  You will find that one section of a local authority will go to the trouble of creating lists and those lists have no statutory effect in law.  They have some repercussions because the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, was gracious enough to accept in a budget a few years ago three pages of my amendments <Col N="283" /> giving specific rights in tax terms to a very limited number of people who restored part of our heritage in the inner cities and so on, and these could be triggered by being list one buildings and so on.  It has that impact but it has no statutory enforceable rights, so that you could have a situation where the local authority decide to put a CPO on a whole string of buildings with two, three or four listed buildings right in the middle and decide to drive a motorway through them.</P>
    <P>May I give a hypothetical case?  Dublin Corporation decide there is an increasing volume of traffic between St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  Right in the way stands a building associated with the Ascendancy, called Leinster House. They CPO it and decide to demolish.  I have received <i>sotto voce</i> advice, that my example may be bad; Senator Hederman has whispered to me that she does not think it is possible to CPO a Government building.  That may be true.  In that case, let me say that my example was perhaps a little bit extreme but there could be the situation if you use something like Trinity College.  Here, again, I come to the Webb judgment in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court of this land &mdash; this is my final point &mdash; has decided that there are certain artefacts which are so important and valuable as part of our heritage that the necessity of retaining and cherishing them in the interests of the entire people is so powerful that it overrides all kinds of property rights.  That does not seem to be addressed in this Bill.  Those are five or six points that I would be most grateful if the Minister could address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>If a structure is occupied for a purpose other than that of a dwelling, then it will be subject to the levy.  If a structure, whether a dwelling or not, is unoccupied, then it will also be subject to the levy.  That is very fair.  I do not want to get into the terminology of occupation. The usual procedures apply to a building that is occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris felt that local authorities should have to pay the derelict sites levy so that their failure to comply <Col N="284" /> would be exposed.  What would local authorities be doing in that case only transferring the money out of one fund into another?  The Senator may be underestimating the intelligence of local authority members.  In this Bill, as Senator Howard pointed out, very good powers are being given to local authority members.  I would not dare to instruct the members of local authorities.  There are very competent persons here who have been a long time on local authorities and who understand the position extremely well.</P>

      <P>Sorry, Acting Chairman, for that good humoured interruption. There is a statutory definition in the Bill of &ldquo;listed building&rdquo;.  A listed building cannot be demolished unless with the permission of the authority and notice must be served.  Also, in respect of a listed building, if you want to carry out improvements you must comply with the Planning Act.  The Planning Bill at present going through the Dáil deals with that and there is a tightening up process in it.  That is to be welcomed also.</P>

    <P>Senator Norris, if I am correct in my interpretation of his remarks, seems to be <Col N="285" /> in favour of putting levies on all occupied buildings.  Even in the Dáil there was nobody in favour of that.  I do not think that is a runner.  The Senator may not mean it that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to get into the question of occupiers.  We use our own interpretation of that.  In my part of the country, being modest people, we comply accordingly.</P>
      <P>I hope I have explained what the position is.  The Dublin members of the corporation are very articulate and would be quick to bring any dereliction to the notice of the authorities.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains all the powers. Senator Howard hit the nail on the head when he said &ldquo;We are now getting some control to decide what we want to do&rdquo;. That was a good point.  I always admire a man or woman who puts up a good point.  As I see the situation, I do not see any need to include local authorities in this section.  I think Senator Costello understands what I am saying.  Senator Norris said in case of infringement they should be exposed.  There is an articulate public out there who will be able to show that up.  It is for all local authorities and individuals to get their house in order.  I am confident that all local authorities will respond when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the remarks Senator Norris made.  He mentioned many aspects that I had intended to bring up.  I will refer &mdash; and I will not labour them because of that &mdash; to one or two points.  Senator Howard referred to the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  He made some interesting points on that and the Minister of State explained how this definition operated, how it was intended to extend to trespassers and other unlawful occupiers and so on, which was quite illuminating.  The point I want to make in relation to that was that in that section the wording is: &ldquo; `occupier' in relation to land, includes any person in or <Col N="286" /> entitled...&rdquo; and so on.  While it is a fairly comprehensive definition it does not pretend to be all encompassing.  I do not know why the Minister will not consider the very reasonable amendment put forward by Seantor Naughten that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; should be dealt with in the same encompassing definition, namely, instead of &ldquo;means any building&rdquo; et cetera, &ldquo;structure should include&rdquo;.  In that way you ensure that anything not covered by the specific definition in the Bill will be covered by that type of catchall phrase.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second amendment and, indeed, the third one which was unfortunately not allowed, the points have been made fairly substantially and comprehensively.  Despite the Minister's assertion, I am not convinced by his arguments that a local authority or any State authority should be simply and absolutely exempt from the terms of this legislation and that is what the section is doing. I realise that the local authority is the registering authority and that it is being given powers here and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Howard and with the Minister but, I too, like Senator Norris, do not see the problem of the circular transfer of finance if the local authority or any State authority was obliged to be subject to a penalty for abuse of powers in relation to derelict sites.  We on this side of the House have given numerous examples where dereliction has been caused directly as a result of the activities of local authorities. It is suggested that we should know better, that we should not be impugning the good name of persons elected to local authorities.  That is not what we are doing.  We are talking about decisions that have been made, planning decisions, decisions that have been carried out over a period of time, that have led to dereliction, for whatever reason.  We are not impugning the good name of anybody but what we are saying is that there are specific exemptions of local authorities in this section that we know through experience should not be exempted.  It is as simple as that.  Whatever about the circular transfer of funds and where they go <Col N="287" /> to, it is important that the public have the opportunity to see that there is nobody and no body in the sense of corporate body, entitled to be responsible for dereliction.</P>
    <P>I still think that the amendments that were proposed to section 2 were admirable and I am disappointed they have been rejected.  The rejection of amendment No. 3 is a shame because it would have dealt with that whole area to which we and a number of people have referred where dereliction has taken place.  Consider, for example, the question of parking places where Dublin Corporation controls many derelict sites that are now turned into parking lots and they have been left like that for decades.  What pressure is there on the corporation, for example, to develop those sites?  That is hardly a way to have parking places throughout the city, areas where land has been taken over or where buildings have been demolished and they have been turned into temporary sites that remain that way for a long period of time.</P>
    <P>We have already referred to the roads and the number of plans that have been brought forward in relation to city road building, plans which have fallen by the wayside for one reason or another, compulsory purchase orders that have been imposed, land that has been acquired, buildings that are lying derelict and those plans have not been fulfilled.  It is important that we include those areas as well. While the Minister was at great pains to explain what he meant by &ldquo;occupied dwelling&rdquo;, I must still say I am not at all clear that that statement does not remove the obligation on the statutory body and the local authority to ensure that all occupied dwellings are in a fit condition.  That seems to be the effect of it.</P>
    <P>I am still very dissatisfied with section 2.  We contend that amendments could have been accepted that would have considerably improved this section and closed off the loophole in the present planning legislation in relation to dereliction in this city.  I am disappointed the Minister has not been prepared to take <Col N="288" /> on board the real concerns that have been expressed from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>The dereliction created by developers who are putting sites together for development and the dereliction caused by the local authority putting together sites for land accounts for the bulk of dereliction in this city.  What is left after that is only peanuts and it is not worth while bringing in a Bill to deal with it.  The main source of dereliction in this city and in every other city in Ireland are those two categories.  Yet, the Minister intends in this magnificant Bill, which he says he and his Department are happy with to exclude those two areas.  I know the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party and the Department are honourable people.  I ask the Minister, why should you tax a poor person with a small derelict site and slap penalties on him while excluding the big developer who is putting together a site and who may have very powerful influential friends?  In all honesty how can you say Fianna Fáil are the party of the small man?  I believe they were the party of the small man but this Bill proves they intend to penalise the small man.  They are going to slap penal taxes on him but the local authority can do what they like.  They can make massive road reservations in every development plan and you intend to let them and the big developer off scot-free.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government's totally unjustifiable cutback in the current level of Overseas Development Aid and calls on the Government:</P>
      <P>(i)  To take immediate steps to increase the level of Government aid to 0.25 per cent of GNP as it was in 1987 and to aim at a target of 0.27 per cent of GNP in the reasonable future.</P>
      <P>(ii)  To reconstitute the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid.</P>
      <P>(iii)  To establish an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to put this most important motion to the House this evening.  Personally, I would add that the 0.7 per cent UN target should be achieved by the year 2000, if practicable at all.  Secondly, we are calling on the Government to reconstitute the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid, either to stand alone or as a sub-group of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs or an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy.  I will not fall out with the Minister on the exact terminology we use there.  In relation to <Col N="290" /> an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs, I have on at least four, if not five, occasions in the last three or four months urged the Government to consider this request.  It is an all-party request, a request from all sides of the House, and as each day passes the need for such a group becomes more obvious.  You can look at any part of the world and look at the requests in debates.  You have only to go back to the whole issue of the UN situation in relation to the vote on Cambodia not so long ago, the discussions both in Dáil and in this Chamber, and the views expressed then.  I am glad that the Government changed their minds and rather than vote they abstained on that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the debate both in the Dáil and in the Seanad and I refer the Senator to all the speakers, to no one in particular.  The Senator did make an extremely good contribution but there were many contributions in that very important debate.  The point I am making is that a forum such as this or the Dáil, is not the ideal place to tease out Irish foreign policy.  We should not be firing bits and pieces of policy back and forward across Chambers and even scoring political points on occasions, which has happened, and I am not going to pretend I am lily white in relation to any of that.  It is the way we are structured in these Houses and it is the way these issues <Col N="291" /> get debated.  I feel this is most inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Week after week we come in here.  We want debates on the Middle East, on the issues in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Nicaragua and on US foreign policy.  Everyone can pick the issue they are fired about.  We should have an all-party forum where we can have an Irish policy hammered out and all go forward together representing abroad the Irish views on these different issues.  I do not think that needs further development.  I think it should be patently obvious that there is an all-party appeal to the Minister, and through him to the Cabinet, to concede on this most important issue.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid did wonderful work. There have been calls from inside this House and outside it, from the NGOs and from different organisations, to reconstitute this committee which did such good work.  There could either be a formal sub-committee of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs or an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy, or it could stand alone as its own joint committee.  It did wonderful work on its own previously, but we need a commitment from the Minister in relation to a foreign affairs committee and/or committee on development aid as a sub-committee of the foreign affairs committee.  I eagerly await the Minister's response to those points.</P>
      <P>If I may turn now to point No. (i) as the motion is tabled and that is the embarrassment, if you like, that is being caused to all of us in relation to our present level of overseas development aid.  Regardless of past records our present and proposed levels of overseas development aid have to be a major source of embarrassment to us all, regardless of our political affiliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when developing countries' debt repayments far exceed all the aid they are receiving, and at a time when 40,000 children still die unnecessarily per day, at a time when one-tenth of the world population, 500 million people, are still chronically hungry, we can only look <Col N="292" /> to ourselves and to our problems and say, &ldquo;Sorry we are going to slash what we give you in relation to overseas development aid.  Sorry, we cannot live up to the promises we made.&rdquo;  There is, to be fair, a litany of broken promises of consecutive Governments in this area.  This debate could be entitled &ldquo;a history of broken promises&rdquo;.  None of us, on either side of the House, can get up and say that our records are clean or that we have not broken promises at some stage along the road in relation to Ireland's overseas development aid generally.</P>
    <P>As we address ourselves to the motion before us this evening, we have to ask whether as a nation we have forgotten that we in Ireland suffered, only a century or so ago, the same fate as the hungry nations of today.  In fact, we had typical Third World conditions until the 1940s in this country &mdash; dispossession, poverty and emigration, mainly resulting from the Great Famine era.  Aid can be and is seen as an indicator of our concern as a nation.  Our overseas development aid is decided by Governments not by the people and that is why it does not reflect the wishes of the people generally or our history of commitment as a nation.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to a few points if I may which are expressed far more articulately than I would be able to express them and I do not apologise for quoting or plagiarising or referring to speeches or contributions or commitments in this area given by outside bodies and, indeed, in this Chamber and in the Dáil over the years.</P>
    <P>In the past in Ireland we have had well-documented the history of evangelisation and education worldwide since 500 AD. It has been pointed out that we got the name of being the island of saints and scholars.  We did not keep that to ourselves here, our missionaries and our educators travelled abroad far and wide.  We have had direct involvement in liberation struggles over the years.  Let us remind ourselves of the Wild Geese in Europe, Bernardo O'Higgins in South America, the Fenians in the American War of Independence, de Valera's influence on <Col N="293" /> Gandhi and Nehru in India, Seán MacBride's efforts in Namibia, acknowledged by the award of a Nobel prize and a Lenin peace prize.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves of the Irish emigrants involvement in nation building over the years: the Kennedys in the States and many others.  Twenty thousand of our missionaries have been active in development and pastoral works overseas since the last century.  They have had tremendous influence on emerging leaders &mdash; Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Tanzania's Julius Nyerere, to name but two.  There were key contributions from Ireland in the formation of the League of Nations and the subsequent growth of the United Nations.  More recently there has been the Irish Army's peace-keeping record in the Congo, Cyprus and in Lebanon.  We have been unprecedently generous as a nation in our response to disaster and famine in Biafra, Kampuchea, Ethiopia.  We can think of Bob Geldof's Band Aid and Live Aid, remind ourselves of the emergence in growth of the relief and development agencies &mdash; Concern, Gorta, Trócaire and GOAL.  There has been unselfish service from thousands of Irish volunteers in the Third World.  There was growth in the Irish Government's official development assistance from approximately £1 million in the early 1970s to over £43 million in 1987.  There have been public commitments by Irish Government Ministers in their time &mdash; Deputy O'Kennedy, Deputy Garret FitzGerald and Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; to increasing Irish aid towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  There has been significant assistance by our semi-State and State agencies and private sector companies too, to developing countries &mdash; CIE, Aer Lingus and the ESB.  We have been the net beneficiaries in most of these development aid programmes and we must recognise that and quantify it if we can.</P>
    <P>In 1985 there was a major public opinion survey carried out which found that 83 per cent of Irish people favoured the maintenance or the increase of Irish aid to the Third World.  Looking at our <Col N="294" /> history, recent and past, and at the views of the Irish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just reminding the Minister, with respect, of our recent past and previous commitment in this area and that the level of Government expenditure today on ODA does not reflect the wishes of the Irish people.  We should not have to go any further than that.  The Government should immediately redress the problem that is there and answer the wishes of the people.  Our non-governmental organisations, mainly Concern, Trócaire and GOAL, collect and distribute per annum as much in the Third World as the entire official bilateral assistance programme of this country. The ratio of commitment from the NGOs to the Government in this country far exceeds that of any other OECD country. Perhaps we should remind ourselves of how we define Ireland's development effort generally at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish overseas development aid is the money allocated annually in the budget by the Government to aid developing countries.  In 1987 approximately 60 per cent of the total was multilateral aid and 40 per cent bilateral assistance.  Multilateral aid is the money which Ireland has <Col N="295" /> to pay to the international bodies such as the UN agencies, the World Bank and the European Communities Development Fund.  Most of our bilateral assistance is spent on personal projects and technical assistance which goes directly to a number of Third World countries. As well as the official Government aid programme, a number of the NGOs give substantial development assistance. There are also Church and missionary organisations and religious orders together with a variety of other agencies which have a combined total of over 3,000 personnel involved in development work overseas.  There is no doubt that that is a good record in terms of a commitment from a small nation such as ours, from a relatively underdeveloped nation.</P>
    <P>In terms of the OECD structure, we are 57th of the 160 richest nations in the world but, at the moment, we are preoccupied with our own debt-servicing crisis.  That has been used rather lamely as the excuse for not honouring our commitments over the years.  It is not just this year or last year, even though the reduction this year and last year has been particularly horrific, but over the years we have not honoured the promises that were given, going back to 1973 and 1874. Deputy Garret FitzGerald has a very honourable record in this area but even some of the promises he committed us to have yet to be honoured.  We are awaiting a White Paper on policy in this area since 1974 or 1975.  Fifteen or 16 years later, to my knowledge, it has not appeared.  I do not know if it is being prepared or is at any draft stage.  I await to be told by the Minister whether something is arising in relation to that.</P>
    <P>While our record of achievement in the cause of human development worldwide &mdash; I listed some of the areas briefly where we have had a good record in the past &mdash; is something we can be proud of, like other OECD countries we are now preoccupied with recession and unemployment and coping generally with the servicing of our international debt.  This was the legacy of the massive borrowing by us as an oil-importing nation during <Col N="296" /> the oil crisis, among other issues, but that was a major compounding factor of our debt problem.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether we have lost all sense of global perspective on this issue, whether the whole concept of the global village means anything.  Yes, we have problems, they have been well documented.  We have economic and political problems, we have spoken of them on other occasions and we know what they are.  Relative to what we have been asked to do as a member of OECD, as a member of the EC, recognising the huge grant assistance which, as a nation, we get from the EC, considering the hype we have had about the doubling of the Structural Funds to ensure that Ireland is not on the periphery of the EC Twelve post-1992, then when one looks at the amount of money we are now discussing and urging the Government to increase its contribution to overseas development aid relative to the type of money we are expecting from the EC and the Structural Funds over the next four years, what we are now looking for pales into insignificance.</P>
    <P>While we introvertedly look, discuss and bemoan our economic and political domestic problems, many developing countries have lost more than a full decade of growth.  The effects of the debt crisis will linger for them for a lifetime at least, even if income grows more rapidly in those countries in the future.  By 1988 the combined GDP of the highly indebted developing countries was 10 per cent lower than in 1980.  It had decreased to about 33 per cent below the level that it would have reached had the 1965 to 1980 growth trend continued through to 1988 in these developing countries.  We have problems but tragically for the developing world their problems have been magnified and multiplied at a far greater rate over the last decade, particularly the servicing of their debt repayments, than anything in this country.  Our problems pale into insignificance.</P>
    <P>For Sub-Saharan Africa the 1980s brought even greater hardship.  Their <i>per capita</i> income in 1988 was 19 per cent lower than in 1980 with little prospect for <Col N="297" /> improvement.  Even with an impressive 4.5 per cent annual growth rate not until the year 2077 would debtor countries reach the <i>per capita</i> income level that they would have acheved if the growth rates of the sixties and seventies had continued in the eighties.  In short, the 1980s has been a disastrous decade for developing countries.  With debt and recession in the eighties, the advances in human wellbeing in these developing countries, such as the reduction in child mortality rates, slowed considerably.  The Third World debt crisis has entered a new stage.</P>
    <P>When we agreed, back in the seventies, to a target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as our ODA, as a relatively developed nation we had not even reached this tragic decade for the developing countries.  If we were being honest and if we were treating like with like, and if we were now to consider in 1990 what we should be contributing in ODA that would be equivalent to 0.7 per cent in 1980 we should be asking for somewhere in the region of 2 to 3 per cent of GNP.  We are realists: that is not going to be achieved today or tomorrow.  I would like some indication from the Minister as to when the 0.7 per cent target set in 1973-74 will be achieved.  It was asked to be delivered on by 1975 and for those countries that had &ldquo;problems&rdquo;, they were given until 1980 to reach the 0.7 per cent of GNP as ODA.  Here we are, a decade later, with the developing countries in crisis because of the debt repayment problems that have beset them since and in fact, we have reduced dramatically what we have been giving them over the past two years.</P>
    <P>We hardly need to remind ourselves that the seeds of the Third World debt crisis were planted in the 1970s after we had struck the target of 0.7 per cent at UN level for ODA contribution.  The oil price shocks led to increased loans to developing countries as petro-dollars were recycled, and eventually to high interest rates, as the industrial countries tried to stem inflation.  By the early 1980s, developing countries had accumulated a mountain of debt in an effort to maintain and surpass their rapid growth of the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> The crisis for most debtor countries erupted around 1982 when the world economic recession closed down previously strong markets for their goods.  I am tempted to quote an expression I heard on a BBC2 programme during the week on developing countries generally when it stated that the developing countries had swopped the tyranny of imperialism &mdash; we are particularly talking about Sub-Saharan Africa in this context &mdash; for the tyranny of the world marketplace. That says it all in a nutshell.</P>
    <P>They are really crippled by the situation in the world marketplace and apart from that because of their urgent need for cash crops to repay their debts, they are now planting areas which should be growing food and areas which should be grazed with cash crops such as cotton etc. and hunger is increasing in their own areas. There is a reduction in their own GNP contribution towards health and education and indeed the development of fresh water systems for drinking has slowed down at an enormous rate in the 1980s relative to the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
    <P>These are all indicators that are used for the various international agencies. UNICEF, particularly, have year after year published very important documents which are really tantamount to gospel in this area, in that the work is done.  They quantify in a detailed and scientific way what the problems are and anything we say or any excuses we make here in relation to our lack of commitment or contribution to those countries fly out the window when one reads through the facts and figures of the organisations and agencies who know in detail what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>I hope we can count on the Progressive Democrats support for this motion.  I hope we can count on the Government's support.  I have no indication at this stage what the Minister's reply will contain but I would like to remind the Minister that both Ministers, Deputies Bobby Molloy and Mary Harney, only 12 months ago committed themselves to restoring our ODA to the 1986 levels of 0.25 per cent. One of those Ministers is a Cabinet Minister and the other is a junior Minister. <Col N="299" /> That I take to be official Progressive Democrats policy and that will be the support I will be expecting as that is exactly what paragraph (i) in our motion calls for today.  I trust the Progressive Democrats members of the Government side here will support us.</P>
    <P>I made the point earlier that the call for a foreign affairs committee has come from all sides of this House.  I omitted to state at the time that a tragic knock-on effect of having no forum in which to discuss Irish foreign affairs in an all-party civilised way is that most foreign affairs policy is now conducted both in the Dáil and in the Seanad in a disorderly way on the Order of Business.  One after another we get up in this House or in the Dáil to make our point, to request Government time to debate this or that, to move Adjournment motions on or to raise under Standing Order 29 issues about different foreign affairs problems.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind when considering the possibility of acceding to our request for a joint committee on foreign afairs.</P>
    <P>In 1973, APSO, which is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs, was established during the time when Deputy Garret FitzGerald was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This body, with responsibility for promoting service by our citizens in developing countries, performed excellent work over the years.  I would like to know if the Minister is making use of them now in terms of advice and whether a lot more could be garnered from this source.  There is wonderful expertise there.  We have had over a thousand assignments on a voluntary, semi-professional and professional basis from this organisation over the years to developing countries and I would like to know how this body relate to the present Department of Foreign Affairs and what use is being made of them by the Department.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that Ireland has an international voice which is far beyond our economic and political importance.  We have a proud history, both long-term past and recent <Col N="300" /> past, in relation to our commitment to developing countries.  We are embarrassed about the position in relation to ODA particularly over the past two years.  We are embarrassed about the broken promises for over a decade or so. Some of our politicians have committed themselves and have very honourable records.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald I single out particularly in this area.  He has constantly spoken and is completely committed to honouring the promises, and even ensuring that those that appear to have been broken to date and are now honoured.  To borrow words again, we need to reinvigorate our commitment to the UN target for overseas development aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP and we must start by restoring our overseas development aid to the level of 0.25 per cent.  I know there were Parliamentary Questions about the £1 million that disappeared between the Estimates and the budget in relation to overseas development aid.  If that money was not needed for what was originally intended, surely it could have been left to take the appallingly bare look off our oveseas development aid figure.  It would have helped a little bit towards restoring the 1986 overseas development aid level.  I understand it would take £22 million on top of this year's overseas development aid figure to get back now to the 1986 level. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that to me.  We would need to bring it up to somewhere around £56 or £57 million next year from the £34 million or £35 million figure this year.  That is a large increase but, comforted by the knowledge that the Minister would have all-party support for such a move, I urge him to consider it as a small step towards meeting our UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP which we need to achieve as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We are the policy makers.  The Government of the day are the particular policy makers, and we have to use the tools of State to accomplish change.  I ask the Minister to please see this as an all-party approach and to act, for the sake of the country.  It is not just the parliamentarians who are asking for action. <Col N="301" /> We are only reflecting the wishes of the people as demonstrated time and time again by their own personal generosity.</P>
    <P>As my colleague has had to leave the Chamber for a short time, may I ask if Senator Murphy will second the motion, please?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will second the motion and my membership position with Fine Gael can be subsequently rationalised.</P>
      <P>In seconding the motion, I will confine myself largely to paragraph (iii).  I think that even Senator Doyle would agree that the composite motion is not the happiest choice in this case.  It seems to me that everything hinges on paragraph (iii), because the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid could be subsumed under an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>I have little to say on the question of ODA.  Senator Doyle has dealt with it very ably.  I would particularly like to reinforce her point that there is popular support for increasing the percentage of ODA.  It is not as if the Government have to worry about taking an unpopular step. This is one of the rare occasions in which the right deed and the political expedience are happily conjoined.  I believe Senator Doyle is also right in that the reason our people show extraordinary generosity is that there is a folk memory or a particular perception of the Great Famine and its effects which still has not died out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to concentrate what I have to say, therefore, on paragraph (iii), that is, on the need to set up an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.  In doing so I should like to begin by quoting from a Member of the Dáil, who has long since gone to his eternal reward, or wherever it is that Deputies and Senators go to.  His name was Deputy Gorey.  I have no idea from what party he came, except that in that period in November 1923, in the infant days of the State the Minister's political ancestors were still howling in the wilderness.  So, he was not one of your own, Minister.  Perhaps he <Col N="302" /> was from County Wexford, or maybe that is simply an association of ideas.  When they were discussing generally the setting up of Government Departments, feeling their way indeed in the early days of the State, he reacted very irritably against the proposal to set up an External Affairs or Foreign Affairs Department.  I refer to the Official Dáil Report for 16 November, 1923, Vol. 5, column 940:</P>
    <P>I do not see why we want a Minister for External or Foreign Affairs.  We are concerned with no foreign affairs, we have no colonies, we have no interest to clash with any other nations. I think it is ridiculous to be playing with theatricals like this.  This Ministry of Foreign Affairs ought to be scrapped and let the Executive Council deal with any foreign matters that have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>By the Executive Council, of course, he meant the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>From this historical perspective we might think Deputy Gorey's remark's are at best, amusing and, at worst, blinkered and obscurantist.  But it seems that the Government's intransigence in their opposition to the setting up of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs smacks of the same shortsighted attitude which we find in Deputy Gorey's remarks.  <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the Government would probably take Deputy Gorey's view that foreign affairs are the business of Government and that Deputies and Senators should not be bothering their pretty little heads with such matters.</P>
    <P>This elitist attitude is not good enough. It is no longer the isolated Ireland of Deputy Gorey's world of 1923, but the extremely volatile global village of 1990; and elected representatives must be at least as well informed and as well serviced in the area of foreign affairs as they are, or as they should be, in any area of domestic politics.  For the Oireachtas to deal effectively with the foreign affairs &mdash; the interlocking of foreign and domestic affairs is a matter which I do not need to dwell on &mdash; they need the prestige and the standing and servicing of an Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Some of us set up a voluntary Oireachtas joint committee, but we have to admit it was a feeble attempt.  Indeed, it underlines the point that without official recognition, backing and servicing an <i>ad hoc</i> committee is worst than useless. We need this committee for all kinds of reasons &mdash; North-South relations, Anglo-Irish relations, the quick-fire developments in the Community and eastern Europe.  It was never so urgent &mdash; indeed every day that passes stresses the urgency &mdash; to have a joint committee. The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC, of which I am a new member, is all very well but, clearly, it does not go far enough; its remit is very limited.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will not think I am being arrogant in asserting that the university Senators have a very special interest in this.  In the nature of things they are extremely interested in world affairs.  I would not be so smug as to claim that they are better informed than political party Deputies, but there is one significant reason why we are interested. Some of us, at least, have constituents who live outside the jurisdiction and that gives us an extra territorial interest straightaway.</P>
    <P>If such a committee is set up, I would like to give warning to the political parties that the University Senators will be demanding proper representation on it. We will not put up with being excluded from these vital committees of the Oireachtas, from the composition of parliamentary delegations, with being excluded from the parliamentary representation to Nicaragua, for example. Indeed, I was reflecting on this last night and trying to come to terms with Ortega's collapse and, in a wild Spike Milligan moment, it occurred to me that if I had been on that delegation, the outcome might have been very different.</P>

      <P>On a more serious note, I would also like to take this occasion to protest at the exclusion of the University Senators &mdash; a relatively large group, as large if not larger than some of the other groups &mdash; from the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion concerns an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs and I submit, with respect, what I am saying is quite well within the bounds of relevance.  Why, then, do the Government turn an intransigent face to this reasonable and all-party demand that an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs be set up?  Partly because of inertia, partly because of conservatism, perhaps very strongly because of a desire to avoid controversy, a desire to avoid provocative debates which might not please some of our friends in embassies scattered around Ballsbridge and partly also, of course &mdash; this is very much germane to all politics &mdash; because of the desire to mystify.  Foreign affairs is somehow an abstruse business which only the high level minds, the globe-trotting people, can really handle.  I detect this mystification in the utterances of many Ministers, present company excluded. Ministers and higher civil servants like to think of themselves as experts in this area.</P>
      <P>In my view, there are very few experts in foreign affairs.  Let us recall the phrase of the Swedish diplomat, Count Oxenstierna, in the letter he wrote to his son, which is as relevant today as it was in the mid-17th century.  &ldquo;Dost thou not know, my son, with what little wisdom the world is governed.&rdquo;  Listening to some of the waffle that passes for utterances in foreign affairs, I must say Oxenstierna's observations are still very true.  There are distinguished gurus who waffle on these matters, and whom prudence prohibits me from identifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take simply as an example that, <Col N="305" /> when people talk about the question of neutrality and how it stands with respect to the changes now taking place and the sea change of NATO and so on, people use words like &ldquo;security&rdquo; and &ldquo;defence&rdquo; and I honestly believe that very few of them know or have any idea of what they are talking about.  What does &ldquo;security&rdquo; mean?  What can it mean in the Europe of the future?</P>
    <P>For this reason alone it seems to me that for the better information of Deputies and Senators the setting up of such a committee is imperative.  In short, foreign affairs is much too important a business to be left to the people in Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I have great sympathy with this motion and with many of the sentiments, on which, I am sure, we could all agree, that have been so ably and eloquently expressed by Senator Doyle, but I suppose we should come back to the basics of why we should be involved in overseas aid and the purpose of that aid.  The purpose of that aid is basically to put it to good use for the benefit of the recipients in the Third World countries.  To simply express it on a statistical basis &mdash; even though I have great sympathy with the figures and fully agree that we would wish to increase our contribution &mdash; is, nonetheless, a very artifical aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would beg slightly to disagree with Senator Doyle.  I have great sympathy with her statements but, nonetheless, I think basically &mdash; forgive me saying so, Senator Doyle &mdash; we do have a good record.  What Senator Doyle is primarily commenting on is the official aid.  As she rightly indicated in the rest of her speech, the contribution by Irish people to genuine aid, in the full sense of the word &ldquo;overseas&rdquo;, bears comparison with any other country or any other group.  Maybe, as Senator Murphy has suggested, it is a folk memory of the Famine.  That may well be at least part of it.  I do not think it is the whole story but it may be part of it.  Certainly Senator Doyle mentioned Band-Aid; and the comparison between <Col N="306" /> the response in this country and elsewhere was totally astounding in the contribution <i>in toto</i> per head of population, the number of individuals who subscribed. It was absolutely tremendous.</P>
    <P>I would certainly agree that most people in this country support the idea of overseas aid.  Indeed, if there was one Government policy on which there might be considerable unanimity, it would be increasing overseas aid.  This is what we would all wish to do.  Again, without in any way sounding our own trumpet, this is a very good attitude and it certainly does not apply universally in other countries.  Many countries feel very reluctant, in their populace as well as in their official dealings, to give overseas aid.</P>
    <P>There is a target set by the United Nations.  Certainly, it is a target that one should aim at or even exceed.  In fact, I would like to see it substantially exceeded and I would fully agree with Senator Doyle's comments regarding the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  I think he has made a special contribution to development aid to the Third World countries.  I would respectfully suggest that this was not so much on the question of statistics or specific financial contributions by this tiny country; it was by the way he &mdash; and, if I may say so, people on our own side &mdash; emphasise the importance of substantial financial commitments going from North to South and basically being put to good use.</P>
    <P>There I think we come in some ways to the kernal of the problem.  Senator Doyle has referred to statistics.  I would have to differ, not with the general trend of the statistics which are horrific, as any of us who have visited or had anything to do with the Third World countries are aware, but the statistics in themselves are extraordinarily unreliable and misleading as regards so much of the Third World. There really are not serious statistics: what there is is an enormous want, an enormous need, which passes beyond normal measurement.</P>
    <P>Let us come back to the point of really putting this to good use.  There are other countries indeed &mdash; not all that many &mdash; who are giving a higher proportion of <Col N="307" /> official aid, a higher proportion of their GNP.  Certainly, that is to be welcomed. But we should be aware of the fact that, whereas we can genuinely say in this country that our aid in so far as we possibly can so organise it &mdash; and I think our civil servants and all the other people associated do a very good job &mdash; it is basically directed altruistically to the benefit of the recipients.  I take the point that some of our State agencies have also been involved effectively on a commercial basis and quite rightly so, but the basic drive from this country on official aid has been altruistic.  Quite frankly, that is not the situation with many of the countries who would claim to have a much higher GNP proportion.  A lot of that apparent and, I suppose, statistically higher proportion is very tightly related to their market requirements and just sheer commercial interest.  So, let us not get too lost over statistics.</P>
    <P>There is a second way in which we should reflect on overseas aid when we are comparing ourselves &mdash; and I would agree; I want to see it increased as well. However, before we start criticising ourselves in comparison to other countries we would also have to note that many of the other countries who have a greater proportion apparently of official aid are doing so with very definite political strings attached.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle has very rightly mentioned the financial situation.  There would be those who in some ways argue that official aid, and particularly much of the financial aid, has been a disaster for the recipients, and that simply increasing by 50 per cent or doubling it, trebling it or quadrupling it would simply add to this appalling financial disaster which has been inflicted upon the Third World countries.  They are now far more heavily in debt than they were in the 1970s, despite the substantial increase in aid. Their standard of living in many countries has diminished considerably.  The standards of health care have collapsed in many countries.  There is an appalling situation.  You may say that some of this is of these countries own making &mdash; the <Col N="308" /> drive towards urbanisation, the penalisation of farmers and producers of food, the excessive mania for prestigious but largely inappropriate heavy uncompetitive industry.  Indeed, we may blame ourselves that some perhaps of our more unscrupulous financial people have taken advantage of Third World countries and, if I may say so, so also have some of our political gurus who have exported totally inappropriate left wing ideas of an urban nature totally unsuited to the benefit of the people in the recipient nations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I touched it again?  There are two things that are particularly needed and where perhaps we can play some rôle.  Let us face it, if we were to double, treble, quadruple our financial contribution it would, I hope, all be put to good use, but it would be a <Col N="309" /> drop in the bucket.  What is needed is very much a revision of the ideas of financial aid to the developing countries. Here I think, quite frankly, that the United Nations has failed very considerably and perhaps we in the United Nations can do something to redress this failure.</P>
      <P>There has been a failure in a financial sense in that the transfers of funds have merely now reached a stage where interest payments are gobbling them up and the actual economic state of the recipient has declined.  They are failing in the sense that probably the greatest disaster of the moment facing, certainly Sub-Saharan Africa, is the AIDS epidemic, which is now reaching appalling proportions.  High percentages of the populace are suffering from AIDS, with all the appalling personal tragedies involved but also, let us face it, the economic tragedies, there is the collapse of much of the economy of these countries. There is no end to it in sight; it looks as though it is going to get much worse.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, on the question of food supplies, we have all seen these appalling photographs; many of us have very personal experience of starvation in Africa and, indeed, elsewhere.  Yet here we are in the Common Market still complaining about our food surpluses.  There is something radically wrong there.  I certainly do not think that doubling our contribution in official overseas aid is in any sense an excuse for the lack of activity that has taken place in the European Community to deal with the transfer of surplus foods from these countries where we have this gross surplus to those countries where people are starving to death literally because they are not receiving food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the view that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid should be reinstituted. I would imagine that many of the various bodies involved in overseas aid on a voluntary basis would probably support this and it would generally be a beneficial development.  There are a number of topics that one would like to see discussed. I have touched on a few of them. <Col N="310" /> Another perhaps is on the relationship between emergency aid and long-term aid.  Again, it does seem to be an appalling situation that people have to starve to death, be seen on our television screens to be starving to death and dying. Then and only then do we really seem to get round to doing something about it and taking measures.  I know that Irish aid, voluntary aid agencies, have done remarkable work under appalling and difficult conditions in this respect, such as the Red Cross and many many others that we all know.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle has referred to the reestablishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  In a sense, this is a very different topic, as Senator Murphy has suggested.  There are those in this House who feel that perhaps we spend a disproportionate amount of our time discussing foreign affairs.  Yes, I know we should be interested in them; yes, I know that some of them are of enormous importance particularly with the European Community. A slight sense of proporation at times would, perhaps, be beneficial. Though I have great sympathy with this motion, it does seem to be a little bit of a blunderbuss one and I will, therefore, have some difficulty in supporting it.</P>

      <P>Being the 23rd richest of 185 countries, we give the equivalent of 2.5p per person daily to developing countries in official aid.  It is significant, in the light of today being Ash Wednesday, <Col N="311" /> that we Irish people spend 16 times as much on tobacco products.  Our Government aid to the poorest countries, known as official development assistance, has been cut by more than one-third over the past four years.  To get ODA restored to its 1986 level of 0.25 per cent of GNP we would have needed £57.5 million.  This would have been the appropriate figure for the Estimates and consequently budget figures.  The reality was that the November estimate was £35.5 million, which is a shortfall of £22 million.  The budget figure of £34.4 million was, as Senator Doyle stated, over £1 million less because of an overestimate of £1.1 million, which was set aside as our contribution to the Lomé Convention but was not called up; of course, eventually it will be.  Instead of leaving the £1.1 million to the grossly under-funded bilateral aid programme, that £1 million reverted to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Another reduction of £100,000 was taken from the disaster relief provision fund.  Granted it went to Romania; and it was needed in Romania and I welcome this.  But it further reduced our contribution of £750,000 to £650,000 for disaster relief.  There must be an immediate commitment by the Irish Government to return to the 1986 aid level and to a fixed yearly increase in ODA allocations until at least we meet and maintain the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  Our aim in the motion of a target of 0.27 per cent of GNP is reasonable in the light of our financial problems, but it is just a first step to the 0.35 per cent OECD average figure and eventually to the 0.7 per cent United Nations figure.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to the 1988 ODA report of the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  He excuses the reduction in aid while stating our retention of our position among the wealthier countries in the world.  He goes on to say that our finances deteriorated very rapidly in the eighties, threatening to cripple the economy and its capacity to sustain public expenditure and debt.  He states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Severe budgetary discipline was needed and all sectors, including ODA, were affected in 1988.  The figure given, £32.4 million, was £6.7 million less than in 1987.  Multilateral programmes were reduced by £3 million and bilateral programmes by £3.7 million.  Nevertheless the framework of the aid programme was maintained and the assistance provided continued to be effective and timely.  Progress would be made as soon as economic circumstances permitted and that particular year showed just £1 million increase.</P>
    <P>I believe economic circumstances have improved here if we are to believe the Government, the budget and all the various headlines we have been subjected to over the last few months.  The public response has been marvellous, particularly in relation to the Ethiopian appeal and I believe the Lenten appeal by Tróciare and other agencies will be generously answered.  The Government this time are not being forced to do something against the tide of public opinion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second and third points of the motion, should we reconstitute the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid and also establish an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs, this is urgently needed to ensure that ongoing informed debate on development issues takes place on a regular basis.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid was disbanded &mdash; I would like Minister Calleary's comments on this &mdash; because, it appears, of budgetary cutbacks and the promise of a senior foreign affairs committee. This has not happened.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid and the establishment of the foreign affairs committee are, I still believe, essential and should be part of any structures for foreign affairs policy.  My experience, short as it has been, is that since the commencement of this Seanad session there has been a staggering range of motions covering foreign affairs &mdash; Cambodia or <Col N="313" /> Kampuchea, Ethiopia, the USSR, EI Salvador, Eastern Europe, South Africa. All of these surely indicate the need for such committees.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to our bilateral aid programme which was cut from its 1986 figure of £15.34 million to £9.5 million, the four priority areas being Sudan, Tanzania, Lesotho and Zambia. Think of the pluses for us, for semi-State agencies.  Irish people are paid to work in developing countries and they are target areas for trade expansion.  From a political aspect the Government should increase their political efforts at European and international levels to promote peaceful settlement of conflicts, the effective implementation of development programmes, assistance and aid in regions of political conflict and turmoil and a full recognition of human rights.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to refer to environmental issues.  Environmental protection is an area of increasing international concern clearly demonstrating the reality of many peoples one world thesis.  Environmental destruction is not only a disease of the industrialised world. The poorest countries of the developing world are often the chief victims of industrial pollution and environmental damage caused by policies and activities.</P>
    <P>There is growing evidence that serious climatic variations, which have disastrous effects on the health, safety and livelihood of people in the Third World, can often be traced to large scale industries carried out by or at the behest of the industrialised world.  In these circumstances surely the Minister would agree that an effective development policy must incorporate a real concern to combat the damaging circumstances of these practices.</P>
    <P>What should we do?  We should allocate financial resources, through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to assist developing countries to meet more stringent environmental protection standards and we should improve measures to improve environmental conditions in developing countries.  Active political and legal pressure should be applied to companies in both the developed and <Col N="314" /> developing worlds to operate within acceptable safety and environmental standards, ensuring that financial responsbility for remedial action is enforcible against any offending company.  The Minister can understand from the range of what I have covered the necessity for having those committees.</P>
    <P>We need active assistance nationally and internationally for agriculture policies which promote improvements in full production and reduce the use of toxic chemicals.  We need effective legislation to prevent dumping of toxic products or banning such practices in developing countries.  A sensitive development policy which takes proper control of global environmental concerns must promote projects and schemes which pursue energy-saving and safe waste recycling.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive environmental protection is difficult to translate into practice in the developing countries.  Extreme poverty for them increases the desire for industrialisation and the employment and income which this brings.  It is our collective responsibility to ensure that economic development in the developing countries is not achieved at the cost of environmental devastation because it is too high a price for any of us to pay.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle has spoken very comprehensively about the problems of debt restructuring in the Third World, so I will leave that.  Development education in schools, which I have spoken about before in this House, should aim at promoting the positive aspects of the Third World rather than the negative aspects that are continually promoted.  I believe that young children should be exposed to the culture of developing countries and not always pushed, as it were, with a hand-out mentality towards them, but to respect their culture, their values and show that an awareness would help eventually towards a better understanding of their needs &mdash; not our perceived needs for them but their own needs.  That is a matter which the Minister might take up.  Of course the role of women is another wide issue in the development area.  We need, as a matter of urgency, to increase our level of aid <Col N="315" /> initially from 0.25 to 0.27, which is what is in the motion, to our OECD average level of 0.35 and, eventually, which will be difficult but we must at least aim towards it, to the United Nation's target of 0.7.  We must reconstitute the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid and establish a foreign affairs committee.  The passing of this motion is not just a pious aspiration, it is a basic responsibility and should not be subjected to whim, emotion or expediency. It should be our guarantee.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this subject even though I cannot say that I accept the terms of the motion as laid down.  The first comment I have to make is that as far as I am concerned the motion is very predictable and simplistic.  As somebody who has been working for a long time in one of the more under-developed regions of this country, I have some understanding of the frustrations that must be felt by the people of the Third World at the simplistic way that we think we will tackle their problems.</P>
      <P>My experiences of development aid are that money grants and other aids like that tend to suit the convenience of the giver, the donor, more than to meet the very necessary requirements of the donee.  We have to face the reality that the problems of the Third World, as we call it, are immense and that the basic economic structures of the world are what we should be tackling in this debate.  The fact is &mdash; this is not just simply a matter for Government &mdash; that we in this part of the world are happy to give small sums of money but we, as people, would be very reluctant to make a major change in our lifestyle that would make a substantial change in the lifestyle of the poorer people of this world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Conroy touched on one aspect of this, an aspect that has always both puzzled and annoyed me, that is the question of food surpluses in the EC.  It seems totally ridiculous to me that we would talk about 0.25 of GNP to 0.27 and at the same time that as a nation, we would not <Col N="316" /> be tackling within the EC the problem of the redistribution of food throughout the world.</P>
    <P>It seems at UN level we must face up to the fact that we can on this planet of ours provide enough food to feed all its people and the problem relates more to distribution than of our ability to produce.  Similarly, we must also look at the various structures that ensure that some very basic raw materials on which the developing world depend are at unjustifiably low cost at times in world markets and that if we really want to tackle these problems that these, rather than a simplistic motion affecting money, are the items we should be tackling.  To do this we would have to start a national debate and ensure that whatever the Government decided to do the people would go with them.  This is where the real dilemma lies.</P>
    <P>The Government could decide tomorrow to increase aid but unless the people are behind such an increase, the realities of government would come home to roost, because, as I have said repeatedly in this House, if we are to spend more money on any programme and if we do not believe in increasing our current budget deficit that money will have to come out of some other programme. That is where one finds the little snags. It is a question of Government reflecting people and people reflecting the Government.</P>
    <P>It is simplistic for a party in Opposition, to propose that aid be increased without specifying which Government programme they would cut back on in order to finance that Government aid.  Week after week we hear calls for more expenditure but nobody tells us where this money will come from and what programme it will come from.  Under the terms of the motion, if the proposers are to be taken seriously, it would be incumbent on the Opposition to specify where the money is to come from.</P>
    <P>In regard to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the motion, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the requests there but, in general, we suffer in this country from too much talking, too much debate and <Col N="317" /> too little action.  We seem to push every problem away by setting up joint committees, committees and commissions.  It would be much more important for whatever Government are in power, to set about doing those things that everybody sees should be done rather than setting up more committees, piling up more paper, to say what a lot of the time is the obvious.  If all the commissions and ideas that have been developed over the years were implemented we would have enough on hand to last us a good few years.  Certainly in latter years, as somebody involved in development, I have come to treat all committees of this type as anathema, as a simple way of fobbing us off, of telling us to run away while the Government think about this matter further.  I hope that the Government, rather than setting up more committees, will continue to uphold the proud tradition of this country in helping the developing world and taking our stand, not only on the question of financial contributions, which no matter what percentage of GNP we give will always be small, but taking a leading rôle in the EC and the United Nations to ensure that the aim of bringing North and South on this globe into harmony and of developing and not exploiting the poorer countries is pursued.  The necessity for doing this is very urgent.</P>
    <P>Our prosperity in the long term will depend on the prosperity of the Third World.  We depend on them just as much as they depend on us.  All we have to think of is the vast amount of basic raw materials that we get from those countries. Therefore, it would, even in our own selfish interest, be of paramount importance to ensure that these countries develop.  We should never forget that it is only a little over 100 years since we were a country of great poverty.  It is only 140 years since we suffered the Great Famine.  We tend nowadays to pass that off as a nightmare of a considerable time ago but, when we think about it, all of us have known people who knew people who were alive at that time.</P>
    <P>The fantastic strides we have made in that time as a country should give us the <Col N="318" /> confidence to believe that poverty in the world is not there of necessity.  It is there because of unequitable distribution of resources and there basically because of the inherent selfishness of man.  We should never forget that at times when we needed help perhaps we did not get that help.  Therefore, we should not in our time stand back as a nation and look on inactively at the suffering and poverty of other nations.  We should believe that it is within the capacity of the richer nations to help the poorer nations in such a way that they can help themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that particular point.  Help given by countries should be basically in co-operation and consultation with the people who are being helped.  It should be given, as far as possible, in such a way that rather than alleviate the problem for the short-term it tackles the root of the problem.  When we look at the money we spend, when we look at the programmes we get involved in, more and more we should direct our resources towards sharing with people on an equal basis our skills and our experience in helping to get them to help themselves. Our experience in this work is that when it is done on that basis, when development is basically done through the agency working in a partnership with the developed nations, the results are much more long term and much more lasting.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;noting the widely held view that a significant number of items of military equipment purchased for the Defence Forces in recent years, in particular the purchase of new rifles, and the purchase of surface to air missiles were either unnecessary or unsuitable for Irish conditions, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;recognising the increased likelihood of a reduction of military expenditure all over Europe,</P>
      <P>calls for a five year moratorium on the purchase of new military equipment, with the resources saved being used to add to Ireland's overseas development aid expenditure.</P>
      <P>I am quite happy to nail my colours to the mast of believing we should transfer resources for military expenditure to development expenditure, so are, I believe, all of my Independent colleagues and so I believe is a considerable proportion of the population of what is now euphemistically and with some overstatement called Europe but indeed of what is perhaps more appropriately called the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sensitive to a number of things that I will come to in my own time.  I agree fully with the motion, with one exception &mdash; I actually had to check this with the Fine Gael Senators &mdash; namely, the extraordinarily limited target they have set for the development of overseas development aid, to increase to 0.25 per cent of GNP as it was in 1987 and to aim at a target of 0.27 per cent of GNP in the reasonable future.  I have had two stories from Fine Gael on this; one of which is that the figure is correct and I think that Senator Jackman is going to tell me is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite happy to accept a correction from Senator Jackman but not an argument.  It is appallingly understated to suggest that this is a realistic target.  I resent this word realism. I live in a world of very harsh realities, among them being the reality of having to get elected and re-elected to this House which concentrates my mind on the views of the admittedly somewhat sheltered electorate from whom I seek my support but I know what they think.  I know, for instance, that the Minister confirmed in a recent answer to a Dáil question that he received 600 different representations on the issue of the Irish Government's views on Cambodia.  I have a strong feeling that when I suggest that pathetically inadequate targets for ODA are a <Col N="321" /> betrayal of the Irish people, whether they be the Government decisions or the major Opposition party's targets, they are a betrayal of the Irish people.  To the extent I am unhappy with the motion; but not to the extent that I would vote against it because there is much in it to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The level of interest in Cambodia, which the Minister is aware of, is a good argument for the Oireachtas taking to itself, which it should, the right to set up committees on overseas development co-operation and on foreign affairs.  One thing that is becoming apparent is that as democracy is restored in eastern Europe in its full vigour we are discovering that democracy means a Government which actually is, in practice, accountable to Parliament, not just in theory, and which actually has to do something that would shock most of the Irish Governments we have had for the last 20 years.  They would actually have to argue their points to a Parliament that could not guarantee them a majority in order to get something through that Parliament.  It would be a healthy exercise both for parliamentarians and for Government to actually have to make up their minds about things on the merits and for Governments to have to win their arguments on the merits of the arguments. That is why an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs and an Oireachtas committee on overseas development and co-operation is so enormously important. It would restore the supremacy of the Oireachtas in areas where the Oireachtas ought to be entirely supreme and not bodies which are allowed to talk about issues when the Government see fit or indeed in a manner in which the Government see fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could mention, on the issue of foreign policy, a long list of issues where the people drove the Government in the direction in which they were more or less reluctant to go.  I, for one, detected a quite remarkable stengthening of the Government's views on sanctions against South Africa as Irish public opinion emerged subsequent to the release of Nelson Mandela.  I have no doubt about <Col N="322" /> the changing views of the previous Government during the visit of President Reagan, from a position of bland indifference and silence on Central America to a position of quite vigorous public criticism in the light of Irish public opinion. It is a great pity that that vigorous, critical, well informed and extraordinarily progressive public opinion is not allowed to express itself through a formal mechanism within the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We would be well served by committees such as that.  I am not sure where the resistance comes from.  I am not trying to pin down the Minister of State on this.  I do not believe it comes from the Minister of State who is the most forthcoming Minister of State we have had in that Department and who has honoured this House by his presence at a succession of debates, all of which &mdash; whatever our differences &mdash; I know he takes seriously, all of which he participates in entirely.  He sits here, he listens and he responds to the debate. The Minister of State has no problems and should not have any problems with an Oireachtas committee.  It would simply be a formalisation of the sort of relationship he has with this House and I am sure with the Oireactas generally.</P>
    <P>I keep wondering, who is it?  Are there experts somewhere who believe they know better than the people?  It must be said over and over again &mdash; this has a lot in common with Senator Ó Cuív's remarks &mdash; there are no experts who know better than the people.  There never can be and there never will be.  There are experts who can attempt to influence the people.  There are experts who can attempt to change their minds but the people have the right to be wrong and the people are sovereign.  It is a very fundamental principle and it is one, in the light of a result of an election in Nicaragua which disappointed me bitterly, is a position that I am happy to reiterate, that the people have a right to make their own decisions.  I will defend that right, but I will also defend that right against those who would take certain <Col N="323" /> areas away from them on the grounds of an alleged lack of expertise on their part.</P>
    <P>At the same time, having supported, and I do support vigorously, the view that our overseas development aid is hopelessly inadequate in terms of its scale, it behoves us to make a few cautionary comments about aid as a source of development on its own.  Again, not for the first time, and on a less controversial issue than on an occasion when we shared a platform recently, I agreed with Senator Ó Cuív.  I will not put anything on the record that will put Senator Ó Cuív in trouble.  I agree with him that aid on its own is not necessarily a good thing, not necessarily sufficient or not necessarily adequate.  I would like to quote an eminent authority on this that I recommend to every Member of this House.</P>

      <P>The motion for the Adjournment is by Senator Naughten, to ask the Minister for Health to outline any changes in his plans since 1 January 1990 for general hospitals, psychiatric, geriatric, community care services in County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this very important issue of health services in County Roscommon.  This is an old chestnut with which this Minister, no less than his predecessor, will be familiar. Indeed, I had the pleasure of asking questions of the present Minister for Health in the other House in the lifetime of the previous Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to refer to tonight is what is now basically known as the Foxe deal. Deputy Foxe has reported specific assurances. <Col N="324" /> He has referred to the County Hospital receiving ten extra nurses and 20 extra beds and also stated that an additional physician would be appointed at the County Hospital.  Deputy Foxe has decided, for his own best reasons, to be general rather than specific on those matters and thus I would like this House to be enlightened on the specifics by way of the procedural guidelines to be followed; dates by which the appointments will be in being; the precise nature of the appointments and the type of appointment.</P>
    <P>In the publicly advertised posts for physician it has been stated that it would be temporary for six months.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there were three advertisements for this post, two of them sought a physician and one sought a physician with a special interest in geriatrics. I would like the Minister clearly to put on record for the House this evening the type of post that is being filled.  Last Monday I met senior consultants and doctors in Roscommon hospital and they generally believe that a temporary physician will not take up duty in Roscommon, that the post will not be sufficiently attractive.</P>
    <P>Some sceptics would say that this particular deal is very vague and deliberately so, perhaps in order to give the Taoiseach the time he needs to complete his Presidency of the EC.  I would like the Minister to put clearly on the record tonight what precisely was agreed; what exactly is coming to Roscommon; what exactly is coming to Castlerea, the cost and the timescale.  They are all factors that we, the people of Roscommon, are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>As regards the nursing appointments, will there be re-employment of some of the 40 nurses who lost their jobs in the county hospital two years ago when they were paid off because of lack of sufficient funding to carry on the posts there? Again, in view of replies to parliamentary questions from me and other representatives whereby the Minister endeavoured to justify the closure of 65 beds at <Col N="325" /> Roscommon County Hospital, is there now an admission on the part of the Minister for Health of being misled in his figures and calculations two years ago in this regard, in view of the provision of 20 additional beds now?</P>
    <P>I have the figures which were quoted by the CEO at the last Western Health Board meeting on 5 January.  It would appear that while there was great overcrowding in the medical ward the surgical ward was half empty.  Those are the figures give by the CEO and it is difficult to understand why an additional 20 beds were just put, <i>ad lib</i>, into the hospital. Or, is a new faculty coming to the hospital? Will there be an additional service there?  This is something I would like the Minister to deal with in his reply.  Will there be a paediatric unit in Roscommon hospital?  Rumour has it that there may be.  Again, I would like clarification.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to recent statements by the Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Marketing, Deputy Leyden, concerning the precise status of Roscommon County Hospital when he endeavoured to imply that were it not for his intervention as Minister of State, County Roscommon General Hospital would now be closed.  I feel it necessary to put on record this evening that the Minister did absolutely nothing on this issue and appeared to be totally helpless when the decision was taken by the executive of the Western Health Board to close Roscommon County Hospital.  It was I and the other Roscommon members of the Western Health Board who by lobbying our colleagues in Galway and Mayo, succeeded in transferring £½ million from the regional hospital budget in Galway in 1987 to Roscommon and it was that which protected Roscommon County Hospital even though it had only 60 beds.  Unfortunately, the transfer of funds was insufficient to retain any more and as a result we lost 65 beds in the hospital at that time along with the nursing and auxiliary staff.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea, this again in an ongoing chestnut since 1986.  The then Minister <Col N="326" /> for Health decided that acute psychiatry should no longer be carried out at St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea but rather at a new unit in Roscommon which has since been funded and has lain idle for the last three to four months.  Again it is no different from the mentally handicapped centre in Swinford which was completed in May 1985 and basically is lying idle.  There is accommodation for 200 mentally handicapped people and there are only 30 people in the whole building.  The cost per patient, because of the difficulty of heating the whole unit, of having lectures there to cater for maybe 100 residents when there are only 30, is an appalling scandal.  It is a reflection on the planning that has gone on in the health service that this huge white elephant should have been built there and there is no money to fund it.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record the wider ranging confusion that now exists about St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea, its patients, the range of services and staff arising out of the recently published reports in all areas of the media.  Initially, I wish to state that in June 1989, I issued a press release after consultation with my party leader, Deputy Alan Dukes, and our front bench spokesman, Deputy Ivan Yates, to the effect that St. Patrick's Hospital should be retained for the provision of high support hostel accommodation for psycho-geriatric patients and a psycho-geriatric section and that the administration of psychiatric services for County Roscommon should remain in Castlerea.  Naturally, I welcome the statements which have been issued since. Since that time, having regard to the policy of the Government from June to January when the Minister of State at the Department of Health visited Castlerea, where he met myself and other members of the health board, the whole purpose was to close down the hospital in Castlerea.  That was the purpose of the visit.  Since last June it has been quite evident that the Government were prepared to run down the Castlerea hospital. Moves were made to get CERT and FÁS involved in taking over the hospital in Castlerea and providing training courses <Col N="327" /> there.  This is something I certainly welcome because it would give a major injection of capital to Castlerea.  There would be lecturers and many students moving in there and I do not think there would have been any jobs lost on the psychiatric side the facilities been in position in Roscommon.  That is where the difficulties arose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foxe asserts that psychiatry will continue in Castlerea and that acute hostel accommodation will be provided in Castlerea.  I would like to know from the Minister is this the situation.  Will it be a new purpose-built acute hostel or a conversion of part of the building?  I would like to know why this line is apparently very acceptable now when such action was alien and unthinkable two years ago.</P>
    <P>The recent visit of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Treacy, to County Roscommon seemed to copperfasten the Fianna Fáil policy by virtue of having Roscommon as the centre of the principal psychiatric services both within the health institutions of the town and also the use of the county surgeon's residence as a high support hostel for long-stay psychiatric patients. There was also the provision of the alcoholic unit in the grounds of the hospital. This new unit was under construction at the time the Minister of State was there.  I would like the Minister of State at the Department of Health to specify precisely what will happen with that unit.  Will it remain in Castlerea? Will the new building that is provided in Roscommon lie vacant?</P>
    <P>In my role as Chairman of the Special Hospital Care Committee of the Western Health Board, I would like to be informed as speedily as possible of exactly what U-turn has taken place over the last 12 months.  As chairman of the committee dealing with special hospital services, as yet I do not know what exactly will be the future of psychiatric services in Roscommon.  The Minister might be able to clarify the matter here tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> I also want the Minister to inform the House of the precise steps being taken to improve the geriatric services in County Roscommon and, indeed, in the whole Western Health Board area.  As the Minister is well aware, my committee sought an additional £400,000 to improve the level of nursing care.  In very many of our hospitals the level of nursing care is below a safe standard at present simply because there are more dependent patients due to the admissions policy that has been operating in the Western Health Board over the last number of years.  The number of staff has decreased and the number of dependent patients has increased.  We need immediate additional funding for geriatric hospitals, not alone in Roscommon but in the whole of the Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Repeated references are made by the Minister to community care services, with the result that I sometimes feel that he is out of touch with the major reduction that has taken place in the Western Health Board in this area of activity.  Is the Minister aware of the high level of emigration from County Roscommon and the resulting pressures on care for elderly patients?  The situation has been reached in Roscommon that there is massive emigration which creates major problems for elderly persons living alone.  Their families have emigrated and they are now dependent on either being admitted to the geriatric hospital if they are lucky enough to get in, or on getting into private homes or, alternatively, they have to depend on the Western Health Board service of the district nurse and so on.  Due to the serious cutbacks that have taken place over the past number of years, that service has been run down and together with the high emigration it has caused major problems for elderly people in remote communities in County Roscommon.  I appeal to the Minister to see what can be done for these forgotten people.  It is equally important that their needs and their requirements are looked after.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> There are a couple of further questions I would like to ask with regard to the costing of this reputed package.  Could the Minister give us an accurate costing of this package?  I understand that it is somewhere in the region of £1.8 million, between the retention of St. Patrick's, the provision of an additional 20 beds in Roscommon and the provision of additional nursing staff together with other back-up staff.</P>
    <P>Again, I wonder if the Minister is aware of the fear being expressed by GPs and consultants in Roscommon of not being able to get an anaesthetist to work in a single practice such as exists in Roscommon.  There is grave concern on the part of GPs and consultants that it will not be possible to fill the post.  The only way they see it being filled is by having a second post of surgeon provided in Roscommon.  They do not see the post being filled without there being two surgeons operating in Roscommon.  I would ask the Minister if he or his Department have given this matter any consideration or examined the danger of not being able to fill this post that will become vacant at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In the Foxe deal there was also mention of extra specialist cover.  I would like the Minister to inform the House as to what precisely is meant there.  Is it envisaged that this cover would be provided in the Western Health Board?  What type of cover are we talking about?  Is it now the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing again in the Department of Health to have a link-up with Ballinasloe, to have a sort of federation between Roscommon and Ballinasloe?  Some people seem to indicate that that may be the case.  Again, I hope the Minister in replying will take the opportunity to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned earlier, I would like the Minister to state whether the additional beds are being put into the hospital or are they for a specific purpose. Have the Department examined the possibility of having them defined as a particular type of bed, as an additional <Col N="330" /> service in the hospital, rather than just having 20 additional beds?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate clearly, first, the costings of this package and, secondly, a time-scale for it.  When will it come into being?  Are we talking about three months or six months?  I understand the temporary position has been advertised. When will the extra beds be provided in the hospital?  I understand certain capital works have to be carried out in the hospital to make room for those additional beds.  When will the new acute psychiatric unit be opened in the County Hospital which has been ready and vacant there for the last four months?  I ask the Minister to give the dates for the implementation of all the issues I have raised.  What will be the time-scale?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised in a way at Senator Naughten because listening to him you would think he believes that something has been put in place of which he disapproves. Then further on there seems to be a contradiction because he seems to feel that everything that is being put in place in Roscommon is necessary.  As far as I am concerned, I want to achieve improvements in the health services in County Roscommon similar to other areas where problems arise from time to time.</P>
      <P>I had discussions with representatives of health boards and with public representatives not alone from Roscommon and indeed the Western Health Board area, but from every other health board.  I have discussed the development of health services in County Roscommon with a number of public representatives, including the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, Senators Mullooly and Finneran and Deputy Foxe, with Senator Doherty, as chairman of the Western Health Board, and the chief executive officer on a number of times and agreement has been reached on the nature of such developments in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I want to assure the Senator <Col N="331" /> and the Chamber of my commitment to the continuation of services at Roscommon General Hospital.  The Senator has been a little unfair to Deputy Leyden who was Minister of State in 1987 when rationalisation of the acute hospital service was taking place.  As Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Leyden made me very much aware of the need to retain Roscommon hospital as a general hospital providing acute surgical and acute medical services.  I was very impressed by the arguments he made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the responsibility of the health board and the responsibility of the Department of Health, there seems to be confusion about the date when the transfer will take place of the acute psychiatric unit to Roscommon.  We, in the Department, would not finalise that date. I understand that discussions are going on between the Western Health Board and the stafff about the move to Roscommon of the acute psychiatric unit.</P>
    <P>As an indication of my commitment to the continuation of services in Roscommon, I might say that in February 1989, I approved a request from the Western Health Board to proceed with their application to Comhairle na nOspidéil for the replacement of the anaesthetist at Roscommon General Hospital when the present incumbent retires.  I have also arranged to expand services at the general hospital to include the appointment of a physican, the provision of 20 additional beds with appropriate staffing and also the opening of the acute psychiatric unit.</P>
    <P>My Department had ongoing discussions with the Western Health Board regarding the provision of services at this hospital.  There is no doubt that the occupancy levels at the hospital over the past few years indicate that the level of services provided is about right, but it is always difficult to get this balance exactly right since we cannot always predict what will happen in advance.  However, I am aware of an increase in patient numbers <Col N="332" /> over the last couple of months.  This has put a strain on the staffing and on the board's resources.</P>
    <P>This recent surge in patient numbers has been investigated by my Department. In the case of Roscommon General Hospital, the board were in a position to defer certain elective surgical procedures and use the bed facilities for the extra medical patients.  The board responded to the exceptional demand for services by the flexible utilisation of resources where this could be facilitated and additional staff were employed as considered necessary. This flexibility in approach to a problem is to be commended.  The overall position regarding the level of services provision is a matter for ongoing contact and discussion between officers of my Department and officials of the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to the continuance and maintenance of a general hospital service at Roscommon.  I believe that the hospital provides a valuable service to the area and is of vital importance to the catchment population in that part of the Western Health Board.  I have always maintained that view about Roscommon General Hospital.  I hope that the beds will be used &mdash; indeed I intend that the beds will be used &mdash; as an assessment and rehabilitation unit having regard, as Senator Naughten said, to the increasing number of elderly people in Roscommon and the increasing percentage of the population who are elderly not alone throughout the Western Health Board area but throughout the country generally.</P>
    <P>In relation to the psychiatric services in County Roscommon, it would be helpful if I outlined for Senators the Government's overall policy in relation to the development of our psychiatric services. I am sure Senators are aware of the report on the psychiatric services <i>Planning for the Future</i>, which recommended the establishment of a comprehensive community-based psychiatric service in each health board area.  The policy outlined in <Col N="333" /> this report has been accepted by successive Governments as representing a professional and humane approach to the treatment and care of people with psychiatric problems.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board have responsibility for the management of psychitric services in County Roscommon. The board have taken a decision to develop their psychiatric services in accordance with the policy outlined in the document <i>Planning for the Future</i>.  The service developments in County Roscommon involve the provision of a new 30-bed psychiatric unit at the County Hospital in Roscommon.  I have provided the necessary capital resources to enable this unit to be completed and the Western Health Board have agreed to open it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our policy of developing community-based psychiatric services, a range of back-up facilities, such as supported hostels, day centres, workshops and community residences, have been put in place in various locations throughout County Roscommon. Accommodation for the elderly at the Sacred Heart Home will be upgraded and certain psychiatric services at St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, will be retained.  A sector headquarters, day centre and workshop will be provided in Castlerea.  On the point made by Senator Naughten about the delivery of services generally in Roscommon and the relationship to other hospitals, something that I have been saying over the last three years is that a hospital can no longer remain working in total isolation from other hospitals in the region and that there must be links between the hospitals. The day is gone when hospitals can totally ignore what is going on around them.  We must have co-operation and co-ordination of services between the hospitals, whether they are hospitals under the aegis of the health boards or voluntary hospitls.  I would see that applying in the Western Health Board area as it does in <Col N="334" /> other areas and, indeed, we have established a committee, the Kennedy Coordinating Group, to ensure that that happens in the Dublin area because of the situation in Dublin where five of the major providers of acute hospital services are under different management.  That is a policy, that there would be co-operation and co-ordination between all the hospitals and that would apply to Roscommon the same as to anywhere else.</P>
    <P>With regard to cost, we are having discussions with the Western Health Board about the overall cost of providing all their services generally in the Western Health Board in 1990.  I am also committed to the principle of providing service within the limits of the expenditure which the State can afford.  In this context I am confident that the overall policy of the Government will ensure the maintenance of existing levels of service and as each passing year brings greater economic success and stability will provide us with the means to enhance our services in keeping with modern day needs and demands.</P>

      <P>It is normal procedure of the House that a Senator is allowed one question.  With regard to the cost and time-scale, was the figure of cost approximately £1.8 million?  Is that the cost for a full year?  What is the time-scale for the appointment of a physician and providing the additional beds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Western Health Board I am sure the Senator is competent to work out the cost.  He is not dependent on his management. It is not anything like the figure he mentions to provide a physician, 20 beds and to staff 20 beds in a hospital. St. Patrick's is operating at the moment. <Col N="335" /> I understand St. Patrick's has the longest-stay patients in the world.  To keep patients there, who have been there for the past 20 years, the money is provided; there is not an increased cost for that.  On the question of the appointment of the physician, a temporary post was advertised about a week ago.  Obviously, as soon as the applications are in and processed a physician will be appointed there <Col N="336" /> but in the future following the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal, a permanent appointment will be made and there will not be any delay with that.  However, these things, of themselves, do take some time.</P>
