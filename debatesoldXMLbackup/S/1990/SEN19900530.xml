      <P>I have notice from Senators Tom Raftery and Liam Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, they propose to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the damage being caused to the economy both locally and nationally by the dispute at Waterford Glass, the need for the Minister for Labour to make every effort to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the construction of a community school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Raftery, Cosgrave and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senators Raftery and Cosgrave and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Neville may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business for today is item No. 1: the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1988, Committee Stage, from now until 6 p.m.: and from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. the Second Stage of the Turf Development Bill, 1988, item No. 4 on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business &mdash; this is becoming a sad ritual &mdash; I would like to put on the record of the House the abhorrence of my group, and I am sure of all the House, of the brutal, psychopathic killing on the continent of Europe this week of two innocent young Australians, the sorrow and sadness we all feel at what has happened and our sympathy to their bereaved families.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, there are a number of brief points.  We have agreed there be no Private Members' time this evening and that three hours be taken next week.  I would like to commend to the Leader of the House the idea that we might have a separate Private Members' time, a complete Private Members' time each week, that would be taken as a whole, whether for two hours, two and a half hours or three hours, and that we discontinue the practice of Private Members' time stretching over two weeks.  There are few enough opportunities for the groups to avail of this facility and I think it would be welcomed, not least among the ranks of the party opposite.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could give me information on a matter about which I asked him last week, item No. 30 on the Supplementary Order Paper.  Will he be able to give us a time for the proposed discussion on events in the Middle East?</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to ask urgently that time be made available either tomorrow, or at the earliest next week, to discuss the implications of Deputy Burke's smash and grab raid on RTE and the blatant attack on one of the great success stories of RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I support the Leader of Fine Gael in asking the Leader of the House to guarantee us that we will have an opportunity to have a serious debate on the Middle East?  I understand that it has been postponed, but I would be most grateful for such an opportunity.</P>
      <P>Since we are taking item No. 4, will the Leader of the House give us notice if there are any amendments to that Bill?  I heard a rumour that they were going to take £3 million off Bord na Móna and give it to the private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is nobody in this House who does not condemn in the strongest possible terms what happened in Holland, the callous butchery that we witnessed there and I am sure all of us extend our sympathy to the family, friends and associates of Stephen Melrose and Nick Spanos.  It is important to remember their names.  Those whose indifference to human life brings such discredit to all of us who are Irish only make that indifference far worse by describing the incident as a &ldquo;tragic mistake&rdquo;. To describe it as a mistake does not make it any more excusable in any sense whatsoever.  I really fail to understand how cowards, who appoint themselves as judge, jury and executioner of innocent victims, can have the temerity to seek the refuge of the law and the Constitution when they are faced with penalties which are far less serious than a firing squad.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would make time available at the earliest possible moment to have a debate on what amounts to the destruction of RTE Radio 2 which was announced this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider giving appropriate time so that we can have a discussion on a very important matter, as far as I am concerned as a member of a local authority &mdash; and so many of us here are members of local authorities &mdash; namely, the purported reform of the powers, functions and financing of local authorities throughout this country.  This House has a very important, significant and paramount role to play in this.  In view of the fact that you have a commission examining these matters at the moment, you have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I will conclude a Chathaoirligh, but I am sure I would have the almost unanimous support of this House in having an early debate on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I will conclude, voice to those who hope that an early opportunity will be granted for a full debate on the Middle East.  I would like to support Senator Manning in what he said about the necessity for capitalising on the opportunities for Private Members' time.  It was a valuable suggestion: that there should be Private Members' time on a different topic each <Col N="461" /> week and perhaps the Leader of the House will bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>I understand, Sir, that you have not allowed any debate on Deputy Burke's proposals, and I am sure that is correct. I have to say I recall a moment here when members of The Workers' Party were accused of taking over Radio Éireann.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to join with all those who have spoken on the abhorrent killings in Holland at the weekend and to say I am very glad you allowed a small degree of latitude so that the feelings of the House could be placed on the record. I was at a European conference in Copenhagen on the European Convention on Human Rights this weekend and may I tell the House, through you Sir, that the name of Ireland certainly suffered very considerably during that weekend and I spent a lot of time explaining the attitudes of what I felt to be ordinary decent Irish people, whose army the IRA most definitely is not.  We have an Army of whom we can be proud.  They engage in peacekeeping operations, They bring credit and honour and respect to ths country and, without using words like &ldquo;monstrous&rdquo; which are ineffective, I hope that perhaps after this event, whether it be a mistake or a tragedy or whatever, the IRA may be called to think again by the strong statements from here and the feelings of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the idea of a full debate with regard to proposals the Minister, Deputy Burke, has put forward in regard to Radio 2.  There are many people on this side of the House who would also like to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Norris has said.  The Seanad seems to be much travelled these days.  I have just returned from southern Holland and was there in the vicinity when this terrible tragedy occurred.  To be there with members of all the EC countries, the EFTA countries and indeed some <Col N="462" /> eastern European countries, it is quite difficult to explain the shame one feels in a situation like that.  Unfortunately, the name of this country is sullied by these people.  If only they could in any way be brought to understand the damage they do to the reputation of this country.  We must do everything we can to ensure that this force for evil is defeated, and defeated constitutionally.  I would support any move there would be in this House to have a discussion on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to raise my voice against the dastardly murder in Holland in the course of the week, the insanity of what happened there.  I am pleased to hear also that the Leader of the House is thinking of bringing in Private Members' time that would be separate from the traditional one in the party context. It certainly would be a way of expediting the business and dealing with issues that have been raised virtually every single day in the Seanad.  May I suggest that he would first address the disposing of the Supplementary Order Paper and perhaps consolidating some of the items and deal with that as urgently as possible?  Might I also suggest to the Leader of the House, that, since the Dáil was unable to put together a committee on crime in the course of the past two weeks, this House would be very anxious and desirous of putting together such a committee and that the matter is deserving of attention from this House.  I would be extremely critical of the attempt by the Minister for Communications to destroy Radio 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to join in condemning the summary execution of two innocent Australians by people who do it in the name of the Irish Republican Army.  They have done a lot of damage to this country.  These are the same people who call for mercy, recognition <Col N="466" /> and support.

      <P>Like the other speakers, I think we should never lose an opportunity of condemning the IRA for the callous murders they have continually committed.  It does not make any difference whether the people they murder are from the North or from Britain, Australia or, as in the past, from America and Germany.  We should use every opportunity to condemn these people. They do not represent us.  They are making it very difficult for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to try to deal with the British and the people of Northern Ireland to get a solution to the problems that beset this country.  They are doing no good for anybody and we should all join in continual condemnation of what they do.</P>
      <P>I am sure the opportunity for a debate on the Middle East is not going to be missed by the House.  What is happening there has to be debated.  There are a number of topics that need to be addressed, not alone the topic of the <i>intafada</i> but the extension of the protest against the Israeli Government.</P>

      <P>Comments have been made on all sides of the House about the execution of the two Australian tourists. As a former emigrant, I am acutely aware of the impact that atrocities of this nature have on the ethnic population, as it is known &mdash; our own people &mdash; in the UK. It has now spread out of Europe to Australia where many thousands of Irish people live.  Anybody who has read the newspapers or listened to the radio and television reports during the past 24 hours could not have been but deeply affected by the reaction of the immediate families. I seek your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, as to whether it is in order for me to request the Leader of the House, on behalf of all sides of this House, to send a resolution to our opposite numbers in the Australian Senate expressing the sorrow of this <Col N="467" /> House and that of the nation to be conveyed to the families.  Is it in order for me to do so?</P>

      <P>Finally, coming as I do from County Leitrim, let me say decisions have been announced by the ESB during the past few days.

      <P>Senator Manning rightly expressed his abhorrence at the killing of two Australians in Holland.  Certainly, all of us on this side of the House, and indeed the entire House, share that view.  He also raised the question of a separate Private Members' time each week, of between two to three hours.  I am not sure if this will happen, but certainly we will think about it and come back to him on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Senator also made reference to item No. 30 on the Order Paper.  I will have that matter checked out as quickly as possible.  It is my information that the precise implications of the judgement of the European Court in the Norris case are being considered in the Department of Justice.  The Law Reform Commission who are also examining this matter indicated in their recently published consultation paper what legislative changes might be made so as to comply with the ruling of the court.  The Commission's final recommendations, which are expected shortly, will be considered by the Government when they come to decide on what proposals should be put before the Oireachtas on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning and other speakers asked for a debate on the Middle East. It was our intention to have a debate on that matter this evening but unfortunately both the Minister, Deputy Collins, and the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, as well as their officials are not available.  However, I give an assurance to the House that we will discuss that matter next week.  Whether this takes the form of a debate or statements, is a matter for us to decide.  Apart from raising that matter, Senator Ryan also <Col N="469" /> raised the question of amendments to the Turf Development Bill.  They will not be taken today but rather some time in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the tragedy in Holland, as did Senator Upton who, along with Senator Manning and other Senators, raised the question of the position of RTE having regard to the statements made last night.  I can tell the House that the legislation on this matter will be published this week and will be debated next week in the other House.  I expect this legislation to be debated in this House in two or three weeks time, certainly well before the end of this session.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy raised the question of local government reform but that is not a matter appropriate to the Order of Business.  Senator Norris referred to the killings in Holland, to Private Members' time and the Middle East, which I have referred to, while Senator Eoin Ryan referred to the position of RTE, which I have commented on.  Senator Martin Cullen referred to the killings in Holland while Senator Costello made reference to a number of matters.  On the question of crime and prisons, I have taken on board the request made by Senator Costello last week, and I am endeavouring to have a debate on it.  Indeed, on Monday last in a telephone conversation with Senator Manning I indicated I was anxious to facilitate a debate, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Senators Cassidy, Ó Foighil, McKenna, McGowan, Lanigan and Mooney raised matters not relevant to the Order of Business as did Senator Hugh Byrne who made reference to the IRA killings and the ramming of Irish trawlers, but as the Cathaoirleach has said, that matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>The 1963 Planning Act does not provide a definition of &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; although the term occurs in section 45 which deals with tree preservation orders.  The absence of an express definition does not appear to have affected the operation of that provision.  For this reason I do not believe a special definition of &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; is required in the Bill.  I have sought the parliamentary draftsman's advice on this point and he agrees that a definition is unnecessary.  I should also point out that English planning legislation uses the term &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; without according it a special definition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Naughten's amendment seeks to apply the provisions of this Bill to any compensation claims arising from the 1963 Act still being processed when this Bill comes into operation. The transitional arrangements of this Bill follow the general principle of section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, that the repeal of the previous statute should not affect any right accrued under that statute, given that the right to planning compensation arises from an adverse planning decision.  The provisions of the 1963 Planning Act would apply to any claim arising from a planning decision made before the enactment of the present Bill.  The new Act will apply to all claims arising from planning decisions made after this.  I should emphasise that planning decision in this context means the final or definitive planning decision.  If a decision of a planning authority is under appeal to An Bord Pleanála it is the decision of the board and the date of this decision which will be relevant for planning compensation purposes.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 3 (2) it is my understanding that the older rules will continue to be applied in cases involving compulsory purchase orders and purchase notices.  If a developer is refused permission by a local authority, is it the case that the developer would proceed in seeking compensation by way of publishing a purchase notice?  In other <Col N="472" /> words, he would insist on the local authority purchasing the land under the old valuation rules.  It is most unsatisfactory that the older rules would be applied in cases involving CPOs or purchase notices under section 29 of the 1963 Act.  Am I correct in saying that?</P>

The purchase notice will be, as the Minister has said published under the old Act.</P>

All claims for compensation will be dealt with under this Bill.  Some Members expressed concern about the Minister of the day having <Col N="473" /> a right to decide if compensation is due to landowners, but I want to make it quite clear there neither I nor the Minister of the day would have the final say on the amount of the compensation to be paid. This would be decided either by agreement or at arbitration as provided for under the 1963 Act.  I will be dealing with this matter in a very comprehensive reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) No person shall be entitled to make a claim for compensation who has failed and is still failing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to fully comply with the conditions of another of previous planning permission,</P>
      <P>(b)  to provide security for such completion,</P>
      <P>(c)  to fully comply with a notice served under section 35 of the Principal Act, or</P>
      <P>(d)  to fully comply with any court order obtained against him arising from a failure to comply with the conditions of another or previous planning permission.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section a person shall include a company which is a subsidiary of or an associate company of any such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of this section each local authority shall prepare and <Col N="474" /> maintain a register in respect of all persons who have failed&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to comply with the conditions of another or previous planning permission in connection with the completion of a housing estate,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to provide security for such completion,</P>
    <P>(iii)  to comply with a notice served under section 35 of the Principal Act, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  to comply with any court order obtained against him by a local authority on foot of a planning permission.</P>
    <P>(4)  A register maintained under this section shall be made available for inspection free of charge by members of the public at all reasonable times.</P>
    <P>(5)  Upon a person named in the register for failing to comply with planning conditions imposed fully complying with such conditions, such person's name shall be removed from the register in so far as it relates to the particular development in respect of which planning conditions have been complied with.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We very often come across in cities and towns, cases of developers seeking planning permission and carrying out part of the development but often it is practically impossible to get that development fully completed, with service roadways, footpaths, sewers left half-finished and the developer moving on to seek planning permission elsewhere, perhaps under the name of another company.</P>
    <P>Each of us with experience of local authorities finds this situation arising from time to time.  It would be grossly unfair that that particular company or individual, or an individual who would have a share in one or other companies which was guilty of those irregularities, could be in a position to claim compensation, without providing security for completing such work.  I think it is important that security is put up to complete the work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> Paragraph (c) reads: &ldquo;To fully comply with a notice served under section 35 of the Planning Act&rdquo;.  Again, it would be very important that this provision would be strictly adhered to.  Paragraph (d) reads: &ldquo;To fully comply with any court order obtained against him arising from a failure to comply with the conditions of another or previous planning permission&rdquo;. We have come across cases where developers have failed to comply with the terms of the planning permission, despite numerous requests to do so by the local authority or court proceedings been undertaken.  It would be criminal if those people were able to claim compensation without first complying with the terms of planning permission in respect of another development.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (2) reads: &ldquo;For the purpose of this section a person shall include a company which is a subsidiary of or an associated company of any such person&rdquo;. It is equally important that that be enshrined in this legislation.  Paragraph (3) reads: &ldquo;For the purpose of this section each local authority shall prepare and maintain a register in respect of all persons who have failed to comply&rdquo; with the conditions of another planning permission. The general public should be in a position, if they so wish, to check out if a company or individual, on applying for planning permission, has failed to comply with the conditions of a previous planning application.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, very often we have come across cases where this happened. We should take the opportunity in this Bill to ensure that it does not continue to happen.  Paragraph 3 (i) reads: &ldquo;To comply with the conditions of another or previous planning application in connection with the completion of a housing estate&rdquo;, while paragraph (ii) reads: &ldquo;To provide security for such completion&rdquo;.  If security is put up for such completion, or if agreement is reached with the local authority concerned that they would be compensated for completing such that would be reasonable.  Paragraph (iv) reads: &ldquo;To comply with any court order <Col N="476" /> obtained against him by the local authority on foot of planning permission&rdquo;. That clearly specifies what I have in mind in proposing the subsection.</P>
    <P>A register should be maintained by the local authority and available for inspection by the general public to establish if a company had failed to comply with the terms of planning permission.  Paragraph (5) reads: &ldquo;Upon a person named in the register for failing to comply with planning conditions imposed fully complying with such conditions, such person's name shall be removed from the register in so far as it relates to the particular development in respect of which planning conditions have been complied with&rdquo;.  It is only right and proper that that subsection should be included also.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill that has been strengthened by the incorporation of the amendments and suggestions from various sources, so the Minister is obviously willing to consider, as he has normally shown himself to be, amendments that strengthen the legislation.  It seems clear to me that this amendment is a good one, particularly from the point of view of the public, of those who have been placed in a situation where they have acquired a house on a housing estate which has not been brought to the proper standard of completion in terms of services, paths, all the things for which the builder is responsible.  It would be very galling for people who have been placed in that position by an unscrupulous developer to find they have to stand silently by and witness public moneys being dispersed to an unscrupulous developer who has left a trail of incomplete developments behind him in this area.  This is a good amendment. I certainly feel that the principle of it is strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may nit-pick just slightly, I rather wish there were not two split infinitives in the wording.  Perhaps, if it is accepted, the Minister will change it to read &ldquo;to comply fully&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;to fully comply'.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal point I wanted to make was, just as a matter of principle, it would be very unfortunate and unfair for people, who have been badly treated by a developer, to be forced to witness public funds being dispersed in a compensation claim to allow them to go on until that first error is expunged. The case was well argued by Senator Naughten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is an extremely important one and I support the remarks made by my colleague, Senator Norris.  This is an extremely difficult problem for local authorities who constantly find themselves, in spite of their best endeavours, with unfinished housing estates, and despite provision being made for open spaces no such open spaces are being made available for the enjoyment of the people of the area.  Provisions relating to bonds and security have been introduced but in many instances there are unsatisfactory and inadequate in dealing with this very serious complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As members of local authorities are <Col N="478" /> aware, one of the biggest areas of complaint from constituents is that of unfinished estates.  If a developer, having failed to complete adequately one development, looks for permission for another development and we try to persuade our planning officials to take into account the fact that he failed to complete adequately a previous development, we are simply told this cannot be done, that we are only allowed to consider the granting of planning permission in the context of the proper planning and development of the area and other extraneous factors, such as the previous record of a developer, simply cannot be taken into account.</P>
    <P>This amendment would strengthen the powers of local authority.  As has been said, it is extremely galling to see moneys being paid out of the public purse to a developer, who has quite clearly failed to fulfil his obligations, and who has shortchanged the local authority and the community in general.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment very seriously. I think the spirit of the amendment is extremely valuable and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seem to relate as much to general considerations of planning enforcement as they do to planning compensation.  They provide for a bar on compensation claims by persons who have infringed planning requirements and for refusal of permission without compensation on the grounds that the person involved has been entered on an appeals register by the planning authority.  The names of persons would be entered on this register where they have breached certain planning requirements, particularly those relating to the completion of housing estates.  The establishment of an appeals register of this kind by an administrative authority has obvious implications for natural justice, particularly in the area of personal rights.  As the amendment stands, a person contravening certain planning requirements would over and above any of the penalties imposed by the courts have to suffer the stigma of entry on a register in addition to being <Col N="479" /> debarred from access to planning compensation which would remain available to others.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I see these amendments as being concerned primarily with the enforcement of the planning laws.  While I appreciate the concern expressed by the Senators that planning requirements should be adequately enforced and should be seen to be observed, I do not believe that this Bill is an appropriate context in which to address enforcement issues.  However I will be examining the whole question of enforcement when the Bill has been enacted and I will give careful consideration to the views which the Senators have expressed.</P>
      <P>When I came to the Department a year ago, the Minister and I asked local authorities to take certain precuations in regard to unplanned estates; there are ways and means open to them to do that. I am glad to say that in recent times the situation has improved dramatically.  I admit, there was some laxity and estates should have been looked after in a better way by the local authority concerned. Recently I have had complaints that the conditions attaching to planning permission for the erection of private housing estates have been very strict.  In other words, strict conditions were laid down and had to be adhered to in regard to bonding and other financial arrangements. I agree that that should be the case.  There has been a vast improvement in this connection.  I am examining this matter and when the Bill comes into operation we will be again consulting with all local authorities because they have the necessary powers to tighten up procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to go overboard on this.  We must strike a balance.  Common sense must prevail.  Some housing estates in the past left a lot to be desired but there has been a vast improvement.  I would not like to penalise any person.  If a company is responsible there will be a remedy under company law.  I may be straying a bit here, a Chathaoirligh.  Forgive me, if I am.  Under company law this can be attended to.  I will keep the views <Col N="480" /> of Senators in mind and I fully appreciate them.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's reply.  I quite understand Senator Naughten's concern because we have all had the experience in our constituencies of a contractor moving and leaving work to be done.  Senator Howard will be familiar with the kind of housing estates I am now talking about.  I think it is too strong to ask the Minister to insert an amendment to section 5 of the Bill to put in place a register which members of the public could inspect free of charge.  It is very severe of Senator Naughten to ask the Minister to accept that amendment.  A contractor may make a mistake, whether in regard to local government housing or a private housing estate, but to put a register in place for inspection by the public on which a name would be registered forever as having done something wrong, is very strong.  I would request that that part be thought about again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I clearly stated in the latter part of the amendment that when a person complied with the regulations, the name would be deleted from the register.  While I welcome the principle in what the Minister has said, that the would be prepared to look at this, I regret that it is not enshrined in legislation.  We in this House are very familiar with the principle of natural justice.  It is going a bit too far to suggest that somebody who would not have completed a development in the manner in which it should have been completed and in the manner for which he got planning permission, whether it be failure to provide public lighting, failure to provide proper roadways, failure to provide footpaths, could get compensation through being a director of another company, maybe the chief shareholder of another company or, in fact, the same company, that is wrong.  It is that aspect that I wished to address when I put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan has referred to particular cases that she and Senator Howard were aware of &mdash; Senator Finneran and I would be equally aware of <Col N="481" /> situations further north &mdash; where housing developers have sold houses on the strength of providing a certain level of service and just moved off, leaving no roadways, no footpaths, no public lighting and, indeed, not even proper storm water drainage.  That is unforgiveable.  To think that those people could be allowed to receive compensation for another planning application not having completed a planning development they were involved in prior to that, would be pretty frightening.</P>
    <P>This is what I am trying to get at here. I am not trying to pick holes in the legislation just for the sake of doing so.  I am trying to protect the general public and the many householders who have been caught with big loans and who have perhaps, to move because of a change of job and have to sell the house.  They bought the property on the clear understanding that the roadways, footpaths and all the other services would be provided.  Now they have to put the house on the market but cannot guarantee that the services will be provided.  In that case there may be a reduction of 25 per cent in the value of the house.  That is criminal.  I know of situations where people purchased a house, had been approved for a loan but were unable to get the loan because roadways and pathways were not finished. The house purchaser had to negotiate bridging finance while the developer moved off and developed another site. That is not good enough and it is what I am trying to deal with in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Senator Naughten's concern as a local authority member, like myself, with regard to the register.  There certainly have been a lot of fly-by-night builders in the last few years and that is obvious in a number of local authority areas.  I would say to Senator Naughten that if a register is compiled then when a person complies with the conditions attached to the planning permission, his name should be removed from the register.  I do not see the purpose of having that register or black list because a black list of builders <Col N="482" /> is already in existence in each local authority and is taken into account every time a builder applies for planning permission.</P>

      <P>We should not depart from Senator Naughten's amendment without teasing it out further.  I was strongly impressed by the number of points Senator Naughten made when he introduced his amendment.  When I listened to the Minister I thought there could be a point in what he described &mdash; and they are quite emotive words &mdash; as a penal list.  Then I realised that in most county councils there is already a list.  In some county councils the list is in five categories from the bad down to those for which there is a good prospect that they will put the estate in a satisfactory condition, given time.  These are debated in public and are publicised in full.  To what extent such lists are penal I do not know.  The Minister was probably using the words &ldquo;penal&rdquo; in relation to the fact that being on the list would bar compensation to persons who had not complied in full with the planning conditions in any development.  It may be that cases should be individually judged on merit but in the majority of cases, particularly those that have caused a lot of trouble, the reality is that developers have deliberately defaulted in completing to a satisfactory level the development they were involved in.</P>
      <P>We come on to Senator Naughten's last contribution where he said that it would be totally wrong &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that people who deliberately defaulted on their obligations to persons who purchased houses from them and, indeed, in relation to the planning conditions set by the local authority, should be in a position to apply for planning permission in respect of another parcel of ground or other sites and have that rejected and then be in a position to apply for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began by being strongly impressed by Senator Naughten.  I swung around when I heard the Minister's reply, which I thought was good, but then I realised that these lists already exist.  Senator Naughten is trying to safeguard against the <Col N="483" /> developer who deliberately sets out to cheat not only the planning authority but persons who purchase houses from him. I would suggest that there is quite a lot in the amendment and I would like to see it teased out further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has given an indication he will consider the general principles that are being outlined here this afternoon when he comes to look at the question of enforcement.  This is satisfactory but, like some of the other Senators, I would like to tease out the matter a little bit further so that the Minister can be quite clear in his mind of the concerns of Seanad Éireann in this matter.</P>
      <P>I have to say I am far from being concerned at the existence of this stigma for defaulting developers.  I feel that a stigma ought to be placed upon them.  I have no difficulty or diffidence with this word at all.  I doubt if a stigma on its own is sufficient, however.  Far from being too strong, it may be a little too weak because some of these persons are quite shameless. Otherwise, they could not virtually attack sections of the community in a vulnerable area, that is, the area of their single biggest investment when they are purchasing a home, and leave them in this unfortunate condition.  I am very happy that this stigma should apply to them.  The Minister is perhaps feeling too delicate towards their sensitivities.  A good strong stigma could be part of the remedy.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan also felt that some of these measures were very strong.  They need to be, if it is possible for them to be.  The Minister was almost suggesting there might be some legal impediment because he invoked principles of natural justice and so on.  I would like the Minister, if possible, to specify what particular legal difficulties might be involved here because there may be some principle of law of which I am completely unaware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the past, Ministers from all parties have been very delicate in this area because of a fear of breaching constitutional and natural justice even <Col N="484" /> though it was quite clear that they were not doing so in the opinion of experts, because a balance of principles came into play.  It is not just under the Constitution the question of personal rights arises.  The Minister really must bear this in mind and perhaps he has &mdash; that the public good is an important element.  Nobody has ever really added that consideration effectively into the balance of rights, that countervailing the personal rights of a developer as an individual, there is what I would consider to be an ever greater balance and, that is, the public good.  So that if there is a contest between these two, the right of the developer to compensation on the one part as against the rights of a considerable number of poorer people who are having their lives made a misery, then the personal individual right of the developer, which we acknowledge, has to cede to the right of the general public good.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that in analogous cases it is always possible to attach the earnings of a miscreant in law, so that the future earnings of somebody who has infringed or breached some part of the law can be taken from him by order of the courts.  I do not really understand; perhaps there is a principle that would be breached.  I am not sure what it is but I am quite sure that if there is, the Minister will be prepared to enlighten me on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Environment spokesman, Senator Naughten, in relation to his intent in principle in introducing the amendment. What has been said by previous speakers in the last few minutes in relation to the whole history of developers and the fact that there history cannot be taken into account when they make other applications is, along with compensation, the nub of the discussion.  We are all aware of cases where the innocent purchasers, who will be spending hard-earned money in repayment of a mortgage suddenly finds essential services such as footpaths and lights are not provided.  In my area people have been left without roads and literally up to their ears in mud.  Residents' associations have had to get <Col N="485" /> together to impose a voluntary levy on a house so that work can be carried out and the estate taken in charge.  The local authority cannot be expected to pick up the tab.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, it is only a certain number of developers who default but the incidents are sufficient to warrant careful consideration. It would be ludicrous if the same local authority were to pay out money to a developer who had defaulted. It may be another company that goes on in these cases.  Improvements in Company Law may go someway towards redressing the situation.  The fact is, building companies fold up and are wound up more quickly than the paint dries on the doors and windows of the estates.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten is trying in this amendment to put in a stay or set-off. There may be difficulties in relation to it but the Minister must be aware of the hardship that has arisen.  It would be ludicrous that a local authority should pay money to a person whom they had been chasing to try to get him to carry out major work.  As Senator Howard said, in the report on the taking in charge of estates there are about four or five categories varying from minor and major works outstanding, to court proceedings. Balance has to be maintained.  As has been said, the common good would not be served if a local authority hands out taxpayers' money to a developer who is giving the Harvey Smith sign to the same local authority.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to take on board the intention of the amendment, to try to deal with developers who default. There have been cases where people were left with the bond indemnifying the work. The situation has improved somewhat.</P>
      <P>All of this requires vigilance.  A developer as soon as he has sold his last house, goes off without doing with are relatively minor works but which can cause many problems for the people.  I would ask the Minister to consider the principle and intent behind the amendment.  He must have a certain amount of sympathy with it.</P>

      <P>Lest the feeling should be about that there is a monopoly of unfinished estates or unscrupulous builders in Dublin or the north or north-west, let me assure the House there are such estates and builders in equal numbers, in or maybe in even greater numbers, in County Wexford where estates are badly finished, lighting is insufficient, footpaths are just not provided and no effort is made to provide landscaping.</P>
      <P>I would accept the spirit of Senator Naughten's amendment.  Listening to the Minister, I am satisfied that he can put in place the procedures to resolve the problem and that is absolutely essential because various problems are caused by unfinished estates.  For instance, very recently a local tidy towns group felt cheated by the fact that an unfinished estate was commented on by judges.  I am satisfied with the Minister's assurance here that he will put procedures in place that will improve the situation.</P>

      <P>It is proposed in Senator Naughten's amendment to have a register of those developers who are behaving in what I might term a socially unacceptable way, defrauding the public of their rights and fooling the local authorities. If there is a stigma attached to them, it is quite right that it should.  I agree with Senator Naughten.  It is quite right that there should be a stigma attached to them because it is a most dishonest way to behave.  I cannot see why the Minister feels that this Bill, which deals with compensation only, cannot take account of this fact.  We are talking basically about the same matter. We are quite simply talking about the local authority who have given a planning permission to a developer to develop land within their area and the developer fails to comply with the planning terms, or fails to complete the estate and in so doing is defrauding the local authority of what they are rightly entitled to expect from him.  Why should it be so far removed from that when we ask that the same developer should not be entitled to receive moneys from the public purse in compensation for some other planning <Col N="487" /> permission which he has not been able to receive?  It seems to me that the two things are quite intimately allied and that there should be no difficulty in dealing with the matter here.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister saying that he is concerned about the whole question of enforcement.  It is certainly an area that needs a great deal of tightening up.  Senators have spoken about lists already in the county councils and one Senator said there was a list with five sections to it, from the real bad boys down to those who are guilty of only minor infringements.  It is wonderful to have these lists but what can we do about them?  We seem to be able to do precious little.</P>
      <P>In our local authority we have constantly requested our planning officials to take action when such a developer comes in again requiring some other permission even though he has flouted the law most flagrantly and most blatantly. We say, is this the same developer who did not finish the estate?  If I am incorrect in this I would like the Minister to correct me.  We are told that we must look at a planning application, we must have regard to the proper planning and development of the area, we cannot look at what the record of the developer is.  It seems to be quite outrageous but that is what our planning officials tell us, that we must have regard to the proper planning and development of the area.  Here we are asking the Minister to assist us in being allowed to deal with it in another way, which is, refusing to give them compensation.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to take this on board because there seems to be general agreement across the floor that this is a very serious matter.  It is one with which all local authorities have problems and we feel the remedy is in the Minister's hands and that he could assist us now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>All members of local authorities share the concern that has been expressed regarding unfinished <Col N="488" /> estates and unfinished building developments. As Senator Naughten, Senator Howard and others have said, we can all identify with situations where neither members of the local authority, the planning section nor indeed, the public who were the recipients of the abuse were happy</P>
      <P>The formulation of a register on the basis that is proposed will not solve anything. We have registers and lists in local authorities already.  Senator Foley has been the answer to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister homed in on what the answer is.  He mentioned enforcement and basically that is what it is about.  The Minister said that he would be looking at this area once the Bill has been enacted. I have no doubt that he will.  Indeed at the end of the day, with co-operation, understanding and consultation with local authorities the answer will lie in the conditions laid down in planning permission by the local authorities and proper enforcement.  The opportunity will be there and is there for local authorities to phase developments, to ensure that situations cannot develop unless certain conditions are met at a certain stage. In the end, it will come down to enforcement.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to go along fully with the Minister.  He has identified the answer. Consultation with local authorities and with ourselves as members of local authorities can indeed bring this situation to an end and provide the protection that we would like to see for the public in general when they buy property from any developer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Naughten's plea to the Minister for a tightening up of this law.  We have heard this debate a million times at county council meetings over the last number of years.  I agree with Senator Finneran who said that a phased development which is being brought in is an answer, by and large.  That has been not just the county council's way of dealing with the situation but now the public, <Col N="489" /> rather than going into 1,000 house complexes are looking for the closer identification possibly with small clusters, of, maybe, 100 or 200 houses.  The first phase of planning permission would be given and there should be a guillotine in relation to the second phase if the developer had not completed phase one.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have only a certain amount of control in that area.  We are talking about the environment and its destruction.  There is nothing as bleak or devastating as an unfinished estate and as Senator Cosgrave said, the situation is exacerbated during the winter months. When people look for an individual planning permission &mdash; they might be only changing the roof of their house &mdash; the county engineer and the neighbours will ensure that they keep exactly to the planning permission.  One can understand why people who have paid out vast sums of money to these developers are irate when they see the developers getting off scotfree and leaving unfinished business behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A register is essential.  I know Senators on the other side have said it is not a deterrent but it is a deterrent for the general public.  When somebody comes to an area they go to the county council and ask what is happening in, say, Castletroy, over the next number of years.  They also ask the names of the builders with an unblemished record, and of the fly-by-night operators.  If one goes through the list one certainly will not be caught by somebody who will swoop off and leave one mucking around in the dirt over the winter months, or even during the summer months as happened a couple of years back when Limerick County Council had to spend £30,000 of their own money to complete an estate.  They had enough to do in the area besides completing this fly-by-night builder's work. That builder took off and was never heard of since and the people there had to find all sorts of methods by which to clean their houses.  It was a long hot summer and that meant there was a lot of dust and dirt.  It was like the wild west or the dust bowl of the United States at the turn of the century. <Col N="490" /> We should not have to put up with this and the responsibility should not rest solely with the county councils.  They are doing their bit as regards phased planning permissions.  The general public are also doing their bit because they do not want to be caught up in these 1,000 house ghettoes which invariably are never completed. They want the small clusters of houses.</P>
    <P>Since I came into the Seanad on 1 November last, the Minister has listened with interest to all contributions and has taken our views on board.  He said he will look into the matter after the Bill has been passed but will that take years?  I hope not.  I would prefer if the Minister included this in the planning and development area because it is broad enough to encompass all of this.  It is a disturbing feature and the Minister should see that from the consensus among all speakers.</P>

      <P>This is an important topic, especially as most people purchase only one house in their lifetime.  It is the biggest decision that most married couples will ever take as it is where they will live for the rest of the lives.  The problems arise in all local authority areas; they are not just confined to one county. It is a major problem and no one wants to come to grips with it.  People are left with something that was not planned when planning permission was granted or when developers moved into areas.  We all know that it is as a result of downturns in the market that these problems arise. We know that from 1983 to 1987 the building industry was decimated, it was on its knees.  No one had the answers, no one could do anything about the problem.</P>

      <P>All these problems arose, from my experience of local authorities, since 1985 when there was a downturn in the market.  There are fantastic builders in Ireland and fantastic Irishmen building all over the world.  We hear about the dishonest builders but much of the dishonesty is not premeditated.  A lot of it just happens because of the downward trend in the market.  As I said before, it seems to happen at a certain period, perhaps once every ten years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposal before us for a register, this is a very specialised industry.  It is an area where county executives keep an eye on everything that goes on from county to county.  They liaise with their fellow county managers, county secretaries and county engineers. The Minister and the Minister of State know every secretary, county manager and county engineer after six months in the job.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is one of the most experienced ever to hold office.  Members on all sides of the House recognise how courteous and approachable he is when dealing with any queries.</P>
      <P>Bearing all that in mind I must listen to the advice of the experienced Minister of State with us today, I must accept his recommendation in relation to those matters.  He has come in here time and time again and has given us the benefit of his own experience.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I am concerned.  We have some of the best contractors in Europe and they have excellent staff.  They have proved their worth outside the country and at home. It concerns me that local authorities in general spend too much time inspecting private houses.  If somebody builds a bungalow they have to inspect everything, down to the gravel on the footpath. To qualify for a grant of any description one receives a call from maybe three inspectors, and this at enormous cost to the Minister's Department.  Some of our finest villages and towns have been adversely affected by the carry-on of some of the cowboy builders.  There are so many sides to this issue such as the black economy.  Many good, honest contractors go to the wall because they do everything according to the book while the fellow up the road does not play his part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must mention another body who have left eyesores all around this country and the Minister might have something to say about them.  The NBA have blighted many towns, as they did in my own town in south Tipperary but they were not brought to heel by the local authority. We do not need registers of any kind if local authority officials paid as much attention to the big developer as they do <Col N="493" /> to the small builder who builds a residence for a family and does not speculate on land or anything like that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concern expressed by most Senators.  It is a shame to see nice towns and villages destroyed by people not completing the work on the footpaths, lighting, etc.  Many people have a role to play including the planning section of the local authority and the Department of the Environment itself.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us when a housing estate is supposed to be finished.  They advertise a grant of £2,000 or £4,000 or whatever it is but they should not be allowed to publish that type of advertisement unless they have complied with all the planning conditions.  It is misleading the customer and the Department should lay down regulations forbidding such a promise to the would-be purchaser.  We all have a role to play and with a little goodwill we could get around the problems.  I hope we will not have any more problems in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the many Members who spoke on this and to refer them to page 22 of the Bill and the Fourth Schedule containing conditions which may be imposed on the granting of permission to develop land without compensation.  One provision refers to any condition determining the sequence in which works shall be carried out and specifying a period within which work shall be completed.  I do not want to be taken out of context because we are dealing in this Bill with compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Members spoke here in detail but they appear to be confused on many issues.  Let me explain something very clearly.  A local authority today has a right, when it is granting planning permission, to put in a condition that phase one of, say, a 20 house scheme, must be completed before they are sold.  The local authority can also put in a condition in the Schedule in regard to funding. Instructions to local authorities are that we must be severe on developers.  It is only right that if a developer builds houses in any planning authority he should comply with planning laws and the <Col N="494" /> laxity in previous years must be rectified. In every local authority there is a planning authority committee to deal with all this.  Generally, my own planning authority have a meeting every month where they discuss all major developments &mdash; indeed any development.  We get a list of what is planned for the county.  The planning authority members are very competent and they can bring that to the attention of the officials, the manager or the designated officer of the planning authority who give consent to the planning or whatever the case may be.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law, I will again get in contact with the local authorities explaining the position.  I do not like using the word &ldquo;penal&rdquo;, though I did earlier.  I do not like to do that because in general we have excellent builders, although there might be one or two black sheep, if those are the words to use.  I do not like using them either but I must if there is laxity in that regard.  Completed houses in regard to which the Department pay a grant are inspected by the inspector of the Department of the Environment and must meet all the conditions laid down.  The planning authority have the necessary powers in regard to private housing estates to enforce very strict laws.</P>
    <P>As I said, when this Bill is enacted I will see what further action I will take.  I will give that undertaking but I regret that I cannot accept Senator Naughten's amendment.  I want to be as helpful as I can and I will bear in mind the Senator's remarks.  Very constructive views were put forward here today and I accept many of the concerns expressed.  Senators can rest assured that the Minister and I will ensure that all necessary action is taken in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query on section 5.  First, I am glad the Minister and Senators Cassidy and Byrne drew attention to the fact that the problems in regard to unfinished estates were caused by a minority of developers and builders. Unfortunately, those bad apples have given a bad image to the building trade. We should balance our discussion here by recognising that some of the finest estates in our cities and towns have been completed by developers whose work is regarded not alone here but outside as examples of good development.</P>
      <P>Most of the discussions so far have been about developers and speculators. There is an obvious interest in this Bill and I regard it as a compensation Bill.  It crosses the divide to affect the interests of another category, that is, landowners. For that reason I intend to hold a watching brief and to ask questions in their interest as this measure goes through.  Therefore, under section 5 and, particularly, under condition No. 20 we are talking about compensation for the removal of a hedge.  What kind of a hedge are we talking about?  Are we talking about a decorative hedge around the front of a building or a fence around a farm?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about this.  Compensation claims of a very substantial nature already exist.  The claims that have been made in this city are the ones that <Col N="497" /> have generated interest and comment and the burden will fall on the local authority. However, should a smaller local authority, other than those that administer the city and county of Dublin, be confronted by a number of those claims some of which are already in the pipeline and not covered under this legislation, where will they find the finance, in view of the stringent circumstances which exist in so many counties?  Can they apply to the Minister's Department to bail them out?</P>

      <P>I understand the Senator's concern but she cannot have it both ways.  When a planning authority grant planning permission or refuse planning permission and there is an appeal, it goes to An Board Pleanála.  An Bord Pleanála are an independent body and they make the decision.  I would not like to interfere with them in any way.  Many Government Departments and local authorities have been blamed for interfering with various organisations.  The Minister, the local authority or a member should have power only when it suits them.  I am not referring to the Senator. I would not wish to get into that arena because then I would be putting down certain workers for An Bord Pleanála which I would not wish to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new Bill dealing with compensation.  While I will endeavour to accept what the Minister says in relation to not wishing to put any constraints on the Planning Appeals Board as they are a completely independent body, the reality is that the Planning Appeals Board do not have to pay the compensation.  Therefore, it is nice and easy for them, independent as they are, to say that.  That is not justifiable. Will the Minister stand over a case where non-compensatable reasons apply and the Planning Appeals Board neglect to include those and, thereby, leave the planning authority to pay the bill?  It is the local planning authorities who have to find the money for those compensation <Col N="499" /> claims. That is inexcusable and, in my view, it cannot be countenanced.  If non-compensatable reasons do not apply, so be it, but where they do apply it is unreasonable to expect the board to decide.  I refer back to the Roches Hill case and to the Grange Developments case.  I believe the Minister is incorrect in saying that the Planning Appeals Board are totally independent and outside every jurisdiction.  The Minister has the authority to direct the Planning Appeals Board in certain instances and he used that power in relation to shopping centres. In that instance the Minister issued guidelines to which the board had to have regard, so the Minister, when it suits him, can have jurisdiction over the Planning Appeals Board.  It is not an unjustifiable interference with the Planning Appeals Board simply to direct them that if there are non-compensatory reasons they include them and do not leave the local authorities to foot the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear on this.  The planning board of the day is completely independent.  I would not interfere or direct them in any way because the planning laws set it all down. Say a planning permission is granted by a local authority.  They often decide to delete the condition or put in another condition.  I have to accept their judgment because they are competent people.  Therefore, I would have to accept their views on the matter.  The Minister does not interfere with the planning board of the day.  I am not aware that any Minister has ever interfered with them.  When the planning is on appeal they have to decide that on their judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may come back on this, the reality is that the Minister did issue guidelines with regard to shopping centres.  He directed the Planning Appeals Board to have regard to them. It is easy to say they are independent. Would the Minister be satisfied if he knew that tomorrow the Planning Appeals Board put in a non-compensatable reason <Col N="500" /> where it applied and left a local authority to foot the bill?  Is the Minister happy with that situation?  I am not, and we could not be satisfied with it.  Just to say that the Planning Appeals Board are totally independent is fine.  I am not suggesting that they be interfered with when making a decision with regard to the rights and wrong of whether permission should be granted or not.  But to require them to put in a non-compensatable reason where it applies simply so that a developer will not get compensation to which he is not properly entitled, does not seem to me to be any infringement of their powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I did not explain myself in full.  Where there is a planning appeal to An Bord Pleanála, the local authority have a right to put their side of the case; the developer and land owners or anyone else also get that right. What more do we want?  We cannot have our loaf and eat it.  Firstly, we want independence and then somebody expects me &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;overturn&rdquo;&mdash; to interfere in the matter.  All the Minister has is the Act.  Our people here have an option which does not apply in other countries: they have the right to demand an oral hearing.  In many cases this is granted.  Then, if they are not pleased with the result of that, they have the option of going to the courts.  What more do we want?</P>
      <P>I am not going to interfere in any way with planning appeals.  I would not do it. I recall the time, when a Parliamentary Secretary was responsible with his officials, for refusing or granting a planning appeal &mdash; and God help him at the time.  He was not too popular.  That is why we brought in the Planning Appeals Board and gave it complete independence. I would not dream of interfering. It would be a grave step to take and completely undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put another query to the Minister.  I would ask him to confirm or otherwise that my understanding of subsection (4) is correct.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> Where, under section 29 of the Principal Act, it is the duty of a planning authority to acquire an interest in land, compensation under section 11 shall not be payable in relation to that interest.</P>
    <P>Section 11 dealt with compensation payable where planning permission is refused, or granted under such conditions as to make it inoperable.  Am I to understand, in regard to what subsection (4) is dealing with here, that if that particular piece of land is required by the local authority for some particular purpose &mdash; road widening, development or some such purpose &mdash; that the earlier compensation does not apply?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) provides that compensation shall not be payable in respect of any interest in land which it is the duty of the planning authority to acquire under section 29 of the 1963 Act. This duty arises only if the owner claims that the land is incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state and a purchase notice becomes effective requiring the planning authority to acquire the land.  It follows that, where both a purchase notice and a compensation claim are submitted by the owner of the land, the purchase notice must be disposed of first.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) again specifies a list of alternative developments. If, for example, planning permission is refused for a particular development, there is a list of alternative developments.  It is as if the planning authority were to say: &ldquo;Look, we are not allowing the development you applied for but we are prepared to admit or accept <Col N="502" /> that any of the following would be suitable development&rdquo; and in these circumstances compensation is not payable. My question is in regard to the developments that are listed as alternative developments there.  Is that a total list? For example, a sportsfield is not listed in that development.  A sportsfield could have a good commercial interest, a dog track, for example.  There are many examples I could give.  But they are not included in those that are listed.  Are those that are listed an exclusive list?  Is anything outside this compensatable?</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) sets out the other developments to which a notice under this section may relate.  This is development of a residential, commercial or an industrial character.  A sports stadium could be counted as commercial. There could be a charge.  Where you have what I call a sponsorship board then possibly it would come under it, too, because there is a gain to the ownership of that. Section 12 and the Second Schedule provide that where planning permission actually exists for gainful development of this kind no compensation is payable.  The present section builds on that principle by providing that, where the planning authority formally declare that land is capable of gainful development for which permission ought to be available, compensation will not be payable either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what is the difference between these notices, as they are now called, and what were previously called undertakings? Is the purpose of this section related to what happened in the past: where a local authority refused permission to a developer, the developer subsequently applied for massive compensation or some compensation and the local authority ran scared because they <Col N="503" /> did not have the money and they said. &ldquo;We will have to cave in and we will have to grant permission&rdquo; and they gave an undertaking that they would grant such permission?  I have the impression, though I am not certain about this, that subsequently there was a case where a developer did not want that and where the courts ruled that they had no validity. Is the purpose of this section to make those undertakings stand up in court?</P>
      <P>I would like to question the whole basis of this idea of first of all refusing a developer permission to develop; he then comes along and puts in a claim for compensation and at that stage the local authority, having previously refused permission to develop, can come along and say that this land in their opinion is capable of some other development and they will give notice that they are prepared to do that and that that will invalidate the compensation.  What we are really saying there is that what was at one stage considered to be bad planning and unacceptable, and therefore refused, tomorrow, or three months later, seems to become all right.  It smacks of the sort of deals local authorities have entered into.</P>
      <P>What is the position regarding an open space?  If you have an open space, such as the Liffey Valley, the green belts around the county, places like Portmarnock, Howth Head, Killiney, anywhere else you like to mention, and permission is refused for these, is the local authority then going to be pressurised for planning compensation and give permission here for some other form of development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The present section seeks to retain the basic principle of allowing a compensation claim to be rebutted by the offer of alternative development.  To avoid the main difficulties associated with undertakings, briefly section 13 will make it possible for a planning authority to avoid the liability for compensation by serving a notice on the claimant stating that in their opinion the land in question is capable of other <Col N="504" /> development for which planning permission ought to be granted.  This will be more a statement of principle than a contractual undertaking and any planning application within the ambit of the notice will be dealt with through the normal procedures without any prejudice to those procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>So the same position is going to pertain: local authorities will be virtually forced to cave in by these possibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>When I said &ldquo;forced&rdquo; what I meant was that they will be, in the whole area of compensation, because as the Minister knows better than most people, local authorities are strapped for resources.  When they are faced with compensation claims, unfortunately, as things are at the moment and because they can give these undertakings or these notices, what is in fact happening is this. Where the local authority believe, for example, that an area should be kept as an open space, that that is in line with the proper planning and development of the area as laid down in the development plan, they then find that if there is a compensation claim in they have to scuttle off, change their minds and say they will allow the development.  It is all right if you are talking about one form of development <i>vis-à-vis</i> another form of development, but what I have asked about specifically is in relation to open spaces and green belts as designated in a development plan.  That is what I want to know about &mdash; where it is not considered good planning that there should be any development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is certainly presenting a very serious problem in the city.  I am sure Senator McMahon will know the pressure they are under in the county areas trying to hold on to the open spaces.  If local authorities are going to find themselves in the position of being faced with compensation claims or giving these notices, <Col N="505" /> it is quite clear what will happen, because they simply do not have the money.  I think that is very retrograde and not in line with good planning for the city, or, indeed, for the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is excluding claims.  Where it is zoned for open development compensation does not arise at all.  Much of this will come under your county development plan.  It is a matter for the local authority who will know how best to act there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 32 and 33, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the High Court may allow, the High Court makes an order declaring it is satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled this amendment was that on Second Stage I expressed great dissatisfaction that the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; was included in this section.  While I have the utmost respect for the present Minister and, indeed, have no doubt that whatever decision he would take would be following detailed discussions and examination of the whole issue and based on sound planning and sound principles, nevertheless, this section does leave itself wide open to interpretation and inevitably will put tremendous pressure on the Minister of the day to decide whether a particular case is entitled to compensation or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister does not decide on the compensation, but under this section he decides whether a case is eligible to be considered for compensation. It is a great pity that the Minister did not seek an alternative avenue. In this case the courts would be the best people to decide whether a particular case was entitled to be considered for <Col N="506" /> compensation or not.  As I stated, I have grave fears that Ministers will be subject to political pressure.  Certainly, they may well be subject to allegations &mdash; perhaps quite wrongly, but that is beside the point &mdash; and once the allegation is made very often it will stick, and people could be forgiven perhaps for interpreting a Minister's decision as being taken because of who the applicant was rather than on the merits of the case.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment carefully.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will include the wording which I have in the amendment. I would appeal to the Minister to examine this section carefully.  By and large, we all welcome this Bill and recognise it as overdue to fill gaps in the planning regulations allowing major claims for compensation to be lodged.  While I recognise that to date only approximately £90,000 of compensation has been paid out, nevertheless there is a substantial number of claims there.</P>
    <P>We should do all in our power to ensure that this legislation will have no loopholes. I fear the Minister will be dragged into the political arena if this section remains part of the Bill.  That is why I put down this amendment.  I appeal to the Minister to have this amendment examined carefully, because regardless of who is Minister, or of what political grouping, the Minister will be open to the allegation of taking a certain political stand.  It is unfair that any Minister for the Environment should be put in that devious situation.</P>
    <P>When replying to the previous section the Minister referred to the very difficult situation that existed prior to the setting up of An Bord Pleanála where the Parliamentary Secretary at the time was responsible for appeals.  By and large most Parliamentary Secretaries were very fair and worked to certain guidelines, but allegations were made of certain planning applications getting more favourable consideration than others because of the political persuasion of the applicant.  I am not saying it was true; what I am saying is that that is what happened.  I would be very much afraid <Col N="507" /> that the same thing would happen in this case and that is why I am appealing to the Minister to accept the amendment I am putting forward now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said earlier on by a number of speakers, the Minister has been very sympathetic.  The Minister has been here on a number of occasions.  He has dealt with a number of Bills, has been extremely interested in the comments and, indeed, has accepted some of the amendments.  Here today also the Minister has been appreciative of the comments and the interest of this House.  If there is one amendment which I hope the Minister will not have difficulty in accepting, it is this one.  As the previous speaker said, it seems to be a very strange situation that this area should be left to the Minister of the day to decide rather than, as Senator Naughten's amendment suggests, that the matter be in the hands of the High Court.  It would seem to be a much more rational and more valid way to deal with a situation if there appears to be an injustice &mdash; and it is quite possible that there could appear to be an injustice.</P>
      <P>It appears that this legislation, drawn up by the Minister's Department and put through with a great number of amendments &mdash; most of which I appreciate &mdash; is going to be considered in certain instances to be inadequate and the Minister is then going to be able to step in and decide if compensation should be paid.  As have been said by Senator Naughten, it undoubtedly leaves open the allegations which the Minister himself denies, the allegations that a Minister can intervene and go over the heads of those who are empowered to deal with this &mdash; and the Minister said how unsatisfactory it was in the case of planning decisions. We would all agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find very strange is this and I hope the Minister will be able to take this thought on board: on a number of occasions this afternoon the Minister quoted to us his abhorrence of the Minister interfering.  You told us, Minister, that you wanted to keep him out of it, <Col N="508" /> you wanted it to be independent, you did not want the Minister to be interfering and getting embroiled in this but now, suddenly, in this instance you seem to be very happy.  However, we hope to hear that you are not happy and that you are going to accept the amendments; but if you do not accept the amendment you are certainly telling us that you are happy to have the Minister involved and embroiled in all this.  If I may go back, Minister, I did not want to keep getting up over and over again.  The Minister sidetracked the point I made earlier on two occasions &mdash; he simply did not respond to it &mdash; about the Minister being in a position to direct the Planning Appeals Board to have regard to certain items and that he did it in relation to the whole question of shopping centres.  The Minister sidestepped that issue.</P>

      <P>Quite clearly, under section 14 we are talking about whether the Minister should be allowed to intervene. We are talking about the Minister here &mdash; whether he approves of Ministers intervening or not intervening &mdash; and it is in that context I am speaking.  It is not very easy in one instance to say we cannot have the Minister getting involved at all and that the Minister must be kept out of it, but under section 14 we are suddenly <Col N="509" /> deciding it is good to have the Minister embroiled and that the Minister shall have discretion to decide on this matter of compensation.</P>
      <P>I think this is a very invidious position for any Minister.  I wonder, if we were to think about it, would we not be doing the Minister a service by having that section taken out, because there is no question about it: whatever the Minister does under that section, if he has the discretion, he will be open to charges and allegations.  If he says that compensation should be considered and it happens to be a crony of his, people will point the finger at him.  If, on the other hand, he says &ldquo;No&rdquo; and he refuses, they will say it is because the developer was not a crony of the Minister.  No matter what way it is done he is going to lose out.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister would be better out of this section.  Undoubtedly, what was put forward by Senator Naughten is a very much more desirable way of dealing with the matter.  I hope the Minister, since he abhors Ministers interfering in these matters, will accept Senator Naughten's suggestion and his amendment that the High Court would be the legitimate authority to deal with this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the amendment to section 14, I am amazed at the attitude of some of my colleagues on the other side.  As practising politicians with confidence in ourselves, we should at all times try to protect the little bit of power we have left. I have the greatest respect for Senator Naughten but I cannot understand how he asks us to support an amendment replacing &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;the High Court&rdquo;.  This is a matter that has in recent times been brought to <Col N="510" /> the forefront of our political life.  We must preserve what confidence we have and our belief that the judgment of Ministers, present and in the future, will be right.</P>
    <P>To hand over the little power we have to a High Court judge is, I think, wrong and I say that as a friend of Senator Naughten.  He is asking us in this amendment to remove the Minister, implying that he or the Minister of State may not make correct judgments in the future, and bring in instead a High Court judge. For senior Members of this House that has deadly serious implications and I would be totally opposed to this amendment. It is rarely I get up in this House, in all my years here, to take such a strong stand.  I intend, while I serve to seek to preserve whatever power is left to us as parliamentarians, to hold on to it and not hand it to the High Court or any other courts for that matter.

      <P>In supporting Senator Naughten's amendment, I am sure it was put forward out of utter concern for the Minister and in recognition of the pressure he will be put under in taking on himself the right to decide if compensation should be paid.  Prior to the establishment of An Bord Pleanála successive Ministers for the Environment were put under pressure in relation to applications for planning permission, particularly when they turned applications down.  I certainly do not see any derogation of power to the court.  The amendment seeks to give the Minister scope to put through the ultimate Bill dealing with planning compensation.  The Minister is going to come under pressure from those refused planning compensation who will say that he favoured some while not favouring others because of political alliances of one kind or another.  The general public will look for a scapegoat and the Minister is ready to be that scapegoat.  It would have been far better if the Minister had gone the whole hog and kept the matter above the question of political interference.  We are not saying the Minister will interfere, by any <Col N="511" /> manner or means, but Senator Naughten is anxious to harbour the Minister from such inferences.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment.  The general public are going to lose thousands of pounds and they will be out for somebody's blood.  I would much prefer to see them out for the blood of the anonymous courts rather than for the blood of the Minister, Deputy Flynn, or the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.  I certainly would not like to see his blood spilt just because he decided he would not pay a specific compensation claim.  We are protecting the Minister in this case and he is more than aware of this.</P>

      <P>Is Senator Honan saying that she would like to see a return to the position where the Minister would decide on planning appeals?  That seems to be the corollary of what she is saying. I thought everybody accepted, in spite of the decisions we might not like, that the Planning Appeals Board did have the independence which Minister, Deputy Connolly, spoke about and that this was a good thing, but now Senator Honan appears to be telling us that the Minister should be involved and should take the final decision.  I think Senator Jackman put it very well when she said there is much at stake.  When I referred to the Minister's cronies, what I am hinting at was allegations, which may not be true, that may be made.  We are leaving ourselves open to the allegation, whether the Minister decides in favour or against &mdash; as has been said, there is a lot at stake &mdash; that the person concerned was some pal of the Minister.  This is undesirable.  I ask the Minister, if his statements earlier that the Minister should be kept out of this were genuine, to indicate how can he justify giving this very delicate and sensitive power to the Minister rather than to the courts who are both impartial and well qualified to deal with such claims sympathetically and in a very reasonable way.</P>

      <P>I oppose the amendment. <Col N="512" /> While I respect the points made by Deputy Naughten, we are talking about the reform of local government.  If we were to accept the amendment we would be giving away some of our powers.  I am satisfied that the Minister of the day will take into account the purpose behind paying compensation.  In his opening statement he said the purpose of the Bill is to amend and consolidate the law with regard to planning compensation.  I believe the Minister of the day would be in a far stronger position to decide on compensation claims.  If the matter were to be taken to the courts substantial costs would have to be out of all proportion to the amount of compensation payable.  It has been mentioned already that claims to the value of £90,000 against the local authority in Dublin have been decided upon, with claims to the value of £25 million in the pipeline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would transfer from the Minister for the Environment to the High Court the discretion to order payment of compensation in exceptional circumstances, as provided for under section 14.  While I appreciate the intention behind the amendment, I consider the function involved to properly be a governmental rather than a judicial one.  By tradition, the Irish courts have been involved in planning matters related to points of law in the interpretation of Bills only.  The judgment required to be exercised under this section is not a matter of law.  The issue involved is whether in particular circumstances it would be reasonable to give a person access to compensation, notwithstanding the restrictions placed by section 12.  I should explain that section 14 does not involve the Minister in any way in determining the amount of compensation which a person should receive, which might be a token figure.  Under section 5, that is a matter for agreement or arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as can be established, only two orders have ever been made by Ministers under section 58 of the 1963 Act, the predecessor of this section.  The last of <Col N="513" /> these awards was made in 1986.  Applications have been much more frequent than awards.  Some 21 applications under section 58 have been made since 1977.  This relatively high failure rate of applications is another reason we should be slow in introducing a reference to the High Court in section 14.  If a competence in this matter is transferred to the High Court, applicants will have to take on the cost of engaging a solicitor and counsel.  We are all aware of the cost that would be involved and in saying that, I hope I am not referring to any legal people here.  I have no wish to do so.</P>

      <P>In bringing the case to the High Court one would be uncertain of the prospects of success.  As things stand, application to the Minister involves virtually no expense.  The power available to the Minister to permit the payment of compensation in exceptional cases is a necessary safeguard because of the very severe restrictions imposed under the Bill on the payment of compensation. I would be very reluctant to hand over this power to the High Court which will only be involved in deciding whether the Bill will stand up in law.  I have explained the reasons I cannot accept the amendment, and I can elaborate on those if the Senator so wishes.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's reply and wish to comment on the amendment.  I support Senator Naughten for two reasons.  First, he advanced excellent arguments in proposing the amendment and, secondly, it is in keeping with the policy of my party in relation to this matter.  My party have always shown a great tolerance for those who might have certain reservations about certain matters.  I want to say that I am undecided as to whether this adjudication should be made by the Minister or by a High Court judge but I am not going to allow my colleagues on the other side of the House to emerge from this debate <Col N="514" /> with a monopoly in defending the integrity of politicians.</P>

      <P>Many people have jumped on the bandwagon and they avail of every opportunity to accuse politicians, be they ordinary Members of the Oireachtas, member of local authorities, or Ministers, of acting recklessly.  I have never felt that I should support that particular lobby.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that provision is being made for an appeals procedure. One can argue in favour of a judge or a Minister making the decision.  I have always been of the view that the primary function of a Minister, apart from running his Department, is to act as a bulwark against bureaucracy in defending the rights of the ordinary individual.  I am confident the Minister, or any other Minister, will fulfil this role.  I am sure that where problems arise they will have arisen as a result of an injustice, perceived or real and we as politicians will be involved.  We will be able to make an informed judgment on whether an injustice has been done.  Somehow or other, I would fancy my chances in trying to have an injustice rectified far better with a Minister than with a High Court judge.</P>

However I am glad I belong to a party that affords me the liberty and the opportunity to express reservations when I feel it is necessary to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the case of the ordinary man or woman in any part of the country who is unable to unhinge the first door of the High Court because of the cost involved.  This is very important.  I have no intention of referring to the position of anybody in the legal profession, far from it, but how much would it cost to initiate High Court proceedings? I can assure Senators a great amount of money would be involved and the person concerned would be uncertain about the prospects of success.  The ordinary man, and I am referring here to the fellow living in the midlands, would not be in a position to initiate court proceedings. Putting that section in the Bill gives a greater confidence to persons in poor financial circumstances to take the case on.</P>
      <P>Let me elaborate further on that point. The procedure under section 58 of the 1963 Act, which allows application to the Minister for a declaration that it would not be just and reasonable for compensation to be ruled out, has been invoked only rarely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the records of the Department, only 33 applications have been made since the 1963 Act came into operation in October 1964 and seven of these relate to the same case while only 13 orders have been made under section 58.  Eleven of these refused the declarations sought by the applicant, while two orders, declaring that it would not be just or reasonable for compensation to be precluded, were made, the first in July 1974 and the second in May 1986. The total amount of compensation paid <Col N="516" /> in consequence of the two orders was £39,000.</P>
    <P>This information should allay the fears expressed by the Senators that section 14 of the Bill will lessen the effectiveness of the new prohibitions on compensation.  I can assure Senators that any applications made under section 14 will be subjected to tough scrutiny and an order will not be made unless it is absolutely clear that the normal limitations on the right to compensation would bring about unjust and unreasonable results in a particular case.  In no circumstances could I see the senior officials of my Department allowing me or any other Minister to take on board any application without first giving it very serious and detailed consideration. As Senators will appreciate, each Minister since the 1963 Planning Act came into operation has been most responsible.  Nobody would deny that, but if I were to accept the amendment &mdash; I cannot agree to it &mdash; I would be doing a grave injustice to some of the people Senator Naughten and other Members of the Seanad would like to help but who, because of the limitations on their finances, are unable to take on a case.  I would advise the Senator to consider it very carefully.</P>
    <P>I have to say I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons I have given, but I hope I have been as frank and as open as I possibly can be on this matter. I told Senator Hederman I would give her a very detailed reply and I hope I have done that.  I also hope I have allayed the fears of Senators.  I appreciate the Senator's views on this matter.  I think she is concerned that the Minister might find himself in an embarrassing or difficult position but I have to take into account the ordinary person who is not in a position to take a case on.  When erecting a new house they are generally dependent on the financial institutions.  I want to see that safeguard retained.  The sole reason for this is that I want to look after the ordinary man and woman.  I think Senators expect me to do this, and they would not think a lot of me if I did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that this procedure will only be invoked in a small number of cases.  I have to support my colleague as there is a possibility that the Minister of the day &mdash; I say this with the utmost respect to the Minister of State present &mdash; may come under undue influence in deciding, on applications, particularly those involving a lot of money.  I think this was one of the criticisms made when the Minister did have a say in deciding on planning applications.  One of the difficulties we would encounter in allowing cases to be taken to the High Court or some other form of tribunal is that we would run into delays.  I do not think, given the number of cases involved, that that would happen in this case.  Obviously we have to be careful in relation to the costs to the individual but I ask the Minister to look again at the question of whether he is going to put future Ministers under the spotlight, when they will face possible allegations that they were influenced by the old boys' network.  I ask the Minister to take on board the intent of Senator Naughten's amendment.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister who is an excellent performer. With respect to all concerned, I think he would make a great lawyer in that he seems to be able to make a great case for almost anything.  I think he has made an excellent case today for doing away with An Bord Pleanála, a body he defended earlier this afternoon.  I, too, have reservations, like some of my colleagues, about taking powers from the politicians and handing them over to others.  Perhaps Senator Naughten is going too far in his amendment but is there a middle road?  Can a case be made here for establishing a body, similar to An Bord Pleanála, to deal with such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In listening to the Minister, one would imagine he was totally opposed to the setting up of An Bord <Col N="518" /> Pleanála which is in contrast to what he said a couple of hours ago.  I do not think he can have it both ways.  A strong case was made for setting up An Bord Pleanála as ministerial decisions made in the past, even though they may have been legitimate and made for good reasons, were controversial for obvious reasons. Successive Ministers came under pressure from many sides, not necessarily from pals but perhaps relations of pals of the Minister of the day.  In a very high percentage of the cases prior to the setting up of An Bord Pleanála, Ministers were subjected to political pressure of one kind or another and the same may happen in this instance.  Granted, fewer cases will come before the Minister who stressed that point at some length, but if only one person has been unjustly treated it is only right that we give this measure due consideration.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister between now and Report Stage to consider something between what Senator Naughten is looking for and what is contained in the Bill; in other words, a body which would decide on applications to take the pressure off the Minister in such cases.</P>

      <P>If Opposition Senators push this amendment to a vote we would want to be quite clear on what we would be voting on.  We would be taking powers from ourselves.  Ministers, like the rest of us, are politicians.  Senator McMahon made reference to An Bord Pleanála.  We would only be talking about the expenditure of a couple of pounds if the cases were to be decided on by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However if legal proceedings have to be entered into we would be talking about an sum of £10,000.  We have heard all sorts of lectures in recent times about justice for all kinds of cases.  I am strongly opposed to this amendment and I will not participate or take part in a debate which seeks to remove the little power left with the Minister who is one of us.  I do not care if he is a Fianna Fáil Minister, a Fine Gael Minister or a Coalition Minister; I will have respect for him and give him the credit he deserves at all times in <Col N="519" /> relation to any judgment he may have to make in the future.</P>
    <P>I beg Senator Naughten and his party to pull back from this amendment because, what we are talking about is the handing over of the little powers left with politicians to High Court judges.  We have heard lectures during the past few weeks on where power should lie in relation to cases we are not supposed to refer to now.  However, I have said it now, and so be it.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard stated he would have said more if he was on this side of the House but fair play to him, he nearly said it.  I am a bit like Senator Howard, if something is right it is right, and if it is wrong it is wrong.  I beg Senator Naughten to pull back from this amendment as we should hold on to the little power we have left and trust our Ministers now and in the future and not hand over these powers to High Court judges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McMahon has alleged that I want to dispense with An Bord Pleanála.  That is not the case.  I always supported the setting up of An Bord Pleanála who are completely and totally independent.  In my opinion, all Ministers for the Environment have been very responsible.  The Minister in deciding on applications will not decide on the amount of compensation to be paid; rather it will be decided on by agreement or at arbitration.  Common sense will have to prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the ordinary person living in Limerick, Offaly or Ennis who does not have the financial resources to take a case to the courts?  It is not my intention to refer to the legal people in any shape or form but if a person goes to a solicitor in the morning to tell him that he has to take the case to the High Court we know what he will say to him.  He will say, &ldquo;Do you know the cost involved?&rdquo;  He will not thank him for it.  The poor unfortunate individual down the country has not got the resources.  The restrictions imposed under the Bill on the payment of compensation are very strict.  I could see ministerial action taking place only in very <Col N="520" /> exceptional cases and the records verify that since 1963.  In the constituency I come from, if I were to allow a decision like that to the High Court, they would say I lacked judgement.  I know Senator Naughten does not want that to happen.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the manner in which the debate has taken place on this section.  It has been a very constructive and most interesting debate, all the Members of the House saying how they saw things. That is why I am reserving that function for the Minister.  I want to protect the unfortunate individual who has not got the financial resources.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not do that.  I am a politician and I never deny that.  Whatever legislation we put through, it is always in our interest to safeguard the public.</P>
    <P>Senators may ask where is the planning objection to An Bord Pleanála?  There is very minimum cost involved in that but High Court costs are very high.</P>

For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot go down that road.  I would like to be as helpful as I can.  I am being helpful in what I am saying.  There is no man who understands the planning legislation more than I do because I have been through the mill on this.  I have been introducing Bills and understand the situation very well.  I would like to be as accommodating as possible because I have a high regard for Senator Naughten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I do not want to be repetitive.  I must reply to a couple of points that were made, particularly by Senator Honan.  I pointed out when I started to discuss the amendment that I had absolutely no doubt that if this Minister was making a decision under this Bill he would carefully examine all the facts and figures before him.  I also said I had absolutely no doubt that any other Minister for the Environment would do the same.  I did say they were open to allegations in cases of controversy and that is what I am concerned about.  Whether that be one case over 20 years or two cases over 20 years, it is one or two too many in my view.  That is why I am extremely anxious that this provision should be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has explained at length his concern and the financial implications and has rightly pointed out that it may be just one dwelling house &mdash; it is quite possible &mdash; although it is more likely to be much bigger developments.  I would <Col N="522" /> also point out to the Minister that one of the things that has crept into our legal system over the past number of years is the principle of no foal, no fee.  It is not abnormal nowadays for the legal people &mdash; solicitors, barristers &mdash; to take a case on the basis that if they win they are paid; if they do not win they are not paid.  I believe there would be adequate safeguards there to protect the individual. My concern is that some Minister acting sincerely and genuinely on the information before him, would find himself subject to public ridicule because of a decision he took, maybe in the case of a party supporter, but, of course, he took the decision having regard to the evidence in front of him.  That could be any Minister.  It could be a Fine Gael or a Fianna Fáil Minister.</P>

      <P>In time.  That is one of the things we have to be concerned about. As Senator Foley pointed out &mdash; and the Senator is a Member for whom I have the utmost respect &mdash; this is the key to the Bill.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to take politics out of decisions on compensation.  I recognise that the Minister will not be deciding on the amount of compensation but as to whether compensation should be given in a particular case.  There are a few other things I would like to say but I realise we have discussed the amendment at length.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want clarification on section 17.  My understanding is that a planning application is submitted; plans are prepared and then it does not succeed in getting through the system.  From reading the subsection I get the impression that preparation of plans for an unsuccessful planning application is an allowable cost in compensation.  Am I correct in that?  I understand that the actual cost of preparing the plans &mdash; architects' and engineer's fees and so on &mdash; in the event of the application being unsuccessful is an allowable cost in claiming compensation. Am I interpreting the subsection correctly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 44 to 48 and in page 16, lines 1 and 2, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) The owner or occupier of any premises within the district of a sanitary authority shall be entitled to cause his drain to empty into the sewers of that authority subject to the following conditions:</P>
      <P>(i)  that he applies to that authority in the prescribed form and receives permission to do so;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that he pays the contribution required by that authority for making such a connection; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  that he complies with the regulations of that authority in respect of the mode in which the connection between such drains and sewers are to be made and with the directions of any person who may be appointed by the authority for the supervision or inspection of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> A sanitary authority may refuse permission for such a connection if, <i>inter alia</i>, the existing capacity in a sewer has been designated for the drainage of an area zoned for development in the development plan made in accordance with Part III of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What I wish to have included in the section is self-explanatory.  In view of the general wish of the House to complete Committee Stage today I will not delay the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would replace subsection (3) of section 25 dealing with sanitary authority sewers but would leave the remainder of that section unaltered.  Subsection (3) as it stands already provides that there will not be an entitlement to connect to a sanitary authority's sewer without the authority's consent and that this consent may be given subject to such condition as the sanitary authority consider reasonable. Accordingly, I do not believe that paragraphs (a) (i) and (iii) in the Senator's amendment add to what is already in subsection (3).</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 17, in Rule 2 (a), between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following subparagraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  the actual price paid for the land where the land was acquired within 6 years of the claim for compensation being made, or where the land was received by way of an inheritance within the aforesaid 6 years, the valuation of the land on <Col N="526" /> the date of death of the deceased from whom the land was inherited.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again, it is clear what is intended by the amendment and I would just ask the Minister to comment on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would require the property arbitrator in determining both the antecedent and subsequent values of land to have regard to any price paid for the land within the previous six years and also in any valuation for debt duty purposes within the same period.  I consider that this last aspect is adequately catered for in paragraph 2 (c) of the First Schedule.  This provides that all returns and assessments of capital value for taxation made or acquiesced in by the claimant may be considered.  The first part of the Senator's amendment would not be necessary.  The arbitrator's basic terms of reference have already been set by paragraph 1 of the First Schedule and they are to operate on the basis of open market value before and after the adverse planning decision. The same principle will be relevant to this system of open market valuation.  It can be said in a general context that the valuation as it operates is fair under the arbitration procedures.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the First Schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two queries on the First Schedule.  Paragraph 2 (c) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All returns and assessments of capital value for taxation made or acquiesced in by the claimant may be considered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want an explanation as to the effect on compensation and capital taxation where that is involved.</P>
      <P>I also want to raise a question on the next paragraph 3 (1).  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing the possibilities, if any, <Col N="527" /> for developing the land, for the purposes of determining its antecedent value, regard shall be had only to such reasonable possibilities as, having regard to all material considerations, could be judged to have existed immediately prior to the relevant decision under Part IV of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to understand the wording, &ldquo;regard shall be had only to such reasonable possibilities as having regard to all material considerations, could be judged to have existed immediately prior...&rdquo;.  I cannot understand that because whatever possibilities existed went out the window when planning permission was refused. What does this mean?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be open to the person or persons concerned to put that forward at arbitration.  I am getting into another area and the Cathaoirleach may not allow me but, under the Finance Act there are provisions for a write-off and claimant's expenses will be taken into account under that Act.  Expenses incurred in regard to arbitration where that may arise will be taken into account in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The other question I asked was about reasonable possibilities. There are no possibilities once the refusal has taken place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain paragraph 12 which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> Paragraph 11 shall, subject to paragraph 13, not apply in a case where a development objective for the use specified in paragraph 11 applied to the land at any time within the five years immediately prior to the date on which the relevant application was made for permission under Part IV of the Principal Act to develop the land...</P>
    <P>In all cases where land has been zoned, rezoned or dezoned from residential, industrial or such purposes to agriculture &mdash; in other words where land is reverting to agriculture &mdash; is compensation payable in all such cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption is made <Col N="529" /> in paragraphs 12 and 13 and is only for landowners whose lands have been down-zoned, that is from development to non-development zoning.  By virtue of these paragraphs compensation will not be excluded on zoning grounds where the land had a zoning in the previous five years with which the development proposal would have been compatible and the person claiming compensation acquired his land interest before the new restrictive zoning came into operation or was formally notified in draft by the planning authority.</P>

    <Title>Turf Development Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to broaden the statutory remit of Bord na Móna.  Under existing legislation the functions of the board are limited to the production and marketing of peat and peat products. While this will continue to be the company's core business for the foreseeable future, the Bill will give the board the added flexibility it needs to exploit commercial opportunities in ancillary areas.  The object will be to diversify the board's operations where it is profitable to do so and to exploit the expertise developed by the board.  The opportunity is also being taken in the Bill to make a number of routine amendments in relation to pay, superannuation and the format of the board's accounts.</P>
      <P>I know that this House is well aware of the contribution that Board na Móna has made to the economic life of this country and, in particular, to the midlands region since it was set up in the mid-forties. The development of our indigenous peat resources has made a valuable contribution to the national economy because it both provides us with an alternative source of fuel supply which reduces our dependence on imported fuels and at the same time provides employment in midland areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of their economic and social role in the midlands the Government are anxious to ensure that Bord na Móna will provide viable and sustainable employment in the long term and will continue as a significant producer of indigenous energy.  Concern was expressed in the Dáil about the financial position of Bord na Móna.  As I indicated to that House, this issue is being comprehensively reviewed at present and I will be putting <Col N="531" /> the matter before Government in the near future.  In the circumstances I do not propose to comment on the board's financial position at this time.  I am satisfied, however, that this enabling legislation will assist the board to take full advantage of development opportunities. I will now outline some of the specific provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the board will be permitted to promote, form, take part in or acquire companies, either within the State or abroad.  This will provide the board with the required flexibility to exploit worthwhile business opportunities. I might mention that providing a State-sponsored body with the power to form or take part in subsidiary companies will not be unique to Bord na Móna. Similar powers were provided to the ESB in 1988.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill will also permit the board to engage in joint ventures in relation to its business as extended and defined in this Bill, again both within the State and abroad.  Clearly, it would be the intention that participation in any such joint ventures would be on the basis that it will pay its way and in this regard participation in joint ventures will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance.  In attempting to exploit commercial opportunities in other countries, it may prove to be more effective to engage in a joint venture with an existing company or, if appropriate, to purchase an existing company. This is particularly so in relation to Bord na Móna's horticultural business as it should facilitate access to specific markets.  The further development of the board's horticultural and related business is one of the best policies to secure existing employment and to create additional jobs in line with the planned growth of horticultural products.</P>
    <P>Under the 1946 Act, the powers of Bord na Móna can only be exercised through the main board.  The Bill permits Bord na Móna, subject to my approval, to delegate certain of its functions to sub-boards. These sub-boards will not be <Col N="532" /> empowered to do anything which is outside the powers of the main board.  The sub-boards will be appointed by the board and the members, including in each case the managing director of the company, will be drawn from the membership of the board.  The purpose of the sub-boards is to ease the workload of the plenary board.  Their existence will facilitate a speeding up of the decision-making process within the company and will allow for the more thorough examination of specific areas of the board's activities.</P>
    <P>At present the board can only exercise certain of its functions within the State. This was unduly restrictive on the board in its efforts to develop and exploit new market opportunities abroad.  Section 4 provides the board with the means, subject to ministerial control, to exercise the necessary powers abroad which will facilitate the exploitation of foreign market opportunities.</P>
    <P>The functions of Bord na Móna, as outlined in the Turf Development Act, 1946 were restricted effectively to the extraction, production, marketing and sale of turf and turf products and all ancillary requirements necessary for this purpose. Under this Bill, the board will be empowered to engage in activities not directly related to peat, but which arise from expertise acquired and developed by the company in carrying out its original functions as defined in the 1946 Act.  The board will now be in a position to exploit this expertise on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also enable the board to undertake consultancy work.  The board has in the past offered consultancy services by way of seconding Bord na Móna staff to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is now proposed to develop commercial consultancy activities.</P>
    <P>The future use of cutaway bogs &mdash; bogs which have been substantially cleared of turf &mdash; is a question of great importance to Board na Móna.  Some 2,500 acres of cutaway bog will become available from the board's operations each year over the next decade.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that recently I <Col N="533" /> established an independent expert committee to examine in depth the potential uses of this cutaway bog and to recommend measures which will ensure that the land is put to the best possible use. The terms of reference of the committee require that they examine the competing demands of forestry and agricultural-horticultural and amenity uses of the cutaway bogs.  Interested parties were invited to make submissions to the committee and I am glad to say that the response has been very gratifying, with over 40 such submissions being made.  I have asked the committee to report to me before the end of the year.  This Bill empowers the board to develop such bogs in accordance with such directives as may be laid down by the Minister for Energy of the day.  This provision will facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the committee.</P>
    <P>The section of the 1946 Act which deals with the accounts and audits of Bord na Móna provides that the board should keep, <i>inter alia</i>, a capital account and a revenue account.  These type of accounts are no longer common in conventional accounting practices.  Sections 7 and 9 of this Bill provide for the necessary amendments to the 1946 Act to allow for a change in the format of the board's accounts to bring them into line with the more conventional practice.</P>
    <P>Section 10, relating to pay, simply formalises the controls relating to the remuneration of the employees of Bord na Móna and is in line with Government policy in relation to the public sector.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are empowered, under sections 5 and 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953 to operate superannuation schemes with the approval of the Minister for Energy and the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  At present, the Act provides that benefits under the superannuation schemes can only be paid to full-time members of the board and its permanent employees.  Benefits for spouses and children are therefore excluded.  A non-statutory widows' and children's pension scheme has, however, been in operation with ministerial approval since 1970.  The Comptroller <Col N="534" /> and Auditor General has been concerned that this scheme continues to operate on a non-statutory basis and has reported, in his capacity as auditor of the Board na Móna superannuation schemes, that the 1953 Act requires to be amended in order to place the scheme on a statutory footing. Section 11 of the new Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of this Bill in 1988, a major consultancy study has been undertaken of the operations of Bord na Móna.  I have indicated to the Dáil that because of the sensitive commercial information contained in the report, I had concluded that I could not allow the report to be published.  I would like to assure this House that the recommendations of the consultancy report are being addressed and, where appropriate, follow-up measures are being implemented.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, Bord na Móna's core business will continue to be the production of peat and peat products.  Bord na Móna will continue to provide a significant part of Ireland's energy needs through the supply of milled peat for electricity generation and solid fuels &mdash; particularly briquettes for the domestic market.  The decision to ban bituminous coal in Dublin provides a particular opportunity for Bord na Móna to expand its briquette sales.  In order to improve its financial performance the board, in common with any other company, must put considerable effort into producing its product range at the lowest possible cost and achieving all possible efficiencies in its operation.  This is what is required to secure sustainable employment in the long term and to enable the board to compete successfully on domestic and international markets.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Bord na Móna is capable of meeting the considerable challenges which faces it and, indeed, the board has already taken steps in that direction.  Initiatives have been taken to reduce costs, including the introduction of a voluntary redundancy scheme, which will lead to a major reduction in costs and overheads.  I would like to pay tribute to the staff of Bord na Móna who, in spite <Col N="535" /> of the difficulties facing the company, have continued to demonstrate the necessary dedication and application, which will ultimately restore the company to profitability and enable it to maintain its position as a vital component of the national economy.</P>
    <P>This Bill will extend the options open to the board to enable it to develop to its full potential and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire as bheith i láthair anseo inniu agus buíochas a ghabháil leis as an gcur i láthair atá déanta aige ar an mBille tábhachtach seo atá faoi chaibidil againn.  Is Bille é seo, ar ndóigh, a bhaineann le hacmhainn nádúrtha, agus rud ar bith a bhfuil baint aige le forbairt acmhainní nádúrtha, ní mór dúinn ár n-intinn, go huile is go hiomlán a thabhairt do phlé na ceiste seo, go mórmhór má bhaineann sé le forbairt acmhainní ar chósta thiar na hÉireann.  Is beag atá ann ó thaobh déantúsaíochta nó fhorbairt eacnamaíochta de.  Bímid i gcónaí ag brath, mar is eol don Aire go maith, ar dheiseanna le forbairt a dhéanamh ar acmhainní nádúrtha, le deis a thabhairt do mhuintir na hÉireann, do mhuintir an iarthair go speisialta, teacht i dtír, ó thaobh fostaíochta de, ar aon bhealach gur féidir leo ar an achmhainn nádúrtha sin.</P>
      <P>Tá sé sin déanta ar go leor bealaí, i dturasóireacht go mórmhór, in iarthar na tíre.  Tá sé déanta againn i gcás fhorbairt fheilméireacht éisc, bíodh go dtuigim nach bhfuil an tAire féin an-chinnte an maith an rud é a leithéid a bheith ann. Tá 500 duine ar imeall chósta iarthar na hÉireann ag plé leis an bhforbairt sin. Mar an gcéanna i gcas na bportach, agus, má thugann na portaigh teacht isteach do mhuintir na hÉireann, tríd an earnáil phríobháideach nó trí Bhord na Móna, caithfimid bheith aireach agus buíoch de na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh agus atá déanta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dé réir mar a thuigim an Bille seo atá os ár gcomhair, is dul chun cinn é sa mhéid is go bhfuil sé i gceist deis a thabhairt do Bhord na Móna leathnú amach sa <Col N="536" /> dóigh is go mbeidh deis acu dul amach ar an margadh chun troid le haghaidh sciar den mhargadh sin maidir le soláthair teasa nó ábhar tine a chur ar fáil.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an-scil acu san obair seo mar caithfimid dul siar go dtí blianta an chogaidh 1939-45 nuair a chrom muintir na hÉireann i gcoitinne, le linn na hÉigeandála, ar an mhóin a bhaint.  Chuamar, tar éis an chogaidh, chomh fada ó bhaile go dtí an Fhionlann agus go dtí an Rúis leis an nuatheicneolaíocht sin a fhoghlaim. Ní amháin gur thangamar abhaile agus gur chuireamar an teicneolaíocht sin chun maitheas na tíre seo trí bhunú Bhord na Móna ó thaobh soláthair agus cur ar fáil ábhar tine agus ábhar portaigh ar na réimsí éagsúla atá le déanamh.</P>
    <P>Sa chúlra sin ba chóir dúinn i gcónaí bheith sásta agus toilteanach aon tacaíocht gur féidir linn a thabhairt don chineál seo forbartha.  Ceann de na deacrachtaí seo a bhí ann trí an blianta, go ndeachaigh an costas táirgíochta chomh mór sin chun tosaigh ar an chostas díolacháin gur fhág sé sinn i gcomórtas le hábhair thine eile ar nós gáis, ola agus guail, agus go raibh mar aidhm againn, ag an Stát, go mbeadh fostaíocht mhór le fáil.  Mar is eol dúinn, tá a lán fostaíochta curtha ar fáil ag Bord na Móna, go háirithe i lár na tíre, agus tá an tairbhe sin le feiceáil sna ceantair ina ndeachaigh Bord na Móna chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ach, é sin ráite, tá mé ag ceapadh go raibh toirmeasc nó ceangal ar Bhord na Móna an t-eolas agus an staidéar uilig a bhí déanta acu anuas trí na blianta, a roinnt le pobal na hÉireann agus le pobal tír ar bith eile.  Mar sin, fáiltím roimh an Acht seo ann, ach, dar liom, tá go leor fabhtaí agus lochtanna sa Bhille féin sa mhéid go gceapaimse go bhfuil Bord na Móna fós faoi chuing, mar a déarfá, an Aire agus an Státseirbhísigh, agus nach bhfuil dóthain cumhachta nó neamhspleáchais acu mar bhord, mar dhaoine, le dul amach ar an margadh sin, go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh an sciar sin a thógáil orthu féin agus troid mhaith a dhéanamh ar a shon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> Tá sé an-deacair, agus beidh sé an-deacair, ag Bord na Móna, de réir a meoin &mdash; agus tá an dea-intinn ann &mdash; cur leis an réimse, nó diversification, atá ar bun acu go dtí seo.  Tá an-iontas ormsa, mar shampla, nár éirigh le Bord na Móna go dtí seo a bheith bainteach le forbairt an phortaigh atá imithe, nó gearrtha, nó cut-away bogs mar a thugtar orthu.  Tá roinnt iarrachtaí déanta ansin, ach tá an-iontas orm nár éirigh le Bord na Móna an cineál ruda a dtugtar biomass air a chur ar fáil agus a chur ag fás sna portaigh a bhí gearrtha acu cheana.</P>
    <P>Is é an míniú atá agam air sin ná go raibh siad, mar fho-eagraíocht Stáit iad féin, faoi smacht iomlán ag an Stáit agus ní bhfuair siad na deiseanna forbartha ag an am gur ghá iad a bheith acu, nuair a theastaigh siad uathu.  Bhí an-deis ag Bord na Móna tar éir an chogaidh, agus anuas trí na seascaidí agus na seachtóidí, dul ar aghaidh ar an gcaoi sin.  Ní bhfuair siad an seans agus, mar sin, tharla go raibh Bord na Móna ag forbairt i lár na tíre, go raibh na costais tháirgíochta ag méadú agus nach raibh an costas díolacháin ag coinneáil céim an chéim leis an gcostas táirgíochta.  Níiontas, mar sin, go raibh Bord na Móna, in áit a bheith ag cur lena gcuid sócmhainní airgeadais sna blianta rathúla, sna seascaidí, ag iarraidh, dar liom, coinneáil céim ar chéim ó thaobh fostaíochta de.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir iad a lochtú sa mhéid gurbh shin é an aidhm a bhí acu, aidhm cineál sóisialta chomh maith le haidhm fhostaíochta, faoi mar a bhí ag an ESB agus ag go leor bhord Stáit eile.  Bhíomar uilig i gcónaí ag caint faoi fhostaíocht ach ní maith an scéal é i ndeireadh an lae, mar atá faighte amach againn; is beag maith dúinn i ndeireadh an lae an fhostaíocht mura bhfuil sí bunaithe ar ghníomh eacnamúil, agus sin an fáth go bhfuil mé ag moladh an chuid sin den Bhille, go bhfuil iarracht á déanamh anseo le go mbeidh siad amuigh sa saol ag troid dóibh féin agus go mbeidh cúrsaí ar bhonn eacnamúil. Mar, mura mbíonn sé eacnamúil, níl aon fháth ná aon bhealach ann go n-éireoidh leis.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-seans ag Bord na Móna, ó thaobh gairneoireachta de, dul chun cinn <Col N="538" /> iontach a dhéanamh ansin.  Tá daoine príobháideacha ag easportáil agus ag díol i bhfad níos mó le haghaidh gairneoireachta ná mar atá Bord na Móna, agus tá cumhacht an Stáit taobh thiar den bhord.  Tá na daoine príobháideacha seo i bhfad níos láidre agus i bhfad níos fearr agus is é an chúis atá leis sin ná nach bhfuil aon laincisí orthu.  Tá siad in ann dul amach agus na barrchostais uilig atá ar an eagraíocht Stáit a laghdú.  Dá mbeadh an duine príobháideach ag plé leis an intinn a bhí ag Bord na Móna ag an am, faoi chuing an Stáit, ó thaobh fostaíocht a chur ar fáil bheadh sé an-deacair dóibh an dá rud sin a thabhairt le chéile.</P>
    <P>Nuair a tháinig an drochaimsir roinnt blianta ó shin, chuaigh Bord na Móna chun donais ar fad.  Bhíodar i ndrochchaoi cheart i leith airgeadais agus mar chomhlachta Stáit.  Cuireann sé iontas orm freisin nuair a fheicim an chaoi a n-oibríonn an Stát-chóras ó thaobh rudaí éagsúla agus ó thaobh Bhord na Móna de.  Tabharfaidh mé sampla den chaoi a n-oibríonn an Stát, ó phortach amháin go portach eile, agus táimid ag caint faoi fhorbairt portach nó obair ar phortaigh. I 1985, mar shampla, thug an Rialtas cead do Bhord na Móna portach i gClárach, Contae Uí bhFáilghe, a dhíol leis an Roinn Foraoiseachta ag an am mar go mbeadh siad in ann é a choinneáil; ba mhaith an plean é sin mar bhí siad ag rá gur blanket bog a bhí ann agus go raibh sé an-luachmhar.</P>
    <P>Rinneadar socrú go n-íocfadh an Roinn Foraoiseachta £500,000 le Bord na Móna ar 1,150 acra.  Anuas air sin, bhí an Roinn ag dul a íoc, agus sásta a íoc, an cháin agus an t-ús le blianta fada a bhí dlite do Bhord na Móna ón chéad uair a cheannaigh siad an portach céanna.  Cuirfidh mé sin i gcomparáid leis an rud atá ar bun thiar i gConamara an lá atá inniu ann, agus má oibríonn tú amach 1,150 acra de phortach agus má roinneann tú é sin ar £500,000, móide an t-ús, feicfidh tú gur tugadh breis agus £500 in aghaidh an acra. Thug Roinn Stáit amháin breis agus £500 in aghaidh an acra le portaigh a cheannach agus thug siad an t-airgead sin do Bhord na Móna.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> An lá atá inniu ann, tá feidhmeannaigh de chuid Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí ag dul thart ar Chonamara ag iarraidh portaigh a cheannach ar £10 an t-acra.  Nach aisteach an chaoi a bhfuil an saol ag athrú; go bhfuil Roinn Stáit in ann £500 punt in aghaidh an acra a thabhairt do Roinn Stáit eile ar phortach?  Ach nuair atá an fear bocht thiar i gConamara ag iarraidh a phortach a dhíol, nach bhfuil sé mícheart don fhoroinn Stáit chéanna, Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, bheith ag iarraidh an cineál portaigh chéanna a cheannach &mdash; leis an aidhm ceannann céanna, is é sin, lena chaomhnú mar oidhreacht de chuid an náisiúin seo &mdash; ar £10 nó £15 in aghaidh an acra.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna freisin, i 1985 tugadh treoir ón Rialtas go dtiocfadh Bord na Móna agus an Roinn Foraoiseachta agus Iascaigh timpeall na tíre le breathnú ar áiteanna speisialta portaigh le go bhféadfadh siad iad a cheannach agus a chaomhnú mar a bhí á dhéanamh i gClárach. Ceannaíodh Clárach, íocadh an t-airgead, ach níor deineadh tada óshin. Tá na mílte acra thiar i gConamara, mar is eol don Aire go maith, agus tá an oiread cainte déanta faoi le bhliain anuas mar go raibh muintir na háite ag iarraidh 50 acra le haerfort beag a thógáil ann: 50 acra as 24,000 acra, twenty four thousand acres!</P>

Nach aisteach an rud é, nuair a bhí siad ag iarraidh sin a dhéanamh, bhí siad ag iarraidh é a chaomhnú. Tá chuile dhuine ag léim ar an bandwagon seo maidir le caomhnú, environment agus chuile shórt eile, ach nuair atá muintir na háite ag iarraidh píosa beag den acmhainn nádúrtha atá acu lena fhorbairt dóibh féin, tá baic uafásacha orthu; níl siad in ann tada a dhéanamh faoi, agus níl siad ag fáil cúnaimh le haon rud a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní bhaineann sé sin le Bord na Móna <Col N="540" /> amháin ná leis an gClochán, baineann sé le háiteanna eile timpeall na tíre chomh maith céanna.  An pointe atá á dhéanamh agam ná gur chóir do Bhord na Móna dul i gcomhar leis an Rialtas nó le Roinn na Mara maidir le caomhnú portach agus, sa chaoi seo, bheadh siad, ar a laghad, in ann praghas réasúnta a thabhairt.  Is é an fáth go bhfuil mé ag rá sin ná gurb í an aidhm agus an spiorad agus an prionsabal atá taobh thiar den Bhille seo ná go mbeadh Bord na Móna in ann struchtúr a chur ar fáil dóibh féin le go mbeadh siad ábalta dul i gcomórtas, nó, mar a deirtear i mBéarla, to be competitive; sin an aidhm atá leis an mBille, de réir mar a thuigimse é.</P>
    <P>Nach aisteach an rud é go bhfuil sé mar aidhm ag an Stát go mbeadh Bord na Móna in ann comórtas a dhéanamh sa sórt saoil seo agus san am céanna, go bhfuil Roinn Stáit eile ag iarraidh fear Chonamara a dhéanamh níos boichte ná mar atá sé agus ag iarraidh an cúpla acra portaigh atá aige a fháil uaidh in aisce.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin de réir an spioraid atá taobh thiar den Bhille seo.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an spiorad céanna atá taobh thiar den Bhille seo ón Roinn Airgeadais nuair a bheidh plé acu le hobair a bhaineann le forbairt portach nó aon rud eile.  I dtaca le Bord na Móna arís, caithfidh siad bheith an-chúramach. Tá a fhios againn uilig gur saol uafásach deacair atá anseo ó thaobh comórtais de, competitiveness.  Feicimid timpeall orainn é gach lá.  An té nach bhfuil in ann dul amach agus an margadh sin a fháil dó féin agus ag an am céanna brabach a dhéanamh dó féin, ní sheasfaidh sé.</P>

      <P>Gabh mo leithscéal. Níor thuig mé é sin.  Ní leanfaidh mé mar sin cé go bhféadfainn caint go maidin faoi phortaigh.  An pointe atá á dhéanamh agam ná go gcaithfidh Bord na Móna <Col N="541" /> bheith cinnte má tá said ag dul a bhriseadh amach agus fobhoird acu ag deileáil le earraí éagsúla mar bhricíní agus na fobhoird uilig faoi smacht ag an ollbhord, agus iadsan uilig faoi smacht an Aire agus na státseirbhíse, ag an deireadh, dar liomsa, ní oibreoidh sé sin.

      <P>Is cuma faoi smog nó gan smog a bheith i mBaile Átha Cliath, ní éireoidh le Bord na Móna sa chathair seo na brícíní a dhíol ar an gcineál praghais atá orthu faoi láthair. Níl sé eacnamúil.  Níl sé eacnamúil ó thaobh an méid teasa a chuireann sé amach.  Níl an margin sách láidir le go bhféadfadh fiontar príobháideach dul isteach agus airgead a ghnóthú, agus níl sé sách láidir mar gheall ar an struchtúr atá ag Bord na Móna féin ó thaobh fostaíochta de agus na gcostas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, if I may, first of all to welcome the Minister for Energy.  We greatly appreciate that he is here personally to take this Bill through the House.</P>
      <P>We also welcome the Bill itself, which is very necessary, an enabling Bill as the Minister has described it.  I think we should listen to the wide-ranging comments of Senator Ó Foighil.  We should recognise the fact that Bord na Móna has been a success story, and it would be very easy to forget this in the difficulties which have afflicted the board very recently, over the past two or three years.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna was set up in 1946 in a very different era, with a very different type of State company envisaged. Senator Ó Foighil referred to the private competition, and this is very true.  It is a very different world.  It was very successful in the way it acted in the forties and fifties; indeed, it helped to lay the basis for the effective industrial and modern industrial expansion which we had in the sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although perhaps we did not realise it at the time, that very expansion was putting a demand on our energy <Col N="542" /> resources which previously related very much to hydro-electricity and to the Bord na Móna production.  Effectively, it transferred that energy cost to a demand for mobile fuel for oil.  That, in turn, meant when the oil crisis struck in the mid-seventies that Bord na Móna was faced with a request at that time to expand its production of fuel.  It responded very successfully from its own point of view &mdash; in some ways too successfully &mdash; to that demand and to that request.  It engaged in capital intensive and other actions the effects of which are being felt today when, of course, the price of oil is at a very different level from that projected in the mid-and late seventies.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for a body such as Bord na Móna, and particularly with the type of structure which it had, the operating rules under which it was working, to adapt.  I would like to join with the Minister in paying tribute to the employees and staff of Bord na Móna for the way they have faced up &mdash; naturally it is a very emotional issue &mdash; in a very good, effective and, at the end of the day, a very co-operative manner to a very difficult situation.  Only a few years ago there were 4,500 employees in Bord na Móna; now we are down to about 2,700 to 2,800, somewhere in that range of numbers.  A very large number of those employees were situated, as the Minister and Senator Ó Foighil have indicated, in the midlands, particularly in County Offaly and adjacent counties.  It has been an extremely traumatic process in human terms, in employment terms and in financial terms for those midland counties, and particularly for County Offaly because it affected quite a substantial area of the country.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has basically been a success story but it has found itself faced with enormous capital outlays and it has also, of course, by the very fact that it was labour intensive, found itself in an extremely difficult financial position. Clearly, that has to be taken into account. It is not really, however, what is being dealt with in this Bill; and, as the Minister has indicated, it is receiving the very <Col N="543" /> necessary attention which it requires, it is receiving that elsewhere.  But the enormous debt burden on Bord na Móna is clearly something that has to be dealt with at some stage and I am quite sure it will be.</P>
    <P>What this Bill is doing effectively means that Bord na Móna will be enabled to move ahead once again and once more, hopefully, to become a success story. Senator Ó Foighil referred to techniques is fearr sa domhain.  He is absolutely right.  The techniques developed by Bord na Móna employees are among the best in the world.  Countries such as Finland and Germany, who are not exactly behind in modern machinery and modern techniques, came to this country, to Bord na Móna, in order to learn from them techniques relating to peat and turf technology. That is a very great achievement. Not only that, but it gives considerable hope that, with this Bill and other measures which the Minister clearly has in mind, it will be possible for Bord na Móna to move ahead again.  We have seen the co-operative work of the employees.  We have seen also the success of those employees in a very competitive, innovative modern world when given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>However, if we look at the product of Bord na Móna, clearly there are very grave problems.  Possibly 50 per cent of Bord na Móna's output relates to milled peat and turf.  If you look at that in terms of energy costs, then, as compared with coal, the cost is something in the region of about £30 a megawatt as compared with something under £15 a megawatt for coal at presentday prices.  It is a very difficult situation.  Nonetheless, of course, coal has very major disadvantages. There are those of us, many environmentalists, who would say that coal should be very sparingly used, that it is a very environmentally inappropriate substance, if it can possibly be avoided. But, if you are just thinking in harsh financial terms of what it costs a body such as the ESB to buy coal as compared with buying peat, there are obvious difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> As regards solid fuels, I think the day when Bord na Móna could sell sods of turf is gone and finished with.  In so far as it is an economic industry today it is for small private units that have extremely low overheads and work under very tight and flexible conditions, which is not possible once you go outside a very small number of people.  You are left then, from the point of view of competitive fuels, with the briquettes.  Here one would certainly like to applaud the Government for the steps they have taken in relation to smog &mdash; the situation here in this city, which was beginning to cause not just the obvious structural damage to the buildings but very definite health hazards.  It is perhaps fortunate and good that in fact peat briquettes can compete quite effectively on that market, certainly as a smokeless fuel.  Even there, however, there are certain problems at the actual sales end, the retail network as it were.  Hopefully, those problems will be overcome.  That accounts for about 75 per cent of product, so you can see some of the problems that are facing Bord na Móna.  There are problems of capital, of labour intensity and problems of an extremely uncompetitive market.</P>
    <P>One comes, then, to a market which Bord na Móna has been developing and exploiting very successfully and that is the horticultural market, where probably about 25 per cent at present of its revenue would be of a horticultural nature.  There, Bord na Móna has been extremely successful. Probably worldwide it is a leader in the horticultural peat market and I see few reasons why that should not be very effectively developed and on a very large scale.  There, you are building on success. There, you are building on a market which exists.  There, you are building on a situation in which we have a competitive advantage.  But, even there, there are some problems.  There is the problem of increasing competition from Finland, from Germany and perhaps even from the Soviet Union.  There is also a problem, from an environmental point of view.  There are those who would argue that peat should not be used in horticulture. It is probably a very tenuous <Col N="545" /> argument but it is one we have to be conscious of and which the board, in its advertising, in its working and in its sales, should turn perhaps to its advantage rather than allowing it to be to its disadvantage.</P>
    <P>That is the present situation.  The Minister and the Government in this Bill are bringing in the opportunity for the board to develop, to work outside the State in a much more effective manner and to work in joint ventures.  There are many foreign companies who would be interested in working with Bord na Móna for a series of reasons &mdash; its innovative technology, its knowledge of the background in peat, its success in the horticultural market.  These would all encourage foreign joint venture participation. Here you are talking of considerable highly added-value products as compared with the milled peat or solid fuel.  I think it is an excellent move to make this more feasible, more practicable, to give Bord na Móna the opportunity to move ahead in this direction.  It is going to have to move ahead in other directions as well.  I know it is already working on some of these.  One is activated carbon which probably from an environmental and technological point of view will be of some considerable importance. I think the board has to have the opportunity to develop into other related markets and this Bill would appear to open that opportunity to the board.</P>
    <P>There are a number of particular points in the Bill.  One that one should perhaps take a little bit further in relation to technology is that the Finns have come to this country to learn from us in this particular respect.  They have shown us in some ways how, with very limited natural resources, very difficult economic and social conditions, you can, by occupying a high technology link, compete extremely successfully and also how that can be related to joint State-private enterprise co-operation.  I think there are many lessons which we could usefully apply in that direction.  These are particularly appropriate for Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the Minister bringing the archaic accounting system of Bord na Móna up to date.  Again, if it is <Col N="546" /> going to compete, you must have modern management and financial accounts. There was a great and unfortunate constraint there which, I am sure, in some ways did not make it any easier for the management of Bord na Móna over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Consultancy is another area which is already very open to us, which already been successfully performed by Bord na Móna but only by the extraordinary method of working through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Here again, the sister body, the Electricity Supply Board, has been extremely successful in this regard in the Middle East and indeed many other countries as well.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see the pensions scheme being brought into a proper arrangement.  It was a very necessary measure and it is good that the Minister should have resolved the queries about the situation there.</P>
    <P>There is one other small point which I think is a pointer towards the future.  That is that it is very nice to see the clause in the Bill which refers to the sort of co-operation which we should see between our universities, our regional technical colleges and our industry.  I am delighted to see that a clause to that effect has been inserted into the Bill.  I welcome the Bill and I look forward to Bord na Móna once again having the success which it has had over many decades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms I welcome the introduction of this legislation. For many years industry and companies like Bord na Móna and the ESB were completely constricted and constrained by out-of-date legislation which forced them into the most devious contortions in order to involve themselves in operations from which they were forbidden by the legislation.  It is a reflection of the gom-been mentality which existed in the twenties and thirties which really tried to suppress the development of the ESB and Bord na Móna at that stage.  We in fact saw little of it but it raised its ugly head just 18 months ago when the ESB decided they could sell coal cheaper than anybody else.  All the forces who were supposedly <Col N="547" /> in favour of the free market at all times until that point suddenly found it was no longer suitable to allow the ESB to sell coal and at that stage the Government fought a rearguard action &mdash; and I must say I supported them on it &mdash; against many of the people whose predecessors had 40 years ago objected to the Shannon scheme.  It was the same mentality which led to the setting up of this legislation 30, 40 or 50 years ago, legislation which did not allow Bord na Móna to develop along the lines on which it should have been allowed to develop.  It is the same mentality which would shut down national radio stations when they feel it is in the interests of the other side at certain stages.  However, there is enough said about that for today.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the portfolios of Energy and Communications were separated from each other last July or August.  At least I feel more secure in discussing this legislation here today.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's input and his comprehensive report on various aspects.  He outlined one of the issues which I was alluding to there &mdash; the question of having to put people on secondment to Foreign Affairs in order to let them work on operations abroad. I welcome the broadening out of the base of the board on this.  I think it is very positive and progressive and that it will lead to both efficiency and effectiveness in the operation of Bord na Móna.  To that extent it is very much to be welcomed. I have some problems about what I see as various conflicts between what the Minister said in his speech and sections 4 and 5 of the Bill which I will refer to in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw what was done with hotels in the States.  Aer Lingus have on many occasions subsidised many of their operations through things like their hotels. Similarly, the ESB are now moving out into areas which they did not consider before.  It is great to see the ESB taking full page advertisements dealing with their retail outlets, aspects of their work which they not only ignored but felt was not in their interest in years past.  I am <Col N="548" /> also delighted with the new thrust and impetus in the marketing of Bord na Móna products.  It should not go without saying that the famous Marino Waltz advertisement certainly put the board before the public eye.  It took the bog into the hit parade, which certainly was an important thing at that time.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure that I would agree with all that has been said.  Senator Conroy refered to the end of the sod of turf.  I am not sure about that.  Until last year I operated my house, which is in the county of Dublin, on turf.  There is a difficulty in terms of the pure bulk of the stuff.  I always found it difficult to simply order ten tonnes of turf and get it delivered and to rely on the quality.  The advantage of the briquette, of course, is that the quality control is superb &mdash; one briquette is the same as the other whether you buy it in Belmullet or in Dublin.  It is a different ball game altogether with the sod of turf.  The reason bulk buying of turf has become so difficult for the consumer is that one just cannot rely on the consistency of the quality; there is no quality control on the sod of turf. Obviously, the peat briquette is a much more manageable product in the way it is now being presented and it can be handled in supermarkets, etc.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the bulk selling of sods of turf to people who wish to run their home on such turf.  Oil is very cheap at the moment, but that is not always going to be the case.  Every year in their statement of accounts or annual report Bord na Móna make it clear how world energy prices are really the main determining factor in working out the marketability and the saleability of a product.  Bord na Móna have always been dependent on the weather and on world prices.  These are the two great variables over which they have no control, on which they are utterly and totally dependent.  Therefore, that is another reason why I welcome this legislation which allows them to broaden their base of activities so that they can involve themselves in areas which would allow them to compensate for difficulties which would arise because of weather <Col N="549" /> problems and because of world energy price problems.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that both the Minister and the first speaker from the Government side of the House found it important enough to make a reference to the workers in Bord na Móna.  I think it would be wrong to allow any discussion on Bord na Móna to take place without recognising the great difficulties that those workers have gone through.  They have taken a hiding from the media on quite a number of occasions over the last number of years.  They have been absolutely loyal and dedicated to that company.  They have gone through the trauma of lay-offs, short time, half-time and indeed of redundancies.  They have come through and are as dedicated as ever they were.  I certainly would also want to put on the record my admiration for their contribution, not just to their industry but in many ways to our economic policy.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to respond to the question of the long-term future of Bord na Móna.  I am one of the people who objected to the setting up of Coillte Teoranta.  I listened to what the Minister had to say agus bhí mé ag éisteacht chomh maith leis an tSeanadóir Ó Foighil agus an méid a bhí le rá aige mar gheall ar dhaoine i lár na tíre atá ag brath ar Bhord na Móna ó thaobh fostaíochta de agus gach rud a bhaineann leis sin.  I want to hear the bad news as well.  As I understand it &mdash; and I am open to correction as I am not an expert on this area &mdash; there is no long-term future for Bord na Móna and we are talking about their prospects in the medium term.  What I want to know is whether there is going to be a Bord na Móna or a turf industry by the year 2010, 19 years from now?  I do not believe there will be.  I think it is misleading to talk in terms of their long-term prospects.  What we are talking about is their prospects in the medium-term. It is a five to ten year industry and I cannot see what will be happening in this industry in ten years time.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister looks aghast.  That is a warning shot of what I <Col N="550" /> want to say.  I see no need to have Coillte Teoranta and Bord na Móna running separate operations.  To me they are synonymous, dealing with almost the same product.  As well as this, the development of the biomass technique as a source of energy will bring them even closer together.  I put it very strongly to the Government at the time that it would be a mistake to set up Coillte Teoranta.  The operations of Coillte Teoranta should be an extension of the operations of Bord na Móna who have the expertise and the managing and marketing techniques, required by Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>We could have saved on costs and had a more efficient operation if we had put both of them together.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states that the board may promote and take part in the formation or establishment of a company; acquire, hold and dispose of shares or any other interests in a company and become a member of a company etc., having regard to the definition of &ldquo;company within this State&rdquo; under the terms of the present Companies Act and the proposed Companies Bill.  I would like to know if any difficulties will be created because of this in the long term?</P>
    <P>What would happen if Bord na Móna merged into Coillte Teoranta?  Is this a possibility?  Would the Minister outline his view on this matter as this could not happen without ministerial blessing. There was a vote a short time ago on another Bill on the question of ministerial involvement and responsibility.  I am in a state of confusion about what is involved in this Bill.  Is there anything in this Bill which would prohibit, stop or block an attempt to merge Coillte Teoranta and Bord na Móna?  Not only will this be necessary, it will also be inevitable by the turn of the century.  I want to make sure that we clear the road for this to take place as it certainly will happen.  The one thing that might delay this happening is developments in the cutaway bogs.  I listened with some interest to what the Minister had to say on that matter.  A major development will take place which is quite exciting.  This legislation allows <Col N="551" /> for such development to take place in an efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I do not see the need for section 4 of the Bill.  Obviously, I must be misreading it but I do not see the need for it.  Therefore I am certainly going to propose that it be deleted from the Bill.  I do not think it adds anything to it.  I look forward in particular to the Minister's response on that matter.  Section 4 states the board may engage in the marketing of turf and turf products, the production of turf and turf products; fostering the production and use of turf and turf products; the acquisition of bogs and other lands; the management, development and working of bogs &mdash; which basically amount to consultancy work &mdash; and generally doing all such other things as arise out of, or are consequential upon, the powers mentioned in the preceding paragraphs.  That is fine.  It moves on to state that the exercise of these powers shall be subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the way in which it will operate.  If Bord na Móna take up a minority interest in a viable company outside the State and this viable company proceeds to involve itself in something the Minister for Finance or Minister for Energy does not like, what will happen at that point?  I do not think that adds anything to the Bill but rather will create extra work for the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 5 states that the board may, inside or outside the State, engage in all such commercial activities, whether in relation to the production or marketing of turf or otherwise, as in the opinion of the board arise out of and can advantageously be conducted in conjunction with any function of the board.  That is not right.  It cannot engage in activities which, in the opinion of the board, can be advantageously conducted as it is stated in section 4 these are subject to the consent of the Minister.  Therefore, it is not just a matter of whether the board consider these activities can be advantageously conducted, it is a matter of whether the Minister also agrees with them.  That does not add anything to the <Col N="552" /> Bill.  This is one of the few points on which I might be in agreement with the Minister's party.  It is a clear example of where a &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; policy should be adopted by the State.  Once a board is set up, they should be left to get on with it.</P>
    <P>Section 5 states the board may, inside or outside the State, engage in commercial activities.  That is a clear statement. Why then do we need section 4?  That section actually restricts the spirit of section 5.  There is no sense including it and I certainly want to hear the reasons for including it.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said the Bill empowers the board to develop such bogs in accordance with such directives as may be laid down by the Minister for Energy of the day.</P>
    <P>If the board decide that an activity can be advantageously conducted and the Minister decides he does not like it for some reason, such as somebody in high places is developing something privately hand-in-hand somewhere else, what would happen?</P>
    <P>What kind of constraint does the Minister have in mind?  I can see an immediate conflict.  I envisage Bord na Móna saying they can produce electricity cheaper than the ESB and wish to sell it to the ESB.  Perhaps that would be out of line with national energy policies.  I can see the reason for imposing constraints, in terms of national policy rather than on economic and commercial activities.  Sections 4 and 5 deal with commercial activities.</P>
    <P>What would happen if Bord na Móna decide that perhaps the best thing they could do with a cutaway bog would be to start prospecting for minerals or oil? Where would that leave us in the long-term? Some people might begin to feel uncomfortable and put undue pressure on Ministers and the Government.  Why is the Minister including that constraint in section 4 (2)?  I believe sections 4 and 5 are in conflict with one another.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an inbuilt conflict and contradiction in section 10.  As the Minister is aware, I look very closely at the provisions on the remuneration to be paid to public servants and people <Col N="553" /> attached to State industry, etc.  The section states that in determining the remuneration to be paid, the board should have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant.  I have a great difficulty in legislating for wage agreements. I immediately see a conflict in that there could well be a Government guideline which has not been nationally agreed.  What happens in that case?</P>
    <P>The section goes on to state the board should comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances etc. which the Minister may give from time to time to the board.  Is that a wise and necessary interference by the State in the operation of the board?  Why should the Minister have to tell the industry what they should pay their workers? I do not think there is any need for this and I look at it from both sides of the coin.  First, I object to it because it would represent a centralised attempt to depress workers' wages to which I would obviously object.  If an attempt was made to do that I hold that the very energetic and positive trade union representatives of the workers in that industry would ensure that it would not happen.  I fail to see what the advantage to the State would be in interfering in the internal operations of the company.  Why should the State interfere and tell the board or the industry what they should pay their workers? This is an interference which cannot be justified.  I can see a conflict in this and I request the Minister to justify the inclusion of his section and indicate what effect it will have.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the section do not do anything to develop the turf industry. What the board pay their workers is surely a matter for the board, perhaps at sub-board level.  It may even be a matter which would not come before the board at all.  This raises the question as to the Minister's style.  Giving the Minister the final or a major say in the type of commercial activities in which the board may engage and allowing the Minister for Finance to decide on wage increases etc. for employees of the company amounts <Col N="554" /> to inteference with the working of the industry.</P>
    <P>This is fine legislation in many other ways but I do not think these two aspects add anything to it.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider these points.  As I said, this is positive legislation which removes the chains and shackles on the industry. Let us not remove those shackles on the one hand and replace them with other constraints.  I do not think Ministers need, want, or should be involved in the administration of the company or in the policy decisions of boards.  We should put the right people on those boards so that they do not find themselves in conflict with Government on the one hand and, on the other, ensure the administration are able to decide on the appropriate level of wages for their workers.</P>
    <P>With those two reservations, I welcome the general thrust of the legislation, I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive presentation and I look forward to his response on some of the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important Bill.  It provides the board of management of Bord na Móna with some of the main tools they need to restructure and revitalise the operations of the board. The Bill's main purpose is to provide greater flexibility in the ways the board may adopt to reorganise and restore the core peat business to a sound financial basis, to enable the board to engage in other activities in which they have acquired particular expertise, to promote, form, take part in and require companies to enter into joint ventures to exploit cutaway bogs and other bogs not required for peat production and to undertake engineering and building works not related to peat and to engage in consultancy, advisory and training activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since their formation in 1946, Bord na Móna have played an important role not just in providing an important alternative native source of energy but also providing a significant number of jobs in areas in which, in most cases, there was no alternative source of employment.  The <Col N="555" /> importance of peat in Ireland is emphasised by the fact that one-sixth of the total land area is peat land.  Bord na Móna are unique in that the company are totally dependent on the unpredictable nature of Irish weather.  They have faced major problems in recent years when we experienced summers ranging from poor to dismal.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are central to the social and economic infrastructure of the midlands where there is a concentration of bog.  The company employ 3,000 people despite almost 1,200 redundancies during the past few years.  There have been job losses in County Offaly where peat production formed 50 per cent of the board's operations.  In this respect, I compliment the workforce for the manner in which they accepted there was a need for rationalisation. There has been very little other industrial development in the areas where Bord na Móna have operated during the past 40 years.  Job losses have taken place since rationalisation was undertaken by the board during the past few years and there is the added problem that no apprentices, fitters, carpenters etc, have been taken on by Bord na Móna since then.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have always been regarded as the flagship of the semi-State sector.  In the two oil crises during the seventies, at the direction of the Government the board embarked on a substantial development programme, which involved huge capital, to substantially increase output to provide milled peat for the ESB power station to create energy and reduce our dependence on oil when the price of oil was highly volatile.  It was the exploitation of an indigenous natural resource to provide substantial employment, and substituting for imported oil required to generate electricity.  As a semi-State company and because of the way it was structured financially, they have to borrow substantial sums on the open market to fund capital programmes. Unlike a private company, which could develop in such circumstances, they were unable to go to the stock market to raise equity funds.  As the company must fund <Col N="556" /> their operations by borrowing they have incurred substantial repayment costs on their borrowings, particularly during the era of high interest rates in the late seventies and early eighties.  This meant that an increasing amount of profits went in fund interest on borrowings rather than part of it being made available for substantial research and development and diversification programmes to widen the product base and provide alternative sources of revenue, to give added value to the product and to provide substantial employment.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna borrowings stand at £180 million, despite profits of £20 million. They have to make huge interest repayments on borrowings each year with the result that the enterprise is being choked and deprived of the necessary breathing space in seeking to restructure their operations.  It is reported in the accounts for the last financial year yet to be published that despite their efforts to cut costs by reducing overhead costs by £6 million, their interest repayments increased by an extra £7 million for the same financial year.  It is clear that Bord na Móna are having to run in order to stand still and that the future of the company rests on a proposal at present being considered by the Government in relation to financial restructuring of the company.</P>
    <P>The principal submission is to set up a holding company to take over the debt and provide a moratorium period of approximately five years while the Government arrange for payment of interest on the debts of the holding company so as to give Bord na Móna breathing space during that five year period, to generate profits and reinvest substantially in the company, so that when the moratorium is up the company will be in a position to take over the repayments of the debt from a more financially secure and sound position.</P>
    <P>Stokes Kennedy Crowley have been commissioned by the Minister for Energy to vet the submission from Bord na Móna and decisions are imminent.</P>
    <P>Given the economic and social importance of Bord na Móna in the areas in <Col N="557" /> which they operate, particularly the midlands, it is vital that the Government arrange for a financial restructuring of the company without any further depletion in employment having regard to the fact that the board have reduced numbers and increased productivity to a maximum, as a result of their voluntary redundancy programme agreed with the unions, over the past two years.  New work practices have been introduced and the new Haku system of operation for milled peat has been introduced side by side with the old Peco system.  Enterprise units have been set up whereby groups of workers operate autonomously within the board, and act as a private company making milled peat with Bord na Móna purchasing from them as agents.  This is an attempt by the new management team to encourage enterprise and initiative in the company, cut costs, secure employment and provide a product at a competitive cost with other fuels being purchased by the ESB in the generation of electricity.  The price of milled peat, in terms of energy generated, is more expensive than oil or coal. However, it is important that we retain our indigenous solid fuel resource while, at the same time, insisting that Bord na Móna operate commercially and provide solid fuel at the most competitive price possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill and the provisions which provide for greater flexibility within the institutional set-up of the board through the creation of sub-boards, Bord na Móna is being divided into three semi-autonomous divisions, with the head office being decentralised to their place of operation, as follows: horticultural peat, with its head office at Cul na Mona near Portlaoise, the milled peat division, with its head office at Boora, County Offaly, and the turf division, which will deal with peat briquettes, to be located at Croghan, County Offaly.  It would seem that some rationalisation is required having regard to the fact that there are four briquette factories, located at Lullymore, County <Col N="558" /> Kildare; Littleton, County Tipperary; Derryinlough, and Croghan, County Offaly.  Sales of briquettes should increase, given that the sale of bituminous coal has been banned in Dublin from next winter.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a big marketing drive being undertaken by Bord na Móna to increase their very small share of the solid fuel market, at present standing at 7 or 8 per cent.  Sales from the four factories, when in simultaneous production, account for only 75 per cent of the total output.  I hope the slack can be taken up by an increase in their share of the Dublin market.  There have been temporary closures in all four factories to allow for overproduction and the fact that sales have been slack, particularly last winter.</P>
    <P>In considering the options for the board's future, one obvious question is the future use of bogs from which commercial quantities of turf have already been extracted and which are not suitable for use for forestry purposes.  In July 1987, the Government decided that Bord na Móna cutaway bogs which were suitable for forestry were to be transferred to the forestry services of the Department of Energy.  I agree with this decision and disagree with Senator O'Toole who I think objected to the Bill which provided for the setting-up of Coillte Teoranta.  It was an important step because it is also very important that we develop forestry.  The decision applies to the cutaway bogs at present available for planting and to those areas of cutaway which will become available in the future. This area will rise in the future as more and more bogs are depleted in so far as commercial exploitation by Bord na Móna is concerned.  The board have no statutory power to use cutaway bogs to establish any activity related to peat production for which there may be a commercial opportunity.  This Bill provides the board with such power but emphasises that as far as cutaway bogs are concerned the power applies only to cutaway which is not required for forestry <Col N="559" /> purposes.  It further provides that all cutaway bog no longer commercially viable for the exploitation and extraction of turf must first be offered to Coillte Teoranta to ensure that it is unsuitable for forestry.</P>
    <P>All Bord na Móna operations are very much weather-dependent and this has to be taken into account in assessing their performance.  The board are working to provide systems of operation which will make it less weather dependent.  The Haku system has been introduced with this purpose in mind.  They have made a signficant contribution to the local economy, particularly in County Offaly, where 50 per cent of its operation is located.  Fianna Fáil were associated with Bord na Móna in the time of the late Sean Lemass.  Under the chairmanship and stewardship of the late Todd Andrews it has gone from strength to strength.  It is vitally important at this critical time for the company that the measures taken by the Government will be supportive and helpful to a semi-State company who have undertaken their own rationalisation programme in an attempt to do all it can internally.  They cannot get away from the fact that a financial restructuring of the company needs to take place as soon as possible and it is in the interests of the company and the workers that the matter be clarified as soon as possible.  The Government should now come forward with a decision, having considered the matter carefully over the past few months, since the submission was first made to the Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with the pensions of the workers.  The Turf Development Bill takes note of the fact that the board are operating in a more commercial market than heretofore and the flexibility enshrined in the Bill will help for quick decision-making and decisive leadership from the management of the company as they enter a critical phase in their development.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you will accept it is a national issue and not, in the least, a parochial issue.  The Bill is necessary to tidy up the position largely because of Bord na Móna recent activities in the horticultural sector outside the country. There have been wide-ranging comments concerning the board.  I wish I could be as sanguine as other speakers but, with some experience, I would find this difficult for certain reasons which I would like to comment on.</P>
      <P>I am a little bit uneasy about proposals which give too much latitude to Bord na Móna.  This is not an issue which concerns Bord na Móna any more or less than any other semi-State company but it is a fact of life that many Governments in the past established what were described as semi-State bodies but which more properly should have been entitled State bodies. There is a great national spirit when a board is established to perform a certain function, be it in the airline business, or in the peat or sugar production sectors.</P>
      <P>There is great fervour at the beginning but if these boards are given latitude to exceed their original brief, they can abuse their function.  There is a history of this running through State investments.  For that philosophical reason &mdash; and nothing specifically related to Bord na Móna &mdash; I would be making these comments regardless of the State body for which the Minister was proposing latitude &mdash; I am uneasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from the Minister's speech that the board will be given the added flexibility to exploit commercial opportunities <Col N="561" /> in ancillary areas.  There is latitude involved in sections of the Bill.  Section 5 says that the board may, inside or outside the State, engage in all such commercial activity whether in relation to the production, marketing of turf or otherwise as in the opinion of the board arise out of or advantageously can be conducted in conjunction with any function of the board.  There is huge latitude there, much wider latitude than I would give to any State company.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) states:</P>
    <P>(1)  In the performance and exercise of its functions in or outside the State, the board may do all or any of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  manufacture any plant, machine, apparatus or appliance.</P>
    <P>There is extraordinary latitude there.  My view is that it was certainly not the intention on the establishment of Bord na Móna that it should engage in the manufacture of any plant, machine, apparatus or appliance.  The section continues:</P>
    <P>(b)  erect buildings,</P>
    <P>If there are people making agricultural buildings like Keenans in Bagenalstown, McCartan's in Newtowngore, is it reasonable that a State body should get into this sector at a certain time to protect what it believes to be its interests but which could decimate what is happening in the private sector in that particular area?</P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) (e) says:</P>
    <P>to establish and operate shops and showrooms.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the controversy where the ESB are concerned with showrooms around the country and the views of the private sector people in the electical business.</P>
    <P>I would be extremely uneasy about allowing that kind of latitude to a State body, particularly in the case of Bord na Móna, for this particular reason: the board has the most appalling problems, some of its own creation and some <Col N="562" /> because of the function it has, obsolescence and so on.  What I mean by obsolescence is that our bogs are running out. The major raised bogs in the midlands have a limited lifespan left, to which Senator O'Toole referred.  He suggested that there may not be a turf industry in Ireland in the year 2010, only 20 years hence.  Looking at the projections of the board, that is approximately the fact of life, that where the major employment of the board is in the midlands, there is a short time-span to the extinction of those bogs.  When you get past that point and down to the subsoil and start forestry or whatever else, whatever happens on that land past that point is an infinitesimal employer of people in comparison with the turf industry in its own right.  Consequently there will be the most extreme administrative and political pressure on the board to diversify.  The broad latitude I see in this Bill I would regard as giving the board <i>carte blanche</i> and far more powers than I would be happy about because of the potential abuses I can see looming.</P>
    <P>For that reason I would urge greatest diligence possible by whatever Minister is in the Department of Energy to ensure that what they do is fairly closely related to their core business.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the concern expressed in the Dáil about the financial position of the board and that was with very good reason.  Senator Kiely gave some details about the extent of their indebtedness.  I do not have the figure in front of me because I had a very limited time to prepare my speech but I understand that it is greatly in excess of £100 million.</P>
    <P>I have a few critical comments to make but I am very glad to note at this time the sense of realism of the present chief executive of Bord na Móna, who acknowledged the problems of the debt and who in so far as the operations of Bord na Móna are concerned acknowledges the level of overmanning which exists, the extent to which he has to get his house <Col N="563" /> in order and has the courage, which is unusual for the chief executive in a semi-State company, to draw adverse comparisons between the historical performance of his own board and of equivalent boards in other countries.  For example he has gone publicly on record &mdash; it is a fact of life but it is refreshing to hear him recognise the fact &mdash; that an approximately similar amount of peat is harvested in Finland as here.  Historically, we have been producing the same volume of peat with over 6,000 people, whereas the number of people employed in Finland to perform the same function, to produce the same volume, the same wealth, has been something of the order of about 1,700, implying that the redundancy level here, if one is cost effective in line with the modern approach in the sector is in the region of 3,000 or 4,000 people.  This is a fact of life, recognised by the chief executive of Bord na Móna, recognised by the Department and, I presume, recognised by the Minister, which forces the board to put its house in order.</P>
    <P>In so far as the present level of the debt is concerned, the board itself has been the architect of much of that because when it was given a brief by Government, 20-30 years ago, when the energy crisis loomed to set up a first and then a second national programme for fuel production, unfortunately the prevailing view was that in Ireland we knew what this sector was all about and we should continue to do things as had always been done here. While we laid our plans to continue major capital investment in line with what had been established practice here, there was a revolution taking place in the peat sector in the Nordic countries.  What was happening in the Nordic countries at that time was that, at the height of this energy crisis, a country such as Finland had a vast peat resource, had never used it, had virtually no alternative energy resources and their Government adopted a strong political position of insisting that the peat <Col N="564" /> resources be developed.  They took people out of their technical institutes to do it.  They knew nothing about the sector before they started and that was a blessing because they did not have tunnel vision.  They went out and looked at a sector with a good but open mind and developed in a different way.  Basically what they did is very simple and is now being copied here &mdash; Senator Kiely referred to it &mdash; namely the Haku system.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difference is that as we had developed, we developed with mega-machines, mega-bogs, mega-rail-way systems, mega-investment and mega-people, which meant that if you wanted to develop a peat bog on the traditional method here you got into the direct employment of contractors, mechanics, fitters and electricians.  It did not relate in any sense to what was required in the sector, having regard to the weather factor.  We had three successive years which were until last year three of the worst in this century.  The board was brought to its knees because it was not geared to the modern approach, towards modern technology.  The bad winters came; there was no production in the summer; there were thousands on the payroll.</P>
    <P>In contrast to that you can run bogs today, you can scrap your railway systems; you can replace them with simple trailers which can be towed by standard farmers' tractors.  You do not need permanent workers on the production side. You can bring in farmers and sub-contractors to carry out that work.  You need a limited number of mechanics and electricians on a permanent wage roll because if you are subcontracting, the farmer will look after the maintenance of his own tractor.</P>
    <P>The whole principle of what is described as the Haku system is that it is entirely related to weather.  If there is a good summer, the farmers make a lot of money.  If there is a bad summer, they batten down the hatches.  They might not make very much but they contain their <Col N="565" /> overheads and the energy company is not bled.  Bord na Móna had been bled.  If 20 or 30 years ago when we made major investments, if senior management in Bord na Móna and the boards to which they were accountable, and the Governments in turn to which they were accountable, looked at what was happening in this sector internationally the debt which exists in Bord na Móna today would not exist to a fraction of the extent.  I will give you two figures.  The Littleton complex, including factory, bog development and bog machinery cost something of the order of £40 million.  A major part of the technology is obsolete and what costs £40 million might more reasonably, using different methods, have cost about £10 million.  There is conceivably a cost saving of the order of about £30 million.  I see Senator Conroy shaking his head.  It is a fact of life which I can prove to him.</P>
    <P>The other point is that based on the balance sheet, if they try to service the interest charges in Littleton on the huge borrowings there, you end up with a profit and loss account which suggests that the factory is losing about £5 million a year. These are facts which I would be glad to relate outside this Chamber to my friend at any time and to produce the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the abortive Ballyforan venture in which about £12 million was expended and there is not a factory there.  There were strange events at that time concerning Ballyforan.  There was a certain amount of evidence that some millions of pounds of equipment was ordered after the Minister of the time scrapped the project.  In that sense, if there is a substantial debt, to an extent people in past times responsible for what was going on in Bord na Móna were architects of it but, having said that, one does not want to be unduly critical.  We have to look at the present and look to <Col N="566" /> the future.  I am glad to see the sense of realism there is at present.</P>
      <P>In so far as that realism is concerned, I welcome very much the decision by Bord na Móna to sell their headquarters in Dublin.  I have been in the building many times.  I am a great admirer of it.  I gather there are structural problems but I will not argue that.  Architecturally, it is a gem.  It is a lovely building.  But, from the beginning my view was that it was a crime for an organisation such as Bord na Móna, with its roots in the bogs, to insist on having its headquarters in Dublin when their headquarters other than Dublin was as close to Dublin as Newbridge, which is a dormitory village of this city.  I can understand workers and executives wanting to work in the city so that their children are near the universities and the schools.  I can take all this into account but I could see no reason in the world why executives or others working in Newbridge could not have access to the superb educational facilities in this whole region.  This decentralisation into these three or four other areas is very much to be welcomed.  The grandiose concept of the Dublin headquarters and all that went with it was a form of madness and was part of the syndrome that led to that type of debt situation.  There is a sense of realism shown in the sale of that headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sod turf has been mentioned.  Of course, the board is doing very much less in the sod turf sector than it had done previously and the reason is very simple. It is not that sod turf production does not pay, it does pay and is a substantial source of income for many farmers; but it is because the private turf plan into which the State has put a very limited amount of money to help the farmers has been hugely successful.  From a cost benefit point of view, if the Government want to analyse what they have been losing annually on the direct route through the board or what they have gained in production through putting a very few hundreds of thousands of pounds or millions <Col N="567" /> into the private turf scheme, the private turf scheme is yielding about one million tons of turf each year produced cost effectively by Irish farmers who can sell it at the right price.  Effectively, common sense private sector activity has been so successful in the sector that it has rendered obsolete what the board could do. The board, weighed down by so much of its structure, with its private workforce, the cost structure, etc, simply could not compete.  That is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>There is another issue I just point to very briefly before I revert to the specifics of the Bill.  These State companies have consolidated balance sheets and you can work miracles with a consolidated balance sheet because you do not publish the accounts of the various sectors.  You can have profit-making sectors and loss-making sectors and you can have the profit-making sector picking up the tab for what happens in the loss-making sector.  One of the horrifying aspects of the level of Bord na Mona indebtedness and subsequent cost is that at the end of the day the Irish consumer is paying for it.  Let me give you one or two facts in relation to this which are of great concern. It is no wonder that many in the Dáil were concerned about the financial state of the board because of the spinoff.</P>
    <P>What has been happening is, that the profit and loss account will show that the Ballyforan factory is losing about £5 million a year if you service the interest and, of course, you must service the interest.  That is one simple example.  You build the accumulative effect of two or three of those and you run into an enormous loss situation.  What do you do? You are selling milled peat to the ESB for electricity generation so you charge the ESB about 50 per cent more than you should charge them, in order to recoup what you are losing.  About four or five years ago, when conventional energy prices are running very high and the <Col N="568" /> board was running into a financial catastrophe and the Minister for Energy wore a hat for the ESB and he wore a hat for Bord na Móna, effectively a political decision was made in relation to what the price of milled peat was because at the end of the day the two boards should be one board, responsible to the same Minister.  At the stroke of a pen, a decision was made insisting that the ESB pay an energy-related price for milled peat.  &ldquo;Energy-related&rdquo; equated the price of milled peat with the price of oil.</P>
    <P>Those of you who know the energy sector around the world will know that in the case of solid fuels the lower in energy value you go, the less value they are in equivalent BTU terms.  Simply because peat is a desperately low BTU, even when you relate it in energy value to oil, because of the huge costs of using the kind of fuel that it is and the capital costs incurred and everything else that goes with it, the value is discounted in energy terms.  It might be 50 per cent cheaper because of the problems associated with it, but the paying of the same price was an outrageous decision.</P>
    <P>Even more outrageous was this: the decision was made to compensate the board on an equal price for oil and this gave Bord na Móna in a single balance sheet an extra £20 million in that given year, or of the order of what happened the following year.  The price of oil came back by about 40 per cent and there was no question of an energy-related price for peat.  The whole concept went out the window.  I have not had time today to get the up-to-date position but the ESB was paying of the order of about £20 million a year more than it should have been for milled peat, given world prices for the commodity and equivalent energy prices. If that is the case, it kicks back on the Irish consumer whether it is a farmer in a milk parlour in east Galway or a housewife in Ballyfermot with her electric cooker or an industry under pressure to maintain jobs.  It is one of the factors why energy prices have been much higher <Col N="569" /> in this country than they should have been.  It is for all of these reasons that I have a fairly jaundiced view where this debate is concerned and why I have to express my reservations as well as what I would like to say of a more positive nature.</P>
    <P>The Bill stems from the activity of the board in the horticulture sector and it seems that is one of their best profit centres. It seems they are very adept commercially in the sector.  They seem to be very successful in the acquisition they made in France and that is suggesting to them that they should engage in other activity outside the State.  In so far as this activity is in the peat sector and they see a role to play, given the potential redundancies, this in itself is very welcome.</P>
    <P>State companies' have to be compared against an international standard.  While the board is successful in the horticultural sector outside Ireland, there is no evidence to suggest that it is being successful in the energy sector.  Bord na Móna are competing in the developed world for consultancy services in the peat energy sector but are picking up a tiny fraction of the business.  They are picking up a limited amount of business on the African continent in some fourth world countries. But, in the United States of America, Canada, Germany or Sweden, a huge proportion of the consultancy services in the peat energy sector are provided by Finland and Sweden.  This is a fact of life which must be considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity the board will have to get involved in joint ventures. It is a very good idea.  I note that the Minister said it will be the intention that participation in any such joint ventures would be on the basis that it would pay its way.  I would hope that comment would not be necessary.  It should go without saying.  The fact that the board would have to get into bed with private sector people who would not entertain the venture unless, in the first instance, it looked like paying its way is certainly healthy.  A <Col N="570" /> real semi-state company, in my view is a company which is a joint venture; in which there is investment by the State and investment by the private sector.  If there is not that private sector investment I call them State companies.</P>
    <P>The idea of sub-boards, breaking up the activities of the board, is an excellent idea because there are three or four different profit centres there, each very different, requiring different talents.  I note from the Minister's speech that the board have power to engage in activities not directly related to peat but which arise from expertise acquired and developed by the company in carrying out their original functions.  That is far too broad for my liking.</P>
    <P>On the cutaway bogs issue, I have very strong views because we are a country of farmers and largely private sector people. Land is land.  Unfortunately, in past years, as the board developed, the farming community had to sell bogland to the board at abysmal prices.  They did not have any choice for two reasons; they were very poor and they needed the money.  In other cases, in areas of high emigration, the board had statutory powers for compulsory acquisition.  Families who went to Manchester, London or Boston were under intense pressure and the forcible acquisition route was taken.</P>
    <P>I have seen around Ballycroy and Belmullet in County Mayo a couple of thousand acres of the best of bogland bought as recently as 20 to 25 years ago for £7 an acre.  I saw land bought in a year prior to that for £1.50 and £2 an acre.  I saw the board coming in on a family of an elderly woman who was forced to sign something.  There was no legal documentation and they came back 30 years later claiming that they had a title to it, which they did not have.  They were beaten in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I find highly unsatisfactorily about the cutaway issue.  I do not approve of the compulsory acquisition powers of the board.  In many other countries when an energy company needs <Col N="571" /> bogland to develop the energy resource, there are two ways in can be done.  The farmer might voluntarily want to sell that land but there is an alternative route.  The farmer might be much more attracted towards leasing that land to an energy company.  If you go the leasing route, the farmer holds his title to the land, it is there for future generations in his family, he has employment on the land during the time the turf is being cut; the energy company incurs all the expenditure in field drains, main drains, roads and boundaries and, at the end of the day, when the energy is gone, the land reverts to the farmer in a far better condition than the first day because it is drained and there are roads through the system and future generations of the family will have that holding as part of that family's heritage.  Much more of that type of activity should have developed over the years.</P>
    <P>What do we now find?  We find a social mess because we are building up through the direct labour method, towns and villages in the midlands, built up solely by direct employment, in which in future there will not be direct employment to a fraction of the extent.  At the same time, we have taken this peat bog almost forcibly from the farming community and on what are now thousands acres of cut away bog we are adopting a kind of Gulag approach, we are into collective farming, practically into socialist farming, where vast tracts are now owned by the State and the State decides how the cutaway will be worked.  We would have a much better structure in this country if this cutaway bog was now reverting to the farmers who owned the land and the fringe of it, who owned it in the first instance.  There are very strong views on that issue in the IFA, in other farming organisations and among the farming community.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister, with this group that has been set up, to look at this issue, and to consider that rather than go down <Col N="572" /> the route of the State having to do the forestry, having to put the sheep, the cattle or the calves on it, that cognisance is taken of the original owners of the land and the input that the small farmers in these areas could have in the working of the lands.</P>
    <P>The board is given far too much latitude to go anywhere they like.  I can see the reason and I can see the pressure.  It needs to be tightened a little bit.  I would like, for the second time, to put on record my welcome to the Minister, Deputy Molloy, to this House particularly because of his recent banning of mining in Croagh Patrick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I would like to welcome the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, to the House for this important Turf Development Bill. Coming from a midlands area, it is appropriate that I should speak, if only briefly, on this important Bill.  It is a fact that Bord na Móna has been an outstanding employer in the midlands region over the past 50 or so years.  While, of course, it gave good permanent positions to many people, a feature of the employment of Bord na Móna was the seasonal or temporary work it gave to many people.  You had a situation where many people, particularly many small farming people living within ten or 12 miles of their particular bog, found their living standards were increased and improved as a result of temporary or seasonal work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, it can be said that Bord na Móna added enormously to the economic life of the country and to none more, I would suggest, than to the entire region of the midlands.  I want to stress what Bord na Móna has meant to so many people in the midlands.  It was for them their way of life, their life line and any change in direction must preserve viable, permanent worth-while jobs.  This is what the Bill is basically about, the financial stability of the company; continuation of jobs and survival of the company.  We are in a changing world.  Bord na Móna is not <Col N="573" /> the only State-sponsored organisation to change.  Indeed, many State-sponsored bodies over the years have changed or have diversified their areas of activity to remain viable and profit-making, in the interest of job retention and job creation.</P>
    <P>For the economic and social life of so many people, in the midlands region in particular, Bord na Móna must continue to be an important employer and must make every effort in its restructuring to improve its position, to protect its future and the jobs of the employees.  The expertise which the board have developed must be to the benefit of the economy, even though I realise it is in a changing, very challenging and highly competitive marketplace.  Personally I have no hang-up about change.  Changes are necessary to make obvious improvements in a changing marketplace.</P>
    <P>The board over the past number of years have had many problems, many difficulties.  We all know that.  Basically, what we are doing in this Bill is to give the board greater flexibility, in the way the board may adapt to reorganise and to restore its core peat business on a sound, financial basis to enable it to engage in other activities in areas where it has acquired particular expertise; to enable it to acquire companies, if that is what they want; to enable it to enter joint ventures.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole has referred to the work of Coillte Teoranta.  I certainly feel that Bord na Móna and Coillte Teoranta will be working very closely together for obvious reasons.  This year we had the passing of the Horticultural Bill giving effect to the setting up of Bord Glas.  I visualise Bord na Móna and Bord Glas as being mutually interested in one another's activities.  It is well known nationally, it is well known internationally, that Bord na Móna horticultural peat moss products are in great demand and sales of peat moss come to about £20 million annually.  There is great <Col N="574" /> scope for improvement in this area, for better sales nationally and internationally. This area of activity is one that the board will obviously be examining.</P>
    <P>There is the whole question of rationalisation, of changes in companies.  We have had it in the financial services over the past year.  In this House we have had debates on the changes in the building society movement and changes in the ACC.  We had the levelling of the playing field for the Trustee Savings Banks and changes in the ESB in 1988.  We are living in a changing world and Bord na Móna must move with the times.  In fact, I reckon they have no choice but to move with the changing times.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna, we know, are set to have major losses again this year.  The bottom line is that we are really talking about the survival of Bord na Móna and the staff agree that if changes are necessary for the survival of that company, then so be it.  The board must move forward from their traditional functions, the production and marketing of peat products. They must look forward to a new marketplace.  The Bill will improve the lot of Bord na Móna.  I certainly welcome it and wish Bord na Móna and their staff every success.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senators Tom Raftery and Liam Cosgrave that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today they propose to raise the following matter: in view of the damage being caused to the economy both locally and nationally by <Col N="575" /> the dispute at Waterford Glass, the need for the Minister for Labour to make every effort to resolve the dispute.  I understand the Senators intend to share their time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I compliment the Minister on his efforts to get agreement in this unhappy dispute.  I am sorry to see this dispute in Waterford, a city and a people for which I have a great affection.  Not only was it part of my constituency when I was an MEP but, more importantly, it was a city in which I began my career.  Even though my stay in Waterford was brief, I enjoyed my time there.  I am very happy, therefore, to see that both sides are at last talking and nothing should be said in this House, or outside, which might endanger the outcome of those talks.</P>
      <P>We have few enough products, God knows, that enjoy an international reputation. Waterford Glass has been the jewel in our crown, known and admired by people who do not even know that Ireland is a country or that Waterford is a city.  To the Waterford region it means 2,300 jobs directly in Waterford Glass and almost 7,000 jobs indirectly.  Waterford Glass workers have a payroll in excess of £54 million per annum and contribute about £22 million to the Exchequer.  To the balance of payments Waterford Glass contribute almost £100 million annually.  It is the single biggest tourist attraction in the south-east, attracting more than 100,000 visitors annually to Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present troubles arise from trading losses which simply could not be sustained. Over a three-year period the company lost in excess of £60 million and for the year ending December, 1989, the losses were in excess of £21 million.  Let us be quite clear that the present problems are the result of bad management over a long period of time and bad habits acquired by a workforce during better times.  That bad management includes, particularly, allowing wage costs to rise <Col N="576" /> much faster than inflation until labour costs amounted to more than 70 per cent of total costs.  The market could not possibly absorb the price increases necesary to offset such labour cost increases.</P>
    <P>Waterford workers have been know for a long time to be the highest paid workers in the land.  They are also, of course, among the most skilled people in the land.  The management proposals do not, let me repeat do not, envisage cuts in wages, only cuts in bonuses.  The proposals would still leave them the highest paid workers in Ireland.  The cuts proposed are in bonus payments.  Let me point out that these bonus payments were originally brought in solely at the discretion of management to be paid only, of course, if the industry could afford them.  Quite clearly the time has long since gone when the industry can afford them and it must be patently clear to everybody now that we can have these jobs only if we are realistic about the market.  The market situation, quite clearly, is that we cannot sell our glass at a price which we would have to charge to pay the level of wages and salaries which Waterford Glass have been paying in recent years.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that common sense will prevail.  I again thank the Minister for his intervention and I hope that the outcome will be satisfactory for Waterford, for the workers, the region and the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>Three minutes for each <Col N="577" /> of the Senators.  First, I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and as my party's labour spokesman in the Seanad, I raised this matter some weeks ago.  I am glad to be able to contribute to this debate.  As my colleague, Senator Raftery, said I do not think anyone would wish to say anything which would in any way affect the talks that are proceeding. I welcome the fact that talks have commenced and wish all those involved, both management, workers and officials of the Labour Court, success.  What we want to see is a happy outcome and an end to this dispute.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the problems which have evolved in recent weeks and of the possible horrendous consequences if they take their full course.  The action of politicians, civic leaders and those in public and commercial life, particularly in Waterford, in helping to bring about talks must be welcomed.  We are all only too well aware of the tremendous contribution that Waterford Glass has made to the economy and to the country.  The tremendous history behind that industry will encourage those involved in the discussions to arrive at a proper, just and, hopefully, lasting solution acceptable to all.  We are aware of the thousands of jobs that could be at risk, and of the thousands of people who depend on Waterford Glass.  We are all aware of the tremendous success of Waterford Glass throughout the world and we all wish that success to continue.  Obviously, changes have to take place.  Work practices and methods of production will change with the introduction of new technology but, at the end of the day, what we want to see is a product representing Waterford and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for Labour who has skilfully kept at this difficult task and brought the parties to the stage at least where they are talking. At times we are critical of Ministers, and others, and it is important to place on record our support for his initiative. The Minister has the support of all <Col N="578" /> Members for any action he takes. Democracy here has been founded on secret ballots and elections and that being the case there should be a secret ballot in this dispute.  I do not want to pre-empt or put any markers down as to what should or should not take place.  We all want to see a just and lasting solution to the difficulties which have evolved so that Waterford can continue to grow and benefit the country and our economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister and those who worked diligently in recent weeks.  Some weeks ago when we first raised this issue things were looking fairly black.  I would like to accommodate my two colleagues and allow them contribute a few words.  I wish the Minister well in his deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to thank my colleagues for allowing me to speak on this very important matter. There is only one clear message I would like to give tonight: now that talks are under way, I am not going to pre-empt those talks or try to dictate what should or should not be discussed at them.  The efforts over the last number of weeks have been very painful, very complicated and very difficult but, happily, talks are now under way.  While those talks will be extremely difficult, the one clear message from the workforce in Waterford Glass, with whom I have spent days and nights talking in the past number of weeks, is the importance of securing the long-term future of that company.  That is their objective, and, to me, that puts a very definite responsibility both on management and the unions.  They both know short-term answers will not suffice.  Now they want to sit down, they want breathing space, they want to get down to what they should be talking about with everything on the table.  That is a matter for the negotiating teams on either side to discuss.  Our wish for all of them is that they secure the long-term future of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> I would like to pay a most sincere compliment to the Minister for Labour.  It is not because I stand on this side of the House, but I know from practical experience the enormous amount of time, day and night, and weekends, he gave to this issue.  He handled it in a skilful way. His briefings were outstanding.  That can never be seen by the public and, indeed, it is hard to acknowledge it.  I would like to put that on record tonight.  The Minister's co-operation with me was quite beyond what one would expect of a Minister. He understood the gravity of the case and nobody has worked harder in this very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I am an optimist by nature and I believe we should stand back a little and let the people involved secure the future of the company.  It is the people in the company, on the factory floor and up to senior management, who have the ability to secure the long-term future of the company. It is vital for them, for my city, my county and for the national interest that that should happen.  I wish that process very well.  I urge caution on those who may want to contribute to the debate. They should stand back and give those involved breathing space to tackle the issues.  I wish the talks well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Minister to the Chamber and to wish the talks well.  It is great to see talks under way.  The negotiating parameters have been set.  Industrial relations is the art of compromise and we look forward to the successful conclusion of the talks.  I would like to ask both sides in the negotiations to recognise the classic industrial relations situation they are in. As some of my colleagues have already stated, in all companies wages and conditions of employment improved during the sixties and seventies.  That was the natural development at that time and it happened in Waterford.  Subsequent to that, changes accrued in the labour market and competitors came in with <Col N="580" /> different conditions of employment.  That put pressure on the company who had conditions and costs at a much higher level than their competitors.  That meant two things; either the firms in the area would have to adjust their costs, or else they would go out of business.</P>
      <P>Both sides must recognise that the workforce will, as far as possible, do everything to protect their conditions. That is the nature of things.  To do anything else would be unrealistic.  They must recognise also that the management require an extensive cost-cutting exercise to keep themselves competitive.  If they are to stay in the market they must get their costs right.  Not to do so means that the company will not be competitive and will continue to suffer losses with inevitable closure.  We have seen time and again that the companies who adjust their costs can survive.  I cite Guinness as one of those.  The companies who did not adjust their costs &mdash; and I know many of them &mdash; did not survive.  The failure was blamed on unions and on management but it had to do with the failure to recognise the situation that developed in the late eighties.  We have had changes in competition and changes in cost levels. Management must recognise the desire and the natural approach of labour to try to maintain their workers' standard of living and labour must recognise that the company must be cost effective in a competitive area.  Both sides should recognise each others position and try to come to a settlement that will be fair and reasonable. I was glad to hear Senator Cullen say that both sides have as their objective a settlement of the dispute.  They go in to get the best deal they can at the table but they must have that objective in mind.  I would like to thank my colleagues for allowing me to contribute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators Raftery, Neville, Cosgrave and Cullen for the opportunity to say a few words on the Waterford Glass dispute.  All Senators have been <Col N="581" /> helpful and have made it easy for me to say a few words because it is too difficult and too early in any negotiations to be anything other than vague.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, we have been involved in this dispute for the past number of weeks in an attempt to secure a basis for negotiations to begin talks. That proved to be quite difficult.  Everyone knows the story behind that.  I am happy to put on the record of the Seanad that the formula which I put to both sides for the commencement of negotiations was accepted.  I appointed an independent chairman and negotiations began today.  I do not want to say anything that might prejudice the outcome of negotiations beyond a few general comments.  I thank all Senators for being responsible in that regard because it is, as everyone appreciates, a delicate matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to wish both sides well in their attempts to reach agreement.  I would ask them to approach negotiations in a spirit of goodwill and conciliation and to ensure the long-term viability of the company which is in all their interests. I concur with the remarks of all the Senators who said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waterford Glass is one of our greatest enterprises, as Senator Raftery said.  It is an international success story and its demise would have both local and national effects.  It is important that the company continue to exist and, indeed, prosper.  In numerous company disputes the people do not always realise how well they are known.  In the Waterford case, if I had undertaken all the requests from people on radio programmes outside Ireland who wanted me to say something &mdash; which might have been unhelpful &mdash; I would have been on international radio for a few weeks.  I declined all of those requests but people should realise how international competitors are prepared to jump on a bad news story.  If Waterford Glass were launching one of the many hundreds of products they produce and wanted publicity, unfortunately they would not have got the international <Col N="582" /> media attention to the extent that I and others had over the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>Any successful undertaking results from a combination of capital, labour and enterprise, and one is no good without the others.  The key to success is the co-operation of management and workers to create quality products at a competitive price so that production can expand.  That is the nucleus of the story.  I would ask both sides to bear that in mind.  A combination of cutting costs and increased productivity will lead to a successful outcome and either on its own is not the answer.  We have to look to both sides.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for raising this matter. This has been my only opportunity throughout this dispute to thank Senators for their restraint in regard to public comment over the weeks.  In particular I would like to thank the media who, in all industrial relations disputes, are extremely responsible and helpful.  In this case I would like to single out one of the Members of the Seanad, Senator Cullen, because he was at the heart of the dispute and in a very difficult position.  I have had many contacts with him in industrial relations disputes.  Nobody can read onto the record of either House or onto any file, for that matter, the nature of contacts that go on in industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Members from the other House were also involved but I want to acknowledge the role of the Upper House in this and say that work in relation to this dispute, and other disputes, has always been on a non-party and non-political basis.  That has been the practice of the Houses of the Oireachtas for many years and it was used efficiently and effectively in the dire days of last week in this dispute.  As Minister for Labour I want to acknowledge that because it is a practice and precedent that has existed in both Houses down through many Ministers.  Such practice is vital in trying to come to grips with industrial disputes and I appreciate it, particularly in this dispute where it was not possible to get the results I was seeking without assistance from a number of <Col N="583" /> people.  Like other Senators, I want to mention the work done by those people, whether in all Church circles, business circles, trade union circles, other than those involved, such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers and many individuals in Waterford, and nationwide, who were concerned about the outcome.  The important thing now is that negotiations have commenced and there is great pressure and responsibility on those involved without anyone adding to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> I want to thank the various negotiating bodies and people directly involved in this dispute and wish them well in the arduous work ahead.  It is a difficult task but I have every confidence that they can overcome their difficulties and that we will see a continuation of one of the most successful Irish companies that ever was, Waterford Glass.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 31 May 1990.</P>
