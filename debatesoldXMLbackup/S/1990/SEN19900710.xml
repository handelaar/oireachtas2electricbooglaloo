      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to confer official sanction on Kilfinane Centre, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The location and development of St. Gabriel's school and clinic in Limerick for the physically handicapped, and the provision of a physical medical service for physically handicapped children on a site adjoining St. Paul's school, Dooradoyle, Limerick, to serve the need of the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill and housing development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent resolution <Col N="1930" /> tabled at the European Parliament, the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take an active interest in the case of Raoul Wallenberg.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Jackman, Kennedy, Ross and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Jackman and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Kennedy, Ross and Norris may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The business for today is item No. 1, as agreed, without debate; Second and Committee Stages of item No. 2 from the conclusion of the Order of Business until 4 p.m.; Committee and all Stages up to 7 o'clock, to conclude on item No. 3, the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, 1989.  There will be a sos from 2 o'clock to 2.30 p.m.  We will debate item No. 4, the Industrial Relations Bill, 1989, from 7 p.m. to 12 midnight, with a sos at 9 o'clock to 9.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, perhaps I could have some clarification from the Leader of the House when he says it is proposed to take Second and Committee Stages of item No. 2, that is, to take them but not necessarily to conclude.  There will not be any obstruction on this side of the House, but it is not a closure motion.</P>
      <P>Also on the Order of Business, may I compliment the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, for the efforts to date to secure the release of Brian Keenan and to say that on this side of the House &mdash; and, I am sure, in the House as a whole &mdash; we hope that this long agony will be brought to an end fairly soon and that he and the other hostages will be released.  The full voice of this House is behind the efforts of the Minister.  Indeed, I also compliment our colleague, Senator Eoin Ryan, on the part he has played in this up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> On another matter on the Order of Business, I would like your indulgence simply to say that I know the Government intend to bring in the Broadcasting Bill here on Thursday.  I would ask the Government to think again about that. To bring a controversial Bill straight from the other House defeats the whole purpose of the Seanad, which is to allow for a period of calm and reflection.  I would urge the Government to postpone this Bill until the autumn, but certainly not to bring it in on Thursday.  If it is in this House on Thursday, we will have to oppose it with every effort possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to co-operate as fully as possible with the timetable the Government have set for us in the next week or two.  Having said that, these benches will not agree to any closure motions on sensitive or important Bills. All the legislation before us is important and deserves full discussion.  I do not think, for instance, that the National Treasury Management Agency Bill, 1990, will go more than four hours, looking at it and at the number of possible speakers on it but, if it does I ask the Government to give it the leeway the legislation deserves.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning that this House must be given time to consider the legislation seriously.  It must not be put under pressure from the Government because they are in a sudden hurry to get legislation through.  We are sitting extremely long hours &mdash; I do not mind about that in the slightest &mdash; but, if we sit long hours, all the legislation must get full hearing from anybody who wants to speak on it and must get full Committee and Report Stages examination.  I would like the Leader of the House to give us an assurance, in order to secure the co-operation of this group, that we will not have any guillotines or closure motions between now and next week.  It is not the way the House should be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in regard to item No. 1, the first I knew about the item was about five minutes ago when I looked at my Order Paper.  Perhaps the Leader of the House <Col N="1932" /> could tell us why it is agreed that this should be taken without debate and with whom it was agreed.  As far as I know, it was not agreed by us.  Item No. 1 seems to me to deserve a slightly more full hearing &mdash; not a long hearing but a few minutes hearing &mdash; about the televising of the proceedings of the House.  I cannot understand why it should be taken without debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with Senator Manning in wishing the Government and everybody else the best of luck in trying to solve the Brian Keenan problem.  It now seems to be coming to an end and I hope it will have a happy ending today or tomorrow.  May I join also in the compliments to Senator Ryan who made a valuable intervention in going out there to try to get a solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party would also be very concerned at closure motions.  We have not agreed to them and certainly we will be opposing them if they are supplemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Upton in complimenting the Taoiseach, the Government, and in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, on the efforts that have been made over the past number of months to get the release of all the hostages held in the Middle East.  Kidnapping is a most horrific crime and the length of time these hostages have been held exceeds anything seen in kidnapping circles anywhere in the world.  The conditions in which they have been held have been horrific. I sincerely hope we are now coming to the end of this period in the Middle East, that the reports coming out are correct and that it will be Brian Keenan who will be released shortly.  Not only should we compliment the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but a special compliment should be paid to the family of Brian Keenan for their forebearance during this particular difficult time.  They have at all times worked extremely hard both at national and international level <Col N="1933" /> to see that Brian is released.  Their fortitude in this has been magnificient.  Like the other speakers, I would like to compliment Senator Eoin Ryan and the Andrews brothers who have worked extremely hard to see that all hostages will be released, and in particular Brian Keenan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters I would like to raise on the Order of Business with the Leader of the House. First, in view of the alarming and, in the words of a Government spokesman, &ldquo;quite exceptional&rdquo; increase in the unemployment figures, would the Leader of the House consider making time available for a short debate in relation to what is clearly a worsening situation?  If this situation continues, it will be very serious in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in view of the threatened 700 job losses at the <i>Irish Press</i> would the Leader of the House convey to the Minister for Labour the support of Members of this side and, I am sure, the support of the House for any action he might take in relation to it?  Obviously, it is at a very serious stage but other disputes have been brought back from the brink and certainly this would have the support of the Members of this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer just to one item, No. 1, and to explain why I am referring to it.  I do so, I hope, with a little delicacy.  I fully appreciate the efforts the Leader of the House is making with the Whips to ensure there is no unseemly dispute on the Order of Business.  I think in recent weeks you will agree, a Chathaoirligh, that we have attempted to abide by this in so far as possible.  The procedure we have engaged in is that our Whip lets us know in writing the Order of Business.  I studied this when I got it late yesterday afternoon and there was no mention of this item on it.  I have had no communication from my Whip about Item No. 1.  That places me in a considerable difficulty.  Perhaps it is a matter of communication between the Whip acting for the Independent group <Col N="1934" /> and myself, but I understand Senator Ross has had the same difficulty.</P>
      <P>There are two or three points that I would like to make with regard to this item.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach would consider it improper for me to make them on the Order of Business so, for that reason, reluctantly I will have to oppose the Order of Business being taken in its present form because I think there should be room for just some slight discussion of this measure, which is historic.  In the absence of notification from my Whip I regret to say to the House I will have to oppose it unless we can have some small degree of discussion, which I am sure could be limited.  As I say, I have just two or three points but I would like them to be on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your indulgence, Sir, I would like to propose that a vote of sympathy be extended to the families of the four members of the South Western Regional Fisheries Board who were tragically lost last week off the Cork coast.  This is a very unfortunate occurrence. If it were four members of the Garda or of the Army, I think there would be great furore but these men were acting in the course of their duty and were tragically lost.  I think it would be appropriate that this House would note the loss and that a vote of sympathy be proposed.  I understand an investigation is being undertaken by the Department of the Marine as to what precisely happened. There are many other things I would like to say in relation to the incident, but until such time as the investigation is complete I will let the matter rest.  However, I think the House should note the tragedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House about paragraph (iii) of item No. 1.  I do not understand what &ldquo;a clean feed of the proceedings to Members&rdquo; means.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could clarify that.  Could he also tell me how the contract was awarded to Windmill Lane Pictures Limited?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning referred to item No. 2 on the Order Paper.  My understanding is &mdash; indeed, it was suggested to me and has been confirmed by other speakers &mdash; that this legislation may well not require the length of time we have given it.  We have said we will order Second Stage and Committee Stage and see how it progresses.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also congratulated the Government on their efforts to secure the release of Brian Keenan, something which we all support totally.</P>
      <P>I have noted what the Senator said in regard to the Broadcasting Bill.  In regard to that legislation &mdash; indeed, other references were made to the guillotine and so on &mdash; it is not my wish to guillotine any measure.  I suppose when we talk about a guillotine, we talk in terms of beheading people, as it were; but in a parliamentary context what we are talking about is a means to limit debate on a Bill or a motion.  What I am saying is that we are giving ample time, from early in the morning until very late at night, to debate all the legislation we have this week and next week.  In fact, this week we have very close to 40 hours of debate and in a normal week we would have something like 11 hours.  I suggest that is sufficient time to debate much of the legislation we have.</P>
      <P>In regard to what is arguably the most important piece of legislation in the year &mdash; the Finance Bill, which has 104 sections &mdash; we devoted 15 hours and 20 minutes to it.  In regard to the Social Welfare Bill, also a vital piece of legislation with 51 sections, in this House we devoted five hours of debate to it.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo;.  I am saying we are trying to devote as much time as possible to completing the legislation we have before us and, therefore, we are sitting early and finishing late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to a timetable. I would have to say&mdash;again, as a further point to support what I am doing&mdash;that last week, for example, we did try certain things and, to say the least of it, we <Col N="1936" /> were let down and disappointed.  I have to make that point.  He again referred to the word &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo; and he asked about item No. 1, and whether it will be taken without debate.  Item No. 1, is a motion and it was referred to by Senator Norris and one or two other speakers also.  Incidentally, Senator Norris is correct when he made the point that it could not have been discussed last week by the Whips. It was agreed only last week by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that this matter would come before us.  It appeared on the Order Paper this morning and most Senators would have seen it for the first time this morning.  I am not opposed to a debate on it.  However, it was suggested by some Members outside this morning that we may have it without debate.  But what I will say is this.  If we are to have a debate on it, that might take place at the conclusion of business tonight, or if we find a free half hour during the day we can take it then, if that is what Members want.  Moving on to Senator Upton, he also raised those points and the question of the Brian Keenan affair, as indeed did Senator Michael Lanigan.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave referred to the unemployment figures and the 700 jobs at the <i>Irish Press</i>.  It is not obviously appropriate to the Order of Business, so I do not intend to refer to it.  Senator Lydon referred to item No. 1 on the Order Paper.  I think I made the point clear that it was a Committee on Procedure and Privileges decision.  It does not make a difference to me, but it has been discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and all parties have representatives on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Therefore, if Senators want a limited debate on it, I am agreeable to it during some part of the day.</P>

    <Title>National Treasury Management Agency Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I opened the Second Stage debate in the Dáil with some facts about the national debt which might bear repeating in this House.  Total employment in this country is about 1.1 million and each of these persons is on average paying out of his and her pocket almost £2,000 each year just to meet interest on the debt.  Half of that sum is going abroad.  The debt is £25 billion and represents almost £23,000 per head for each person at work here.  These figures are <Col N="1938" /> growing.  Our aim in this Bill is to do everything possible to minimise this burden.</P>
      <P>I said in my budget speech earlier this year that the Government had decided to establish, under statute, an independent office for the management of the national debt.  My statement referred to the fact that debt management has become an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity, requiring flexible management structures and suitably qualified personnel to exploit fully the potential for savings.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of the new office, to be called the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
      <P>The Bill enables the Government to delegate my statutory borrowing and debt management functions to the agency, but my responsibility as a member of the Government will be unchanged.  In other words, the Minister for Finance's powers are not being diminished in any way.  This new agency will act on my behalf as Minister for Finance and under my control.  An advisory committee is being established to advise and assist the chief executive of the agency. The chief executive will be directly responsible to me as Minister for Finance and will be the accounting officer for the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is clear from what I have said, debt service costs have become a major burden on the Exchequer.  It has become obvious as well that the executive and commercial operations of borrowing and debt management require an increasing level of specialisation and are less appropriate to a Government Department. The Department of Finance, who have been dealing with borrowing and debt management up to now, are basically a policy Department.  The function of borrowing money by the Department in the name of the Minister for Finance began with the issue of national loans in the early days of the State.  In those days it was a relatively straightforward function. Despite the huge growth in borrowing by the Exchequer, including the breaking of new ground in the international capital markets, the Department continued to <Col N="1939" /> adapt and coped very well with these increased responsibilities.  But we cannot ignore what has been happening in the past five or six years, and in particular the loss of financial expertise from the Department, about which I will say more in a moment.  Exchange controls have been all but eliminated.  Cross-Border capital flows have increased.  Deregulation has grown.  Markets have become more complex.  There has been rapid growth in new debt management instruments.  The function of borrowing money in the 1990s and of managing debt, particularly active management, is increasingly specialised.</P>
    <P>In GNP terms Ireland's national debt remains one of the highest among the OECD countries at over 120 per cent of our GNP at end 1989.  Interest payments alone come to over £2.1 billion this year or 9 per cent of GNP.  This is a huge burden and is almost equivalent to the total yield from income tax in the PAYE sector.  It is about 60 per cent greater than total Exchequer expenditure on the health services and about 60 per cent greater than total Exchequer expenditure on education.  At its most fundamental, of course, these huge debt servicing costs can be tackled only by continuing to reduce borrowing and to limit or stop the rise in our debt, but shrewd management of that debt can also yield savings and contribute to an improved budgetary position.</P>
    <P>Debt management is essentially about managing risk.  As I have said, our debt is enormous and the range of borrowing and debt management instruments used, both at home and abroad, is large, varied and complex.  Out of the total debt of £25 billion, over £9 billion is in foreign currency.  It is subject to exchange rate variation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish pound, particularly in regard to currencies outside the EMS such as the US dollar and the yen. Out of the total foreign currency debt, about 40 per cent is at a floating rate of interest and is subject to movements in international interest rates.  It is obvious, therefore, that adverse trends in exchange and interest rates can cause a <Col N="1940" /> severe rise in our debt servicing costs. Debt management must, in the first place, minimise the effects of these adverse trends by switching between the currencies in the debt portfolio and by varying the proportions at fixed and floating interest rates having regard to projected movements in interest rates generally.  In addition to those strategic risk management techniques there are several ways of covering interest rate and exchange rate risks in the short-term.</P>
    <P>All these techniques can make valuable savings as well as averting risks.  My Department have been examining the potential for savings on the national debt portfolio in consultation with a number of leading international banks and are satisfied that significant savings are available while following a risk-averse debt management strategy.  I should emphasise here that savings on the national debt are available across the board and are not confined to the foreign debt portfolio. Opportunities also exist in the domestic market and an active approach can secure savings in the switching between fixed and floating interest rates, between long and short maturities and between different forms of debt instruments.</P>
    <P>The domestic gilt and bill markets alone total almost £14 billion so that the potential savings from even small, but active, shifting of the portfolio are significant. I should also mention that non-residents now hold about £4 billion of this figure.  Adding this to the foreign currency debt, the net result is that non-residents hold over half of our total debt and we are spending each year about £1 billion in interest payments to non-residents.</P>
    <P>What is vital if we are to get the most benefit from all borrowing and liability management opportunities is to have a professional and specialised team to do the job and that they should operate in a stable working environment.  It is readily acknowledged that financial institutions are only as successful as the people working in them.  In our dealings with foreign banks we have seen many instances of key personnel leaving.  Ultimately if these people are not replaced quickly and <Col N="1941" /> effectively, the services offered by their former employers deteriorate and their profitability suffers.  There is no reason a treasury management operation should be any different.  It cannot operate effectively while constantly losing staff or knowing that its staff can be readily poached.  That is what has been happening in the finance division of the Department of Finance.  The increasingly specialised and complex nature of the work has been unfortunately matched by a constant drain of people to the private sector, attracted by better rewards and career prospects.</P>
    <P>People leave for all kinds of reasons and sometimes it can be too costly to retain them.  But it is unrealistic not to be able to make an appropriate response in terms of financial rewards or career opportunities in order to retain valuable staff.  This is especially so in what is an active seller's market for their services. Even more fundamentally, the size of the national debt, the complexities of its management and the huge burden which it places on the national economy make it a very significant part of our public finances and mark it out as a special case. The Exchequer's debt represents by far the largest portfolio in the country and it is inexcusable not to devote the best possible expertise to its management.</P>
    <P>The choice for the Government and for me as Minister for Finance is whether we can allow Ireland's national debt management operation to continue to lose experienced and qualified people and expect that somehow the Department of Finance will cope or whether the risk of letting our debt management lag behind other treasury management structures, either in Ireland or elsewhere, is too great and the consequences too costly.  We tried to recruit suitably qualified people into the Department of Finance but this was not successful.</P>
    <P>I said in the Dáil that we must be realistic about our situation, however painful that may be, and accept that we are not going to be able to get and hold the best type of people that we need in a Civil Service environment.  We have got to pay market rates for the right people <Col N="1942" /> and devise an organisational structure which they can be encouraged to join and to give of their best in the interests of us all.</P>
    <P>I have already said that our interest payments come to over £2 billion annually. Even a small percentage saving can yield a significant reduction in our budgetary expenditure.  If these savings are feasible, and it has been demonstrated that they are, then we must commit the necessary resources and the management structures to ensure that they accrue.  That is why the Government are satisfied that establishing an agency as provided for in this Bill is the right solution.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline for the House the basic structure of the agency. The Agency will operate under the general control of the Minister for Finance; the chief executive of the agency will have a direct reporting relationship to the Minister; there will be no board of directors between the Minister and the agency; instead there will be an advisory committee to whom the chief executive can refer; because the national debt is such a large and complex part of our public finances the present carefully constructed controls involving the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Exchequer system of accounts will continue; accountability will be enhanced by making the chief executive formally accountable to the Dáil through the Public Accounts Committee for the financial affairs of the agency; there will be flexibility as to pay and conditions so that key staff can be recruited and retained; in return, they will be assigned clear levels of responsibility and must perform to these levels; and the agency's staff will not be civil servants.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, I would like especially to mention the key provisions in sections 4 and 5. Section 4 states that the principal functions of the agency will be those delegated to it in section 5. Section 4 also makes it clear, as I have indicated already, that the agency will operate under the control of the Minister for Finance and subject to whatever directions and guidelines he may give.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> Section 5 enables the Government by order to delegate to the agency the borrowing and debt management functions of the Minister for Finance.  These functions of the Minister are contained in the legislative provisions identified in the First Schedule.  The principal such provisions are listed at (g) in the Schedule, viz section 54 of the Finance Act, 1970, as amended in particular by section 118 of the Finance Act, 1983.  These allow the Minister to issue debt and to engage in debt management operations.  Most of the other references to the legislative functions of the Minister for Finance refer to the operations of the Post Office Savings Bank, and small savings generally.</P>
    <P>An order made under section 5 will be annulled if either House of the Oireachtas passes a resolution annulling it within 21 sitting days of the order being laid before it.  Section 5 also sets out in some detail the subsidiary functions of the agency.  These deal with matters such as the borrowing programme to be undertaken by the agency each year, as well as the submission to, and approval by, the Minister of the annual estimate for expenditure arising out of the national debt.  Also included are various advisory and other ancillary functions to be performed by the agency.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the Bill to which I would like to draw particular attention is section 9 which deals with the establishment of the advisory committee.  The intention here is to engage the knowledge and experience on a part-time basis of senior people with a proven track record in financial services.  It might be possible that some of these would have an international background and would, if necessary, be headquartered outside Ireland. This would not only reflect the international arena in which the agency will operate but offer a useful background of experience and advice for the agency's operations.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is also worth mentioning in particular.  This provision effectively nominates the chief executive of the agency as the accounting officer for the <Col N="1944" /> management of the national debt.  This will allow the Dáil, through the Public Accounts Committee, to engage in a detailed examination of this large item of expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should also say something about section 14 dealing with the disclosure of information.  A number of Deputies in the Dáil expressed concern at first about the minimal nature of the £1,000 fine for unauthorised disclosure of information. As I said in the Dáil, however, the fine is deliberately low in order to have access to the District Court and seek summary conviction following which the perpetrator can be dismissed without delay. The alternative would be to proceed by way of indictment which would take longer.  Dismissal is not the only deterrent of course.  A non-disclosure clause will be written into the contracts of employment, a breach of which can be pursued under the civil law and, finally, the Official Secrets Act will apply under which stiff penalties are applicable.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome here this morning with what effectively is a Bill to head off the headhunters.  That is what we are talking about.  We can put nice words on it, we can discuss the many and varied problems that surround our national debt and the management of it but we are talking about how the Minister for Finance will head off the headhunters in the financial arena where our people in the Department of Finance, who are trying to manage the national debt for us all, happen to be working.</P>
      <P>Basically, I have no difficulty with the concept of the agency.  It is quite a novel one, but on reflection, perhaps it is one that could be applied to other sectors in the public service as well.  The board of ERAD immediately comes to mind.  I am sure if we look at this as a template for handling niches or specific problems in the public sector we could even extend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to head off the headhunters the Minister has to be in a position to increase the pay and generally improve the conditions of those who manage our <Col N="1945" /> £25 billion debt.  They must be put on a par with conditions and pay in the private sector.  There are increasing career opportunities in the private sector generally for the expertise that we have in the Department of Finance, particularly in the debt management sector.  One has only to look at the financial services sector and the opening up of that whole area.  With the relaxation of exchange controls I think we will automatically see a total relaxation of financial controls and that adds another layer of sophistication to the already very difficult job of debt management.  That, in itself, will bring the need for more expertise or for anchoring the expertise we have already got to be sure they are not head-hunted for the private sector.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister has been trying to attract more personnel with expertise and qualifications to the debt management sector or to the Department of Finance generally over the last year but rather unsuccessfully.  Whether those who applied were not suitable or did not have the experience he wanted or whether the salary and conditions did not attract them I am not sure but the venture I understand was unsuccessful.  If the private sector can organise their debt management, their treasury management generally, and if every other country in Europe and further afield can have the best and the brightest working on behalf of their taxpayers, there is really no reason we cannot do the same in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We could spend a long time attributing blame as to why we are talking about a debt of £25 billion.  Basically, we would all have our own views on that but the facts we are faced with are that we have a debt of £25 billion at the moment.  This continues to increase, although at a much reduced rate than heretofore.  We are looking at interest payments of £2.1 to £2.4 billion a year.  That money has to be found from the taxpayers of Ireland.  We have to borrow, we have to live within our means but, above all, we have to ensure that the spiralling debt which was out of control for so long no longer returns.  We have got to reduce even further the debt-GNP ratio from the present <Col N="1946" /> position.  I think the Minister used the figure of 120 per cent of GNP at the end of 1989.  I think it could be somewhat lower at the moment.  I think we might be looking at around 117 per cent.  That has to come down.  While we have public opinion conditioned to accepting the medicine, in a reasonable way we must ensure that we achieve our objectives in this area.</P>
    <P>I think, it was during our debate on the Finance Bill or the budget that the Minister responded rather sharply to my suggestion that it was a budget of missed opportunities, that with the support of the Tallaght Strategy and with the support of nearly all sides of the House&mdash;not all sides, I accept, but with the support of 80 per cent of both Houses &mdash; for getting our finances in order we should not let out of our grasp an opportunity to do so. Slowly but surely, public opinion is now accepting that the medicine was needed, that financial rectitude is the order of the day and has to be the order of the day. If the public generally, if vested interest groups and lobby groups get back into a position where they will all look for whatever they feel they need for their sector, we will not be able to keep the reins that were there.  The Minister has majority support from both Houses to resolve the problem.  I felt the budget was a budget of missed opportunity.  The Minister rebuked me rather sharply at the time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I await your contribution eagerly, Senator.  We have talked on several occasions in the past six months in <Col N="1947" /> this House about the economic situation generally.  I think we debated the NESC report before Christmas.  We had a long debate on the budget and we had a debate on the Finance Bill.  The Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill provided another opportunity to get into this area and here we are again this morning.  I think the facts are well known to all sides of the House.  We might have a different interpretation but that does not get away from what the Minister is about this morning which basically, is, how do we put in place the personel with the expertise and experience to manage in the international arena that they now operate in the financial services sector our £25 billion national debt.</P>
      <P>The Minister has brought this Bill to the House, a measure to head off the head-hunters as I mentioned.  The agency should be in a position to offer the best and the brightest the appropriate pay and conditions.  This should also help to attract from the private sector to the public sector the expertise we now need in this very sophisticated and complex job of managing our debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that it costs those of us at work over £2,000 per annum to service the debt alone.  That is a lot of money when you think that there are only 1.1 million people at work in our country.  We all should be concerned about how this job is done, we all should be concerned that the Minister cannot hold the expertise he now has and that he cannot attract the further expertise he feels he needs.  Despite the progress made in relation to our debt and our financial management in recent years, we still have in GNP terms one of the highest debts of all the OECD countries.  That is a salutary thought.  We can get carried away with the progress made and think the debt is not still rising or that we do not have a problem at all.  There is a view out there that the problem is now solved, that better and brighter times are here.  I hope they will be here and I hope the country is facing better and brighter times but the problem is not solved and will not be solved unless we have in place debt <Col N="1948" /> managers of the right calibre and expertise doing the job for all of us.  I suppose we could remind ourselves that they are not doing the job just for the Government, they are not doing the job for the parliamentarians, they are doing the job for the entire country.</P>
    <P>The new agency's job apparently will be to negotiate loans at home and abroad. The Minister pointed out that over £9 billion of the debt at the moment is in foreign currency.  They will have the job of balancing our debt portfolio and of managing risk generally.  I suppose the emphasis the Minister gave in the Dáil and in this House was to the management of the risk and to the expertise which can effectively manage the risk involved.  The foreign currency debt of £9 billion is subject to exchange rate variations and indeed the volatile situation that is there now.  We do not quite know the effect of a united Germany on the liquidity position generally and the demands that will be on them from other sources.  We now have to pay more attention than ever to the US dollar and to the yen and generally it is a much more sophisticated and risky business than perhaps it was in the past. The old traditional sources of money cannot be taken for granted.  We cannot assume we can always keep going back and repay a few loans and take out a few more.  We cannot be sure that we, or indeed others, will be as welcome because they have to deal with different situations than previously.</P>
    <P>Apart from the exchange rate variations in relation to the foreign currency debt, we have the international variations in interest rates.  The job of the debt managers and the new agency, and indeed the job of our debt managers at the moment and for a while, has been to balance the borrowings as between fixed and floating interest rates.  I understand there is about 60 per cent of our foreign debt at the moment at fixed interest rates and about 40 per cent in round terms at floating interest rates.  There, again, with the variation in the floating interest rate there is considerable risk and to balance the amount of loan in the different areas, between the different countries, <Col N="1949" /> demands considerable responsibility and here the pay and conditions should be commensurate.  If we have the best and the brightest they should be paid and rewarded for the job they do.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foreign borrowings and the balance that is needed generally between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates, there is also the balance needed in domestic borrowing.  If £9 billion represents our foreign borrowings of £25 billion, then I think in round figure £4 billion represents non-resident borrowings in the country.  The balance, therefore, of £12 billion is what is borrowed directly from the Irish market.  If a saving of even 1 per cent can be made by this agency it would represent a saving of over £20 million a year, a very considerable saving.  The Minister had a figure of £35 million per annum in his budget speech which he hoped this new National Treasury Management Agency would provide.  In responding, could he point out whether that figure is likely to be reached this year?  Is that £35 million an ongoing annual ball part figure or does it represent 50 per cent of this year and <i>pro rata</i> next year?  You can only tighten down so far.  When you are playing on the financial services sector, as these people will be doing, you will have good years and bad years, but I wonder how, in this computations, in terms of his budgetary figures, the Minister is arriving at a figure of £35 million per annum.  Is it a little bit loose at the moment and can that be pruned or tightened down immediately, or does he think the agency he is setting up is going to attract a particular expertise we do not have at the moment that could produce a saving of £35 million?  How did the Minister come to this particular figure?  Can we compute it each year for some years in our budgetary arithmetic or will it be a once off?  I would be pleased to hear exactly what is the status of this £35 million the Minister referred to in the budget?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated to us how the agency would be structured &mdash; a chief executive officer supported by an advisory committee.  There will be no board of directors as might have been assumed. <Col N="1950" /> By whom will the advisory committee be appointed?  Exactly what will be looked for from this advisory committee?  I read &mdash; it may have been in the Minister's Dáil speech or in some of the press commentary on this proposed agency &mdash; that some may be international advisers and may not even be located in this country. Is it correct to assume that they will all be part-time advisers, or will they be experts on an annual retainer that we will be calling on in the different areas when and if needed?  We are not looking at a physical committee located in the Department of Finance, but perhaps some of them will be present in the Department of Finance on a full-time basis.  Could the Minister elaborate on how this advisory committee will be structured and what their terms of reference will be?  That is very important because done properly, as I am sure it will, it could be of enormous benefit to the CEO and to the Department of Finance generally.</P>
    <P>Apart from a minimum salary hike of at least three times what personnel in the public sector could be expected to have at the moment there are many other carrots on offer from the private sector as the Minister knows only too well.  I read recently a rather harsh term &mdash; perhaps it is because of an association of ideas that I do not like the term &mdash; where those who had jumped ship from the public sector, to the private sector had been referred to as &ldquo;departmental defectors&rdquo;. I find that slightly harsh.  I am quite sure if I found myself in the Department of Finance and if I was lucky enough to have the ability and/or the expertise to do the job some of them are doing, I would have gone long ago.  I still find the expression &ldquo;departmental defectors&rdquo; slightly harsh. In a nutshell, it expresses the urgency of the need for the legislation we have here this morning.  Effectively that is what people have done, totally understandably. The Minister's job is highlighted by that expression and by the whole difficulty of the new expanding financial services arena of the head hunting that has been going on.  On offer to departmental defectors there are hello <Col N="1951" /> money, share options, cheap house loans, a stake in the company concerned and company cars, apart from a minimum of a three times increase in salary, and it could increase to any level after that.</P>
    <P>The private sector is quoted to be hungry for experts combining trading expertise, a knowledge of financial strategy and Government contacts.  How right that is.  I have no doubt that is exactly what the Minister is up against.  One browse through this book from the Financial Services Industry Association that arrived on my desk, and I am sure other Senators' desks, in recent weeks spells out exactly how strong the carrot must be in terms of attracting from the public sector this expertise into the private sector.  This Financial Services Industry Association &mdash; the FSIA &mdash; of which I knew little until I read this, is a regulatory advisory group which decides just about everything &mdash; it is all divided into committees under one title or another &mdash; for the development of the financial services in Ireland generally.  Apparently the association is unique in Europe in providing a single forum for the industry within which issues of common concern can be identified and resolved.  It is a very formidable body and I quote from it:</P>
    <P>The Association was established in December 1984, within the Confederation of Irish Industry, and it has a membership base of over 120 financial services companies.  These include banks, building societies, insurance companies, fund managers, venture capital companies, leasing companies, charge card companies, stockbrokers, accountancy practices, management consultants and other providers of financial services.</P>
    <P>From a quick glance through the various lists of executive committees, management and so on, it is hard to find any influential group in the financial services sector in Ireland that is not party to this. It is a very formidable body and I congratulate the CII and those who spearheaded its establishment.  The objectives are outlined and what interested me more <Col N="1952" /> than anything was on page 11, Work Programme 1989-90, under the director's report.  I will read a few miscellaneous paragraphs.  They are very pertinent to what the Minister is doing here this morning.</P>
    <P>The FSIA participates actively in the Taoiseach's International Financial Services Centre Committee (IFSCC) chaired by Mr. Padraig O'hUiginn, Secretary of the Department of An Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The FSIA report on Manpower and Training Needs was discussed by the IFSCC in July and it requested the FSIA to establish appropriate training courses.  The Committee has offered strong support in pursuit of a number of initiatives.  An MSc programme in Investment &amp; Treasury designed by the FSIA in conjunction with DCU and the Society of Investment Analysts was launched in January 1990.</P>
    <P>Hard at it.  Train the people.  Get the best and the brightest and get going.</P>
    <P>The FSIA was also involved in attempting to simplify and reduce Stamp Duty and other related costs of doing business in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>A few talented bodies from the Department of Finance who knew their way through the bureaucratic system would be a wonderful asset in this arena.</P>
    <P>The group held a number of meetings with officials from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to discuss issues and substantial progress was made in clarifying and simplifying existing procedures.</P>
    <P>Those Revenue Commissioners and members of the Department of Finance would be of extreme value to the private sector.  Anyone who would have contact with them would know exactly how to get through the massive bureaucracy and have the contacts on the inside in the public sector needed.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I am just stating facts. The report states:</P>
    <P>It is hoped that this initiative and dialogue can be maintained and <Col N="1953" /> strengthened during the coming year to deal with such issues as the taxation of financial instruments and other related taxation issues.</P>
    <P>Under a heading &ldquo;Partnership with Regulators&rdquo; it states:</P>
    <P>Another major initiative of the RAG (the Regulatory Action Group of this body) is to develop an ongoing partnership with the regulators (the Minister, his colleagues and the Department of Finance).  A number of members of the RAG met with representatives of the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce during the last year to explore ways of developing this partnership.</P>
    <P>It might be also to find out who is the best and the brightest there, who knows what they are talking about, and then snapping them up afterwards.  It continues:</P>
    <P>In addition, there have been a number of informal contacts with regulators.</P>
    <P>These are the people behind the scenes running the show for the Minister and he is running the show at the moment for all of us, being the Minister for Finance in the Government.  It continues:</P>
    <P>It is expected that this initiative will be pursued in the coming year.</P>
    <P>They would be mad if the Private Secretary did not pursue the contacts, formal or informal, with those charged with managing the debt in the Department and with the considerable financial expertise that exists in the Department. There is no way the Minister, without the type of structure he is bringing here today, could expect the considerable expertise that he has in his Department that has developed over the years and decades, to stay while he sees what is on offer from the private sector at this juncture with 1993 around the corner, with deregulation in this whole area and the urgency to collect the best brains together to run the show.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> At this point I would like to compliment, on behalf of all of us, those in the debt management sector of the Department of Finance who have been running the show in terms of managing the national debt for so long, particularly over the past few difficult years.  Mr. Michael Somers and his team deserve all our thanks and credit for a very difficult job well done.  Indeed, instead of paying £2,000 per annum for my tax bill as my contribution as one of the 1.1 million people working in the country towards the interest repayments on the national debt, it could be double or treble that if they were not doing a good job at the moment.  Those who are doing a good job should be in a position to be able to stay because the choice between staying out of loyalty to the job or improving their family situation and their general personal prospects is an invidious one and they should not have to make it.  We should pay on par with the private sector for the expertise we need, the expertise we now have and the expertise we need to attract in the future.</P>
    <P>The debt management team in the Department at the moment have done such a good job that we are now, by the rating agencies, considered AA rating rather than A rating as in the past.  I mentioned a 1 per cent saving that could be achieved which would relieve the interest bill of £20 million.  In fact, if we consider moving from A to AA rating this in itself means the difference between 0.25 per cent of the interest bill, which is another £5 million if we accept that £20 million represents 1 per cent. Immediately the change in rating saves this country that amount of money.  That rating would not come and we would not enjoy confidence abroad and at home if we had not the debt management in the hands of those who knew what they were about and who were doing a good job.  I suppose the greatest compliment to them has been the confidence in Ireland Incorporated at home and abroad as reflected by the good rating we now get from the rating agencies.</P>
    <P>There is another point I must mention, <Col N="1955" /> namely, we cannot forget how the political situation affects economic confidence in this country.  We sometimes choose to forget it generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator might when he hears what I have to say.  He cannot agree with me until I finish speaking.  I am referring to the enormous damage done to Ireland Incorporated after the IRA outrages generally in this country. Perhaps this aspect of those outrages does not hit us immediately.  The horror is across our front pages and on our TV screens, but we never really stop and analyse the financial impact this type of behaviour is having on our country, particularly the difficulty it is imposing on those trying to manage our debt because of the lack of confidence it creates in the international arena.  Therefore, to get the political situation stable, to establish the fact that lunatics do not operate on behalf of any of us, and to get them off the stage altogether, if at all possible, is critically important to a stable, economic situation in this country.  That aspect is one we do not reflect on often enough.  Yet, it is one the debt managers have to handle quietly in their offices while the rest of us rage and rant on about different outrages.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of points I would appreciate the Minister's response to, when he is winding up.  I have indicated one, to elaborate on the advisory committee, the terms of reference and exactly who, what and where it will be and how it will relate through the CEO back to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made concerns the freedom which will be given to this agency in terms of the pay and conditions.  I have little problem in paying the best and the brightest what they need to be paid, commensurate with the private sector but I would like to know exactly is it just <i>carte blanche</i>, will there be certain guidelines or how will that be structured?  Will it just be up to the Minister or will it be up to <Col N="1956" /> the agency to determine its own pay and conditions and on what basis, will the agency be in a position to increase the conditions applicable in certain cases or vary them depending on who they want to attract?  I would like the Minister to develop that point in relation to this agency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the relationship between the political issues and the policy issues of the day, the Minister is ultimately responsible as he has pointed out for the debt management and the agency will be responsible for the economic issues and economic questions involved in debt management but how will that work?  Apart from the political issue I referred to earlier on, there is the broader political scene, the policy-making and changing.  What will be the reporting procedure in terms of changes in legislation and of answerability between the policy-makers of the day through the Minister back to this agency?  Exactly how is that tied down?</P>
    <P>In the First Schedule there is reference to the functions of the Minister which may be delegated to the agency, referring back to sections of various Acts.  One would want several days, not just an hour, to really comprehend what that means.  Could the Minister give us a synopsis of exactly what that means and in layman's terms indicate what the First Schedule holds?  I find that fairly complicated and, without literally looking back through all the legislation it refers to, it would be very hard, unless one made a study of it, to grasp quickly what is involved there.  We need to know exactly what functions the Minister will delegate and under what terms he may delegate those functions.  If he wants to take some of the functions back into his own responsibility, what procedures is he allowed to use to do that?</P>
    <P>All sensible Members of both Houses are agreed that we cannot continue to mortgage our children's future.  As a former colleague of mine said once, &ldquo;to spend on today's generation what has to be repaid by tomorrow's is not stealing; it is, in fact, caring&rdquo;.  I believe the key <Col N="1957" /> people, at the moment, in terms of managing Ireland Incorporated, are those charged with our debt management. Controlling of debt and reducing the penal rate of taxation which will come with the further controlling of the debt, will get more people back to work, will increase the incentive of those already at work to work harder and will generally achieve what we all have been asking for for so long.  I have no major objections to the principle of what the Minister is trying to achieve today.  Perhaps we can ask more specific questions on Committee and Report Stages but I would appreciate, in return for the co-operation the Minister may get from this House, if he would expand on these matters in his response and answer the queries we have which may head off protracted Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill this side of the House have to have recourse to the past, in particular the fact that the national debt doubled in actual terms between 1984 and 1987 which time, ironically, coincided with a Labour-Fine Gael Government.  The Government debt stood at 83.5 per cent of GNP in 1981 but by the time the Coalition had left office it had reached 135 per cent of GNP, thereby doubling that debt in those four and a half years.</P>
      <P>With the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 we saw a tight-fisted approach in public sector spending with the result that over a three year period public spending was cut by a massive 11.5 per cent, a significant achievement.  With tax yields surging and the public spending suppressed total Government borrowing contracted sharply.  In that period public sector borrowing declined from something like 15 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 3.3 per cent of GNP last year.  One can only say that as the Government cut their annual level of borrowing they were reducing the current addition to the existing stock of debt that was before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, falling interest rates between 1986 and 1989 cut the annual cost of the interest bill on the national debt and the strength of the exchange rate of the Irish <Col N="1958" /> pound eased the cost of the country's debt also.  It is interesting to note that between 1980 and 1985 the Irish pound's effective exchange rate plunged by almost 16 per cent, while last week the pounds' exchange rate was 18.5 per cent higher than in 1985.</P>
    <P>The stabilisation and the subsequent reduction of the debt-GNP ratio must be seen as representing a policy achievement of major significance which ensured the stemming of the rising tide of debt as a necessary precondition to converting a short-term economic pick-up into a sustained economic recovery.  Thankfully, this would appear to be what is happening at the moment.  To place it in perspective, while we have rounded the corner there is obviously a long distance to travel before Ireland returns to economic solvency.  I will outline the reasons why this is the case.</P>
    <P>First, it can be seen that despite the improvements effected last year the national debt remained in excess of 120 per cent of GNP and that is half as high as the debt-GNP ratio experienced in the 1980s.  Secondly, Ireland remains deeply in debt if we compare it with other EC member states.  The debt-GNP ratio, as I understand it, averages 50 per cent, so Ireland is still more than twice the European average in terms of foreign debt.  Thirdly, the Irish economic performance remains particularly vulnerable to higher interest rates because of the scale of the indebtedness.  Directly high interest rates increase the annual cost of debt service, and this year the service debt is estimated at £2.3 billion or 10.5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>While we can be very thankful for good, sound, stable Government, it is not the time for self congratulation.  Rather it is a time when much more has to be accomplished and much more remains to be done.  The introduction of the Bill must be seen as an acknowledgement of this fact and a commitment on the Government's part to tackle that headon. The Minister has indicated that employment stands at 1.1 million persons. That means it is costing £23,000 per head for each person at work and with <Col N="1959" /> half of this sum going abroad it is absolutely essential that it is minimised.</P>
    <P>Debt management nowadays is an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity and it requires flexible management structures and also suitably qualified persons.  The Department of Finance in the past as admitted by Senator Doyle, have been doing an excellent job in negotiating loans and achieving a well-blanced debt portfolio. The total debt of £25 billion, £9 billion of which is in foreign currency, and of that 40 per cent at a floating rate of interest, can cause a severe rise in our debt servicing cost.  The Government are convinced that by following what the Minister termed a risk adverse strategy following on discussions with personnel in international banks, significant changes or savings can be made. Obviously it is correct that that should be pursued.  Similarly, the Minister has pointed out that the domestic gilt and bill markets alone total almost £14 billion so that the potential savings from active shifting of portfolios can equally be significant in the domestic market.</P>
    <P>I can also point out that the creation of semi-State bodies is not a new concept. In fact, since 1927 we have been adopting different models and we have been hiving off areas of public service administration from the concept of ministerial responsibility. Given the functions which will be transferred by this Bill the mode adopted is right and proper.  It would be inappropriate to follow the traditional State-sponsored body model in setting up an agency to deal with the national debt.  In the other House the Opposition asked if we could not accommodate this within the existing staffing structures of the Civil Service.  The Minister replied adequately to that in that some personnel in various departments are obviously very highly regarded; they have excellent specialist knowledge and in many instances that is recognised outside and is being paid for outside.  It is important, therefore, that in setting up this agency the Minister has cognisance of that, recognises the talents <Col N="1960" /> that are available and arrives at a clawback situation within the public sector itself.</P>
    <P>We must live in the real world and understand that in the financial services sector young people can now command starting salaries of £50,000 plus, and in many instances some of them are in receipt of £100,000 plus.  It is again suggested that the Minister could obtain the expertise he is seeking from inside the Civil Service by adjusting the scales within the Civil Service itself.  Everybody is now accepting that that position does not stand up to argument.  If you were to pay a salary of 50 per cent more to a principal officer at the Department of Finance it begs the questions why would a principal officer in any other Department not get a similar rise.  It would also have repercussions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the trade unions and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>. All of us who had any involvement in trade unions in the past will know of the consequences of relativity claims on the Exchequer in the seventies.</P>
    <P>Quite rightly, the Opposition have asked the question, if the Department of Finance can handle medium and long term economic planning and forecasting, why could they not manage the debt within the Department?  It must, again, be readily admitted that the debt management function is so specific nowadays that it can be readily hived off and the Minister, in appointing a chief executive officer and an advisory committee, is in fact going along the right road.  In reality the Bill creates a semi-autonomous agency, which is fully under the control of the Minister and the Minister and the Government will retain the responsibility and be answerable for the national debt and how it is to be handled.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of points raised by Senator Doyle relative to the advisory committee.  The Minister is bringing together the best experience and skills in the financial services sector to advise on how the debt should be managed. It begs the question: what is wrong with having the best brains available at home or abroad to help out in this task? <Col N="1961" /> That is something that should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Another important element is that this is an advisory group and their role is totally to advise.  The Minister has spelled out quite clearly that any remuneration paid to them will be relatively small in the overall context.  He has in place a chief executive officer who will make decisions based on the advice given by people who have a knowledge of and access to the World Bank and the European Bank.  The Minister, with the co-operation of his officials in his Department, can make suitable decisions on the advice being given to him.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Senator Doyle refer to the Finance Bill.  I had not anticipated that she would do so because some of the prognostications made by Senator Doyle in debating that particular Finance Bill related to the budget and one of them was an over-reliance on buoyancy.  She said that it raised serious questions on meeting targets this year.  I am sure, at the end of June, the Senator will have read the outturn and will be pleased that the Minister is very much on target.  She was quite concerned about the high level of interest rates and was dubious about the Minister's forecast on interest rates coming down at that time.  She must also be pleased at this stage to note that they have come down by 1 per cent.  The Minister forecast a further decrease of 1 per cent before the end of the year.  It is interesting and indeed welcome to hear the CIF mention that our inflation level could be as low as 2 per cent by the end of the year.  All of these facts indicate that the Government are on the right track and any decisions they have taken to date have proved to be correct.  I have no doubt that with this Bill they are also adopting the correct approach.  As such, I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House but I do not particularly want to welcome his Bill. I found, initially, that there was some difficulty in considering this Bill because, instinctively, I might have been in favour of setting up a body of this sort to manage <Col N="1962" /> the national debt but when I thought about it I felt the Bill was totally unnecessary.  When I read the Official Report of the Dáil and the reasons given by those on the Government side for setting this agency up, I have to say that I found them extremely unconvincing.</P>
      <P>The Bill is based two false presumptions. First, for those who are not directly involved in the financial world and financial services, in taking decisions of this sort there is some appallingly difficult intricate mystique attached to the decisions people in that world make.  The first thing I should say, having been involved in this area for many years, is that most of those people who hold highly paid jobs as dealers, who take decisions which involve millions of pounds every day, have very few qualifications for actually doing that job.  It is most extraordinary that they have some training in that area but their qualifications are virtually non-existent for taking decisions of that sort.  They are involved in a world other people do not understand and because of the size of the debt, the size of the figures and the size of the transactions, people outside feel that they have a magic wand and some magic expertise which entitles them to high salaries, to the respect of those outside and therefore, to be put on some sort of pedestal.  They have the power to move vast sums of money, that has to be recognised, but they do not necessarily have any greater expertise using that money than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to ask outselves if the job these people are doing is really that difficult, or is it something which an ordinary intelligent person could do with a minimum of training.  You only have to read a book like &ldquo;Liars Poker&rdquo;, a bestseller issued recently, which specifically mentioned Solomon Brothers, a merchant Bank, to see the vast sums being moved about by young people with virtually no experience, with three or four weeks' training, having a major effect on people's lives, on institutions, on funds and, in some cases, on the pensions of people around the country I recommend this book because it is a very good read apart from being very frightening.  Many <Col N="1963" /> of these people simply had no experience in the field in which they were operating. Many of these people were losing vast sums of money day in, day out; they were also making vast sums of money day in, day out, but the basis on which those decisions were taken are never apparent.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody on the Government side should say, with their hand on their heart and with conviction that, as the Minister said in his speech, these people have tremendous expertise and experience and it is getting harder and harder.  That is not necessarily the truth. Out there in the private sector, with which the Minister is trying to compete in this Bill, there are people operating who should not be operating in this particular field because they do not have the expertise to do it.  That is the first point I should make &mdash; we should recognise that these are not necessarily particularly skilled or able people.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make &mdash; I am sure it has been made by other speakers both here and in the Dáil but it follows from the first &mdash; is that this Bill is an explicit criticism of the civil servants in the Department of Finance.  I believe they have been performing well enough, but if the Minister and the Government thought the civil servants had been performing up to scratch, this Bill would not have been necessary.  This Bill is saying, &ldquo;these people are not good enough; they are not doing the job well enough; we need people who know what they are talking about and who are flexible enough to do the job in the Department.&rdquo;  In other words, the civil servants do not have the necessary expertise.  If we are gong to say this implicitly or explicitly, we need specifics.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to have heard from the Minister or from Government speakers in the Dáil where money could have been saved but was not or where money had been lost in the past where that should not have happened.  How many people are involved in this and what size of losses could have been prevented?  I know those sort of things are not very easy to quantify.  I know you cannot say <Col N="1964" /> if they had taken X decision, X would have happened, because that is jobbing backwards but if we have a Bill like this brought forward, we are entitled to specific areas of weakness, specific areas where losses have been made and specific areas where advantages could have been taken but were not.</P>
    <P>I started off in the financial world and dealing in Government stocks from the other side of the table, when part of the game was to second-guess what the Government broker and, therefore, the Department of Finance and Central Bank were doing.  From my limited experience I must say what whereas they did make mistakes from time to time they were very quick indeed to remedy them and it was very difficult to outsmart them in this area.  They were efficient and shrewd; they were fairly ruthless; they ran a very well-organised market at that time.  I must say, from the other side of the operation, it was difficult to criticise them in doing their job.  To those of us who were trying to invest maybe at a cheap level or at a certain speed or to do switches in Government stocks or in spotting anomalies, they were frustrating in their efficiency.  Quite honestly, I find the implicit criticism of the Department and of those who have been running this area, in particular the Government stock area which is the largest part of the Government debt, unjustified.  I find that their past record on this is extremely creditable and has served the State very well.</P>
    <P>The same principles attach now in that area as attached then and I see no reason whatever for bringing in people from the private sector to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; the performance in the national debt here.  Without doubt, those who have run the national debt, those who have made decisions on the national debt in the past, certainly over the last 20 years, have a first-class, creditable record and it is wrong that this Bill implicitly criticises them.</P>
    <P>The second way in which the Bill is flawed is the premise that somehow not <Col N="1965" /> only is there a mystique about the financial world, which there is not, but somewhere in some way there are experts in the financial world whom we can pay to make the right decisions.  That mystique should be removed and stripped and we should realise that the people involved are extremely fallible, that they do not contain any particularly great talents that many of them have had little training.  It is frightening how little training they have had having regard to the amounts of money they move around.</P>
    <P>I want to question also who these experts are and what was their performance like.  We only have to read the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> this week to see that on the stock market in Dublin six so-called experts were asked at the beginning of this year to pick their shares for this year that would out-perform the market. These were people for the best stockbroking sides, stockbroking houses, people from the major financial institutions and investment houses in Dublin. They were asked to pick their particular shares to out-perform the market.</P>
    <P>People in the stockbroking world have to make, as the Minister will well know, decisions being similar to the decisions that will be made by those involved in the National Treasury Management Agency. They have to look at interest rates, at money trends, at the basic economy at industry and how it is performing, they have to look at foreign exchange trends and all the fundamentals that people in this agency will be involved in.  Then they have to make the decision.  I am speaking from memory &mdash; it can be checked immediately &mdash; but five out of six of them under-performed the market and, in fact, they under-performed the market extremely badly.  These are exactly the sort of people that the Minister will be trying to recruit for this agency.</P>
    <P>I would bet &mdash; I may be wrong &mdash; that all six of these people are paid vast salaries to do exactly that job.  I would bet that they are all earning at least £50,000 a year and many of them are earning more. Yet they cannot even out-perform the Irish stock market.  You would forgive them if they were just line ball.  You <Col N="1966" /> would expect because of the salaries they are getting that they would out-perform the market because that is what they are paid for.  But they could not do it.  They had a dismal record.  This was a crosssection picked at the beginning of the year.  There was no smart alec backward looking by the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> saying, &ldquo;We found six people who are paid vast sums of money who cannot do it.&rdquo; They were just six people picked at random who could not out-perform the market.  We should seriously question the ability of people to have some sort of mystical expertise to out-perform the market.</P>
    <P>It is the same principle which applies in this agency which the Minister is setting up because people in this agency could be trying to out-smart international interest rate trends, international foreign exchange trends and other areas of that sort.  I am not sure that there is any particular expertise attached to this beyond some very fundamental knowledge of how you do the transactions involved, how you hedge, how you switch, how you look at interest rates.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago I saw a survey of fund managers in America who are making similar decisions.  I took a far bigger sample than the last one.  In that sample the conclusion was drawn, having looked at the transactions that the fund managers had done, at the commissions which they paid, the margins which they paid, the spreads they made in every transaction, that they would have been far better if they had done absolutely nothing, that, the costs of transactions and the fact that the pluses and minuses virtually balanced out, left them in a situation where they would have been far better if they had not moved money at all during a long period of time.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of fallacy attached to this expertise in the financial world which is attributed to them only by those who are not in it.  It is very easy and a very human failing for those of us who see people who are supposed to be expert in certain areas about which we know nothing, to say that they know an awful lot and, of course, they are very credible. <Col N="1967" /> When we get into their area &mdash; it is always happening &mdash; we find that in fact their knowledge is possibly quite great but the area itself is not particularly difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me because even this year we had a situation where all the experts in the economic field were saying that interest rates were going to rise again and the Minister was almost on his own, and it is to his credit, when he said up to recently that interest rates were going to fall.  The Minister who, with the greatest respect, is not a technical expert or so-called technical expert in this field, although he is a very good Minister for Finance, took on all the experts in that field.  He got it right and they all have egg on their faces.  It is important that the Minister should recognise that, as an amateur, he took on the experts and beat them, that if he employed people in this area they would have taken a different decision and either he would have been in conflict with them or they would have won through because they are experts and it would have cost the Exchequer an awful lot of money. That is indicative of the point I am trying to make.  The mystique should be removed.  The salaries are too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I would like to make about the Bill is that it is too vague. The Bill is giving the Minister and the Government a blank cheque to set up this agency.  It does not happen very regularly in legislation but I would much prefer if the Government could come to us and say, &ldquo;We are setting up this agency.  It will cost X.  We have no indication as to how much it will cost.  The <Col N="1968" /> chief executive will be paid so much.  The advisory body will do the following.  It will consist of so many members who will be paid so much.&rdquo;  There is nothing tangible in the Bill as to how much it will cost us or whether it will be worthwhile. It is too much to ask the House simply to say, &ldquo;Go ahead, pay them what you like, because that is what the Bill says &mdash; pay everybody what you like and give them unlimited expenses.&rdquo;  We should be told how much the chief executive will be paid, within a certain range, how much the advisory body will be paid, how big the staff will be, what they will be paid and the cost to the Exchequer.  I have no indication from the Bill as to what it will cost.  It is reasonable that we should know the size of the operation and the cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In passing, it is worth asking the Minister whether it is intended that this body will regulate the market in Government stocks.  I presume that will be one of its principal purposes, that in managing the national debt it will also regulate the issue of tranches of Government stocks when they are offered, when they are bid.  It may be that it will have specific instructions to regulate this market in a far more flexible manner than is being shown at the moment.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Exchequer, the market in Government stocks at the moment is being run on an extremely efficient basis because none of them is available.  That suits the Exchequer tremendously because it means that they do not have to issue tranches and they do not increase the national debt that way.  In the short term that suits the Exchequer because the national debt stays absolutely solid.  I assume &mdash; and it happens in most countries &mdash; that there is also an obligation on Government to conduct an orderly market in Government stocks.  That is not happening at the moment.  That has been a matter of some concern to the financial community for many months now.  I made this clear on the Adjournment some time ago.  People cannot buy Government stocks at the moment even in very small amounts.  I would suggest <Col N="1969" /> that the Minister should give the agency specific instructions to make a fair market in Government stocks but, above all, to make a market in Government stocks, to make them available even in small amounts.  Any good commercial dealer can sell Government stocks at a premium and can lay them off some place else.  If people want them badly enough he will be able to sell them at a low enough interest rate which he can cover somewhere else.  I cannot understand why the Government do not do this at the moment but I am sure it is for the very good reason that they do not want to increase the national debt.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the Minister's view on that.  I would also like to know what his view is on the relationship between the new agency and the Government stockbroker.  Will the Government stockbroker be given any spontaneous power?  Will he be allowed to make large discretionary decisions or will the new agency simply be instructing him on what to do, what Government stock to let out and what Government stock to take in, what tranches to issue day by day?  In other words, will the agency have complete control over this area and will it control it in a more orderly, more organised and more flexible way than has been the case in the last few months?</P>
    <P>What the Bill emphasises more than anything else is the real difficulty about the difference between the public and the private service competing with each other.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a classic problem which we have had to face in the past and will have to face in the future.  Here we have public service people doing what the Minister, I think, regards as private service work.  As a result, we have the public service and the private service competing.  This has presented us with many problems in the past and will in the future, not least in regard to the pay scales of those involved.  It presents other problems.</P>
    <P>We saw it last week in the Industrial Credit Bill where there is the Government owned bank competing with its hands behind its back, and has to come <Col N="1970" /> to Government every time it wants to borrow over a certain amount but has to go out to the marketplace and compete with the private sector.  So, it is working at the disadvantage of being hampered by the limitation of its involvement with Government but, on the other hand, it has the advantage of Government backing and a Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>All along it is not a level playing field &mdash; which is an expression I do not like &mdash; there is a situation which is very difficult for both sectors involved.  This Bill is a result of that difficulty.  I understand the Minister's problems with pay.  The Bill is really all about pay, all about not being able, apparently, to attract people at the right level who will take the right pay.</P>
    <P>I find it a little strange and it is difficult to work out why it is in this sector that there are particular difficulties.  It is true in other areas the Civil Service has been able to attract people of great expertise and great ability who can compete in terms of ability and talent with the private sector.  There are undoubtedly first class accountants in the Revenue Commissioners. There are undoubtedly people in that area who could command enormous salaries in top accounting offices but choose not to.  There are undoubtedly first class solicitors and barristers in the Attorney General's office who could go down to the Bar Library or go into private practice as solicitors and could command very large salaries there. That particular line presumably could be extended to every single Department of Government.</P>
    <P>They choose &mdash; let us have no doubt about it it is by choice &mdash; to take jobs in the Civil Service with lower salaries and lower expectations than to go out into the jungle.  That is a choice they have made.  I cannot believe that in the financial services sector there are not also many people who have the expertise the Minister has been talking about who do not want to stay in the Civil Service at lower salaries.  There are great attractions in the Civil Service for people of a certain age.  There are great attractions for them in having jobs which are steady, salaried, pensionable and, to a large extent safe. <Col N="1971" /> That is the single greatest benefit of being in the Civil Service and attracts a certain sort of person who may well have an expertise in the area the Minister has been talking about.</P>
    <P>The private sector attracts people who are not so interested in those benefits. The private sector, especially in the financial services area, attracts people who are interested in taking risks, who are not so worried about the tenure of their jobs.  It is extraordinary that people still go into the private sector and the financial services area when they see year after year stockbroking houses in Dublin, London and New York laying off people who one year were earning £100,000 plus and the next nothing.  That happens all the time.  The private sector attracts people who are prepared to take that chance.  I cannot believe there are not other people who have the expertise in that area who would rather not take the risk of walking into £100,000 a year job and being on the dole next year, but would rather take a lower salary doing the same sort of work and being in the Civil Service.  It seems to apply to every other Department as well.  I really do think there is nothing special about that sector.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service has had, and continues to have, the top brains in the country who rise to the top of the Civil Service.  There is not any enormous exit from the Civil Service in other Departments. I would be interested in what the Minister will have to say.  I understand he says people have left.  I know of people who have left the public service for the private sector in the financial areas and who have gone back to the public service at lower salaries.  I know people who have left and want to go back because they do not like it out there.  I would have thought that what we would like to see is an exchange of these people who eventually settle down in the area that, psychologically and mentally, suits them best.</P>
    <P>I am not very happy about the safeguards in the Bill.  If we are to have those who manage the national debt saving sums of money on our behalf and on <Col N="1972" /> behalf of the Government, they are undoubtedly in order to do that.  They will have to take risks on our behalf.  The Minister spoke very eloquently about risk-averse policies.  That is a very nice phrase but I notice that he did not say &ldquo;risk-free&rdquo; policies, &ldquo;risk-free&rdquo; decisions or &ldquo;risk-free&rdquo; strategies because there is, as he would recognise, no such thing as a risk-free strategy of this sort.  &ldquo;Risk-averse is simply saying &ldquo;as little risk as possible&rdquo; but if you are going to be taking as little risk as possible you are going to get as little gain as possible.  The risk-reward ratio is well known.  You get rewards only if you take risks in this area.</P>
    <P>I would be worried that the people who come in from the private sector, where they have been used to taking major risks in this area, because that is their job in the private sector, would also be performance-orientated and the moment you are performance-orientated &mdash; and all people in the financial services sector are performance-orientated &mdash; you are under pressure to perform better than the next man.  The only way that this can be done in this area is by taking chances and by taking risks, by switching in and out of currencies, by buying currencies when they fall in the hope that there will be a recovery and by taking chances, because you are looking for a particularly good performance at the end of the year or at the end of the quarter.  The only way you can do this is by taking a chance and the more chances you take the better chance you have got of actually making more money for the State and looking better in the eyes of your employer at the end of the day.  I do not see in the Bill any precaution to stop that.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will be taking an overall look at this agency.  However, the people who are employed in this area and who have been brought from the private sector, because they feel it is incumbent on them and because of the obviously large salaries they will receive, will have to take risks with the State's money.  That is a real danger.  The Bill should include some safety measures to prevent that. It should contain some real guidelines because it is not inconceivable, in fact it <Col N="1973" /> is likely, that if the Minister talks about a saving of £35 million the other side of that is a loss of £35 million.  It is as simple as that.  If anybody can save £35 million for the Exchequer, he is undoubtedly taking a risk of losing £35 million or much more on the other side.  I ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to set up something that is, after all, very similar to another semi-State body.  It is a body which will be sitting somewhere in the middle, in no-man's land.  It will not be independent as other institutions are, but neither will it be totally dependent.  The people employed in it will constantly be looking at their employer, which is the State, and their brief which will, to some extent, hamper their freedom of movement.  On the other hand, it will not be completely dependent so they will be subject to the sort of pressures they feel in the outside private commercial world.  It falls between two stools.  I genuinely feel that the management of the national debt would have been better left in the hands of those who are running it at the moment but that the system by which they are appointed and paid could have been improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate of the National Treasury Management Agency Bill, 1990. The Minister has made some very interesting facts available concerning the national debt.  Total employment in this country is about 1.1 million.  On average, each of these people is paying out of his or her pocket almost £2,000 each year just in order to meet the interest on the debt.  Half of that sum is going abroad and the debt is £25 billion which represents almost £23,000 per head of population at work.  These figures are growing.  The aim of the Bill is to do everything possible to minimise the burden.  Servicing the national debt is the largest item of expenditure after wages and salaries, which is the largest expenditure, and social welfare which is the second largest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In acknowledging that this is an important Bill, let me say that it was first <Col N="1974" /> mooted in 1987 when my party were in Opposition.  It has been accepted for some time that our national debt warrants special consideration.  The Exchequer is paying an enormous amount of money each year in order to service it.  I believe the figure is in the region of £2 billion per annum.  This is a great drain on Exchequer resources.  The efforts being made by Government to reduce this massive burden are to be welcomed.  A reduction in the annual service cost of the national debt and the investment of the money saved in good projects such as tourism and industry, will help in the creation of jobs.  In that way we can continue to achieve progress during the nineties.</P>
    <P>From the statistics available we are on the threshold of substantial and sustained net job creation over the next number of years.  The significant achievements in net job creation during the past two years were based on sound Government policy which was brought forward with courage. We have seen that this policy enabled the economy to grow at a steady pace, enabled various sectors in the economy to contribute and made it possible for Government to continue to work closely with the social partners who recognised that our finances were in an extremely precarious state and made an overall contribution towards putting them in order.</P>
    <P>It is accepted for the purpose of the Bill that the best expertise available should be recruited.  This will be appreciated by the general public.  In this way we can be assured that the agency will achieve substantial savings over the next four to five years.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  Since taking over his portfolio he has done a tremendous job.  Senator Ross suggested that the Minister is not a technical expert. That may be the case but certainly I would like to see a few more like the Minister, particularly with regard to this agency.  I would also like to congratulate the many officials in the Department of Finance who over the years have looked after the national debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the lunch break I referred to the tremendous work done by the officials of the Department of Finance in relation to the national debt and I availed of the opportunity to congratulate them for that work.  They would be the first to recognise and acknowledge that the time has come for an independent look at the state of our public debt.  In this regard I welcome the steps outlined in the Bill.  The professional management of the national finances is a feature of many world democracies and its success has been proved more than once.  I am satisfied that the general public have shown a very keen interest in this Bill and the benefit of the proposed agency will be seen in future years.</P>
      <P>The way in which the national debt has increased over the years has been most unfortunate for our economy.  It has crippled employment opportunities, caused widespread emigration and many job losses.  The doubling of the national debt between 1982 and 1987 was the greatest blow to our people since the foundation of the State.  I welcome the concern expressed across a wide political spectrum with regard to the national debt.</P>
      <P>The progress of the new agency will be monitored with interest.  I recommend that we should consider having the Comptroller and Auditor General as a member of the advisory committee.  I say this as a result of my long experience as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach shares my concern.  The Comptroller and Auditor General would be a tremendous asset to the agency with his in-depth knowledge of the public finances.  His position as a member of the agency would serve a twofold purpose. We have seen in the private sector where specialised financial personnel have proved cost effective and created massive savings and we should avail of that in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the intention is to engage <Col N="1976" /> the knowledge and experience, on a part-time basis, of senior people with a proven track record in financial services.  It might be possible that some of these would have an international background and would, if necessary, be headquartered outside Ireland.  So be it.  This would not only reflect the international arena in which the agency would operate, but would offer a useful background of experience and advice for the operations of the agency.  We must make it attractive for the right personnel.</P>
    <P>This agency is being set up to ensure that we can, without public service restrictions, recruit and attract people with expertise to work under the Minister for Finance, but with increased flexibility. The new agency, however, will be working under the control of the Minister and he will delegate to them power to manage the debt without diminishing any of his responsibility in this area.  The Minister has made reference to the significant relative savings that can be made and he said even 1 per cent shaved off our interest payments would yield £20 million per year in savings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the basic structures of the agency.  It will operate under the general control of the Minister for Finance and the chief executive of the agency will have a direct reporting relationship to the Minister.  As already pointed out this morning, there will be no board of directors. Instead there will be an advisory committee to whom the chief executive can refer.  As the national debt is such a large and complex part of our public finances, the present carefully constructed controls involving the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Exchequer system of accounts will continue. Accountability will be enhanced by making the chief executive formally accountable to the Dáil through the Committee of Public Accounts for the financial affairs of the agency.  There will be flexibility as to pay and conditions so that key staff can be recruited and retained. In return, they will be assigned clear levels of responsibility and must perform to these levels.  The agency staff will not be civil servants.  It is important that that <Col N="1977" /> flexibility would be seen to be there because, as we have seen in the past, some of the best brains have been recruited from the Department of Finance and we would not like to see a repetition of this.  I referred to the 1 per cent saving earlier.  There is no reason this 1 per cent saving cannot be increased over a period, eventually to reach maybe 5 per cent, which would mean a saving of £100 million per year.</P>
    <P>As many other Members of this House wish to contribute, I will conclude by again congratulating the Minister on this Bill.  I have no doubt that this agency will be a tremendous success and will be of great benefit in getting to grips with the problem of our national debt.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of the State having the best advice possible on the management of Exchequer funds and the national debt.  I am also in favour of people in the public sector who work in this area being paid the going rate.  We are now talking about establishing a new agency with nominating power under the control of the Minister for Finance and I would be quite concerned about that because it seems to be a vote of no confidence in the Department of Finance to manage the national debt.  I do not accept that.  They are as good as anyone else. That is the reason I am very concerned at the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are other factors as well.  First, there is no statement as to what this agency will cost or how many people will be employed.  In many ways what is being proposed is something of a blank cheque. We have to believe that the Minister will look after everything and do everything for the good of the country.  I have no doubt that the Minister will do his best but control is very important and we seem to be giving him something of a blank cheque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said there would be a saving of £35 million arising from the work of the agency.  If there is, it begs the question: why have we waited until now to establish such an agency?  What has been happening all the years while the national <Col N="1978" /> debt was so great?  Why have we waited until how to save £35 million?  Of course, the reality is that when the Minister says there will be a saving of £35 million a year that is speculation.  It is also possible that there will be a loss of £35 million a year.  Whether there will be savings or losses will be very much determined by a variety of factors including the expertise of the people who manage the finances but there will also be factors over which this country simply will have no control. I have great difficulty in accepting the idea that there will be a saving of £35 million just like that.  If it were as simple as that, what was the Minister for Finance doing over the past few years?  He should have made this saving.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the confidence which seems to be placed in the capacity of financial experts to deliver and I have great difficulty in believing that financial experts outside the Department of Finance have anything extra by way of expertise over those who work in the Department.  I am also somewhat sceptical of financial experts in general. Senator Ross quoted from a sample of six experts from <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, a gazette I read from time to time because I like to keep an eye on how the other half of the world operates.  It is useful to read through that paper to see how the thinking processes are going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite expensive &mdash; 85p or 90p.  Five of the experts seemed to come out on losers, if I remember Senator Ross correctly and indeed it is my own recollection of a two second read of that page.  I felt I had enough of financial expertise for that Sunday morning. If that is the case, there is a bland assumption that we will bag £35 million by setting up this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Playing the markets is a hazardous business.  The extent to which one will make savings depends on the degree of risk taken.  The trouble about risk is that you can come out the wrong side of it. What happens if we do come out the <Col N="1979" /> wrong side of the risk-taking process? Where are we then and how far down the road can we got with that risk?  How long will the risk run for; how long are we going to be in for?  This is something like the thinking processes that punters and bookies engage in.  There is a notion of risk and how long that risk will hold for. Do we go in losing for one, two, three of five years?  What is the time scale?  Will each year be taken in isolation?  Are we talking of a five or ten year period?  That is not made clear.  I have doubts in relation to this whole area.  In many ways there is a strong element of gamble in it.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the notion that outside experts working to different criteria can do better than the tried and trusted people in the Department of Finance. From time to time I have a difference of views with the Department but I would not accuse them of being reckless.  They are anything but reckless. They are extremely cautious and prudent in the way they manage their business. While in many ways we may have reservations about that from time to time, there is a lot to be said for it in terms of playing the money markets where if you get it wrong it can be absolutely disastrous.</P>
    <P>As regards advisory experts and so on, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with having people from outside advising the Government but you would have to keep an eye on whether there was a conflict of interest in relation to how they gave advice and so on.  If these people were big bankers or big players in the money market and were playing around with Government funds, to some extent they would be playing with money which was not really their own and, in many ways they might not have to answer for it as directly or as strictly as if they were dealing with an individual client.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that occurs to me is that the establishment of this agency provides the Minister for Finance with a delightful, political escape route.  If things go wrong and if the national debt management does not work in the way it should then the Minister can say the <Col N="1980" /> agency got it wrong; he can adopt the attitude of &ldquo;a touch of the mistakes here and there folks, but I am actually doing a jolly good job myself&rdquo;.  Ultimately, the Minister for Finance is responsible and if he carries the can then he may as well carry it straight up rather than at a distance through this type of agency.  I do not think it is a solution.  For those reasons the Labour Party, who have confidence in the prudent management of the national debt by the Department of Finance over the years will be opposing this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is imaginative, well thought out and a very interesting endeavour to deal with a problem which besets us not only in this country but also in many national treasuries throughout the world.  How do you deal with national debt?  For some countries this has been an horrific problem which they have not been able to cope with.  Some countries which were quite prosperous at one time used oil revenues to excess, assuming that the price of oil was going to go on moving upwards towards $90, $100, even $200 a barrel. They borrowed accordingly and now find themselves in an almost impossible position.</P>
      <P>One sees it in a very different respect in Third World countries where financial institutions, the international banks and so on lent them money and that money for one reason or another was spent in a way which turned out to be unwise, perhaps emphasising heavy industrial development as opposed to emphasising agricultural development.  In Africa, for example, the debt is one of the twin scourges of that continent, the other being AIDS.  They are both very difficult matters to deal with.  It is related to the appalling starvation there and so on.  We are very fortunate in that our national debt does not have such horrific implications. It is worth while focusing our minds on the possible implications and on the necessity of having the best possible advice and management of our national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be nice to follow Senator <Col N="1981" /> Upton's comments but it does not really relieve Governments either of responsibility for the national debt or indeed of responsibility in the sense that their policies may well impact on the debt.  It does not matter what the technical people do on the actual day-to-day or month-to-month management if Government economic and financial policies cause an increase in the national debt.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual for us to have some body associated with the Government. Again, in the case of petroleum we had a relatively recent example where we deliberately recruited people who are specialists in that area to advise the Department of Energy.  They play a very good role and some of them were people from outside this country.  Equally well and on a much more long established basis we have a body such as the Geological Survey, which is separate from the ordinary Government Departments and yet which has recruited many distinguished and able people and plays a key role in advising the appropriate Departments on a number of matters.  It is not a totally new idea but it is an essential one in another practical respect, that is in the down-to-earth mundane business of recruiting and retaining the appropriate people.</P>
    <P>Our Department of Finance have a very distinguished record with some of the most brilliant brains in this country being associated with that Department. Indeed, a former Member of the Seanad, Dr. Ken Whitaker, wrote one of the postwar papers which people know affected this country greatly and affected international finance in a very beneficial manner.  That was his booklet on &ldquo;Financing by Credit Creation&rdquo;.  We have a record of ability in the Department of Finance which is second to none but in a sense this has brought about a problem in that the recognised ability and brilliance of so many members of the Department of Finance has naturally meant that outside financial institutions &mdash; there has been an exponential growth in financial services over the past few <Col N="1982" /> years &mdash; had an obvious field of recruitment. It is high time we organised ourselves so that these people can continue to work for the Government and give them the advice they need on this essential matter.  The Government would be negligent if they did not tackle this problem and I do not see any very feasible way of tackling it other than the method which has been adopted.</P>
    <P>This Bill is imaginative, innovative and, quite frankly, necessary.  The Minister mentioned the size of our debt, £25 billion or thereabouts, 120 per cent if you take it up in GNP terms.  He also mentioned that £9 billion of this or 36 per cent is in foreign currencies and that is by no means the whole story.  This, in turn, relates to interest payments which, though horrific at £2.1 billion, represent very good work on the part of those who were involved in keeping them down to £2.1 billion on a total debt of £25 billion.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came to office we have made enormous strides in relation to the management of the debt. We have restored confidence in the country and we have restored financial confidence but, as the Minister has said on more than one occasion, we have really only made a beginning.  It is important that we do not begin to relax because we happen to have made very good initial progress.  There is a long way to go and a national debt of £25 billion is a very large debt indeed.  A lot of work still needs to be done in financial and fiscal matters generally in relation to Government policy over the next few years before we are out of the wood as opposed to simply making the first very critical, very difficult but very essential steps.</P>
    <P>Risk management has been mentioned. This is a very technical subject in itself.  It is not a simple matter.  We need people who are experienced in that field and who are able to give the appropriate advice.</P>
    <P>There has been a revolution in financial services over the past few years starting with the Euro bond market.  It is an enormous market in itself.  Since then many of our financial and banking colleagues, unless they have kept very much up to <Col N="1983" /> date, would find it very difficult to relate to some of the changes which have taken place.  In the course of these changes some extraordinary things have happened. We have seen a financial grouping come together in the UK and become one of the largest financial institutions in that country or, indeed, in the world and then suddenly collapse.  Dealing in financial services is a very serious and difficult matter as is dealing in risk management.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of things like hedging in ordinary business.  If you are hedging against a currency that you expect is going to fall, you immediately take a position on it and hedge against it. On the other hand, if you believe that the currency is going to rise you may take somewhat different measures or even hold for quite some time.  This may seem a very simple matter but predicting foreign currency variations is enormously difficult.  Some £9 billion of our debt is in foreign currencies.  We tend, perhaps, to think in terms of the German Mark something like 50 per cent of our national debt is in non-EMS currencies and you can have enormous changes very rapidly. What might seem like a relatively modest depreciation of our currency could lead perhaps to an increase of £0.5 billion or £1 billion in our foreign debt and this has happened in the past.  Take one simple elementary level of foreign currency dealers in banks &mdash; the chaps who are at the end of the phone.  It is one of the most difficult, demanding jobs in such an institution.  The people involved are usually very young and they are often paid very high salaries but they usually burn out within about 18 months or two years of doing the job.  There are a lot of aspects to this which are not simple by any means.</P>
    <P>The idea of an advisory committee is very interesting and imaginative.  The chief executive may refer to that advisory committee, he does not have to.  Presumably he has to refer to the Minister. It is essential that there be a very close working relationship between the head of this agency, the Secretary of the Department of Finance and the Minister <Col N="1984" /> for Finance because if there is not we will not get all the benefits that might otherwise accrue from setting up this agency.  For example, in relation to the balance of foreign and domestic borrowing, the type of debt instruments and so on, presumably this agency will decide on the type of debt instrument but will it consult on such matters as the relative balance of domestic and foreign borrowing and whether we are to encourage non-resident borrowers?  If we look at domestic as opposed to foreign borrowing, domestic borrowing has the difficulty that it tends to raise our interest rates.  You do not have that problem in the same way with foreign borrowing. On the other hand, if we increase our proportion of foreign borrowing that will impact on our exchange rate.  Is the sort of balance that is intended something the agency will determine absolutely in its own right or will there be consultation with the Department of Finance and the Minister?</P>
    <P>Foreign borrowing has the effect of injecting spending power into our economy. It can have an enormous effect on the economy whereas with domestic borrowing it is merely a question of transferring resources within our own domestic economy.  To what extent will the agency take responsibility for this? Will it be the absolute responsibility of the agency to determine these balances or is it going to be done in consultation? If so, who takes the final decision? Exchange rate risks &mdash; again what is going to be the balance there?  Is there going to be consultation in relation to the proportion between EMS currencies and non-EMS currencies?  Is there going to be a question of the agency or its chief executive taking an absolute decision on that matter?  I cannot believe that it is because they are strategic policy matters as opposed to the actual tactical management of the debt and hedging and so on.</P>
    <P>We have the rather unusual, if not totally unusual, position of perhaps about £4 billion of our foreign debt being now held by non-residents of this country. <Col N="1985" /> This is a fairly substantial sum of money and in many ways it is a great vote of confidence in our economy and in our political system, but it also could have a very rapid and very considerable effect on liquidity as such non-resident owners of funds in many circumstances tend to move them and move them at relatively short notice.  In this respect we are perhaps rather fortunate in that a very considerable proportion of our non-resident debt holders are, as I understand it, German nationals who have a tradition &mdash; fortunately for us &mdash; of tending not to rapidly change but having once taken up a given currency, unless there is a strong reason or a given debt, to hold on and maintain that debt.</P>
    <P>In a sense there has been a knockon effect here and I am very concerned about the lack of liquidity within our Dublin domestic market.  Is this new national agency going to look at this matter and decide it, or is it going to be a Government decision?  What interaction is there going to be between the Department of Finance and the Government generally?  There are a lot of matters here which are of absolutely crucial importance.  I am astonished that we have so few speakers on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat and listened to a good deal of this debate.  I was not here for all of the Minister's speech, the reason being that I took it away to read with some care.  It was out of no disrespect for the Minister who is a man for whom I have a very healthy and lively respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was here to hear some of the speakers however earlier in the day, including my colleague, Senator Shane Ross, whose speech I found quite revelatory &mdash; very clear, very interesting and accessible to me, a layman.  The first point he made was about the mystique that surrounds these particular kinds of financial expertise. He was quite correct to say that that mystique can be penetrated by the average citizen, given a chance.  I have to say &mdash; with, I hope, due modesty &mdash; that I consider myself here representing the average citizen reading the Minister's script and looking at what I see as some <Col N="1986" /> accessible points that interest and concern me.</P>
    <P>I must say that it does concern me, not that I am suspicious of the Minister himself at all, but in the light, for example, of the Broadcasting Bill, which in its original form seemed to me to be nothing other than an attempt to perpetrate a fraud on the Irish people and to transfer large sums from the taxpayer to particular persons.  I must say that I approached this Bill with a degree of scepticism, scepticism both in principle and in particular.</P>
    <P>It seems quite clear to me, from having read the Minister's speech and from having listened to contributions around the floor, which certainly contributed to my education, that at least part of what the Minister is engaging on is a form of rather high class gambling.  He makes this really clear when he talks about risk.  He says: &ldquo;But shrewd management of that debt can also yield savings and contribute to an improved budgetary position.  Debt management is essentially about managing risk&rdquo;.  It may be that the management of risk is necessary, and I understand a little about currency fluctuations as they have an impact upon our national debt.</P>
    <P>I quite recognise that movements in currency outside this jurisdiction can artificially swell what we already owe.  It is for that reason that I assume the Minister will be unable to answer the question posed to him earlier this morning, before I left the Chamber, by Senator Doyle when she asked for a figure.  She quoted £25 million or £35 million and was looking to see if this figure was likely to remain stable or if it was a particular percentage or proportion.  I do not believe that the Minister can give that kind of information, because, as I understand it, interventions by this particular kind of agency can only crop up, opportunities only present themselves, at specific times and the fluctuations in currency can be either small or very considerable.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is possible to predict with any level of accuracy, particularly in the prevailing economic circumstances in Europe and throughout the world in the <Col N="1987" /> money markets, with any degree of precision what this profit is likely to be.  On the other hand, it is true what Senator Ross had to say about what may be a profit of £35 million.  I found it very interesting that he spoke about his own profession of stockbroking and indicated that on the record of one of the Sunday newspapers it was clear that some of these people with international financial expertise came a bit of a cropper where they were not able to outguess the market in any satisfactory form, so that there is a possibility that we could be confronted with a debt of the same proportion as a result of their operations, in other words, it is a gamble.</P>
    <P>Could I put another little refinement or development on this argument, because when we are employing these people we are employing them apparently at highly commercial rates.  Even supposing that they have the capacity to break even, which was not demonstrated by financial experts, according to the Sunday newspaper quoted by Senator Ross, the taxpayer actually loses as a result.  Apart from anything else, we are paying by this time well above the odds, I presume, for these gentlemen, or gentlepersons, because perhaps some of them will be women.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that the Minister appears on my cursory reading of the Bill to be inviting us to write him a blank cheque.  There is not, in fact, any ceiling placed on the remuneration for these people.  In fact, there is very little indication as to who they may be.  One would like to think that they would not be friends of the Government, and perhaps they will not be, but if the Minister has people in mind, perhaps he would be kind enough to let us know.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the kind of background that he is prepared to provide for these gentlepersons, because he says:</P>
    <P>We have got to pay market rates for the right people and devise an organisational structure which they can be <Col N="1988" /> encouraged to join and to give of their best in the interests of us all.</P>
    <P>In its way that is an admirable sentiment. I know a little about fund raising and I have rolled my eye around the international market on more than one occasion.  People have been recommended to me, I have spoken with them and I have subsequently followed their careers.  I was rather glad that I had not, in fact, engaged their services because my experience would have been of their frailty and their fallability as I followed their record, even though they had very considerable recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues his description of these people &mdash; as I say, it is in some ways vague and in other ways worrying &mdash; by saying: &ldquo;The intention here is to engage the knowledge and experience on a part-time basis of senior people with a proven track record in financial services&rdquo; it might be possible that some of these would have an international background and would, if necessary, be headquartered outside Ireland.  Again, I am speaking purely as a layman and I am sure the Minister and his advisers may be capable of producing a logical, rational explanation, and something that would satisfy a doubting Thomas like myself, but I am a bit worried that we are going outside the range of expertise that we already possess in the Department of Finance. We are looking for people who have this capacity to gamble, which appears to be very difficult to assess, to quantify and to determine, and we are prepared to look outside the country for it, indeed to people with headquarters outside the country.  I wonder is this wise.</P>
    <P>I had better not name people, but I would be very concerned indeed about that, partly on the basis of principle and partly because the whole thing concerns me as a result of its impact on the Civil Service.  I do not actually think it is intended as a slight on the Civil Service. I have to say that because that was said this morning.  I do not believe the Minister had any intention or desire to cast any slur on the Civil Service, but I have to ask what is the impact going to be on <Col N="1989" /> those who remain in the service of the Department of Finance?</P>
    <P>I had some dealings with them, partly as a result of the intervention of a previous Minister, Mr. Ray MacSharry, and partly as a result of the intervention of Deputy Albert Reynolds, the present Minister.  I found them, in fact, bewilderingly expert.  They floored me on my first meeting in the most courteous possible way.  Then, when I persisted and drew out a line of argument with the assistance of some people from outside the immediate world of politics who had financial expertise, they were both courteous and prepared to accept the argument. I came away with a high regard for the people I encountered in the Department of Finance.  I wonder what the state of their morale is going to be if the Minister feels it necessary to go outside for this particular form of expertise.  I feel they must be undercut in their confidence if they are paid substantially less than people who are brought in from outside.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask if the Minister could explain to me if there is something special about the Civil Service in the area of the Department of Finance that requires this particular drawing in of fresh blood from the free market economy.  I am not quite sure what that is, except for the extremely worrying size of the national debt &mdash; for which, I may say, a plague on both sides of this House. Fianna Fáil tried to plant it firmly on the Fine Gael people but it seems to me that they were equally disastrous in managing the finances of the country.  I think there is very little indeed to choose between the two aspects of our Government.  I have a number of concerns as a layman.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask also &mdash; and it may be that there is a regulation for this &mdash; if the Minister, and under what circumstances, has the power to dismiss or to fire or to suspend the members of this new debt management committee.  Of course I accept that there is a genuine concern, worry and anxiety on the part of the Government.  We have all seen these figures before but there is no point in &mdash; if it is not an unparliamentary word to use &mdash; bellyaching about them.  We are <Col N="1990" /> stuck with them but, as a PAYE taxpayer myself, it does not give me any joy to read from any Government &mdash; and I accept that there is a kind of common responsibility &mdash; that all the money that is painfully extracted from the PAYE section goes to service the national debt. In other words, we do not even have the satisfaction of feeling that these penal rates of taxation do any good in terms of reducing the debt.  That is a very frustrating psychological condition for people in this country to be in.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have a number of real concerns because of the general framework, because of the general philosophy of the Bill, because of the element of gambling that is involved in it very clearly, because of the unpredictability of the success&mdash; and I wish it success.  It will clearly pass into legislation, there is nothing I can do about it, I can just raise a few little layman's queries over it, but I wish it success.</P>
    <P>I think, however, there is an element of risk in it and I think the Minister is surrendering very considerable powers to these people.  I note his comment that &ldquo;Section 5 enables the Government by order to delegate to the agency the borrowing and debt management functions of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  Those are probably among the two most significant powers the Minister for Finance has; and these it is proposed to delegate, at least in part, to persons who may be friends of the Government, as we have seen in the Broadcasting Bill.  I have no knowledge of this, by the way, so I am not attempting to spread scandal.  The track record of the Government is not good.  It is not good at all and I am a bit worried about that.  They may even be people like dubious financiers who are also involved in international arms dealing.  One reads about them constantly in the American and international press.  It appears that these persons would be regarded as fit. Apparently they are not even required to be Irish citizens, or are they?  Perhaps the Minister could give me some light on this. Are they required to be Irish citizens because they are clearly not required to be domiciled in Ireland?  They can be <Col N="1991" /> offshore.  Again, as a layman, the phrase &ldquo;offshore&rdquo; raises a few questions in my mind about the appropriateness of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>I have one or two further questions.  In fact, it may boil down to just one, if I can read what I have been scrawling on the Minister's script, and that is where he says &mdash; and Senator Conroy referred to this in a way I found very interesting and pointed out some of the dangers &mdash;&ldquo;Total employment in this country is about 1.1 million and each of these persons is on average paying out of his or her pocket almost £2,000 each year just to meet interest on the debt.  Half of that sum is going abroad&rdquo;.  Senator Conroy dealt very expertly and very interestingly with the half that goes abroad.  I am interested in the half that stays here because I think that is also an interesting area.</P>
    <P>I did plead my ignorance when I started off.  I am sure a lot of this is in Government stock and so on; perhaps all of it.  I wonder have the Government borrowed, have they taken loans from any of the Irish commercial banks?  I do not know that.  Perhaps they have or perhaps it is not possible for them to do that.  Perhaps the Irish banks have considerable holdings in Government stock out of which they may be in a position to make a profit. I would like to say that when this agency comes into being, as, even despite my slight demurs, it undoubtedly will, perhaps the Minister would ask these gentlepersons from all over the world or offshore or wherever they are from to have a look at the capacity of the banks to repay some of what they owe the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>For example, we hear about level playing fields and all that kind of thing, but we have a situation where the banks in this country give continually dwindling services to their clients while the rates consistently climb in interest terms.  They then engage in the commercial market, in investing in things like the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, and when as a result of bad commercial decisions they get their fingers burned, they reach into <Col N="1992" /> our pockets to bail them out.  So, if the banks are investors in Ireland Incorporated, which is now apparently to be managed as an offshore entity, perhaps the directors of Ireland Inc. could be advised by our new financial gurus as to how we can abstract a little bit of the money that some of the great banking institutions in my opinion, morally if not legally, owe to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister and also welcome the introduction of this Bill.  Perhaps my first reaction was that, first, it was a pity that we are in this mess regarding our national debt and, secondly, that it would seem the only practical thing to do is to go outside Civil Service structure to deal with this enormous problem.  I have spoken many times in this House about the fact that in the long term the only solution to our problem, particularly regarding day-to-day borrowing, is to ensure that the money that we spent on day to day expenditure is raised from day to day taxation, etc.  However, it is a fact of life that we now have a debt of £25,000 million and that no matter what progress we make in bringing this debt down &mdash; and when we think of the reality that this had grown to £25 billion by 1987 it is obvious that very significant work has been done in stabilising this debt over the last few years &mdash; it is a reality that it is going to be here for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>Where there is a debt there is a servicing cost.  At the moment this cost is in excess of £2 billion per annum.  It is quite obvious that for every minor saving that can be made &mdash; for example, a saving of 1 per cent. &mdash; you are talking in the region of £25 million saved per annum.  With that kind of money a lot of good could be done and a lot of services could be provided to those people who need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I accept, an innovation to hive off such a central part of the management of finance to an agency of this type. However, I cannot see, when one stands back from what is being done and looks at it clinically and coolly, any significant difference in principle between what is being proposed in setting up this agency <Col N="1993" /> and, for example, Governments hiring barristers, etc., to defend or prosecute cases in court.  The principle is the same: you make available to yourself at the best cost you can the most cost efficient system for handling the problem on behalf of the people.  In this case I feel that the ends will definitely justify the means.</P>
    <P>If by setting up an agency and attracting into it people of ability, people who have skills in this particular field, we can make significant savings in the debt servicing cost of our national debt, I think we would be selfish to say that this should not be done.  The reality of the world we live in, the reality of the free market economy we live in, is that if you want to have that type of person working for you, you would have to have them in an agency whose terms of reference will be more flexible than the normal Civil Service terms of reference and whose remuneration would be greater than that normally available under Civil Service regulations.</P>
    <P>However, I think it is also fair to point out that there is a <i>quid pro quo</i> involved here too regarding staff in as much as one of the other provisions being made, for example, is for the hiring of part-time staff, the hiring of people on a part-time basis, that people would not be permanent, that people could be hired on contract, etc.  Therefore, in the event of them not performing, in the event of them not effecting the type of savings being sought by the Minister, they would not have the normal security of tenure that would be available to civil servants.</P>
    <P>Here I think we have to strike a very nice balance between control and giving people the freedom to get on with the job of saving money.  I have always believed that you will not get an effective operation unless you give a reasonable amount of freedom to people to get on with the job and make decisions. Whereas I accept that the Minister is ultimately responsible, I think there is not a person in this House who does not recognise the reality that most decisions on a day to day basis are made by people at various stages down the line.  By formalising that in the creation of an agency whose annual estimates must be <Col N="1994" /> presented to the Minister beforehand and who are answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts, is just giving a reasonable time span for people to perform.  I think it would be very important that it would be made clear to those people who would be employed by this agency that their tenure would be totally dependent on the effectiveness with which they carried out their remit, that peformance would be demanded of them and would be the only way that they could justify the salaries that would be paid to them.</P>
    <P>I would hope that by bringing in this Bill considerable savings can be made, that at last not only will we stabilise the national debt but that also we will begin to reduce it, because in the long run it is only when we get to the stage of reducing this debt will we be able to do all the things we would like.</P>
    <P>I have had a great concern all my working life for the disadvantaged and the under-privileged.  To me personally high wages do not hold any attraction, but I am a realist and I do realise that to hire the type of people needed for this particular job the type of salaries that would have to be paid would be in excess of those available.  I would feel that we would be reneging on a responsibility to the disadvantaged if we did not make the savings that are possible under this agency.  I would look forward to the debt coming down and to more money being available in the long term to provide services to the disadvantaged, to provide the houses we need, to improve social welfare and to provide more job opportunities for the young people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this agency could in time be expanded to provide on a consultancy basis debt management to our semi-State bodies.  It is a fact that outside of the Exchequer borrowing there is a considerable amount of debt accumulated across the semi-State bodies.  It would seem that if such an agency is successful in handling the national debt, as it is called, it might also be made available to provide services and advice to the semi-State bodies in such a way that they too would be able to improve their debt management services and reduce the amount <Col N="1995" /> of money, a lot of which is leaving this country annually, which we now spend on debt servicing.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think the very necessity of this Bill should serve a sharp reminder to us that the money we borrowed now has to be repaid and that the debt accumulation that occurred in the seventies and eighties is going to be paid for in the nineties and in the decades of the new century.  We must never again yield to the temptation to borrow on current account. In saying that I repeat what I said: I make a very clear distinction between borrowing for necessary infrastructural development that is going to be there in the future and borrowing on current account.  I look forward to the day when our main debt structure would be on the capital side and that we would be able to account for and point to developments that were carried out and that are providing new services, new infrastructure, new development from borrowings that would be made in the future and that we would never again raid what I call the kiddies' piggybank to pay ourselves and to provide services for ourselves out of what our children will have to pay for in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope this agency is successful in saving the type of money the Minister has outlined and that we will continue to see a vast improvement in the debt situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have very strong reservations about the consituation, the necessity and the validity of this legislation.  In the Title the Bill refers specifically only to borrowings and to management.  There is no reference whatsoever to a reduction of the national debt.  The Minister in his introductory speech says:</P>
      <P>Debt management must in the first place minimise the effects of these adverse trends by switching between the currencies and the debt portfolio and by varying the proportions at fixed and floating interests rates,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can imagine our agency staff, our <Col N="1996" /> advisory committee and our chief executive as high rollers gambling with the various bills and securities and pushing paper between different portfolios as the market seems to move one way or another.  This is a limited vision of dealing with out debt and certainly it is something that the Minister can distance himself from and say the agency is dealing with the matter, that everything is in hand.  It is the nation's money that is being dealt with, or not being dealt with by the Department of Finance but put into the hands of an agency which will, under these terms, be allowed apparently very wide latitude.</P>
    <P>The national debt like so many other matters originated in Britain.  When the country got its independence we took on a proportion of the national debt in 1921-22. That, I believe, was traded away in the context of the Boundary Commission in 1925.  The real problem came in the last two decades where borrowing for current expenditure took off at an unprecedented rate.  That was when the major problem came into being.  I refer specifically to the 1977-81 Fianna Fáil Government where the cost of servicing the national debt mushroomed and more than doubled from £400 million to £1 billion.  That was the greatest single unprecedented expansion in the context of the national debt and borrowing for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech on the budget last January indicated that he was going to set up such an agency, that that agency would be in operation by mid-1990 and that that agency would result in a saving of £35 million in that year.  He gave no explanation how that money was to be saved.  Was it a once off saving? What savings were going to be made in the context of our national debt at the time that would justify that figure?  Did he pull that figure out of the air?  Is it a different figure now seeing that more than six months of 1990 have gone by and the agency is not in existence yet?  The agency will itself be a burden on the Exchequer.  Will it lead to another cost on our national debt, thus increasing it?</P>
    <P>This legislation is peppered with <Col N="1997" /> expenses, remuneration, benefits in kind and so on.  This is a major part of this legislation.  It is a guise whereby extra funding can be put into the hands of certain people to do a certain job.  So, in itself, it will be a cost on the Exchequer. We have not got any clear indication of where those savings are supposed to come from; The figure of £35 million is very small in the context of a debt of £25 billion.  What exactly will be the cost of this highly paid chief executive officer, the staff and advisory committee of this agency?  Is this a once off target?  Does the Minister expect to save £35 million in the second half of this year?  Does that mean that he expects to save £70 million next year, or is it geometrical progression or a declining figure?  Could the Minister indicate what the targets are and how they are to be achieved?</P>
    <P>The national debt itself which the agency will manage seems to be a very mixed bag of State liabilities totalling in all some £35 million.  The Minister in his speech gives us quite a chilling account of the extent of the national debt.  He says the total each year to each individual employee is £2,000 just to meet the interest on the debt.  Half of that sum is going abroad.  The debt is £25 billion and represents almost £23,000 per head for each person at work.  The figure is growing. That is a colossal figure.</P>
    <P>He also said that in gross national product terms Ireland's debt remains one of the highest among the OECD countries over 120 per cent of our GNP.  Interest payments alone come to over £2.1 million this year or 9 per cent of our gross national product.  It is an incredible figure that we are facing.  It includes &mdash; and we do not know precisely what the breakdown is &mdash; diverse sums in saving certificates and prize bonds, Government stock, Exchequer bills, land bonds and foreign loans.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Central Bank Quarterly Report that a total of £4 billion of this debt is quoted as miscellaneous or due to other sums.  What is a miscellaneous figure in the context of £4 billion of the national debt, almost a <Col N="1998" /> quarter?  Could we have some clarification from the Minister of what that miscellaneous figure actually means in practice?</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a need for more information on the composition of the debt. How was it accumulated?  In what form is it at the present time?  We need a breakdown of how this came about and what are the various forms it is in at the present time.  We need a more coherent statutory scheme for addressing the debt. That is part of the major problem of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Schedule I of the Bill lists the functions of the agency.  These functions are in a wide rag bag of legislation.  They cover such diverse areas as regulating deposits by the Post Office, the Savings Banks and Trustee Savings Banks, Saving Certificates, Prize Bonds and securities.  If the agency, is to have any meaning, it should be in a position to examine the existing legislative framework for public finance and debt and to recommend amendments and reforms to the legislation. Otherwise we will end up with an <i>ad hoc</i> piece of legislation, an <i>ad hoc</i> agency operating in a confused fashion. In the explantory memorandum there is no information given on the areas to which it applies.  It simply refers to sections this and that of the finance legislation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill in relation to debt policy, should the debt be dealt with, should it be located on the domestic scene or should it be dealt with through foreign sources?  Should it be dealt with in the EC countries or should it be further afield?  From the Minister's speech we see that out of the total debt of £25 billion over £9 billion is in foreign currencies, that the domestic gilt and bill markets alone total almost £14 billion and the non-residents now hold about £4 billion of this figure.  As Senator Conroy quite rightly point out, we can never be sure in a situation like that what is the liquidity position.  That money may be withdrawn at any time.</P>
    <P>The other major problem is the currency exchange.  What has been the policy of the Department in relation to <Col N="1999" /> borrowing and what should be the policy in the future?  We are talking about currency in various forms.  We are talking about domestic currency and non-domestic curencies and the proportion of each.  Have we not got a policy on that? Will the agency have a policy?  Should it be reducing this high level of borrowing in non-domestic currencies?  The agency itself will be powerless to affect the size of the debt and that is a major problem. It is concerned with debt management and not debt reduction.  That gives the impression that the situation is being dealt with and that the Government have solved the problem but, of course, the problem remains with us, the national debt is still growing and there is no prospect of it reducing.  We are not dealing with a solution here, we are dealing with an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to a problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more than anything else there are problems in relation to the public sector and the public service.  If we set up an agency here then the Bill as a result will most likely have the effect of transferring people out of the Department of Finance who, as the Minister has said, could be poached and go to areas of the private sector or to a separate State agency, which will operate totally different pay and conditions of employment. The implications of that are enormous, where we have just one agency set up specifically to enable large salaries, very good conditions, superannuation, expenses and so on to be given to people in the Department of Finance so that it is giving money in another guise.  What will be the implications for the morale of the public service generally when we have one agency which has created a structure where people who would formerly have been civil servants can now be employed through the agency for its purposes and salaries given which would not compare with the normal rates in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>In 1985 John Boland produced a White Paper called <i>Serving the Country Better</i> in which he recommended the setting up of quasi-autonomous units in the various Departments to achieve more effective <Col N="2000" /> decision-making.  If that had been properly carried out across the board, this might be regarded as creative reorganisation or at least could contribute to a creative reorganisation of the public service, but the problem is that if it is only a once-off thing all it will do is to demoralise the Civil Service, which sector will compare itself adversely with other sectors of the public service.  John Boland's White Paper was scrapped, and indeed the Department of the Public Service has been subsumed into the Department of Finance and there seems to be no movement by the Government in relation to the implementation of any policies for reform in the public service.</P>
    <P>I see this once-off agency, which is going to have a considerable degree of independence, particularly in the recruitment of people it regards as experts &mdash; and there is a great mystique about expertise in relation to finance &mdash; leading to a situation where other sectors of the public service and of the Civil Service will be adversely affected.  It could lead to a severe degree of demoralisation.  This is not the proper way to go about this.</P>
    <P>What we have here is something of a quango which is presented as a way of dealing with the problem, and indeed of providing a solution to that problem which, of course, it cannot do.  It is something I believe is not necessary.  Expertise can be acquired on a different basis.  It can be contracted.  Under this agency it can be contracted on a part-time basis. Many of the functions of the Department of Finance will be duplicated.  It will introduce an element of gambling in the operation of the management of the national debt and that will not be properly monitored in the context of the Department of Finance.  I do not think that is the way to do proper business.</P>
    <P>The implications in relation to the public service have not been very well thought out.  I would certainly like to see the situation arising where there could be a full-scale debate on the operation of this particular agency in a short space of time.  The Labour Party will not be supporting the National Treasury Management Agency Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to this discussion is in the Minister's speech when he talks about the better rewards and career prospects in the private sector that are available to the quality personnel of the Department of Finance.  In reality, what we are looking at here is the privatisation of the Civil Service, or at least an attempt towards the privatisation of the Civil Service. It is a contradiction in terms but then the whole operation in a sense is a contradiction in terms.</P>
      <P>The arguments put forward by the Minister, whatever the underlying truth, are certainly not based in the real world. We cannot have a free market outside and a non-free market inside.  If we talk about the argument for the free market, let us also apply it to those operating in the public and semi-State sector.  That is the real difficulty we are having here.  We are having to deal one more time with the inherent contradiction that when the people who are working for the State are doing too well we simply move the action away from them.  We do it in RTE; we do it in Aer Lingus, we do it anywhere you care to mention.  What we are really doing here is we are compensating for the exodus of brain power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at any of the pension funds.  Look at any of the managed funds.  Look at any of the unit trust loan agencies and you will find out who is managing the most successful agencies.  If you ask where they got their training they will say they got it in the Department of Finance at the taxpayers' expense, and when they were good enough they were sold to the private sector.  Headhunting by the private sector has dropped us into a mess where the Minister is now able to say that the level of sophisticated specialisation required for the management of the national debt is no longer available in the Civil Service. If it is not where has it gone?  Many of the people who were in the Civil Service are doing the job now in the private sector.  Why?  The reality is we have not paid them enough to hold on to them. The reality is that with the false non-market based restrictions on the ability of those people in the Civil Service to do this job they have been persuaded, motivated <Col N="2002" /> or bought out of it.  That is the reality.  In this legislation we are now going to look at the people who have been headhunted out of the service by the private sector and we will bring them back as consultants.</P>
    <P>It is a well-worn path at this stage and we are now beginning to institutionalise it.  I have no difficulty with putting together the best brains in the country, internationally or otherwise, to manage the national debt.  I think it makes a lot of sense but what does not make sense to me is having to institutionalise it outside the Department of Finance.  The Minister said that debt management has become an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity, requiring flexible management structures and suitably qualified personnel to exploit fully the potential savings.  This is what we need and to say that we no longer have this capacity within the Civil Service says an awful lot and is an indictment of the personnel in the Department of Finance.  However, I intend to come back to that later.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the emphasis on inside or outside Ireland.  To me non-resident means offshore and I certainly need to have it explained to me why we need to make this distinction between inside or outside Ireland.  A number of fundamental issues have been raised and one which I certainly want to put to the Minister and I would like to have explained in some detail is &mdash; and this is my understanding &mdash; that under the Ministers and Secretaries Act the accounting officer for the Department of Finance is the Secretary of that Department. I do not understand how the function of accounting officer which as of now rests not with the Minister for Finance but with the Secretary of the Department of Finance can now be shifted and diverted to the chief executive of this new agency.  I do not understand how that can be done without changing some very basic structures in the State as they stand at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know what the precise relationship is between the chief executive of the new agency and the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  In <Col N="2003" /> dealing with those two people I would also like to have some indication of the salary levels not for any narrow reason &mdash; I do not object to people being paid top dollar for the job they are doing, in fact I always approve of that as the Minister knows well but I want to know the relationship between the salaries and the status of both those people for the very simple reason that, according to the Bill, if that person who is reporting directly to the Minister is paid a higher level of salary than the Secretary of the Department of Finance, then that says it all.  That, in effect, means that not just a section of the Department of Finance but indeed the total Department including the Secretary has been bypassed, passed out, with a structure put in above the Secretary's head.  I want to know the relationship between the Secretary of the Department of Finance and this new body we are setting up.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister well understands that to try and convince me that the specialisation required to operate this body is far too sophisticated and not appropriate, to use the Minister's own word, to a Government Department is an outrageous comment and it does not fit in with anything this Minister has ever said before in this area.  I know that the views he has expressed in dealing with any aspect of financial services have made it clear that the Department of Finance has to be as bright, sophisticated, able, ready, responsible and flexible as any of the groups in the financial services.</P>
    <P>Are we now saying that we are going to have a Department of Finance where, for instance, we will not have the expertise to deal with the extravagant and sophisticated movements of, let us say, an international commodities market?  Are we going to have the sophistication within the Department of Finance to deal with the movements, bargains, buys and sophisticated and complex arrangements of a futures market?  Are we going to say that in the Department of Finance no longer will there be people who can follow the movement of capital to various banks and <Col N="2004" /> countries, because that is precisely what we are saying here.</P>
    <P>If we have not got the expertise in the Department of Finance to deal with the management of the national debt how are we going to have it to deal with other things and to ride shotgun, as it were, on the other operations of the financial services?  This is how we have been caught out time after time down through the years.  It seems to me that the Department of Finance need the most sophisticated expertise in order to be ahead of the posse and ahead of the thinking in all these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have made some reference in the course of his contribution to the extraordinarily good results achieved by his Department over the last decade.  I do not care whether this is taken in real terms or in percentage terms, they have both been left out of his speech.  The movement in a most difficult time internationally and internally has been nothing short of extraordinary. Somebody worked it out and either in percentage terms or in real terms the improvement, whether in relation to GNP or any other marker, in the national debt has been extraordinary.  I do not care whether we give credit for that to the Government of the days we are talking about, but it is with the &ldquo;permament Government&rdquo; at the end of the day that the responsibility of the nuts and bolts will lie.  I think it is important to place on the record as well that their record in this area has been second to none over the past decade.</P>
    <P>I find it a bit much to be faced with the argument one more time that the total PAYE bill goes to service the national debt.  We have slightly changed that argument to almost all the PAYE taken is used to service the national debt.  The reason for that is that we do not have an equitable tax system, and we know that very well.  It has to do with spreading the tax burden, taking it in in other places and getting a more equitable payment from those people with wealth.</P>
    <P>I would also like to have thrown into the equation the movement of money in and out of the country and how much <Col N="2005" /> repatriation of profits might yield were we to have a serious look at taxation. Nobody knows how much money is repatriated out of this country year by year, but I can say £2 million, and no one will contradict me because it is much higher than that, which seems extraordinary at this stage.</P>
    <P>I believe what we are really looking at here is the public <i>v</i>. the private sector. Who is going to do this?  Who is going to manage this?  In his speech the Minister referred to discussions with international banks.  I would be more than surprised if there were not also discussions with some well known agencies in this country.  I think whatever happens, there will be a watching brief that these posts will not be handed out to people who are very close to Government.  I will say no more than that except that it has been put to me very strongly in other places that this might well be the case.</P>
    <P>I worry when we try to do down the public service.  I do not care how we go about doing it, but we have seen it in many different forms over the last number of years and it does not become the marketplace attitude of this Government. In 1987 when the former Government came into office they seemed to be of the opinion that you could use the marketplace philosophy, but, of course, that was something we allowed as long as the public or semi-State area was not able to compete.  As soon as it is, the Government either take it from them or sell it off.  Their record in that area is abominable.  We have seen what happened with RTE radio; if the Government thought they were making too much money they stopped them.  We saw it in Aer Lingus last year when, after they put all the money into sorting out routes, the Government took three routes from them.  We have seen it in the ESB when they are not allowed to pay their rates.</P>

      <P>We are now reaching a stage in the relationship between the public and private sectors which worries me.  I believe that whether it be public or private it should be able to exist in the marketplace.  It worries me that all the better parts of the semi-State, or now of the State or of the Civil Service, the expertise and the successful areas are being hived off.  That does two things: first, by passing legislation not to allow the semi-State sector to compete and second by taking away from State industry those aspects which are successful, we succeed in giving a bad name to semi-State and State industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very interested in, and wish I had more time to tease out and discuss those sections of the Minister's speech where he refers to two issues, the foreign exchange rate and the floating interest rate and the fact that roughly £9 billion is subject to foreign exchange rate and 40 per cent of it is at floating interest rate. It is extraordinary that the Minister can come in and, with a straight face, put this argument to me because the same Minister, two months ago, in this House, on national radio and television and in the Press was saying, &ldquo;What do the private sector know about the interest rate?  All they have told us about the interest rate is wrong&rdquo;.  These are the people who suddenly are going to manage the national debt, the people who told us, for instance, six weeks ago that interest rates were going to go up by approximately 2 per cent because of the unification of Germany.  At the time that the people who are going to run the national debt were saying that, the people in the Department of Finance have been proved to be correct.  Would the Minister give his money to those people who were 2 percentage points wrong six weeks ago? What would that do to the national debt &mdash; £20 billion at 2 per cent?  It does not <Col N="2007" /> take a genius to work it out.  We are £1 million down before we start.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the thinking behind this.  This is the private sector.  Six months ago they did not know where the game was at on the international scene. There were only the Minister, myself and the Department of Finance holding the line and telling them how little they knew. I could go further.  In the intervening period the value of sterling has gone through the roof, and now the Irish pound is valued at nine-tenths of sterling. They are the same commentators who six months ago were telling us that the Irish pound would be trading at parity with sterling by the middle of 1990 and would continue to do so.  The Minister will remember them.  They were on television and making the headlines.  Not only that but there were others telling us how it would affect our competitiveness. These are the people, who were one-tenth out in one case, who are to manage the national debt.  I would not give them a bank to run, never mind the national debt.  Hindsight is an exact science.  They have never been right.</P>
    <P>The major discussion at present about the UK is in connection with the EMS.  I would go on the record as saying that if the UK are allowed into the EMS in the next six months we will experience real suffering.  I have said this consistently. The reason was never the unification of Germany but that woman across the water has bolstered up sterling to an extraordinary artificial rate beyond its value and if they get into the EMS at those values we will all suffer.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister not grab the nettle and tie us in with the Deutsche Mark, and quick?  I hope to hear the Minister's response.  What will that do to the 40 per cent of the floating interest rate and to the foreign exchange rate movement of the £9 billion?  Why do we not do what Belgium did?  Belgium has tied itself into the Deutsche Mark.  More worrying, what about Kohl's two-stage approach to the single European currency? I am worried about that because when I read his speeches there is a first <Col N="2008" /> stage and a second stage, there is a group of nations mentioned for the first stage and a second group mentioned for the second stage but, guess what?  There is no mention of us anywhere.  We should get our oar in.  The two stage approach to the single currency is leaving us behind also.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do a great deal more to stabilise the national debt if in regard to the international money exchange he were to take the chance, follow his nose and forget about the high fliers who are burned out at 30.  He should tie us into the Deutsche Mark, do what Belgium is doing and save us a packet of money at no cost and no risk.  I will run with the Germans on this one.</P>
    <P>The people who are now going to run the national debt are those who gave us Black Monday.  They set it up, they computerised it, it could not go wrong. The same people will be taking the same risks.  I would prefer the approach we have had over the last decade.</P>
    <P>I thought I would have had time to discuss where the national debt came from but that might be too political at this stage.  We are now giving over the management of the national debt, the £2,000 per worker per year etc., to people who gave us Black Monday, who called the trading rate of the punt wrong six months ago, who called German unification wrong two months ago and who will continue to get wrong the impact of the EMS, of the single European currency and of European movement of trading.  They have consistently done so. We have seen all the high fliers came down to earth wherever they happened to be.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with this legislation, not because I have any objection to having the best people doing the job, or because I object to paying the best people for doing the job or because I have any inhibitions about the best possible and most productive involvement in financial services, but simply because the people we are going to ask to do this job have proven themselves to be inept time after time after time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed to the debate.  Senator Costello and Senator O'Toole do not seem to understand what we are about here because I have no intention of calling in the people who called it wrong for the last six months to do a job.  What I want to do, and what I want everybody to understand, is to hold on to the people and the expertise I have, something I have not been able to do for the last number of years because every time anybody was trained as Senator O'Toole rightly says, they ended up in stockbrokers' and financial management houses around the city.  That is exactly what was happening.  Everybody recognised the problem but I did not hear anybody here offer a solution anymore than I heard anybody in the Dáil offering one.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello said we should look after it within the Civil Service.  He and Senator O'Toole are good trade unionists and know as well as everybody else the relativities that exist within the system &mdash; the whole foundation of the EO system &mdash; but, if those people are now pointing in a new direction, saying let us forget about relativities, let us scrap all the linkages that exist within the system, let us have performance-related pay and build a new system, then I am here to listen.  I would be only too delighted if these people would say that, but I do not hear anybody say that.  I hope that was what Senator O'Toole and Senator Costello were saying.  Otherwise, the House knows as well as I do that relativities and linkages exist and if somebody gets 5 per cent for this, somebody else has to get another 5 per cent; it is a merry-go-round and it never stops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special pay increases, linkages and the foundations are there all the time.  The first attempt I made at that, starting at the top, was to delegate on a three year rolling basis the budgets of various Government Departments to let Ministers and Secretaries of Departments manage.  The first stage of introducing performance-related pay will be introduced at assistant secretary level and, <Col N="2010" /> hopefully, if it is successful there, we will find our way to getting it down further into the system because I believe in it.  I believe the public service should have it as much as the private sector should have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go through the points raised by the various Senators, but a general comment was called for in relation to the last few speakers I heard.</P>
      <P>Senator Avril Doyle asked if the £35 million saving will be reached this year. I can tell her that the answer is, yes.  The figure is based on advice I received from leading foreign banks, not the people to whom Senator O'Toole seemed to refer or seemed to say were around town, very close to Government, who are called in to give advice and to get well paid for giving that advice.  This advice did not come from that sector at all: it came from international bankers who specialise in this area and who have a small subsidiary in this town, but the people who did it for me were from outside the country. Therefore, the Senator should not have any worries in that regard.  The £35 million saving will be achieved this year. With regard to savings for future years and targets to be set, they will be agreed with me, taking the advice of the new advisory committee that I will set up in conjunction with the chief executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say at this stage that members <Col N="2011" /> of the advisory committee will have honorary positions and will be drawn from the best available people, ensuring that there will be no conflict of interests in so far as that is humanly possible to detect.  There are good Irish people abroad and at home in this area and it is such people that I would hope to bring from the international sector into the advisory committee.  They will be paid no more than an honorary, small figure such as is paid in, say, semi-State bodies or something like that and, of course, it will be a part-time body.  It will advice the chief executive who will make the decisions at the end of the day and the advice will also be available to me.  They will advise me also on what they consider to be the proper remuneration for the new chief executive.</P>
    <P>I pursued all possible avenues to try to resolve the problem within the system before embarking on this legislation. First, we advertised publicly in the press for people to join the system or, indeed, to come in on a contract basis and we failed to get any worth-while response. The people who responded were not suitable. I got many applications at a lower level, at graduate level, for training purposes, but at middle to senior management level I drew a blank; there was nothing available in that regard.  Then I headhunted as the private sector do and again drew a blank.  It is precisely for that reason that we ended up with the legislation before the House, every other avenue having been tried.</P>
    <P>Senator Avril Doyle asked about guidelines for pay for the agency staff. The staff and recruitment of same will be a matter for the chief executive but the budget for the agency will be set by me and the agency will have to operate within that budget.  The Senator also asked about the reporting procedure between the Minister and the chief executive as did Senator O'Toole.  The chief executive will be reporting directly to me as Minister for Finance and not to the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  I will lay down the directions and guidelines for him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> Senator Doyle also asked about the large number of Acts mentioned in the First Schedule.  The Acts referred to in the Schedule can be dealt with on Committee Stage if the House wishes but the key functions are at (g) of the Schedule. The remaining references are, in the main, relevant to statutory authority for post office saving certificates and other small saving instruments.  A summary of the legislation is available if the Senators want it, but basically we are talking in the First Schedule of section 19, for instance, of the 1930 Act which provides for the appropriation by the Minister for Finance for general Exchequer purposes of whole or part of excess interest accruing to the Post Office Savings Bank.  This is the basic statutory function we go back to.  Section 30(2) of the 1940 Act grants to the Minister for Finance power to make rules in relation to the issue of saving certificates.  There is a long list of Acts from where the authority of the Minister for Finance derives.</P>
    <P>What is happening here is that the Government are devolving the authority of the Minister for Finance to this agency to borrow money and to manage the national debt, and that is the procedure that is used.  It is a similar procedure to delegation of a Minister's functions to a Minister of State as exists at the moment. It is not the same as setting up a semi-State body in which case the board of directors would stand between the Minister and the company.  That is not the case here because the Minister for Finance has, at all times, to carry the responsibility and, indeed, the agency, at all times, has to be responsible to the Dáil, the Oireachtas, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts of the House.  That is the way it will work and those are the procedures that will be followed.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross criticised the lack of qualifications among dealers.  I want to thank him for his generous words in regard to my ability to make better forecasts than the people outside who are paid large salaries.  However, I shall not go up the blind alley as to who has qualifications and who has not.  There are people out <Col N="2013" /> there with qualifications; there are people with no qualifications.  There are people who would say that the people with no qualifications are more successful than the people who have, but I am not going up that blind alley either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would need a heart transplant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about heart transplants here now.  We are talking about keeping the nation afloat, not a particular individual.  It is not just dealers we are talking about; we are talking about market analysts, economists and other people, some of whom have proved they have good financial judgment.  Some people might feel that others have not been as successful as they but that is not what is at stake here.  This is not intended and never was intended to be a criticism of people in the Department of Finance.  In case anybody has any ideas about it, I want to place on record that this Bill is in no way a criticism of the people in the debt management section of the Department.  It is well known &mdash; Senator O'Toole referred to it &mdash; that people have been poached out of that section of the Department of Finance the minute they were trained and had acquired expertise.  That is precisely what we are trying to put into reverse.  It is a recognition of the realities of the marketplace.</P>
      <P>We probably have the largest portfolio in the country to manage.  We are entitled to have the best people, to hold on to the best people and to pay the market-related rates so that we can keep the good team we have and add to it as we go along.  It may well be that some people will come in from outside or some people in the existing section may decide that they want to stay within the Civil Service for their own reasons, and they are entitled to do that.  They are also entitled to go if they wish.  I do not want to see the situation deteriorate further than I have had to contend with over the past while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all look at under-performers. We can all look at performers outside. For every six under-performers any of us <Col N="2014" /> could point to six performers who have reputations for financial expertise.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was concerned that they might get unlimited expenses.  This will not be the case.  The budget will be set by me and they will have to operate within those limits.  In relation to the question raised by Senator Ross as to what the position will be with the new agency <i>vis-à-vis</i> creating an orderly market for Government stocks, the answer is yes, the agency will indeed be giving instructions to the Government broker.  Again, I recognise, as Senator Ross said, that there are people who have been looking after this part of debt management in the Department who are doing an excellent job and it was good and efficient from the Government's point of view.  We judge them as we see them.  However, they will be responsible for, and will be giving instructions to, the Government broker in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is true that if you want to make large savings you must take large risks, but the people we are talking about in this section have done an excellent job over the years, have shown that the strategy they have adopted is a risk-averse strategy and there will be plenty of safeguards and guidelines laid down in the policy guidelines given to the agency to protect against huge losses.  I believe in a strong risk management section and I also believe that it will have to be part and parcel of the new agency.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton spoke about the controls in this area.  I repeat that the agency's affairs are under the control of the Committee of Public Accounts of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the agency will work within those well controlled Exchequer accounting systems. Senator Upton also asked about risks involved.  Again I emphasise that there are risks at present and any debt, particularly one as large and varied as the one we have, is open to large risks.  In the new situation, hopefully, we will have more expertise to manage the risk, but the guidelines will be laid down.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy asked about strategic matters of policy, for example, a mix of <Col N="2015" /> foreign and domestic borrowing, fixed and floating interest rates and so on.  I want to assure Senator Conroy and the House that there will be close interaction between the agency, its advisory committee and the Minister for Finance.  Of course, I have my people available to me in the Department of Finance.  I do not want people to get confused about this. The people in the debt management section may or may not decide to join the agency.  I have a policy-making committee, the budget team, for instance, available to me for advice and that will continue to be the position.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked if the Oireachtas is writing a blank cheque.  The straight answer is no.  The Minister of the day will decide the budget for the agency; the financial affairs of the agency will be subject to audit; and the chief executive officer is responsible directly to the Minister for Finance.  Senator Norris also asked why go outside the country for advice in the international markets; Senator O'Toole seemed to think I was going offshore.  There are many good people in very senior positions in financial services and financial markets around the world available who may or may not, but who certainly will be asked by me if they would be prepared to give of their time to advise in this situation.  I remember in 1982 finding an excellent Irish native at the top of his profession in the oil business and I appointed him a director of the National Petroleum Corporation.  The same idea will apply here.  There are good people of Irish descent available in the European Investment Bank, in the World Bank and various other institutions around the world, who might be available to take on an honorary post like this, and be delighted to do it for the country.  That is the kind of people who take on jobs in semi-State bodies as directors.  The same situation, more or less, applies here.</P>

      <Col N="2016" /> Senator Norris asked in what circumstances would the Minister fire members of the Committee: if, for example, a member became involved in a conflict of interest and refused to resign; they do not have to be Irish citizens. The sole criterion would be their proven abilities.  What is wrong with that at the end of the day?</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points raised; the reasons for the Bill; the reasons we have brought it to this Stage. It is in everyone's interests that we get to work on it as soon as possible because it is all about savings and savings are devoted to reduction of income tax, which is a priority of this Government and a priority of taxpayers who feel they are paying too much.  It is about managing affairs in a more efficient manner and applying the savings that we hope will come from this operation.</P>

      <P>On sections 4 and 5 &mdash; and this is tied in with the First Schedule &mdash; in his speech the Minister referred to the list of functions which my be delegated to the agency.  It is not particularly good practice in a Bill like this simply to give 15 or 16 different functions under the side heading of the sections.  It would have been very helpful if the Minister had provided in ordinary layman's language the exact scale of the functions which would be delegated to the agency.  At this stage there is not very much that can be done but it would be very helpful in future, or even at this stage, if we could <Col N="2017" /> be told by the Minister now what these particular functions are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Finance Acts are basically getting authority to do this, that and the other, as I am sure Senator Manning will appreciate.  I will circulate them to him.  What we are doing here is delegating the functions of borrowing money on behalf of the State and managing the debt on behalf of the State.  That is the central function.  The agency must report directly to the Minister for Finance and not to the Department of Finance or not the secretary of the Department of Finance, to ensure that the constitutional functions of the Minister for Finance are kept intact.  The model that was devised for it is the Minister for State.  Basically, it is to devolve down the functions of borrowing money on behalf of the State, issuing loans on behalf of the State and managing the national debt on behalf of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister very much for his replies.  It is becoming rarer and rarer that on Second Stage we get a detailed reply to the questions we ask in this House.  I would like to thank the Minister for taking the trouble to go through the points we raised and tackling them one by one.  Nobody expects us to agree with everything he did but at least he took the trouble to tackle the points raised.</P>
      <P>On section 4, I am not sure whether it is a permanent part of legislation or if it is just creeping in and being incorporated in all legislation of this sort and into the functions of other bodies, that consultants are shoved in anywhere to give an agency of this sort powers to send for people they want when they are inadequate to deal with it themselves.  I would be happier if the agency's powers were limited in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people are being employed at very large salaries to do what the Minister tells us &mdash; personally I disagree with him &mdash; are highly specialised jobs.  That is why they are being paid so much.  I cannot understand in what circumstances it would be necessary for them, on top of <Col N="2018" /> that to call in consultants.  It seems that they are specialised in their own fields already.  Maybe the Minister could give us an example or an illustration of where they would need to call in consultants on top of that?  I would have thought that they would be people who are experts in foreign exchange and other forms of debt management, Government stock, Exchequer bills and all the different areas.  It is giving them too wide powers to say on top of that they can bring in consultants any time they like on any issue they like.  It is complete freedom of movement without limitations.  Could the Minister tell us in what circumstances he thinks this could be necessary and, maybe, that their powers to do so could be limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Starting out, the creation of a proper management structure &mdash; and the people we talk about sometimes are not the best at this &mdash; to operate in such a situation is important. The Senator can be assured that the Minister sets the budget and will not let them run wild and bring in consultants for this, that and the other.  He directs the policy and sets the limits on the budget.  That safeguard is there and will remain there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Various other areas, perhaps risk management systems.  I do not think the people who would be inside there are the people who should devise what the risk management systems should be, for instance.  If you are setting the target, you are setting a performance <Col N="2019" /> policy for them.  They should not devise the internal system to which they would have to work towards.  Another example may be the insurance limits they keep within and certain limits are risks.  We are not into the high risk, the high roller business.  We are intent on running a business that can get us the maximum savings at the minimum risk.  There are areas where it can be done but the Minister will set the overall expenses of running the agency.  They will not be able to call them in every day or else they will be doing with less staff.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply to the matters I raised.  There was one on which I did not hear the reply and it refers particularly to the section, that is the delegation of powers to the agency.  I have not got the Ministers and Secretaries Act in front of me and I must confess I did not read it today.  I am quite clear about the constitutional delegation of power from Ministers to functionaries within the Department.  I use the word <Col N="2020" />&ldquo;functionaries&rdquo; in its correct sense there and not in any demeaning sense.</P>
      <P>It seems that the Act specifies the Minister has certain duties.  I was also under the impression by virtue of that legislation or some other that the Secretary of the Department of Finance was the accounting officer for that Department.  In this legislation, as the Minister outlined to us in his earlier presentation, the chief executive becomes the accounting officer.  I see a clear conflict in those two roles.  We now have two accounting officers in the Department of Finance. The Minister said that he was the accounting officer.</P>

The Secretary of the Department is the accounting officer for the Department of Finance.  I specifically asked three times about the relationship between the chief executive and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, because we now have two accounting officers for the same Vote.</P>

      <P>No.  The Secretary of the Department of Finance is the accounting officer for the Department of Finance Vote.  There was no accounting officer up to now on central fund services. It was not included in the Vote.  It was separate from the Vote.  To make this agency accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, I had to appoint a chief executive as the accounting officer to account to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The relationship is as follows.  The chief executive officer of the agency reports direct to the Minister, not to the Secretary of the Department of Finance and the Secretary of the Department of Finance has no involvement in accountability of the agency to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Committee of Public <Col N="2021" /> Accounts or the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>I am quite clear on that aspect of it.  The second aspect I am still not clear on is whether the Minister has the authority to delegate that power outside the Department of Finance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to a few points in relation to the constitutional delegation of this authority.  The exercise of the powers being given here to the agency is an exercise of the executive powers of the State.  The executive powers of the State are exercisable only by, or on the authority of the Government. We had a debate in the Dáil about this.  Article 6 and Article 28 are the two Articles that govern the constitutional aspects of it.  The effect of this Bill is that the agency can only exercise its powers and functions if the Government make an order delegating those functions to it. The Bill also provides for the revocation of such order in whole or in part by the Government.  The delegated functions of the agency will be exercised subject to the control and general superintendence of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance will retain, concurrently with the agency, his powers and functions in relation to the management of the national debt.  A provision similar to those which I have already mentioned applies to the Ministers for State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the functions and powers of the agency will be exercised on the authority of the Government subject to the control and general superintendence of the Minister for Finance, that is the basis for making it totally and absolutely within the requirements of the Constitution under the Articles I have talked about <Col N="2024" /> with the best constitutional advice in the country plus, of course, the Attorney General's advice available to the Government in taking this step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the legal advice I got.  They are Irish citizens under the Constitution.  The Senator need have no worries about that.  With regard to the question of the members of the advisory committee, as I have said here in the Senator's absence, there are institutions like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank where Irish people have reached the top of the ladder, or very close to it, in their own particular fields as financial advisers in the financial world and possibly such people could be called on if they were agreeable to serve in a part-time advisory capacity, with a small honorarium, and very similar to that of a semi State body.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what size does he expect the agency to be?  We talk about the employment, the chief executive, the salaries.  Everything in the Bill is very flexible and that may or may not be a particularly good thing. <Col N="2025" /> I suspect it is not, but it gives a certain scope to those involved.  We do not seem to have got out of this Bill, from the Minister or anybody else how many people will be employed or even some sort of broad figure of what it will cost the Exchequer in administration expenses?  I would like to have a better idea of how many people there will be on the administrative and technical staff and in the so-called expert area, and what it will cost.</P>

If you look elsewhere where this kind of operation is being done, say Sweden, for instance, they employ in the region of 135 or 140 in this particular operation.  At the moment, I would say probably the best judgement would be somewhere between 50 and 100.  You have to take in computer people and back-up services.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 12 to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to the chief executive being a member of the advisory committee.  The reason for this is the chief executive, from all indications, will be a very highly paid individual.  Part of the reason for setting up the body in the first place is because it is so difficult to get the necessary expert people and since the chief executive will be the number one person in the agency obviously he will be exceedingly well paid.  Secondly, he will be responsible to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advisory committee have a function obviously to give advice in relation to the operation of the agency and how best to manage the affairs in the context of the national debt.  The chief executive then will, of course, be a link between the Minister, the agency and the advisory committee.  It would seem necessary that the chief executive sit in on all of the meetings of the advisory committee and from that point of view it would be appropriate that he would be a member. It seems unreasonable to have it otherwise or else we would be establishing two bodies that would operate and meet separately.  Of course, the chief executive is the man who is directly responsible and makes the direct contact with the <Col N="2027" /> Minister.  If the advisory agency is to advise the committee and the Minister it seems absolutely essential that this amendment be accepted and that the chief executive be appointed as one of the members of the advisory committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Minister of the day to decide who shall and who shall not be a member of the advisory committee.  You will meet two schools of thought out in the real world about this.  Some people would say that the chief executive should not be a member of a board, other people would say he should be.  It is a question of which view you take.  The reason for the insertion of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is to leave open the possibility that he will be a member of the executive committee but that it should not be binding on the Minister of the day.  I am sure he or she will be a member of the advisory committee but I would envisage at all times that that person would be in attendance at the meetings, just as the chief executive is in attendance at a board meeting to answer questions or to get involved in discussions. I do not see any problem with it.  The reason I put it that way was to ensure that the position was left open for the Minister of the day to make his or her decision in relation to membership or not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) old age,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment attempts to achieve something basic and can only improve the Bill.  Effectively, what is at issue here is that &ldquo;old age&rdquo; be included with physical infirmity, physical injury and mental infirmity.  It could be argued that that is already implicit in the Bill and I see no reason it should not be made explicit.  We see this improving the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  In section 1 (1) of the Bill a &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; means a person who requires assistance with the activities of daily living such as dressing, eating and so on by reason of (a) physical infirmity or a physical injury, defect or disease or (b) mental infirmity, and &ldquo;dependency&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly. On a literal interpretation, therefore, of section 1 (1) the definition of &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; covers only two categories in my view, those suffering from physical infirmity or those suffering a mental infirmity.  We would welcome, therefore, a definition which deals with the type of person who does not suffer from either physical or mental infirmity. We must link this amendment with section 7 which deals with subventions.  As we know, these are strictly linked to the definition of a dependent person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I support this amendment proposed by Senator Joe O'Reilly because we believe it should cover a category of elderly people who are not in any way disabled or suffering from physical or mental disability but who might be outside the scope of this Bill.  We are <Col N="2029" /> trying to copperfasten the situation in proposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment submitted by Senators O'Reilly and Kennedy. A &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; as defined in that section is a very rigid, inflexible and insensitive description and does not involve or extend its scope to accommodate as many people as I would like. While I support this amendment in relation to &ldquo;old age&rdquo; I do not think we have gone far enough.</P>
      <P>There is no human face to this section. We are talking about a dependent person.  Is a &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; depending on his own means, on the means or support of his relatives, in an isolated area, on the support of his neighbours, on the support of a community service that is not there or on the services supposed to be provided by the health boards?  I come from a rural area and I know people who are not old, people in their middle fifties who live in poor accomodation in isolated areas.  Despite numerous efforts to be assisted in making their house more liveable under the health board system, by force of circumstances they have to look for admittance to a geriatric institution if there is a bed available in one.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I emphasised many of the flaws in this Bill.  I stressed that, because of the serious cutback in financial resources thousands of beds for our older citizens were withdrawn and this created a crisis for this dependent person.  As another Senator has indicated &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; will be the social core of section 7, which is the most important section in this Bill because we will be dealing with people who are not in a position to support themselves.  For that reason I fully support this amendment. While it has not gone far enough I want to re-emphasise that there are many old people in the community who need to be recognised as &ldquo;dependent persons&rdquo; and who are not getting recognition in this Bill.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose this amendment, while I agree with the sentiments and the very good intentions which are obviously behind it.  Senators have referred to circumstances which should be looked at.  My basic objection is that old age is not a disease.  It is most regrettable that we sometimes adopt the attitude that simply because somebody is old, he or she is immediately to be regarded as dependent or ill.</P>
      <P>Old age is a process and some people who are quite elderly are extremely active and have all their faculties while others, as has been mentioned, in a much younger group may have a physical or mental infirmity and they should qualify under this Bill.  We have to get away from the idea that old age in some sense implies being ill.  I am sure that is not the intention of the proposers, but it is most unfortunate that this amendment is proposed. If it were phrased in some other way perhaps one could go along with it, but I do not agree with the present wording.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I reply to Senator Conroy?  We are not suggesting all old people are of necessity dependent but <Col N="2031" /> many are and do not fall within these parameters.  Many old people who would not have mental or physical infirmity as such are dependent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the objections raised by Senators Honan and Conroy, I still agree with the amendment as proposed by Fine Gael.  Even if, in the first instance, the aspect of old age was covered by the existing provisions, it would be important to emphasise and draw attention to the area of dependency which exists in the context of old age. The amendment does not state that old age is a disease.</P>
      <P>It simply says that old age can be the factor which bring about dependency.  In that context it is one of the major factors and, should be included in the list of provisions. As it stands, a limited set of factors are covered but it should be extended to cover old age.  That flexibility is necessary in order to put emphasis on the problems of infirmity and dependency that can arise as a result of old age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the proposed amendment.  I have a basic objection to using the term &ldquo;old age&rdquo;.  We would have paragraph (a) dealing with physical infirmity or physical injury paragraph (b) dealing with mental infirmity and add on &ldquo;old age&rdquo;.  I am not sure if paragraphs (a) and (b) are necessary.  We should put a full stop after &ldquo;bathing&rdquo; but if we are going to start defining it I would be very sad to see old age included with physical and mental infirmity.</P>

I have one constituent who is 87 years of age and who is attempting to have his house repaired by the health board rather than go into an institution.  By including that particular category under section 1 of the Bill you will ensure that he will qualify <Col N="2032" /> under section 7.  It is out of respect for old age that we are including it.  I cannot understand how Senator Conroy can object to what we are doing.  We are trying to improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions on this amendment.  A considerable amount of time was spent in the Dáil discussing whether the inclusion of &ldquo;old age&rdquo; as a criterion of dependency in the Bill would widen its scope.  I would remind Senators what the Bill says.  It defines a dependent person as a person who requires assistance with the activities of daily living, such as dressing, eating, walking, washing and bathing by reason of physical infirmity, injury, defect, disease or mental infirmity.  The suggestion in the amendment is that we add on old age to this list of infirmities.</P>
      <P>At this stage I want to appeal to the logic and commonsense of the Senators. An elderly person who needs assistance with the activities of daily living does not need it because of old age as such but because of physical or mental debility that may accompany old age.  Recently I had reason to represent the country overseas and on my trip a woman of 101 years from the United Kingdom was travelling unaccompanied on a world tour.  Today I met a man of 75 years from County Offaly who was absolutely thrilled and delighted to have obtained a visitor's visa from the US Embassy as he was going on his holidays to the United States.  These two old people are an example of what old age can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be inaccurate to automatically equate old age and dependency.  It goes against the trend of bodies and organisations who have been trying to promote a more active image of old age.  Senators may be aware of the work of the Age and Opportunity Committee in organising the National Week on Ageing which is now an annual event.  Similarly, the Pensioner of the Year awards clearly show how independent elderly people can be and how they can continue to make a very valuable contribution to society.  The <Col N="2033" /> committees which organise these activities are trying to get the message across that most people remain healthy, energetic and capable of participating actively in society long after they have reached the age of 65 years.  They are trying to combat negative images of old age, which is implied in the suggestion that in this Bill we should equate old age with dependency. Senator O'Reilly is correct when he says that old age is implicit in the Bill. If a person becomes dependent during old age they are covered within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senators that there is no malign intent on my part in standing firm on this point.  If you do not agree with me on the principle involved, I can assure you that my legal advice is that the addition of &ldquo;old age&rdquo; will not bring any additional category of persons under the Bill.  In other words, no category of elderly person will be excluded from the scope of the Bill by the omission of &ldquo;old age&rdquo;.  Longfellow said: &ldquo;for age is opportunity no less than youth&rdquo;.  In appealing to the House I use the words of Browning which were: &ldquo;Grow old along with me, the best is yet to be, the last of life for which the first was made&rdquo;.  Perhaps in that spirit we could go along together.</P>

      <P>I made the point it could be argued by some people that old age was implicit in the Bill but I see no reason not to make it explicit.  The very romantic, colourful and picturesque description of idyllic old age by the Minister as lived out by some people is charming and is of great interest to the House as a form of diversion but the tragic reality for many old people is different.  It is a reality of isolation, loneliness, often great poverty, great physical and emotional isolation etc., and unfortunately that tragic reality is much more common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> The idyllic type of old age painted by the Minister does exist.  I know people like that also and it is really heartening when we see it but, unfortunately, the more normal experience of old age is an isolated old person living alone in a rural hamlet, hoping for a letter from an emigrant child and depending on the social services.  I appeal to the Minister's good sense &mdash; I accept his bona fides on this &mdash; and concern for the old and ask him to think again about this.  The Bill will be enhanced by this very minor adjustment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>How do we define old age?  To a child going to school we are very old but we would not consider ourselves that old.  How do we define old age?  Recently I played golf with a lady of 86 years playing off a 13 handicap. There are many people of 25 and 35 years who could not play off that handicap.  It would be very foolish to put in something we cannot define.  &ldquo;Old age&rdquo; is a very loose term.  To us, someone of 80 years is an old person but for that person someone of 90 years is old.  There were two old people talking one day and one said: &ldquo;I am 74&rdquo; and the other said: &ldquo;I am just 82&rdquo;.  The first person said: &ldquo;If I get to 82 I will be pleased&rdquo; and then the other said: &ldquo;You will until you get to 82.&rdquo;  So, how do you define old age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly is fantasising a little when he says that an old person is somebody living on their own in an isolated cottage waiting for an emigrant's letter. I do not think there are too many people who, if they were able to send home a letter &mdash; presumably with money in it &mdash; would leave their elderly parents in such conditions.  What the Senator said might refer to some people who are living on their own and have no one belonging to them.  I was visiting a neighbour and I wandered across the field one summer evening to visit a person I considered to be an old man.  His house was in a very dilapidated state.  A number of social workers had visited him because he lived on his own.  When I called on him he was out in the field and I spent about two hours talking to him.  The sun was shining and I said to him, &ldquo;James, you can have <Col N="2035" /> a nice bit of land on the road side instead of here in the bog&rdquo;&mdash; he had to come though a bog &mdash; and I said we could get a nice house for him there.  He said: &ldquo;I would expect nothing better from you; the father and mother who reared you would not have reared a son who was not good natured, but, he said, as soon as I get the hay finished I am going to do up my own house&rdquo;.  That man was 80 years of age.  How could anyone tell him he should be in an institution.  He did not consider himself old.  To insert &ldquo;old age&rdquo; in this legislation would be very foolish and I appeal to the Minister not to do it.</P>

      <P>In fairness, Senator O'Reilly should withdraw this amendment because there are enough of us in this House serving at local level to know the pressure which is exerted on us to get people places in institutions.  Only 5 per cent of our elderly are in institutions while 17.5 per cent of the elderly are being catered for at home.  Senators Ryan and Kennedy have enough clout to get a place for any old person who wants to go into an institution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;`record' shall mean all records <Col N="2036" /> excluding clinical and financial records&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) (g) provides that the Minister may &ldquo;prescribe requirements as to the records to be kept in nursing homes and for the examination and copying of any such records or of extracts therefrom by officers of health boards.&rdquo;  We believe that clinical and medical records and personal financial details, as they are in the doctor patient relationship should be reserved for a very careful eye and not just for the officers of health boards.  It is true that draft regulations which were published on 25 May 1990 provide in fair detail for this matter.  For example, in regard to Article 24 (d) it states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this article authorises any person other than a designated officer who is a medical practitioner or the patient's general practitioner to inspect any medical records relating to a patient in a nursing home.</P>
    <P>Article 18 of the same draft regulations, from subsection (a) to subsection (g), provide fairly detailed regulations regarding the keeping of records and so on.  Our main worry is the fact that this is contained in regulations.  I believe the exclusion of clinical medical, financial and personal details should be enshrined in the Bill.  The acceptance of this amendment will make this section watertight and it should not be totally dependent on the regulations that the Minister purports to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the argument made by Senator Kennedy valid.  If there were, for example, a situation where the patient had a doctor of his or her own but for some purpose another doctor, being a doctor who intervened as an officer of the health board, did get access to the clinical records of that patient, would that access and that knowledge be covered by the doctor/patient relationship even though the patient involved was not directly a patient of that doctor?  I am not sure if I am making myself quite clear but I am really concerned about the confidentiality of personal records.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At present nursing homes are not required nor is there any intention to require the homes to make records available for inspection.  Under the present regulations, patients' clinical records may only be inspected by a medical practitioner in the service of the Minister for Health or of the health board or by the patient's general practitioner.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Norris's question, we are proposing to put in regulation form that patient's clinical records may be inspected by a medical practitioner who is representing or working on behalf of the Minister for Health or a medical practitioner working on behalf of the health board or the patient's own general medical practitioner.  We have designated specifically that only a general practitioner can inspect clinical records. I think that protects and preserves the doctor/patient relationship.  One doctor will obviously respect the relationship a colleague has with a patient and the fact that no other person can inspect clinical records preserves the privacy of the doctor/patient relationship and the very detailed and important information relating to the clinical condition and the health of the patient.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>The draft nursing home regulations which my colleague, the Minister for Health, circulated to Senators last week repeat this provision.  Senators may wish to read Article 24 (d) on page 10 of the draft regulations.  In view of this, I think we have been very explicit and I would request Senators not to put this amendment as I do not consider it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is trying to go some way to meet my objection. The question of clinical records is more important than financial records although they are both significant.  My worry is not completely met by what the Minister has kindly said.  It seems to me that a medical practitioner acting on behalf of the Minister or on behalf of the health board would be obliged to relay whatever information came in to his or her possession to the Minister or to the health board and there could be areas of <Col N="2038" /> confidentiality in which it is very important that the primary responsibility and obligation of the doctor as a medical practitioner is to the interests of the patient. It seems to me that if a doctor is acting principally on behalf of the health board, he or she might come in contact through clinical records with material that could be interpreted to the disadvantage of the patient either by the Minister or the health board.  I am unwilling to give specific examples but I could produce one or two if I were pushed.  It is for that reason I am interested in the precise quality of the confidentiality the Minister would also like to see preserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of the draft regulations which indicates that it is taken seriously.  These are purely draft regulations but this is of such importance that it should be written into the legislation. Traditionally, the relationship between doctor and patient is sacrosanct.  Clinical and medical records are not available to everyone.  This amendment would enhance the legislation.  The fact that it was considered by the Minister's colleague as worthy of introduction into the draft regulations would indicate his acceptance of its importance.  The logical thing to do would be to go a stage further and allow it to become part of the legislation. I appeal to the Minister to consider doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Norris, there is a presumption on his part that the medical practitioner representing the Minister for Health or the health board, on examining the clinical records of a particular patient would automatically transfer information from those clinical records either to the Minister or the health board.  I do not think this situation would prevail unless the medical practitioner was specifically sent in to inspect the clinical records of a patient for a particular reason, either as a result of a complaint being made to the health board or to the Minister or that some investigation was being carried out at the request of the Minister or of the health board.  I do not think the medical <Col N="2039" /> practitioner would report back on any clinical records unless he was sent in for a specific reason but we must allow flexibility both to the Minister and the health board to send in a medical practitioner to carry out an inspection at any time and to take random samples of clinical records to assess the medical condition of a patient and to gauge his condition <i>vis-à-vis</i> the care being given to him by the management of the nursing home. Based on the over-view the medical practitioner, as the inspector, would have, I am sure if he were satisfied with what he saw as a result of his random examination he would not have any reason to report out of that clinical record information which he found therein.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator O'Reilly, there is no change in the <i>status quo</i> as far as the inspection of medical record is concerned. No problems have been expressed with the arrangements that at present exist pertaining to nursing homes.  We do not see any good reason to change them.  They are here in draft regulation form to be firmed up and accepted and signed by the Minister as soon as the Bill becomes law.  We are putting them before the House so that Senators will know what already exists and what we propose to do.  I hope Senators can accept the fact that we have designated a medical practitioner to carry out this inspection and to have information available only to this qualified person protects the privacy and rights of the individual patient.</P>

      <P>If what we have in the draft regulations were included in the Bill we would be happy.  For example, Article 24 states that:</P>
      <P>The registered proprietor and any member of staff of the nursing home shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) permit designated officers to enter and inspect the nursing home and shall afford the said officers such facilities and information as they require for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> (d) nothing in this article authorises any person other than a designated officer who is a medical practitioner or the patient's general practitioner to inspect any medical record relating to a patient in a nursing home.</P>
    <P>This should be included in the Bill.  We would be delighted to accept the appropriate amendment if the Minister comes up with it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister in everything he has said has indicated concern for the well-being of patients. One thing that is not addressed in this section but is tangentially considered by the amendment is the question of the patient's consent.  I accept that this does not emerge very much but the situation could arise where a patient would wish to withdraw his or her consent to examination of his or her records by a doctor operating on behalf of the Minister for Health or indeed a health board.</P>
      <P>I said if I thought about it I could probably drag up from the depths of my imagination an example and, curious enough, I have been able to do so.  It comes from a situation I have been familiar with through my activities in counselling agencies over the past ten or 15 years.  It may be regarded as a rather controversial one but I ask Members of the House and the Minister not to allow their response to be prejudiced by what may appear to be a controversial element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of situations, for example, where couples of the same sex have lived together for a considerable period of years and when one party to the relationship became seriously or terminally ill or was hospitalised as a result of a degenerative disease or a nervous breakdown, the family intervened in order to inhibit visiting by the partner of the dying or seriously ill patient.  It could be that the family would have recourse to a health board or to the Minister.  Since homosexuality is still a criminal offence I do not think that would place the Minister in a position to respect the desire for <Col N="2041" /> confidentiality of that patient.  I did not come in with the intention of raising a problematic or controversial issue but I felt it would be useful for me to draw from my own experiences a possible case where the requirment for consent on the part of the patient is clearly indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to put an imposition on a dependent person to give consent to a medical practitioner, particularly one representing the health board or the Minister for Health <i>vis-à-vis</i> an investigation into their clinical records.  Old people or people who are dependent need peace and a nice warm hospitable environment to give them good care.  It may upset them and cause them distress if they have to give consent for their medical records to be checked. The medical practitioners may come on the direction of the health board or the Minister or they may do a random check or inspection which is very important for the overall efficiency and co-ordination of a high standard of care in nursing homes.  It is not like administering an anaesthetic where permission must be obtained from the next-of-kin.  It would be an imposition on the patient and create undue stress for that person.</P>
      <P>Homosexuality is not a medical condition and would not appear in a clinical record.  Consequently, I do not see any difficulty with regard to it, or in it creating any problem for the general practitioner who would be carrying out the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Minister.  Unfortunately, he is incorrect. The World Health Organisation is in the process of removing homosexuality as a <Col N="2042" /> disease, but suppose it happened that somebody had a nervous breakdown. Technically, it is a disease; I believe that is wrong, but it is classified as such.  In fact, I could claim to be suffering from a terminal form of it and require a pension, if I was maliciously inclined, but I am not.  The World Health Organisation move very slowly; they are in the process of removing it from that category.  The Minister may have some information about its precise classification in this country.</P>
      <P>Dependent people are not all elderly. There are also elderly gay people, and that could appear on the clinical records. There are also various medical conditions in which this could occur but I am not going to push this line of argument because I believe it would be improper for me to do so at this time.  I will conclude by saying that I completely accept what the Minister said about somebody who is ill or dependent.  Of course, one can be dependent for different reasons in a nursing home.  I would have thought that in addition to the warmth, comfort and cherishing in a nursing home, the right to be visited by a life-long partner is also something that should be strongly indicated to most people in terms of their general well-being.  I have indicated a hypothetical situation which, in fact, is also practical and real because I have personally dealt with it.  A family, for their own reasons, although separated from any close connection with this individual for many years, may, when he or she is dependent intervene maliciously to prevent a life-long partner having access.  This is just a worry; I will not be returning to it but I wish to draw the Minister's attention to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 18 to 19, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>According to section 2 a &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; means an institution for the care and maintenance of more than two dependent persons, excluding an institution managed by or on behalf of the Minister of the Government or a health board.</P>
      <P>On both sides of the House we welcome the Minister taking on board the ideas envisaged in the Bill to improve the standards and regulations in the control of private nursing homes throughout the country.  However, I am taken aback when the same Minister, in dealing with his own nursing homes under his own responsibilities through the health boards, is excluding such institutions from being described as a nursing home as outlined in the Bill.  The private nursing homes we are dealing with have had very rigorous standards imposed on them, which are very welcome.</P>
      <P>With regard to existing nursing homes under the health boards' responsibility, if the Minister is sincere and concerned about the standards of all nursing homes, instead of having a two-tier nursing home system, he should agree to the exclusion of subsection (a).  I cannot understand it. Will the Minister explain the logic of excluding nursing homes under the responsibility of the health board and the Minister from this section while at the same time demanding higher standards from the private sector?  I feel strongly about this and would like clarification from the Minister.  Will he explain why his own nursing homes should not be regulated by the same standards and regulations outlined in the Bill for private nursing homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment.  Section 2 defines the scope of the Bill in terms of which nursing homes and institutions will be affected. Section 2 (1) (a) provides for the exclusion of an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or by a health board.  Section 6 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister for Health in relation to standards in nursing homes.  It seems that the people who are writing these rules and making the regulations want to exclude their own institutions from the standards they wish to impose on private nursing homes.  The principle of equality should be enshrined here and we should have the same standards for public and private care.  It is fundamental that we are seen to treat elderly people in the <Col N="2045" /> same fashion in public or private institutions.</P>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment proposed so well by Senator Ryan.  All institutions caring for the elderly and dependent persons, whether managed by or on behalf of the Minister or by a health board, should be governed by the same standards.  I believe this would also be the wish of the public.  The exclusions now of public institutions, especially in times of financial difficulties, would be seen by the public as setting a double standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ryan and Senator Kennedy for the excellent way in which they presented the case on this important amendment.  As the House knows, the amendment attempts to delete subsection (a) of section 2 (1). It states that an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board, would be outside the terms of the Bill.  That would be very serious for the reason identified by Senator Kennedy at the end of his remarks when he spoke about a time of financial stringency posing grave worries in the public mind.  Effectively in this amendment we want to ensure that the same standards apply to all State institutions as to private institutions.</P>
      <P>We are extremely concerned that people who are in health board institutions would be assured by law of the same level of care as people in private institutions.  I am aware from the Official Report of the Dáil that it was argued by the Minister that there were certain guidelines for those institutions.  Accepting that, I see it as an important exercise on our part to write it into this Bill that all institutions of this kind are put on the same level.  Basically, to use the old adage, what is good for the goose is good for the gander.  I believe that this adage applied in this case.  We basically must achieve the same level of standards, the same level of services and the same rules and regulations for old people in State geriatric care.</P>

    <P>I am not convinced that there are many who do not hold that view; hopefully, <Col N="2046" /> most right thinking citizens hold that view.  It is important that we are not lax about it, that we are in no sense casual about it, that it becomes part of our legislation and this provides a wonderful opportunity to do that.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this important amendment. As we pointed out earlier, if the Minister can propose an alternative form of wording on Report Stage to achieve the same thing we will be happy with that.  Uniform standards should apply throughout the country and it is important and timely that this amendment be accepted.</P>
    <P>Finally, what makes it critically important is the perception that rests around health cuts and financial stringency.  It is important that there be no doubt that we are insisting on the same level of care throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the amendment.  First, it is the health boards who will be policing this Bill and, therefore one would be asking them to inspect themselves which would be a waste of time and energy and completely wrong. Second, at least some of the health board nursing homes and geriatric units are inspected monthly by health board community care committees.  Nursing homes in my health board area, and I know they do in other boards also, because I have spoken with Members of other boards who supervise those visits, are inspected regularly.  They ensure that public representatives are the monitors.  They check those homes, talk with patients and visit them in the course of their duty as a committee.  Those homes are inspected regularly and there is no need for worry there.  However, no health board official and certainly no health board member until now, had authority to go into private nursing homes, other than on a visit. They could not make any recommendations or suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason there is no need to include health board nursing homes in the Bill because we, as elected representatives, monitor them.  We are always shouting about elected representatives' powers being taken from them and here <Col N="2047" /> we want to give away our power to some inspector to abolish community care committees and then we will not have the responsibility of inspecting nursing homes within our health board areas. However, we will have some official doing it.  That would be completely against the system of democracy and the very good monitoring system in health boards carried out by officials and public representatives.  The are the best judges of how well nursing homes are run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, do not support this amendment because this Bill was introduced so that nursing homes in the private sector could be examined by the authorities to bring them up to the required standard.  Any nursing home that I know under the care of the health board system maintains proper standards. I would hate to think that we might have to introduce another layer of bureaucracy to inspect ourselves.  If that is the case, perhaps we should get out of the nursing home business and have somebody from outside the country examine it.  Is that what is meant by the amendment?  The Bill was introduced to bring private sector nursing homes up to proper standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole thrust and purpose of this Bill is to regularise the control of private nursing homes.  It was never envisaged that it would include public nursing homes in the control of the health boards and under the control of the Department of Health.  I do not think it is appropriate that health boards should register and inspect their own homes and hospitals for the elderly.  Health boards, as regards standards in their own institutions, are subject to a statutory system of public accountability.  Health boards have visiting committees whose task it is to report on the standards of care in their hospitals and homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staff of health boards are answerable to the health boards for the standard of care they provide.  The majority of health board members are public representatives and board meetings are held in <Col N="2048" /> public.  Frequently, health board, board committee and sub-committee meetings are held in the board's hospitals and geriatric homes which provide an opportunity for board members and committee members to visit these institutions.  If the Minister for Health is not satisfied with the type and standard of care being provided in the health board institutions, he has the power to order a local inquiry under sections 83-86 of the Local Government Act, 1941, as amended by section 83 of the Health Act, 1970.  Under the sections of the 1941 Act, the Minister for Health can hold an inquiry and obtain detailed information about any aspect of a health board's responsibilities.  They also give an inspector representing the Minister for Health power to visit premises and to obtain evidence and other information.  Deputies and Senators are also free to ask questions or put down motions in the Oireachtas on any aspect of the health services with which they are unhappy.</P>
    <P>The logic is very simple, we do not expect any higher standards of the private sector than have been delivered heretofore in the public sector.  We can be proud of the high standard of care, diligent staff and the important inspections that are carried out by medical practitioners on behalf of the Department, the health boards, senior executives of the boards, programme managers and other staff.  We have over the years, through the public service, the Department and health boards, given excellent geriatric care in particular around the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill is clearly designed to ensure that there is a standardised upgrading enshrined in law and regulated control of private nursing homes.  Due to demographic changes private nursing homes are being built and established all over the country.  Therefore, it is vitally important that, in the interests of dependent people who need constant care and attention, we have clearly standardised regulated control enshrined in law under the control of the health boards, subject to the overall control of the Minister for Health.  It would be totally outside the <Col N="2049" /> scope of the Bill to include public nursing homes and geriatric homes which were never designed as such.  It was never the intention and that was clearly outlined in the Bill and in the accompanying memorandum. We have no intention of including them at this stage and I hope the House can accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's comments rather defensive.  I cannot see why there should not be uniformity in inspection between private nursing homes and public health board homes.  If one relates &ldquo;public&rdquo; to those homes in the health board jurisdiction what exactly is being inspected?  Does it mean that there will be different criteria for inspection of health board nursing homes and private nursing homes?  I imagine there should be no fear of inspection by health boards of both if the criteria are the same for both.  I am afraid the Minister's reply is rather defensive.  We want uniformity between the two.  If the Bill is designed to bring private nursing homes up to proper standards, surely there should be uniformity at the end of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said about the explosion in the private nursing homes sector over the last couple of years which is due primarily to the fact that the cutbacks have affected the public health geriatric institutions so much and many thousands of beds have been withdrawn from the service, but I cannot understand, if we are so certain and so happy that the standards in our own public institutions are so good, why are we afraid not to allow the same standards to apply as apply to the private nursing home sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was 14 years on a health board and I appreciate the standards that apply in all health board institutions.  For the life of me, I cannot understand and I am not happy with the Minister's reply.  If everyone is saying that everything is OK in the public sector nursing homes, why must we exclude them?  What fear have we? Why are we afraid of inspections?  I am not afraid of inspections of the institutions I know.  If we are seen to show <Col N="2050" /> equality to all people who need geriatric care, I believe that equality should be enshrined in this new Bill, which has come as a result of this explosion.</P>
    <P>We have a huge private nursing home system now.  Surely, if we are seen to be concerned for all people in such care, we should include all institutions. Someone remarked about the Dáil doing this and doing that, but here in the Seanad three weeks ago we amended a Bill.  I do not see why we should not be able to do the same thing here if we are seen to be giving equality to all people in need of geriatric care.  As one who has served for 14 years on a health board, I see no reason for that attitude and I am prepared to push this amendment to ensure equality and that we respect our workers in the public institutions.  They are doing a wonderful job.  By excluding them there is an inverted reflection on the services and on the people who provide them.  I will be forcing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I have no need to be defensive.  The record stands as regards the level of service given by the people of this country, and by the State in particular through the public sector and the health boards, this outstanding geriatric care that has been given over the decades.  I have put the situation as it is.  This Bill is designed to regulate privately owned, commercially operated nursing homes.  It is not designed to include the publicly owned, Exchequer supported geriatric and nursing homes that are run by the health boards.  That was clearly the intention from the very outset in the drafting of the Bill.  The Bill was designed to regulate private and commercially operated nursing homes.</P>
      <P>There is no real legal right at present for the Minister or his representatives or the health boards and their representatives to have free, open access on behalf of the people to ensure that the proper standard of care is being given in private nursing homes.  This Bill is designed to ensure that that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Senator Ryan who said <Col N="2051" /> that the cutbacks have seriously affected geriatric beds and that as a result there has been an explosion in the private nursing home area.  As a matter of fact, the opposite is the situation.  As a result of much greater efficiency in the health area, and a rationalisation and an upgrading of services, a number of institutions in the acute and the psychiatric areas, that had to be rationalised became vacant.  Many of those have now been turned into community nursing homes and community geriatric homes and as a result, with State support through both the Department of Health with Exchequer resources and through national lottery funding, many more geriatric beds have now become available. So, due to the efficiencies on one side, it has created much greater community services on the other.  This Bill is not designed as a result of cutbacks.  It is designed clearly to regulate the private nursing home sector as distinct from the public nursing home area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the Minister. I supported him that there was an explosion in the nursing home sector because of the cutbacks.  I must not be living in the same country as the Minister. As far as I am concerned, there has been a serious cutback in geriatric beds.  I know that from the Mid-Western region anyway and I think it is the general consensus around the country.  We have private nursing homes because people cannot get beds in public nursing homes. The need was there.  In fact, under section 3 we talk about the illegal homes. That is how they came about &mdash; because <Col N="2052" /> there was a need there.  Do we hope now that under this Bill the illegal homes will be quashed.  At the same time, I am saying we have nothing to be ashamed of.  In the public sector we have nothing to be ashamed of.  We should enshrine it in the Bill that the same services are available in the public sector as are in the private.  I am pressing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to clarify the situation before we force this issue.  Health board institutions are not afraid of inspections.  They are subject to inspections from their members and from the Department of Health on the direction of the Minister.  They are regularly inspected in the way I have outlined already.  What is at issue here is whether this Bill should include health board institutions. This Bill was never intended to include health board institutions.  It would create major anomalies if they were included.  Are health boards to register their own homes?  Are health boards to pay subventions to people maintaining their own homes?  Are health boards to charge themselves registration fees?  We could go on and on.  It is obvious that the Bill is designed to clearly cover the private nursing home area.  Consequently, there is no point in duplicating the situation with the public nursing home area under the control of the health boards.  We would be creating anomalies, we would be duplicating effort and wasting resources.  Therefore, I am appealing to Senator Ryan not to press this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the regulations shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The wording of that amendment speaks for itself.  I am not going to keep the House very long except to say that it seems to me that a draft of each regulation should be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the regulations should not come into force until an affirmative motion approving the draft has been passed by each House.  To my way of thinking, the net issue here is whether this legislation is to be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas or, in fact, to be accountable to senior civil servants in the Department of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why Senator Kennedy is asking for this.  I recall &mdash; as indeed he should &mdash; that when this same type of wording was laid before the House in health regulations in 1985, only four or five Senators voted for it. Maybe I am wrong, but I recall that that is what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of all Senators to section 14 of the Bill, which deals with the laying of regulations before each House of the Oireachtas.  I would like to concur with Senator Honan that when the original health regulations were laid before the Oireachtas in 1985 an annulling motion was tabled and only four Senators supported it at the time.  There was an overwhelming majority in favour of accepting the regulations when they were laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach which we have adopted in section 14 is the standard one used in the Acts of the Oireachtas &mdash; in other words, the regulations take effect unless a resolutions annulling them is passed by either House within the next 21 sitting days after they have been lodged in the Oireachtas.  This is much more appropriate. First, it gives the Minister and the Department an opportunity to take account of the up-to-date situation in the health regime of the day; second, it makes sure that the most appropriate regulations are drafted and put before the Oireachtas; and, third, it gives the <Col N="2055" /> right to Members of the Oireachtas to table a motion and to have a debate on the regulations that are placed before it. So, I think that if we were to enshrine something in legislation that was going to be fixed and stereotyped, it would not give the flexibility that is needed to ensure that the most up-to-date and appropriate regulations are in vogue at any particular time.  I hope the Senators can accept the situation as I see no reason to depart from this approach.  Therefore, I will not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 41, to delete &ldquo;District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Minister for Health&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working party which reported on the Bill recommended this amendment: that decisions of health boards on registration should be appealable to the Minister for Health.  The Bill says that such appeals may be directed to the District Court.  I believe that the Minister is the proper person for such appeals on health matters. The idea of asking people to submit appeals to an already overloaded District Court is not good.  First the District Court is geared purely and simply for legal appeals, whereas the Minister who set out the conditions and regulations is the Minister who is responsible.  I believe he is the person who should deal with appeals.  It is only adding costs and delays to someone who is genuinely attempting to establish a nursing home worthy of the name and the logic is that such appeals <Col N="2058" /> should be directed through the Minister and not through the District Court.  Aside from my own belief on it, the working party recommended that as one of its recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Ryan was referring to nursing homes under the control of health boards I would agree with him, but in this situation we are talking about nursing homes that are controlled and owned by the private sector.  I believe that it is more appropriate that appeals by nursing home proprietors be made to the District Court than to the Minister for Health.  The District Court is easily accessible and offers a speedy and inexpensive remedy in the event of a difference of opinion between a health board and a nursing home proprietor. The knowledge that a nursing home proprietor may appeal a health decision to the District Court will impose a discipline on the manner in which the health board reaches its decision.  A health board will have to justify its decisions on the objective grounds and, if necessary, demonstrate its objectivity in court.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly that the advantages of this system will outweigh any reservations which nursing home owners may feel about appeals being heard in the District Court.  If the people are in the private sector and the health board rule against them I think it is only fair that in that situation the nursing home proprietor would have recourse to the lower courts which would be the local District Court, an inexpensive court, a court that is local to them and gives them open and easy access where the matter can be decided in law and a final and conclusive decision arrived at.  I think this is a much fairer way than to have the Minister involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was the situation pertaining to the geriatric nursing homes that are normally run by the health boards, it would be more relevant to have that direct line of appeal to the Minister, but in this case as it involves both the public sector and the private sector and it is in the interests of the public and public scrutiny and equity <Col N="2059" /> and fairness, I think it is only right that an appeal should be to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan. Ultimately it is the Minister for Health who bears the responsibility for the health services and I believe that if decisions are to be made on health, in other words, decisions as to what are acceptable standards and so on and what aspects of nursing homes are acceptable, then I believe it is the Minister for Health who should make those decisions, arbitrate on them and ultimately carry the responsibility.</P>
      <P>The other point is that the District Courts are grossly overcrowded at this stage.  It is quite difficult for many people to get in there and I do not believe they should be clogged up with this type of business.</P>

Having the Minister excluded is in the best interests of the Bill and in the best interests of nursing home proprietors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), line 48, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 is perhaps one of the most important sections in this Bill.  The power of the Minister to make regulations is, in fact, a very comprehensive and wide power.  For instance, in section 6 (2) the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; make regulations.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; applies to such important areas as the maintenance, care, welfare <Col N="2060" /> and well being of dependent persons.  The case we are making is that it should be mandatory on the Minister.</P>
    <P>Again he &ldquo;may&rdquo; make regulations which prescribe the requirements as to the numbers, qualifications and availability of members of the staffs of nursing homes and so on.  This is most important and I think therefore that it should be mandatory on the Minister to make these regulations in regard to all aspects of the standard of care, maintenance and so on in nursing homes.  For instance under section 6 (2) (e) the Minister may prescribe requirements as to the food provided for dependent persons and so on. That is the case we are making.  We must look at section 6 because as I said already it empowers the Minister to make these regulations about the ultimate standards of care in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>We know of course, that section 6 is broadly similar to a section in the 1964 Act with some minor changes.  The first set of regulations were made in 1964 and new regulations were made in 1985, but still the Minister persists in 1990 with a set of draft regulations which are very vague and it is almost impossible to pin down these regulations.</P>
    <P>I am informed by people in the health boards that they will find it very difficult to enforce the regulations because the Minister, I take it, with the advice of his officials, is using such terms as &ldquo;suitable and sufficient care&rdquo;, &ldquo;adequate space&rdquo;, &ldquo;sufficient number of competent staff&rdquo;, &ldquo;suitable and sufficient accommodation&rdquo;, &ldquo;adequate day space&rdquo;.  I believe the Minister should incorporate the guidelines that have been issued by his own Department in the regulations. Unless he does this every health board and every director of community care responsible for the enforcement of these regulations will find it impossible to do their job.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board, the major health board in this country, for example, in a recent report stated that the regulations are too general in their requirements and that they are too open to subjective interpretation.  My own health board said exactly the same.  Dr. Paddy <Col N="2061" /> McGowan recently stated that he will find it impossible to implement vague regulations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am suggesting that the Minister should give a commitment to this House now &mdash; it was not done in the other House &mdash; that he will enshrine the guidelines issued by his own Department as part of the regulations.  I would like to get an assurance from him in this regard. For instance, it has been suggested in the guidelines, and I want the guidelines to be read in conjunction with the regulations, that single bedrooms should have at least 100 square feet with a minimum ceiling height of 8 feet, that shared bedrooms should have at least 80 square feet per bed.  There is nothing at all in the draft regulations about this.  The specifics are out, the generalities are in.  I would like some assurance from the Minister today &mdash; I am talking for every health board and every director of community care in this country &mdash; that he will be more specific and definite here.</P>
    <P>I think the nursing homes will have to be given time to respond to these regulations and to put their house in order but we know from the surveys that have been done around the country that certain nursing homes are not meeting even the very minimum standards.  I would like some assurance from the Minister because we will not get the opportunity to discuss regulations here in spite of what the Minister said about this negative resolution that is available to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have never seen regulations being discussed in either House.  It certainly has not happened in recent times here.  I am now suggesting very strongly to the Minister that we, on this side of the House, would be very happy if he could give us an assurance that some of the excellent guidelines that have been developed with the health boards and the Department of Health will be enshrined in these new draft regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been comprehensively put for this amendment by Senator Kennedy.  All I would say at this stage is that the essential objective of the <Col N="2062" /> amendment is to tighten up what could be a loose situation, to make something definite.  This whole area of nursing home care and regulations and the lifestyle of people in nursing homes is of such sensitivity and of such importance that there should be nothing lax, there should be no ifs or buts or doubts.  Everything should be presented in the strongest and most positive way.  It is a worthy amendment and it is one the Minister should accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the two previous speakers.  When I spoke on section 2 on the exclusion of the health board institutions, the Minister made it very clear that the purpose of this Bill was to ensure that the private nursing sector would be properly organised, properly run and properly supervised. Section 6 contains such words as &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; and a repetition of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is insufficient, weak and lax and the Minister will not achieve his ambition to ensure that the private nursing sector is being run on very high standards and according to high regulations. As the two previous speakers said, the regulations cannot be discussed. I have not heard them discussed but I would ask the Minister to give some commitment in view of the fact that the objective of this Bill is to achieve high standards in the private nursing home area.</P>
      <P>As stated by Senator Kennedy, community care managers are going to have very serious problems because of the looseness and laxity of this section.  It will have to be firm, rigid and efficient.  The only way you will get a high-class service is by having a very rigid section 6.  It is too weak at present and on account of its importance, I appeal to the Minister to give a commitment that this section will be given an entitlement of a very high standard and commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, support my colleagues, Senator Ryan, Senator O'Reilly and Senator Kennedy in their concern about the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  If there is not an obligation to ensure those standards the whole thing falls asunder on that point <Col N="2063" /> even though the whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that there are proper standards.  Given that this is the objective of the Bill I cannot see any problem in setting those standards.  The Minister will still have the capacity to change them as things develop and as people's notion of what is acceptable and so on changes with the passage of time.  I very strongly ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment and also to give some commitment on his attitude to the implementation of the guidelines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mr. Jackman Mr. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the amendment I want to say it makes for a very practical aspect of the Bill if those people who will be implementing it have specific standards written into the Bill to ensure that there is no vagueness, no woolliness or ambiguity at the end of the day.  That is the tenor of the Bill so far and it is very important that the obligatory dimension would be there to protect the practitioners when they are trying to implement the regulations, that they have that yardstick to go by and that it is obligatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health accepted an amendment to section 6 (1) in the Dáil to provide that the Minister shall make regulations for the purpose of ensuring proper standards in nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, food and care for dependent persons.  Subsection (2) goes on to illustrate some of the matters what may be dealt with in the regulations. This listing is not intended to be exhaustive and it might be necessary to make regulations in relation to matters that are not specifically mentioned here.  As can be seen from the draft regulations circulated earlier, they are comprehensive and all the items listed in section 6 are covered.  We have been as specific as we can in the draft regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one who understands the problem of ensuring high standards in nursing homes argues in favour of including in regulations specific room sizes, ceiling heights or staffing ratios.  If you do this <Col N="2064" /> you could end up with a situation where a health board would have to close a nursing home which provided very high standards of care but which did not have the right room size, the right ceiling height or the proper staffing ratio or other matters in relation to this.  Flexibility and time are of the essence in creating the ideal home where the care is absolutely perfect and we must ensure we strike the right balance, protect the interests of the patient at all times and ensure that the flexibility is there so that a direction can be given to the nursing home proprietors to adhere to what are the normal acceptable standards of space and conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (1) starts with the words &ldquo;The Minister shall&rdquo; and on the fifth line it states &ldquo;make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to nursing homes&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section `may' ...&rdquo;.  It then goes on to outline in various minor sections what exactly is being covered &mdash; but it ensures that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make the regulations.  He has the right to do so in a specific way, in a general way, reacting to any particular situation, making such regulations as are appropriate at any particular time, at any notice, at any request from a health board or indeed from the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If we change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it means the Minister can only make regualtions which are specified here.  He cannot cover an eventuality which we do not anticipate now.  We are giving that flexibility and that broad opportunity to the Minister to ensure that the regulations can be updated and are as appropriate as are necessary to maintain a high standard at any time now and in the future. I would respectively suggest to the Senator to withdraw this amendment and ensure that that flexibility is left with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has ignored something now, as he did on Second Stage.  I made a very strong case on Second Stage that the regulations as currently drawn up were so vague that health boards would find it impossible <Col N="2065" /> to enforce them because of words like &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and generally vague words.  He has not referred to it at all.  I have asked for some assurance that these regulations would include the guidelines and I cannot see why the Minister cannot do that in regulations.  Guidelines are one thing; what the enforcement officers of health boards want are definite, specific regulations they can enforce.  We have got no indication from the Minister on any Stage so far that he intends to make it possible to enforce these regulations in the courts.  There is no point in having a situation where you can take certain proprietors of nursing homes to court if you know you cannot enforce them because they are so vague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would never be my intention to ignore the Members of this House, or indeed Senator Kennedy.  I would never like to be vague because I do not like vagueness or ambiguity.  I want to assure the House that we have drawn up regulations in the past.  They have been accepted by this House, they have been accepted by the public at large. They have been accepted by the owners and administrators of nursing homes and, above all, they have been accepted by the courts and implemented by them.  It is an innovation in regard to legislation that not alone would we debate legislation but we would also circulate a copy of the regulations with the legislation to give an idea to the Members of the House what we propose.  These regulations are <Col N="2066" /> being drawn up in consultation with officers of the health boards to ensure that they are suitable, that they can be implemented and that they can be sustained. I have no doubt the regulations will be accepted, will be relevant and that the courts will interpret them in a way that they can be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed with the Minister's reply.  I do not think we are talking about the same thing at all.  I hope his officials are more in tune with the thinking of the health boards because I know the Department of Health over the past 12 months or so have been writing to health boards asking for their views on this and there have been very comprehensive discussions with the senior officials of health boards with regard to the implementation of the regulations.  I have spelled it out here. How can you go to court and suggest that a proprietor, for instance, has not provided adequate space, a sufficient number of staff, suitable and sufficient accommodation?  How do you define that?  I am suggesting that the health boards are now operating the guidelines, but since the guidelines have no statutory basis they will find it impossible to implement the regulations.  Therefore, I have to press this amendment, if only to put it on the record that I am most disappointed with the reply the Minister has just given.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(a) prescribe requirements as to the recreational and therapeutic facilities in nursing homes.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is of the utmost importance because there is nothing written in here in relation to &ldquo;recreational and therapeutic facilities&rdquo;.  It is often the case that in a nursing home the only recreational facility is a sitting room with a television set, and wall to wall television all day with people sitting around.  We should establish clearly that it would be part of the life of a nursing home that there be adequate recreation, that there be a range of recreational activities and that there be various therapeutic facilities. It is effectively self-explanatory what we mean here.  I do not see any merit in labouring the point other than to say that it is an important omission at the moment.  There should be no difficulty in the Minister accepting this as a worthy amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (2) (a) provides that the nursing home regulations may prescribe requirements as to the maintenance, care, welfare and well being of dependent persons while being maintained in nursing homes.  If Senators turn to Article 5 of the draft nursing home regulations circulated earlier, they will see how we deal with the issue of recreational facilities in nursing homes.  Article 5 (d) and (e) obliges nursing home owners to provide facilities for the occupation and recreation of the patients and opportunities to participate in activities appropriate to his or her interests and capacities.  Article 5 (h) obliges nursing homes to provide information concerning current affairs, local matters, voluntary groups, community resources and events. What is expected of nursing homes in providing recreational opportunities for residents will be thrashed out further in the code of practice which is being finalised at present.  Article 5 also obliges nursing homes to provide a high standard of nursing and medical care for patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 29 (b) obliges nursing homes to provide physiotherapy, chiropody, occupational therapy or other health services as required by a patient.  I am satisfied that the draft regulations deal with recreational and therapeutic facilities <Col N="2069" /> required in nursing homes and that there is no need for this amendment.  I would be grateful if it could be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I propose this amendment in the names of Senator O'Reilly and myself.  We call upon the Minister to introduce a code of practice to be applied uniformly throughout the country.  As Senators will be aware, such a code of practice is operated very effectively in the United Kingdom. I would be glad to hear the Minister indicate that the introduction of a code of practice is being considered by his Department at the moment.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. I appeal to the Minister to accept it because I believe it is of vital importance that code of practice be applied uniformly throughout the country.  It would be a pity if this legislation was to be found defective because of different standards applying in different health board areas. It is only right and proper that we should have one code of practice throughout the country because, as the Minister knows, the interpretation from one health board to another could vary.  I would like to see some uniform practice applied throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This legislation is long overdue.  I welcome it.  It would be a pity if it was found defective because it was interpreted in different ways in different health board areas.  The previous situation where, on the one hand, some welfare homes were approved by the health board and others were not, some were getting subsidies and others were not, was crazy.  It would be a pity if this legislation failed because of lack of uniformity from one health board to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting my colleagues I want to make this point to the Minister.  At the moment there are many fairly big groups involved in the nursing home business.  I am aware from friends of mine in the world of banking that a number of syndicates or major business people are establishing nursing homes in different health board areas.  If a person owns a number of nursing homes &mdash; one in the Western Health Board area, one in the South-Western Health Board area and one in the North-Eastern Health Board area, for example, even from that person's point of view, he would find it unmanageable to comply with different standards in each health board area.  That makes my case for a national code of practice because it is very important to establish uniformity.  For all of these reasons I recommend the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what the three Senators had to say.  A code of practice will be an important part of the new arrangements governing the relationship between nursing homes, their clients and the health boards.  A code has been drafted for the first time and I have with me the first draft of the new code of practice.  We hope to firm it up later on.  It consists of two parts.  Part I sets out the best practice to which all homes should aspire and Part II deals with the uniform application of the legislation in all health boards. Senator Naughten referred to that.  A group of experts are currently examining the code and advising my Department on the final draft.</P>
      <P>This amendment would limit the code to dealing with inspections only.  I believe the code of practice should deal with much wider issues which arise in caring for the elderly and implementing this legislation.  Consequently, in the interests of having the best possible, broadest and most flexible code of practice agreed and available, I would like the Senator to withdraw the amendment as I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the signatories to the amendment that was ruled out of order, I would like to speak on this section, which is the social core of the Bill.  We are talking here about payments by health boards towards the cost of maintenance of dependent persons in nursing homes.  In fact, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; could be described as a potential charge on the public revenue and &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not.  That beats me because the option is &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; so &ldquo;may&rdquo; is in between, I will not argue with the Chair over semantics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about supporting people in these private nursing homes and supporting applications which have been investigated by investigating officers employed by the health board and the conclusive evidence being submitted to the health board that these cases are genuinely in need of of subvention by the health board.  At that stage the section takes off into the wind even though the health board genuinely <Col N="2072" /> believe that that person should be subvented. The Bill states that the health board &ldquo;may&rdquo; support the person in the nursing home.</P>
    <P>This is a very flawed section.  It is weak and it is reneging on our responsibilities to the less well off who are in these nursing homes, who may only have a pension to meet the cost of maintenance in that health board institution and are depending on the community care section of the health board to help them pay their weekly maintenance Bills in the nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Whoever decided this &mdash; the Government or the Minister &mdash; is turning his back on a promise made in the last three years to emphasise the need to improve community care services.  This is reneging on that responsibility, reneging on that commitment.  Now we have the position that there could be discrimination, there could be favouritism.  Someone will say: &ldquo;I consider that person in the home is genuinely in need of support but because of the Bill, I have the option to decide not to support him&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;May&rdquo; is a very weak word when you are talking about supporting people on low income.  That is why the signatories to this amendment felt it was a genuine amendment.  The fact is that this is the social core of the Bill and there is a weakness in it.  We had support from the Government side last week on that. There was a general feeling that &ldquo;may&rdquo; was too weak that was why we put down the amendment and asked that it be adopted so that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be the operative word rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; when it comes to looking after people who need looking after, I believe we are reneging on our responsibilities if we are not prepared to amend this section.  As I said, section 7 is the heart of the Bill and without it the Bill will mean nothing to the less well off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about others on this side of the House, but I had, and still have, worries about this section.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; does not mean the same as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I will stick to my guns I ask the Minister to amend this section although I <Col N="2073" /> do not know how he will do it, I noted that many amendments were accepted in the Dáil and I would have expected the same to happen here &mdash; we still might get them.</P>
      <P>Everyone in this nation knows my views of health boards, Health boards are left with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It certainly leaves me with deep worry.  As a Senator on the other side of the House said when recent legislation was going through, and he was caught with his party, &ldquo;if I was on the other side I know what I would do&rdquo;.  This evening, if I was on the other side, I know what I would do.  Senator Ryan knows that I will stick by this side of the House but I will say what I have to say.  We should not leave health boards with &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of a stronger word.  If there is a stronger word than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the Minister better use it.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan I am worried about this section.  An interesting thing happened here which I better put it on the record.  We discussed the Finance Bill with the Minister for Finance a short time ago and he made the case that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; had to be left in one of his Bills because &ldquo;may&rdquo; was not strong enough.  Here we are with a Health Bill and we are leaving &ldquo;may&rdquo; in, we are not getting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because &ldquo;may&rdquo; is strong enough.  I would like the Minister for Health to have a talk with the Minister for Finance and let the two of them find out what &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; stand for.</P>

      <P>You could very well have a situation where one health board would interpret their freedom to comply with this particular section by paying a subsidy to the nursing home, whereas an adjacent health board may well take the view that they were not compelled to do so.  I would be much happier to see a commitment there that the health board would pay a contribution for people who qualified.</P>
      <P>I have just two further very brief questions for the Minister.  In the context of the situation which existed prior to this where certain people in approved homes got a subsidy, will those be the criteria laid down for the additional people who will now qualify because the homes they are in become registered?  Could the Minister inform the House what additional cost is involved?  What kind of money are we talking about in terms of subsidies to those private homes at this time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not expert in this matter.  I did a little bit of research on it and I placed my views on the record of the House the last day with regard to the previously existing position under legislation before the passing of this section. Since then I have had this confirmed to me in writing by the proprietor of a nursing home in the Southern Health Board district.  I would like to quote what it says:</P>
      <P>With regard to subvention, the current position is as follows: section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 entitles people in approved nursing homes, i.e., homes approved for the purpose of section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 to claim subvention as of right.  When the new Bill becomes law, section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 will be repealed, thus removing a basic statutory right. Unless the wording in section 7 of the Bill is changed, the &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; argument, then that right will have been removed and nothing put in its place.  It is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what has been said to me so the position seems to be quite clear.  The position being clear with regard to the 1970 Act, I am now quite confused about this measure and this section because it seems to me there is a charge already, for example, in existence as of this moment so what we are talking about is the creation of a charge in some curious way.  I do not know.  I believe in creation <Col N="2076" /><i>ex nihilo</i> but there actually is something there already that is a charge.  I am simply commenting, a Chathaoirligh, not on your ruling &mdash; I would not presume so to do &mdash; but on the fact that the operation of this section as it stands now is to remove something.  The acceptance of the disputed amendment would simply be to retain the <i>status quo</i> so it is matter of conjecture to me how the creation of the charge arises although I have absolutely no doubt you are correct, as always.  I rather have to say that.</P>

      <P>It is so pleasant to get this light-hearted sniping from somebody who is supporting the position I have taken on this Bill, I may say taken up on this section, who is supporting the people who have tabled this amendment.  I draw to the Minister's attention the rather unusual feature that it has support from every section of the House, including the Government party.  I believe, despite the correctness of the Cathaoirleach's ruling, that indicates the Minister really should <Col N="2077" /> think again.  In other words, on this issue he is facing a united House and the professional opinion of those engaged in this area.  If this does not give him cause to think and consider the possibility of meeting the request of this House, then I think there is something very strange happening here.</P>
      <P>I would like also to make one final point, that is, that the Minister indicated in his speech the last day and indicated also to me far from his position on this matter reducing the Government expenditure and being a cheap skate, pennypinching exercise in health cuts, it would lead to an increase.  In other words, his proposals on this leads to the possibility of an increase, according to himself.  I find that difficult to believe, particularly because the Cathaoirleach has indicated that the result of our amendment would be to increase spending.  It is impossible to have it both ways.  I trust the Cathaoirleach absolutely.  I wonder what cheese paring and health cutbacks are behind this and perhaps the Minister would be able to explain that.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister please take back to the Government the clear feeling of the House on all sides to allow such an amendment, or perhaps he will introduce it because apparently it is not possible for this House to introduce it.  This may be just a technicality.  The capacity and the power will reside with the Minister to engage in this exercise which will be a generous act; not terribly generous I have to say because by accepting this he would only be continuing the <i>status quo</i> but it would be an indication at least, if nothing else, of parliamentary generosity.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that we are not able to debate this matter. It will allow health boards to continue to give priority to spending in other areas rather than to the care of the elderly. This is happening already in health boards who have not honoured their subventive payments.  It is interesting that all of us are very strong on this because it is the core of the Bill.  It is a good Bill but it will be theoretical rather than practical <Col N="2078" /> if this provision is left.  It is disappointing for me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am responding to the debate on this point.  To impose a charge on the Exchequer is the prerogative of the Government of the day. The Oireachtas in itself cannot take on itself through legislation or through amendments to legislation this right to impose a charge on the Exchequer. Consequently, this would impose a charge on the Exchequer and, indeed as Senator Norris has rightly said, either &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would impose a charge on the Exchequer in any event.  We have taken account of that in this year's budget.  That is the reason the Cathaoirleach has ruled this out of order.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health in his response to the Second Stage debate clearly outlined the situation pertaining to section 7. We want to ensure that the most flexible position can be adopted to maximise the resources, the services and the regulations that are needed to take full care of dependent people who need to be placed in nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 54 of the Health Act, 1953, obliges health boards to provide care and maintenance for people who cannot provide this for themselves.  This obligation remains under this Bill.  The Bill also repeals section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, which obliges health boards to pay subventions to people who opted for care <Col N="2079" /> in private hopspitals and/or nursing homes regardless of the person's means or dependency.</P>
    <P>The open-ended nature of this section combined with the restrictions on the number of homes approved for subvention and the low level of subvention have been criticised by many groups who have examined this problem.  However, we are protecting the rights of those in receipt of a subvention under the present arrangements.  Heretofore some approved nursing homes created the opportunity for people in those nursing homes to be subvented by the State. There are many unapproved nursing homes where no subvention is possible even though many people in these unapproved nursing homes need subvention. This section takes full care of that and gives the flexibility to the health boards to adjudicate on the means which people in nursing homes have and thereby give them a new subvention.</P>
    <P>We took full care of that in this year's budget where we allocated £5 million for geriatric care, and part of that £5 million must go to taking account of the Act which will be law as a result of the passing of this Bill.  We still have protected those who got a subvention heretofore.  They will not lose that subvention irrespective of their means but, as a result of this Bill being passed, they will retain the right to apply for a higher subvention.  If their means allows them to get that higher subvention then they will qualify for it.</P>
    <P>This goes back to the point made by Senator Ryan where he more or less said we were reneging on our commitment to provide community geriatric care.  We have not reneged; we have provided £5 million extra this year.  That takes account of this Bill which will become law on enactment.  We also recognise that once the Bill is passed it will impose a charge on the Exchequer in the future. We will take that into account in the preparation of the Book of Estimates next year and subsequent years.  The resources necessary to take full care of and give proper care and maintenance in a proper environment to dependent <Col N="2080" /> people will be available in subsequent budgets.  Consequently, I hope we can pass this section.  I thank the Senators for their contributins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I want to express my dissatisfaction.  I am not prepared to accept what the Minister has said.  As of now recognised nursing homes in my area are registered and are not being paid.  When section 7 is passed with the weakness of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; fewer homes will be paid.  In fairness to the officials and the patients, the officials who go out in the field and investigate genuine cases come back into the office and say &ldquo;Mr. X should be approved for subvention&rdquo;, afterwards the deciding officer says &ldquo;with regret we are opting out&rdquo;.  It is a cop out.  We are not meeting our responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I regret to have to disagree with the Minister, irrespective of the £5 million but the Bill with section 7 in it will not meet the requirements of the less well off and will give health boards the opportunity to opt out or discriminate against many people.  I am not satisfied.  I am registering my protest on section 7.</P>

      <P>What Senator Ryan said is serious but is not quite the case.  I am sure Senator Ryan, would settle for a commitment from the Minister, Deputy Treacy, to the Seanad on Report Stage not alone would elderly people get the subvention that is their right in an institution or nursing home but there will not be further delays.  We are aware that nursing homes that did not get subventions will get them from now on.  We understand section 7 quite well.  I would be satisfied if the Minister for Health, but particularly the Minister here present, could tell us (1)  that there will not be further delays in paying subventions in health board areas and (2)  that elderly people who have the right to subvention, whether it be in an institution in a health board area or in a private nursing home, will get the subvention.  That would satisfy me and it might satisfy my colleague, Senator John Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is worry about this section.  If <Col N="2081" /> the Minister gives his word, that is sufficient for me because I know him well. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Treacy, would make a commitment on Report Stage that, without changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; he will ensure that people who are entitled to subvention after this legislation goes through will get it and get it without delay.  We all know there is delay in paying subventions at the moment and that there are families suffering hardship. However, that would be dealt with on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill now before the House provides a framework for the improved conduct of industrial relations and for the resolution of trade disputes, with the aim of <Col N="2082" /> maintaining a stable and orderly industrial relations climate.  The Bill provides for major reform of the law on industrial relations, trade dispute and trade union law and for the establishment of a new Labour Relations Commission.</P>
      <P>The measures contained in this Bill have their immediate origin in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  This committed me to holding discussions with the social partners about changes in industrial relations to provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement and help to create conditions for employment-generating investment.</P>
      <P>In entering these discussions I was aware that many unsuccessful attempts had been made in the past to secure agreement on fundamental changes in trade dispute and industrial relations law. It was my view that any further attempt to secure complete agreement was unlikely to lead anywhere, given the respective positions and interests of employer and worker representatives.  I decided instead to identify a number of key areas which I considered needed attention.  On that basis I developed a package of proposals.  These addressed the major issues and were designed to improve the collective bargaining environment with a view to minimising conflict and maximising co-operation.  The detailed discussions which I subsequently held on the proposals with the social partners confirmed my view that this was the only way in which progress was likely to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before this House is the product of an exhaustive consultation process with both the Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is an amalgam of proposals which I put to both sides and suggestions by the parties.  The Bill has been the subject of very lengthy and in-depth debate in the Dáil over the past six months with Deputies from all parties acknowledging the importance of this legislation.  As would be expected in the case of legislation in this area there were, of course, differences of opinion on various aspects of the Bill.  I gave careful <Col N="2083" /> consideration to the views expressed and the Bill in its present form incorporates a number of amendments and suggestions made during the debate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the specific provisions of the Bill.  These range over a number of areas and can be divided broadly between trade union and industrial relations law.  Under the broad heading of trade union law there are provisions to reform trade dispute law; to introduce pre-strike secret ballots and restrict the use of injunctions in trade disputes, and to facilitate the further rationalisation of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Under the broad heading of industrial relations law I propose to establish a new Labour Relations Commission which will have responsibility for a wide range of functions, including the provision of conciliation and advisory services and the drawing up of codes of practice.</P>
    <P>There are also provisions to amend and improve the procedures governing the establishment and operation of joint labour committees and technical provisions to enable more effective enforcement of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements. I will now deal with each of these areas in turn.</P>
    <P>The statute law in relation to striking and picketing is primarily contained in the five section Trade Disputes Act, 1906, with a number of further provisions in the Trade Union Act, 1941 and the Trade Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1982. The law in this area is not as simple, however, as a reading of the Acts might suggest.  Since 1906 there has been a considerable volume of case law arising from the interpretation by the courts of the provisions of the Trade Disputes Act.</P>
    <P>As a result the law in this area has become extraordinarily complex and its precise limits vague and confusing.  The usefulness of the statute law in providing a guide to conduct is diminishing and it is increasingly necessary to look to case law.  I feel, however, that as far as possible, it is statute law rather than case law which should provide a clear indicator as <Col N="2084" /> to the boundaries of what is permissible and what is not permissible in trade dispute situations and it is my intention that the Bill should resolve this position.</P>
    <P>My approach in the area of trade dispute law is to repeal the Trade Disputes Acts of 1906 and 1982 and to reintroduce the main provisions of these acts with amendments.  An important by-product of this approach is to give the legislation a clear presumption of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>Taken in the order in which they appear in the Bill the main features of the provisions relating to trade disputes are that: the definition of trade dispute is being amended to exclude worker versus worker disputes; the immunities will no longer apply to disputes involving one worker where procedures have not been followed; picketing will be confined to an employer's place of business and the present wording whereby picketing can take place &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; a particular location will be changed to &ldquo;at or where that is not practicable at the approaches to&rdquo;; secondary picketing will be permissible only in situations where workers have a reasonable belief that the second employer has acted in a way likely to frustrate a strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their employer; an anomaly whereby organising a strike is protected by the immunities but threatening to organise or take part in a strike would appear not to be protected is being cleared up; in future the immunity enjoyed by trade unions in respect of tortious acts shall apply only in the case of acts committed in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute; unions will be required to have a rule in their rule books providing for the holding of secret ballots before engaging in or supporting a strike or other industrial action; in trade dispute situations where a secret ballot has been held and notice given the granting of injunctions, particularly <i>ex parte</i> injunctions, will be restricted.</P>
    <P>I would like to go into a number of these proposed changes in some more detail.  In any discussion of trade dispute law, picketing is likely to be a central issue.  This is not surprising.  From the <Col N="2085" /> worker's point of view the picket represents the most formidable and effective means at his or her disposal to bring pressure to bear on the employer.  Similarly in the case of the employer, the picket represents the most fundamental threat to the continuation and operation of his other business.</P>
    <P>The picketing provisions of this Bill seek to strike a balance between the rights and interests of both sides.  In the case of primary picketing, I am moving away from the present definition which permits picketing &ldquo;at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be&rdquo;&mdash; which I am sure Senators will agree is extremely broad &mdash; to the revised definition, &ldquo;at or where this is not practicable at the approaches to a place where their employer carried on business&rdquo;.  The intention is to ensure that in future picketing will be at the employer's place of business.</P>
    <P>However, because of the position in relation to private property rights and the need to avoid trespass on private property, there may be circumstances where it will not be possible to picket directly at the employer's premises.  For example, where a dispute arises affecting one employer in a shopping centre, industrial complex <i>et cetera</i> it should be possible to secure agreement that the picket be placed at the individual employer's business rather than at the entry to the complex. It is necessary, however, to provide a saver for situations where this turns out not to be practicable or possible.</P>
    <P>As far as secondary picketing is concerned, the Bill will regulate such picketing more closely and define secondary picketing in clearly understood industrial relations terms.  Secondary picketing, that is, picketing at the place of business of an employer other than an employer involved in a trade dispute, will be lawful only where the workers in dispute have a reasonable belief that the second employer has directly assisted the employer who is party to the dispute for the purpose of frustrating the strike or other industrial action.  There have been strong demands from the employers side <Col N="2086" /> for the total outlawing of secondary picketing but I believe that to do so would tilt the balance unfairly in favour of employers.</P>
    <P>The secret ballot provisions which I consider to be among the most important in the Bill will require every union to have a pre-strike secret ballot rule in its rule book within two years of the passing of the Bill.  Among other things, the rule will require that all union members, whom it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for the union concerned to believe will be called on to engage in a strike or other industrial action, be entitled to vote on whether or not to engage in industrial action.  Failure to include the secret ballot rule in the union rules within the two year period specified will lead to loss of a union's negotiating licence.  It should be remembered that many unions already have pre-strike ballot rules and the holding of secret ballots is normal good practice. The provisions in the Bill are designed to ensure that this good practice is extended to all unions, thus promoting greater order in the conduct of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The provisions on injunctions are closely linked to those on secret ballots. Where a secret ballot has been held and at least one week's notice of industrial action has been given, the employer will not be entitled to seek an injunction without giving notice to the union and the workers concerned.  This is to remedy the abuse of injunctions by some employers in trade disputes.  The granting of <i>ex parte</i> injunctions, often in a judge's home outside court hours, has been a matter of considerable concern to trade unions for a long time.  The Bill also provides that interlocutory injunctions will not be granted where in addition to having a secret ballot and giving notice, the union establishes a fair case that it was acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  These restrictions on the granting of injunctions will not apply in the case of trespass, damage to property or action likely to cause death or personal injury.</P>
    <P>Injunctions are often sought by employers as a bargaining tool and not <Col N="2087" /> for the purpose for which they were intended, namely, to maintain the <i>status quo</i> until a full court hearing can be arranged.  Trade dispute cases rarely come to a full hearing.  The changes being provided for are designed to reduce recourse to the law courts in industrial relations disputes, while permitting injunctive relief in cases involving trespass, obstruction and so on, thus ensuring that injunctions are stil available in genuinely serious situations.  The new arrangements will also provide a strong incentive to trade unions to hold secret ballots and give appropriate notice of proposed industrial action to employers.</P>
    <P>In the period since the publication of the Bill there has been a considerable amount of comment about the position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions all-out picket under the new balloting arrangements.  Some commentators have suggested that under the new provisions it would no longer be possible for the ICTU to operate the all-out picket.  This is not the case.  The ICTU all-out picket mechanism has been a source of order and restraint and has been conducive to the resolution of a number of disputes.  It would, I believe, be a retrograde step if this mechanism was lost.  The all-out picket arrangements can continue to operate subject only to the union involved balloting their members.  I think it is a fundamental right that workers would be entitled to a say in whether they wish to be involved in a dispute.  To clear up any doubts which may have existed, the Bill now contains a provision which makes direct reference to the position of the ICTU and the all-out picket.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the provisions in relation to trade union rationalisation. It has long been a policy of Ministers for Labour to encourage the rationalisation of the trade union movement. Some progress has been made in reducing the number of unions from 95 in 1970 to 68 today.  Despite the rationalisation which has taken place in recent years there are still far too many unions in Ireland.  This is bad for industrial relations as it gives rise to inter-union <Col N="2088" /> rivalry, a multiplicity of bargaining units and demarcation disputes.  The multiplicity of small unions is also bad for members as such unions cannot provide the wide range of services required in today's working environment.</P>
    <P>The amendments to trade union law provided for in the Bill are designed to encourage mergers between unions and discourage the formation of new or breakaway unions.  The Trade Union Acts, 1975, permitted the introduction of a system of grants towards expenses incurred by unions in a successful merger. The prospect of a merger attempt being unsuccessful and the associated expenses can deter smaller unions from attempting mergers.  I am providing that unions which attempt a merger, but which fail in the attempt, may claim expenses relating to the two year period prior to the failure.  This will, I hope, help to accelerate the trend towards union rationalisation.</P>
    <P>A further proposed change involves the doubling of the membership requirement for a new union seeking a negotiation licence from 500 to 1,000 members and a substantial increase in the level of the High Court deposit required by such a union.  While the present membership and deposit requirements which were provided for in the Trade Unions Act, 1971, have worked well to forestall the establishment of small, poorly financed or breakaway unions in areas already serviced or capable of being serviced by existing unions, experience in recent years suggests that some tightening of the requirements is necessary.  The changes in the Bill are aimed at strengthening the trade union movement and improving the effectiveness of collective bargaining for union members.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations law and institutional reform I would now like to turn my attention to the other major part of this Bill, and particularly to the provisions dealing with the machinery for the resolution of disputes.  The major institution in this area is the Labour Court which was established by Seán Lemass in 1946.  While the court has served Irish industrial relations well there is now a <Col N="2089" /> clear need for a change in the structure and approach of our official dispute setting services.  All structures need to be assessed and re-examined from time to time and to say that there is a need for change in the dispute resolution structures is not to take from the major contribution which the court has made.  What are provided for in the Bill are measures designed to enhance the contribution which the State machinery can make to the resolution of disputes and to the overall improvement of industrial relations. In particular, the proposals recognise the great contribution which the Labour Court has made and aim at improving and enhancing its status.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed shift the main responsibility for dispute prevention and resolution back where it properly belongs, that is, with the parties themselves. The Labour Court has become a court of first resort rather than the final, authoritative tribunal in industrial relations matters which it should be and which it was always intended that it should be.</P>
    <P>The changes which the Bill provides for in relation to the dispute resolution machinery have four principal objectives: to give a new general responsibility for the promotion of better industrial relations to an appropriate body; to encourage and facilitate a more active approach to dispute prevention and resolution; to restore the original purpose and status of Labour Court investigation and recommendations; and to make provision for a number of new functions and services.</P>
    <P>The major change provided for is the establishment of a new Labour Relations Commission guided by a tripartite council, with employer, trade union and independent representation.  In addition to the overall responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations, the commission will have a wide range of functions including the provision of conciliation and advisory services and the development of codes of practice.  The Equality Service and the Rights Commissioner Service will in future act as independent units of the commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2090" /> One of the main reasons for establishing the commission is to have a body specifically charged with the primary responsibility for the promotion of better industrial relations.  The commission will be well placed to make public pronouncements on industrial relations practices and procedures which need to be changed and to call for legislative or other changes if necessary.  The commission will also be able to highlight examples of good practice and encourage others to adopt similar practices.</P>
    <P>Its pronouncements will carry the authority of a tripartite body and the collective experience of respected experts drawn from the industrial relations field. This promotion of good industrial relations will also be advanced through many of the commission's activities, such as the provision of an advisory service, the preparation of codes of practice and the offering of guidance on such codes, conducting and commissioning research and reviewing and monitoring developments.</P>
    <P>A second major objective in establishing the commission is to encourage and facilitate a more active approach to dispute prevention and resolution.  A previous attempt to broaden the role of the conciliation service within the Labour Court structure had little effect.</P>
    <P>The commission will attempt to bring about a change in attitudes so that the responsibility for dispute resolution is shifted back to the parties themselves where it primarily belongs.  The attainment of this end will entail a reappraisal by trade unions and employers, especially those who are still attracted to the option of adjudication, of their attitude towards dispute resolution.  If a dispute cannot be resolved at the workplace then an industrial relations officer of the commission will facilitate the parties to reach a settlement on their own terms.  The parties should be more committed to an agreement that they have worked out together through negotiation than to an adjudication handed down by a third party.  The advisory service of the commission will also have an important role <Col N="2091" /> to play in the prevention of disputes but I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, one major objective in establishing the commission is to restore the original purpose and status of Labour Court investigation and recommendations.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of the 1960s the Labour Court issued about 100 recommendations each year.  Over the years since then there has been a dramatic rise in the number of recommendations issued.  The figure reached a peak of 1,045 in 1983, declining to 708 in 1988 and 646 in 1989.  Part of the explanation for the large increase in the number of recommendations issued by the Labour Court particularly during the 1970s can be attributed to the central role provided for the court in the resolution of issues which arose in the context of the various national wage agreements.</P>
    <P>It would appear that having developed the habit of referring matters to the court for adjudication the parties to disputes have found it difficult to revert to settling their own problems.  While the decline in the number of issues being referred to the court in recent years is to be welcomed, there are still too many recommendations being issued by the court on relatively trivial matters.  This can only damage the status and ultimately the acceptability of Labour Court recommendations.</P>
    <P>The increased emphasis given to conciliation through the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission should ensure that more cases are settled at conciliation and that fewer cases are heard by the court.  Untimately, as the parties take more responsibility for their own disputes, there should be a decline in the number of conciliation cases too.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the court will not normally investigate a dispute unless it receives a report from the commission to the effect that the commission is satisfied that no further efforts on its part will advance the resolution of the dispute. The court should as a result become a genuine court of last resort in industrial relations rather than a court of almost automatic recourse as at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2092" /> On new functions and services and particularly the advisory service, I have referred already to the fact that the commission will undertake research and will review and monoitor developments in the industrial relations area.  The commission will also provide an advisory service. There is an important role for a small strategic State provided advisory service concentrating on areas giving rise to recurring industrial relations unrest where impartial advice from a third party acceptable to management and unions could help to resolve deep seated industrial relations problems.</P>
    <P>Too easy access to the Labour Court has in the past meant that in some cases there has been no examination of underlying problems at workplace level which can give rise to frequent disputes.  It is the intention that where organisations with industrial relations problems come to the notice of an industrial relations officer the officer will be able to suggest that the parties seek the help of the advisory service to be provided by the commission. The advisory service will be in a position to help management and unions in individual employments to examine and review some or all of their industrial relations practices.</P>
    <P>The commission will also be charged with drawing up codes of practice in consultation with interested parties.  I see this as being a very important task for the commission and it is my intention that codes of practice should provide a valuable source of guidance for employers and trade unions on particular issues.  The preparation of codes is closely related to the commission's function of promoting good industrial relations and improving industrial relations practices.  Failure to observe a code will not render anyone liable to proceedings, but provisions of a code will be admissible in evidence to a court or industrial relations agency.</P>
    <P>The commission will be able to prepare codes on subjects chosen by itself or at my request.  It is my intention as soon as the commission is established to suggest priority issues on which codes should be prepared.  These issues include: a dispute procedure setting out the procedural <Col N="2093" /> stages to be followed before industrial action is taken; provision of information to and consultation with employees on the activities of the undertaking and on decisions likely to affect employees; levels of cover to be provided in the case of disputes in essential services; and protection and facilities for workers' representatives in the company.</P>
    <P>Other issues on which codes might be successfully prepared are individual grievance procedures, and disciplinary procedures.  The list is not exhaustive and the commission will no doubt have its own proposals in relation to codes of practice.</P>
    <P>When a code has been drawn up I will be empowered to promulgate it in a statutory instrument thus underlying its status and importance but without creating new legal obligations for employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>As regards joint labour committees the Bill contains provisions to improve the procedures governing their operation and establishment.  There are also a number of technical provisions to improve the enforcement of the terms of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  I would hope that the improvements in relation to joint labour committees and employment regulation orders will make the committees more effective.  They will also make it easier and more attractive for low paid workers to seek to have new committees established or to seek the registration of agreements.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the range of measures provided for in this Bill will make an important contribution to industrial relations in this country.  A stable industrial relations environment is crucial if the country is to realise its full economic and employment potential. The creation of new employment and the preservation of existing jobs remains the number one priority.  The success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> demonstrates the advantages of a consensual approach to the attainment of common goals.  I am confident that with the commitment and goodwill of all sides <Col N="2094" /> a further programme can be put in place which together with the measures provided for in this Bill will ensure the development and maintenance of industrial relations peace for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations peace is vital for a sustained improvement in economic activity and employment creation.  It enhances Ireland's reputation as a good location for inward investment.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has made a positive contribution to the economic and social well being of the country.  The Industrial Relations Bill, when enacted, will be another important element in ensuring a better industrial relations environment.  Its contribution will be all the more important and necessary with the advent of the Single European Market and the opportunities and challenges which this will present</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister for Labour to the House.  I commend the Minister on his efforts to date particularly in relation to the Waterford Glass dispute.  We all hope there will be a fruitful and satisfactory outcome. We have noted the Minister's statement today in relation to the ongoing dispute at the <i>Irish Press</i>.  He would have the support of the House, particularly the Members on this side, in any efforts to resolve that difficult matter at this critical and late stage.  However he may not want to add further to what he has already stated today.</P>
      <P>All of us welcome the Bill before the House which was the result of many discussions and much research to get the right framework.  Anyone interested in our economic prosperity will welcome anything that will improve and sustain good industrial relations.  It is fair to say that there has been an improvement in this area in recent times.  This has come about because of various reasons but if that improvement can be maintained or improved further, all the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on my side of the House support the main thrust of the Bill but on Committee Stage we may put down <Col N="2095" /> several amendments.  We recognise the importance of having good industrial relations in order to attract outside investment.  In the light of 1992, it is important for our economic development to sustain good industrial relations.  All too often in the past unfortunately there were strikes for various reasons.  There was fault on both sides.  There have been problems with management who, at times, failed to recognise or foresee difficulties and the problem gradually worsened. Sometimes that led to closures. There have also been problems on the other side where strikes may be called too quickly or for what would appear to reasonable people to be trivial reasons.  I do not want to dwell on that.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to these issues and it is important to state that.  We must learn from our mistakes and not repeat them.  We should have certain procedures and guidelines and a good industrial relations policy that would ensure that, as far as possible, strikes would be a last resort.  Strikes cause inconvenience to the public and damage the economy.  The Minister said discussions took place with the social partners to arrive at a new framework that would strike a fair balance and which would, as far as possible, be acceptable to both sides.</P>
    <P>We have antiquated legislation some of which dates back to the 1800s and early 1900s.  I have made the point before that legislation should be periodically reviewed.  Far too often we have Bills 16 or 17 years old being amended or repealed.  That has been a problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to strike a fair balance in relation to reforming trade dispute law, having pre-strike secret ballots and so on. It is very important to restrict the use of injunctions.  There has been recourse to the courts when, in many cases, matters could have been resolved by using other frameworks.  It is wrong to ask a High Court judge at his breakfast table to grant an injunction or to get him up out of bed to grant one.  There are obviously cases where this is necessary, for example, where personal rights are being seriously infringed as happened last week where <Col N="2096" /> an injunction was sought at the last minute to stop someone being deported &mdash; but in relation to labour law and strikes, etc., there should be certain procedures to which both sides would adhere and injunctions by and large, should be sought as a last resort.</P>
    <P>In relation to the operation of the Labour Court and the new Labour Relations Commission, I agree that the Labour Court should do what it was set up to do and be used as a last resort rather than as a place where one goes on the first day of a dispute.  That may be an oversimplification of the case but we seem to skip a lot of other procedures, rules and regulations and suddenly head for the Labour Court.  I hope that with a better framework disputes will be thrashed out and discussed between the people involved.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he will let us know if it is envisaged that the commission will not just be another layer of bureaucracy but will sort out these disputes at an early stage without the parties having to go to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister's figures in relation to the number of cases heard before the court.  It is a very necessary and useful tool in the whole area of industrial relations but it should not be a case of people suddenly heading for it.  It is important that discussions be entered into and that there be a recognised set of procedures in relation to notice of ballots, secret ballots, and so on together with a code of practice drawn up by the commission in conjunction with the social partners.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Labour Court be a court of last resort rather than one where matters are dealt with immediately. It is also important that there be full discussion in relation to matters such as pay, practices, conditions, privileges and rights and in relation to various work practices prior to someone going to the Labour Court.  Very often, cases are settled before they reach the High Court and that should be the way with the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>We welcome the main thrust of the Bill.  The Minister has acknowledged that <Col N="2097" /> some amendments were introduced at the instigation of our spokesman in the Dáil, Deputy Jim Mitchell.  We have a common purpose and that is to produce a framework for industrial relations that will see us into the next century.  Hopefully, we will attract further investment and strikes will not be par for the course. This is important because at times we had strikes which gave the country a bad name and hurt many innocent people.</P>
    <P>Our main aim in all of this is to improve industrial relations and achieve economic prosperity.  It was disturbing last week to see the latest unemployment figures and if we do not have the right industrial relations policy they will not get any better.  I do not want to dwell on those figures but they are disturbing for this time of the year.  I am sure the Minister is as concerned as everybody else.</P>
    <P>Akin to a good industrial relations policy and conditions is the whole question of pay and taxation.  It does not matter how much pay one is on, the question is how much can one take home and how far will it go.  You can have the greatest industrial relations policy but if people cannot survive on their take-home pay, that is of little use.  I am sure the Minister would be one of the first to recognise that taxation policy and the policy in relation to job creation are relevant to the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>When does the Minister envisage that the commission will be set up?  The functions of the commission are set out in section 25.  It may well be a substitute for the Minister intervening in disputes. While it will always be necessary and welcome to have a Minister who can literally get the parties together, the commission will be able to report before matters are referred to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will confirm that full discussions will take place with the various social partners prior to people being appointed to the commission so that the right people are appointed to the satisfaction of the various social partners. Will staff be transferred either from the Minister's Department or from the Labour Court to the commission?  Can he assure us that the money will be there to <Col N="2098" /> set up and service this commission and that it will not just be another layer of bureaucracy?  Not too long ago the Ombudsman &mdash; an office we all recognise has done a lot of good &mdash; found his work load was getting bogged down.  We have seen a similar situation with the commission looking at Garda complaints.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance that there will be sufficient funding for and personnel in the commission.</P>
    <P>It is grand bringing in a Bill like this but if there is a shortage of staff it will not work.  We do not want to see the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission saying he has no staff and cannot investigate complaints.  The commission's role could be exceedingly important in investigating and hopefully resolving disputes.  It is important that the commission, if it is to do its job properly, be given some finance, muscle and teeth.  Can the Minister assure us that adequate personnel and money will be provided?  We do not want to build a totally new empire but we want the basic oil in the machine to keep it running.</P>
    <P>It is also important that when the codes of practice under section 42 are being drawn up that the present codes of practice be examined and reviewed.  There must be full discussion on such matters as dispute procedures, information that is given to one side or another, protection of workers, codes of practice as to how grievances are dealt with, disciplinary procedures and so on.  If we get it right at the beginning a lot of good could come out of it.  If there are problems and if both sides do not get a full hearing there will be difficulties.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the labour commission should be one of prevention.  It should try to anticipate problems.  We have seen long strikes where after a certain stage the strikers have nearly forgotten the original problem.  Strikes have to end one way or the other, hopefully with a resolution.  All Members whether they were involved in labour law or not, recognise the problems and difficulties. Everyone wants to see problems resolved because that is in the interests of their future and the future of their children.  It <Col N="2099" /> is easier to work in peace than with a lot of rancour.</P>
    <P>It is important that when regulations, rules and codes of practice are being drawn up there should be a full discussion and an indepth research carried out.  If these regulations are to stand the test of time, they must have a good foundation. It is important to ensure that we have good industrial relations.  The main aim should be, as far as possible, to prevent strikes.  There have been some very damaging strikes.  There must be recognition at management level that workers cannot be taken for granted and full dialogue must take place.</P>
    <P>I agree that for the size of the country there are too many unions and there is a case to be made for fewer but stronger and bigger unions.  Anything that could be done in that area would receive our support.</P>
    <P>We welcome the main thrust of this Bill.  We welcome the intention behind it and hope that following its passage and the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission we will have in place a strong industrial relations framework and a strong plan that will resolve problems at an earlier stage.  Hopefully, also we will have in place practices which will sound an early alarm bell which will prevent fire brigade action at a later stage.  This is in all our interests.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on bringing forward this most important industrial relations legislation.  I also congratulate him on the excellent job he is doing as Minister for Labour and has done over the past three years.  Everyone will acknowledge that his is an extremely difficult area and he has shown outstanding ability.  It is an extremely complex and difficult area because you are not dealing with any other form of legislation or activity, you are dealing with human relations, for which it is extremely difficult to legislate.  You cannot legislate people into corners.  The Minister must <Col N="2100" /> be complimented for providing a framework where individual sectors, employers and employees will be in a position to settle their own grievances.  I reiterate the sentiments expressed by Senator Cosgrave in wishing the Minister well in his efforts to resolve current disputes.  Hopefully, there will be a fruitful resolution in the not-too-distant future.</P>
      <P>The legislation before us is designed to provide a better framework for collective bargaining and the settlement of disputes. It contains a number of extremely important clauses by way of changes in trade union law and in industrial relations generally.  There has been, with one or two notable exceptions, a tremendous level of co-operation and consensus in the area of industrial relations through the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>. People might be tempted to ask: why do we not leave well enough alone, why is there a need for change?  This legislation is designed to make an improvement in the law which will facilitate the better operation of our industrial relations system in the 1990s and into the next millennium.  As the Minister stated, there have been exhaustive discussions between him, his Department, the ICTU and the Confederation of Irish Industry, prior to the drafting of this legislation.  In all cases, the Minister went to extreme lengths to tease out the different areas before this legislation was brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now time to update the industrial relations legislation.  I do not think that can be questioned.  The present law relating to the trade unions was mainly enacted at the beginning of the century and the 1906 Trade Disputes Act provided a framework which allowed trade unions to grow and prosper.  As we speak at the moment, it is still the definitive legislation which governs trade union disputes in this country.  The 1906 Act affords legal protection to almost any industrial action taken by a group in a trade dispute.  The funds of trade unions are protected from all actions for damages. It is claimed that the law, which normally involves penalties for those who do not obey the legal rules, is unsuitable <Col N="2101" /> for resolving the human problems at the heart of industrial relations practice.  This is an extremely strong argument.</P>
    <P>Trade unions, because of their historical experience when they were developing both here and in Britain, are very suspicious of the law and understandably so.  In the first instance they had to fight for legal recognition when they were beginning to develop and form during the last century.  Secondly, they had to deal with a very prejudiced Judiciary at that time.  They made it abundantly clear what they thought of trade unions and what they thought of strikes. The trade union movement historically was up against it from the very start and they had to gain their status against extreme difficulty and odds.  In the present day the use of injunctions by employers in trade disputes and the support by the courts have also made the trade unions wary of the law as it stands. The problem is specifically addressed in the Bill.  As matters stand, legitimate picketing can be stopped by an <i>ex parte</i> injunction.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between trade union attitudes to the law on individual rights as opposed to collective rights. Unions are happy to accept a role for the law in the case of individual rights but they are rightly suspicious of changes in the law in relation to collective rights. People pushing for stronger laws than those contained in the Bill should remember that the vast majority of disputes are settled under existing procedures of free collective bargaining by direct negotiations between the parties themselves.</P>
    <P>The main objective of this Bill is to make changes that will improve aspects of our industrial relations system.  The changes in the law proposed in the Bill are designed to curb the risk of certain abuses.  It also aims to expand good industrial relations practices.  Industrial peace can become the norm only when trade unions, employers and employees are convinced that our industrial relations structure is fair, efficient and above suspicion.</P>
    <P>Of major importance in the Bill is section 1, dealing with picketing.  As the <Col N="2102" /> Minister mentioned, in making provision in relation to picketing it is extremely important &mdash; this refers particularly to places where there would be a number of establishments together, such as shopping centres and so on &mdash; that people not directly involved in disputes would not be inhibited in any way and that only the person specifically involved in the dispute would be subject to the picket.  That is extremely important.  It would be wrong and unfair, in a shopping centre with 15, 20, 30 or 40 different establishments, that all of the people there should suffer where only one person would be at fault, whether an employee or an employer.  I am not going to go into the difficulties there, but other people who are not directly involved should be protected.  I would like to compliment the Minister on that provision.</P>
    <P>The law relating to secondary picketing must be updated.  That is of paramount importance because the present legislation is very confusing in relation to secondary picketing.  The probability is, as the Minister stated, that the courts would have changed the present process if the Oireachtas had not tackled it.  That is very important.  Under the Bill the picketing of a second employer will be legal only where that employer helps in frustrating a primary strike.  The Minister in his speech said there was a strong lobby that secondary picketing should be abolished altogether.  I think the Minister has struck a very fair balance in this area.  It is only right that an employer who helps in frustrating a primary strike should have a picket on as well, because in essence that person is involving himself in that strike.</P>
    <P>The problem of inter-union disputes is one of the more delicate areas in industrial relations.  Such disputes can be extremely damaging and can result in substantial financial and other losses both to individuals and to the country.  I remember a factory giving substantial employment to a number of people from my own locality which, because of an inter-union dispute that lasted for quite a substantial period of time, had to close down with a resultant loss of jobs.  That <Col N="2103" /> had a tremendous affect on my own area. It is only when it comes to you at first hand that you realise the difficulties involved, how difficult it is to pick up jobs if you come from a rural area.  If you are in a large urban area there is the opportunity to have access to different jobs.  In a rural area if you are lucky enough to latch on to a particular job you hope you are going to hold on to that job for an indefinite period of time.</P>
    <P>These types of disputes could cause would-be investors to look elsewhere. This, again, would result in a loss of jobs. I know &mdash; and I think it is acknowledged &mdash; that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions do everything in their power to resolve inter-union disputes.  There are problems, not least where one union may not be a member of Congress.  This is a tremendous difficulty.  The Bill tackles the problem by removing immunity from worker versus worker disputes.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill deals with the area of secret ballots.  As the Minister said, it is probably one of the most imortant sections of the whole Bill.  Subsection (2) (a) states that:</P>
    <P>the union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike or other industrial action without a secret ballot, entitlement to vote in which shall be accorded equally to all members whom it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for the union concerned to believe will be called upon to engage in strike or other industrial action...</P>
    <P>That section continues in that vein.</P>
    <P>I think this is only right and proper.  I know we have all had experience of people who have difficulties in this area. It is important that each member of a union would be entitled to cast his or her vote in accordance with his or her views, and without undue pressure from others.  It will remove the feeling of intimidation felt by people who might not always agree with the proposals that are being voted on.  As the Minister said, it is relatively widespread practice now in quite a number of unions and it is only <Col N="2104" /> right and proper that it should spread to all of the other areas as well.</P>
    <P>Section 19, to a degree, is an extension of section 14 in that it provides that, where a secret ballot favours industrial action and the trade union gives at least one week's notice of strike to the employer, the employer may not apply to the court for an <i>ex parte</i> injunction without giving notice to the union.  Again, this is a very important development, and it underlines the necessity for secret ballots.  It protects the trade union from the long time inequity of <i>ex parte</i> injunctions. There is nothing more deplorable than the case where a trade union with a legitimate cause for a strike goes through the process of negotiations and then decides on a formal basis to call a strike, a strike that would be legitimate in every way, and the next thing in the middle of the night, an employer would get an <i>ex parte</i> injunction from some member of the court.  That is not right.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is a very important clause.  Each union will have two years to include the secret ballot as a clause in their rules and any union that does not comply will lose its negotiating licence.  I do not know if any union would quibble with that.  I think it is just, right and proper that each member of a trade union is entitled to and has a democratic right to a secret ballot.</P>
    <P>Another very important area is the Labour Court, which was set up in 1946 to provide a forum where industry in general could sort out its problems.  As the Minister said, it was never intended to be a court in the true sense of the word.  Each party is free to accept or reject the Labour Court's recommendations. I have heard people argue about this.  There is a feeling or suggestion abroad that this voluntary system is a weakness in the court structure.  I should emphasise that the court does not enforce the law.  As I see it, that is one of the main advantages of the Labour Court, because if there was a question of enforcement the Labour Court would be far less attractive for deciding disputes and people would have little or no recourse to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> The Labour Court has had an outstanding record since its foundation in 1946.  It has at all times recognised the complexities of union interaction and has approached problems in a very understanding and very patient manner.  Its success is due in no small way to the attitude and the commitment of the officers and the staff of the Labour Court who have served through the years.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I would like to say a word of appreciation and congratulation to all of those officers, who as I said, have to do an extremely difficult job.  The area of industrial relations is extremely complex. They do a fantastic job.  They have patience.  One thing you must have as a negotiator in the Labour Court is an extreme and unending flow of patience.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the court was intended to be a court of last resort.  He gave statistics showing that many disputes have been referred to the court without going through procedures initially intended.  The Bill addresses that particular problem and emphasises the need for parties to resolve their differences directly if at all possible.  There is an old adage that prevention is better than cure. Senator Cosgrave referred to this.  He said he would like to see some form of prevention, where parties would come in before disputes would arise in the first place.  The Bill provides for that type of development and it is indeed a very important aspect of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to set up a Labour Relations Commission which will be responsible for the existing conciliation service.  This commission will again emphasise that the court is, as it was intended to be, a court of last resort and that we get back to the situation where that pertained in the first instance.  The commission will also be the key body in the promotion of good industrial relations.  It will monitor and review developments in the area of industrial relations and the provision of an independent advisory service by the commission is a very welcome development. The fact that it is an independent advisory service is very welcome, because people will seek access to that advisory service <Col N="2106" /> without any fear that it would be favouring one side or the other.  I would hope, therefore, that when the advisory service is set up all sections would avail of it.  It would be a tremendous asset in the whole area of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives responsibility to the Labour Relations Commission for another very important area &mdash; the drafting of codes of practice in consultation with the relevant parties.  I believe that the implementation of codes of practice in the interest of good relations can be of immense benefit.  I do not think employers have anything to fear from implementing a code of practice that will acknowledge the contribution of employees and confirm them as a integral part of an organisation.</P>
    <P>Employees should be seen as part of a team and the type of approach envisaged in setting a code of practice would recognise that fact.  If an attitude was created where employers would not be afraid to consult their employees, to have an open mind in relation to their activities <i>vis-à-vis</i> their employees, not to be trying to pull the wool over their eyes in relation to profits and so on, they would have a very important input in the whole area, even in relation to the boards of directors and that type of thing.  I know the Minister is very keen on the provision of worker directors.  This is an area the private sector should now consider very strongly within the whole framework of industrial relations.  It acknowledges the fantastic contribution that workers make. Without them we are nowhere, and it is important that people recognise that.  If that type of attitude was developed the rewards for all sides, both in terms of industrial peace and in the development of industry in general, would be absolutely enormous.</P>
    <P>A problem that has been referred to as a cause of concern as long as I can remember is the number of trade unions there are in this country.  As a teacher of business organisation at leaving certificate level, I can say without equivocation that in every standard text book on the subject of industrial relations one of the standard reasons given for the <Col N="2107" /> cause of trade union problems is the multiplicity of unions here.  It results in inter-union rivalry and competition between unions.  In this regard the amalgamation of the ITGWU and the FWUI into SIPTU is a major and most welcome step. I am also extremely glad, as a member of a teachers union myself and acknowledging the presence of the leader of one of the teachers unions here, that the teachers unions are moving in that direction. I welcome that development and I sincerely hope it moves along the path to amalgamation as soon as possible.  It will have my full support.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides grants.  It is very important that the Minister recognises how important amalgamations are because the Bill provides grants towards expenses incurred in merger negotiations between unions.  There are no real preconditions. Even where merger negotiations fail, the unions involved can claim expenses for the two years prior to that amalgamation failure.  The Minister is to be complimented on this progressive approach.</P>
    <P>Understandably, over the years because of the historical development of our industrial relations system, the &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; syndrome which underlines relations between unions and employers has been all too common.  I do not think this need be so.  With that mentality, no one is a winner; you have a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; situation.  There is an enlightened approach, which the Minister underlines in this Bill, where we do not seek to score off or outdo anyone, where we work as a team in the interests of all and where everyone is a winner.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have done an excellent job bringing forward this legislation.  As he has said, it has come before this House after long hours of negotiation between the different interested parties.  I reiterate his hope that there will be a new <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in the coming years because we have had outstanding success over the past number of years under the previous programme.  I welcome this Bill <Col N="2108" /> as innovative, forward looking and progressive legislation.  I commend the Minister for introducing it and I wish him every success with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue legislation.  To give credit where credit is due, the process of consultation has taken place exhaustively for a long period of time and without a shadow of a doubt all sides &mdash; the employers, the trade unions, the Department of Labour, and in particular the current Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern &mdash; have shown extraordinary commitment to get this legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>The nature of a discussion on a piece of legislation like this is, in many senses, negative.  We all know what we agree on and, therefore, the tendency in terms of amendments or discussions is to highlight those areas with which we have some difficulty and to raise questions on those areas where we do not agree and perhaps to propose amendments.  Therefore, I would like to stress, before going into any of that, that I welcome this legislation.  It is positive; it is long overdue.  In recent times I read again the Dáil debates that took place during the introduction by Seán Lemass of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act.  That was a particularly harrowing time for my union.  I intend reflecting somewhat on that when I get down to discussing those people who are workers in different sections under different definitions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think it is worthwhile recognising that the Minister in his opening presentation referred to this Bill as being the product of the current programme.  I think that is maybe stretching it a bit; I think, in fairness, it was underway before that, but perhaps it was hurried along through the discussions on the Bill.  It certainly was something that was under discussion for some period of time.  It has been true to say that the mutual recognition of the importance of the social partners has been extraordinarily important to the recovery this country has shown over the past period of years.  I believe, unfortunately, the trade union movement has taken the brunt of the <Col N="2109" /> criticism in many cases.  Having arrived at positions through proper negotiation, time and again we get pasted with the worst end of it.</P>
    <P>I will give a very simple example, for the information of the House.  This is something I previously outlined to the Minister.  In regard to the side agreements that arise on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the one I know best is that concerning the basis of the staffing of schools.  The Department of Education have an abominable habit nowadays. When they are rejecting an application for extra staffing to a primary school they will write out letters &mdash; and I have seen one as late as this morning &mdash; saying that because of the agreement between the Government and the INTO we are now not able to sanction an extra staff member for the school.  To me that is the essence of bad industrial relations, that is the essence of pettiness.  That is where a lack of trust begins and that is where difficulties are created.  I would not mind if it were on the other side of it, that when the Minister was sanctioning a post they would say: &ldquo;I am happy to let you know that because of the agreement between the Government and the INTO we are able to sanction an appointment in your school.&rdquo;  That, of course, is not what happens.  That is the kind of pettiness that operates and creates trouble down the line for people.</P>
    <P>I am not in any sense setting that charge at the Minister for Labour because I know he has always shown a lot more sense and sensitivity in dealing with these things and that this would not arise in his section.  It is something I have to cope with every day of the week.  I resent it deeply &mdash; that when there is bad news it is the union's fault and the good news is the Government's gift.  To add fuel to the flames, schools are mostly informed of extra staffing by a visit or a letter or a phone call from the Government TD or Senator for the area.  I find that more than appalling.  I find it unacceptable. It is &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; politics of the worst kind.</P>

      <P>I am a realist and a pragmatist. It is there and I will point it out. I will highlight it.  I will ridicule it but I can do no more than that.</P>
      <P>We have developed over a period of years.  The trade union movement is a highly sophisticated, responsible organisation. It represents workers at all levels from the highest to the lowest.  The importance of its role in Irish society is clearly recognised &mdash; certainly by the Minister for Labour &mdash; and always has been.  I have no hesitation in putting it that widely.  Unfortunately, there is still a very negative view of the trade union movement in many places, not least among Members of the Houses of Parliament. I have certainly come across quite a lot of it.  There is still out there the view that trade unions have the job of keeping people in employment who should not be in employment, that the trade union movement's objective in life is to keep the bad worker in the job.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>The developments over the last period of years have indicated that trade unions take an increasing interest in the product at the end of the day.  I use that word in its widest sense.  One of the major objectives of my own union, the INTO, and I know it is the same for my colleagues in the ASTI and the TUI, is to improve and develop the educational service and to give the best possible service to the country.  that has to be the case. In January 1988, when the Minister for Labour introduced the Worker Participation Bill, I spoke of the need for workers to be interested in the problems of their company, that nothing created more problems in the work place than the sudden news that the company was going down the tubes, that there were going to be redundancies when everybody was suddenly in a panic, whereas the sharing and the distribution of information over a period of time before that would have had everybody dealing with the same problem, concerned to find a solution and would have created more of an agreed position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> I also feel that the trade union movement itself is of value to the country and it is a movement that has time and again helped to resolve problems.  One of the side aspects which I, as an incoming trade union general secretary would be very aware of, is the cost that has been imposed on unions by some of the legislation here.  Secret ballots are going to be a costly exercise for many unions.  I am not saying we should avoid it from that point of view.  I am just making the case that all the developments, even in terms of the law here, create more and more cost for unions.  Unions now spend a huge amount of money per year on legal costs. What I welcome more than anything else about this Bill is the attempt by the Minister to exclude the law courts from industrial relations.  The law courts have no place in industrial relations.  They should not be used, abused or introduced like they have been.  It has become like a circus over the last 15 years.  I do not think it is going to work.  I am not blaming the Minister for that, I am not blaming the trade unions for that, nor am I blaming the employers for that.  Our law is so complicated that I do not honestly think it is going to work, though I applaud the attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>As a rule I have excluded within my own union the representation of lawyers in domestic tribunals which in the first place were set up to be dealt with by unions. It has given myself great personal pleasure to take on lawyers in these domestic tribunals, because the reality is that any half-baked trade union official will know ten times more about the operation of the job or of the conditions of service than any lawyer.  I love to see a lawyer on the other side of the table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with some aspects of the rising financial cost to the trade union movement of supplying a service to their members.  I think the Government of the day should be mindful of the fact that even something as simple <Col N="2112" /> as the proposal to insist on a secret ballot does increase substantially the costs of unions in an industrial action.  I am not using that as an argument against it, I am just using it as an illustration of the kind of costs they can run into.</P>
      <P>There are various aspects of this Bill. I will be referring to the internal domestic remedies and whether they have been exhausted in the case of individual members.  Many of these things are going to call for more legal advice.  I was saying before the sos that whereas I welcome the Minister's and the Government's intention to try to remove the courts of law from industrial relations, I did not think we had the remotest possibility of success in this area.  I think the lawyers will see this as an opportunity to make a killing.  More and more of the resources and finances of unions are being eroded by legal costs in terms of advice, of representation and otherwise.</P>
      <P>There is one area in which we have lost out.  The Minister is very committed to an organised workforce.  Irish Governments over a period have seen the value of an organised workforce.  However, one of the real difficulties we have is with multinationals coming in and more and more problems are being created by multinational and international companies who insist on non-union workplaces.  I am not saying that we should make it a condition that they would organise, but what worries me is that a lot of Irish people think that is very smart and very clever.  All it actually does is to lead to the exploitation of our own people.  At the end of the day it is in everybody's interests to have proper, responsible and effective representation of workers.  The reality is that the patronage which is being given by some of these sweet international and multinational employers goes very sour indeed when we have workers very poorly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Secretary of Congress, Peter Cassells, recently gave an example of the shop on the corner, that is, the 7-Eleven chain of stores who refused to employ organised trade union labour.  I have raised this with many people in general conversation, not at public meetings, <Col N="2113" /> to assess reaction.  Very many people think this is a very smart move.  What they are actually doing, and this happens in every case, is bringing in cheap labour. This goes back to the very basis of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Companies like that which are irresponsible enough to insist that their workforce do not become organised are not doing anybody a favour because they are trying to undercut the competition in a most unfair way.  I believe that should be considered by the Government as a form of unfair competition because, in reality, the mentality which says if they are prepared to work for it they are getting enough, does not really wear.  You will always find people to work no matter what amount of money you offer, and I think the idea of a fair wage for a fair day's work is something we should look at.  A national minimum wage would certainly deal with some of those issues in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The question of industrial action is dealt with in section 8 of the Bill.  I have read the definition of industrial action and I do not understand it.  It is in very simple English but I still do not understand what it might not mean.  I can understand what it might mean but I do not understand exactly what it might not mean.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Industrial action&rdquo; means any action which affects, or is likely to affect, the terms or conditions, whether express or implied, of a contract and which is taken by any number or body of workers acting in combination or under a common understanding as a means of compelling their employer, or to aid other workers in compelling their employer, to accept or not to accept terms or conditions of or affecting employment.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what that means.  I am sure this has been debated in the other House but I have not read the debate in the other House because I always find it distracts me from what I want to say here. Maybe the Minister has been through this a million times.  Certainly I have read the newspaper reports on aspects of it and it <Col N="2114" /> seems to me that a work to rule is not a breach of contract.  A work to rule, for instance, is an application of a contract. Is a work to rule industrial action?  I am sorry if the Minister has been asked this question many times before, I suspect he may well have been, but I do not know that he has and I do not know what answer he has given.  I just need to be informed and I want it quite clear in my mind.</P>
    <P>I make a very clear distinction between industrial action and strike action and I cannot find the reference to this in the Minister's speech today.  But I notice in one part of his speech today that there is an interchange between industrial action and strike action and then just simply strike action in another place.  The two are quite different.  I am making the point that I was quite aware of that when I was reading the Minister's speech.  I will not go back over it but it is there.</P>
    <P>I think the phrase he used was &ldquo;the need for secret ballots for strike action&rdquo;. Is he using this as a justification for what is in section 8?  I do not have a problem with secret ballots for strike action &mdash; I will deal with those later &mdash; but I do have a problem with the general idea of a secret ballot for industrial action.  I think there are lots of problems with that.  First, the Minister is pushing people over the edge because he is saying that if we are going to have a ballot we will make it serious action unless certain things can take place, like a work to rule or work to contract.  A work to contract is not a breach of contract and I do not see how it would be operable.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier I think many aspects of this Bill are going to be tested in the courts again and again and that is certainly one of them.  I want to make my own views clear on it.  I believe the traditional strike weapon is now outmoded. It is ineffective in many ways.  The total withdrawal of labour for an undetermined period of time is no longer a successful and efficient way for trade unions to carry out their business.  That is a personal view.  Nowadays the battle is won in the hearts and minds of people, it is won in the media, in the pubs, the <Col N="2115" /> lounges and the sittingrooms.  Nowadays it is a matter of convincing people of the worth of one's argument and I take that view.  I do not have a difficulty with the question of a secret ballot.  Maybe that is because my own union, the INTO, has had a secret ballot for industrial action for years, for as long as I can remember. I take the view that if right is on your side, as it should be before taking strike action, then you will be able to convince the members of that and you will get the vote if that is what is necessary.  I am speaking as a trade union official on that point.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister in his response to deal comprehensively with this issue of industrial action as opposed to strike action.  Is work-to-rule an industrial action?  I do not believe it is.  Industrial action is any action which affects the terms or conditions of a contract.  I am leaving out the extra clauses.  A work-to-rule would not affect the contract in the sense that somebody could not be suspended or action could not be taken against a person for working to rule because that person would be working to the terms of his or her contract.  I would like a comprehensive response from the Minister to that and it will be important to place it on the record as well.  If workers decide, for example, that they are not going to do overtime and they are not required under their contract to do overtime, work unsocial hours or so on, what happens in such situations?</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill is the 1906 Act in the new terminology.  It removes the liability for certain acts under the 1906 Act.  I could speak at some length on that but I wish to make just one brief statement on it.  I have been appalled since we set up the Free State by the difference of interpretation of that Act by the Governments in the two states; the very broad and liberal interpretation that has been undertaken of that Act, particularly in the definition of a worker, in the English and Welsh courts.  I am not sure about Scotland as they have a different court system there.  Their interpretation of a worker was far more liberal <Col N="2116" /> and the protections under that Act were far more liberal than was the case here. That Act had to be amended at some stage.  In the seventies or at the beginning of the eighties we had much discussion on it in order to extend the protection.  I was very conscious of the fact that teachers at that time were not covered.</P>
    <P>In the section of the Bill it is protection against action for tort and it is an immunity against the tort of procuring a breach of contract of employment which is straightforward enough, an immunity against the tort of intimidation etc. and an immunity against the tort of interferring with a trade or business and various things like that.  Of course I welcome that.  This is very important but having had the sore experience of being at the receiving end of a breach of constitutional rights arising from industrial action at incredible cost, well publicised, to my union, I regret the fact that this legislation makes no attempt whatsoever to protect unions from actions for breach of constitutional rights arising from the withdrawal of labour, for instance, under the terms of the Act.  In other words, if a union complies with all the terms of this legislation, goes through all the steps and then decides to take industrial action and this gives rise to a case where, for instance, somebody takes a case for breach of constitutional rights, in other words of being deprived of primary education, which is guaranteed under the Constitution, in such a situation there is no protection whatsoever.  I would like some comment on that from the Minister in his response.  Here we have two constitutional rights &mdash; the right to work and, consequentally, the right not to work or to withdraw labour and there is also the right to free primary education.  If a court were to hold that the action of a teachers' union was to deprive somebody of their constitutional right let us say to free primary education, there is nothing in this legislation to protect the teachers' union involved.  That is just one example and there could be others also.  I would welcome the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>I like the optimism of section 15.  I suspect it was written by somebody who <Col N="2117" /> does not know the Registrar of Friendly Societies or who has never had to have a rule book processed through the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The committee of management or other controlling authority of a trade union shall, notwithstanding anything in the rules of the union, have power by memorandum in writing to alter the rules of the union so far as may be necessary to give effect to section 14.</P>
    <P>I will believe that when I see it.  I have no problems with it but I do not believe it will work.  The consequential changes in legislation are somewhere mentioned in the Bill but I cannot find them but I certainly want to hear where they are. I have not the slightest doubt that the Registrar of Friendly Societies would say: &ldquo;Sorry, I cannot do that under the powers in the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The normal situation in a union which wants to change its constitution is that it has first to send out notices to the branches before Christmas.  All the branches then have to issue notice of that change of rule to every individual member in time and before the agenda of the AGM to allow them to make any amendments.  The AGM in January will discuss them.  They are then put on the agenda for the annual congress at Easter but it then requires a two-thirds majority. They are the rules that have been implemented in my union and it is the same in most other unions and they have been endorsed by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I do not believe section 15 will run.</P>
    <P>To get a rule book through the Registrar of Friendly Societies at the moment is a long, wearing operation.  There is hardly a change in rule that does not come back for some assessment.  Many unions have three or four contacts a year with the registrar.  Where is the Minister empowered to do that?  The legislation that set up the Registrar of Friendly Societies was back in the last century but what changes have we made in order to allow that to take place?  There will be real problems with that section.  How does the Minister envisage it working?  I <Col N="2118" /> am certain if a union tries to do that next year the Registrar of Friendly Societies will send it back and say: &ldquo;That has not gone through the process&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister is saying &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in the rules of the union&rdquo; but that will not run with the registrar.  I have not the slightest doubt about that.  Even if the amending legislation is enacted it is going to create a huge conflict.  I look forward to that because we have had ins and outs with that office for a long number of years in trying to get things sorted out.</P>
    <P>In section 14 I very much welcome the recognition given to the ICTU.  I had long arguments with the Minister's colleague in a different Department during the discussion here on the Companies Bill where I particularly wanted the involvement of the unions as responsible partners to be duly recognised in legislation.  I welcome this development here.  It is important. However, I doubt if we will be able to get around the Registrar of Friendly Societies on it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the secret ballots, I do not have a difficulty with it, but I do have one problem.  It is a very practical one as somebody who has been in the situation.  I am reading 14 (2) (f) which states:</P>
    <P>as soon as practicable after the conduct of a secret ballot the trade union shall take reasonable steps to make known to its members entitled to vote in the ballot:</P>
    <P>(i)  the number of ballot papers issued,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the number of votes cast,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the number of votes in favour of the proposal,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the number of votes against the proposal, and</P>
    <P>(v)  the number of spoilt votes.</P>
    <P>If I am in the middle of a dispute and I go looking for industrial action and get support from my members for industrial action by 1 per cent, 51-49, there is not the slightest possibility that I would want <Col N="2119" /> to make that information public during the course of a dispute.  It would be damaging to my union, it would be damaging to my members, it would weaken my hand in negotiations and it would do nothing to improve industrial relations. Therefore, it has no place in the Bill if it means immediate.  I want to know can &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; be interpreted to mean at some stage following the dispute, for instance?  Why is there a requirement that that should be done?  Is it a requirement that it should be done during the course of the dispute or before the industrial action?  I would find it most impractical for that information to be made available to the adversary, to the enemy, during the course of a dispute.  I would refuse to do it.  It is like playing poker with your hand showing up and everybody else holding their cards to their chest.  It is not on.  Let us level the playing pitch.  I do not mind playing five card stud but I would like us all to be clear on what we are doing.</P>
    <P>There are very clear outlines in section 16, section 17 and so on about what happens to unions which do not comply with the set of regulations on secret ballots. There is another side to it.  What would happen &mdash; and this has happened in Britain on a number of occasions &mdash; if an official of a union was seen to interfere with the result of a secret ballot?  I am not saying up or down, for or against; I just want to know where the Bill stands on that particular point.  The reason I raise that point is that in the UK Transport and General Workers' Union last year they had to do a rerun of a ballot and it cost them about £0.5 million.  It was alleged there was interference by the union head office or by some branches of the union with the correct conduct of the ballot.  If we were to vote for the secret ballot, the details of how that might be carried out might have been fleshed out a bit more as to who does the counting and where it goes.  There are aspects of this that worry me somewhat.  If we are going to go into it, I would certainly like to have more constraints on it.</P>
    <P>I would like to address section 22 and <Col N="2120" /> the question of rationalisation.  I have a vested interest in this.  I see my colleague, Senator Joe Costello, currently President of the ASTI, who will have a similar interest in this.  The section deals with grants towards the expenses of amalgamations or transfers.  I just want to be clear about this.  The movement towards the amalgamation of unions is a slow and painstaking process.  I would like to hear the Minister in his response to Second Stage spell out for us whether there is a difference.  He used the words &ldquo;transfer of engagements&rdquo; in some cases and &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; in others.  Is there a difference between the two?  Are those words synonymous for the purposes of this legislation or are they separate? There could be many states of amalgamation before the actual transfer of engagements and I think that process could take longer than two years.  I would like to have the situation that would arise spelled out.</P>
    <P>If we take the case &mdash; one I have currently an interest in &mdash; of the three teacher unions, referred to earlier by Senator McKenna.  He, being a member of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, would have a very significant interest in that. The position is this.  The three teacher unions would be discussing at the moment the question of amalgamation, working closer together, and having the objective of creating at some stage some form of union structure incorporating all three unions.  The question of transfer of engagements might not arise for a long time.  In other words, if there are three unions there at the moment with certain areas of responsibility, let us say they have set up a superstructure, a structure over the existing structures, and that they were to give certain responsibilities to that superstructure &mdash; let us say the responsibility to negotiate pay and allowances, salary and allowances &mdash; at the moment the unions operate under the single system of salary and allowances and they work very closely together.  If they were to say, &ldquo;okay, we are now going to give you the authority to look after negotiations on behalf of the three unions on salary and allowances&rdquo;, that is <Col N="2121" /> not necessarily a transfer of engagements. What it means is that the three unions have now set up a further structure to deal with certain aspects of the work of the union, certain parts of the responsibility of the union.</P>
    <P>They might also say that this superstructure would look after the publications of the three unions and the benefits for union members because it would be easier to deal with them for all the unions than each union working separately.  This union might also look after, say, trade union training and education of members and things like that.  In this instance the three unions still exist and are still registered as bonded trade unions but they have set up an extra structure or tier which would, in effect, be doing the work which up to now was the responsibility of each individual union, but it would be subject to the individual unions as they still exist.</P>
    <P>That process might develop towards a closer confederation after a time and then to a closer federation with a written constitution, and then perhaps some sort of a closer structure beyond that where there would be some form of single union.  If that process takes longer than two years, it cannot be said to have failed obviously because it is still progressing but since it has taken longer than two years, at what stage does the Minister for Labour, sign the cheque on that particular one?  I would like to hear that teased out.  It is a real problem not just for the teacher unions but for any union that is going to take a period of time to move into it. To do something like this is going to be costly.  That is why I thoroughly support the idea of grants towards this kind of development.  It will not be cheap but it is going to take a lot of time and extra personnel and I would want to be clear about how the money is going to be paid, particularly if it goes beyond the two year period.  If it is clearly seen to be leading towards closer unity or moving towards some form of a single union, at what stage does the Minister say, yes, that is going ahead all right?</P>
    <P>What annoys me more than anything <Col N="2122" /> else in this legislation are the two definitions of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; under section 8 and section 23 &mdash; one for the purposes of the Labour Court and the other for the purposes of what was the 1906 Act, and is now Part II of the Bill.  It seems that my own members, teachers, are considered workers for the purposes of the protections in Part II of the Bill, but when it comes to Part III, they do not have any access to the Labour Court.  That annoyed me so much over the years that it is only in recent years that I can speak about it without becoming annoyed.</P>
    <P>For years and years, I have had great difficulty in trying to work out why it was that national teachers did not have access to the Labour Court but I could not get an answer from anybody.  I eventually went back to the discussion that took place in the Dáil in 1946 on setting up the Labour Court &mdash; the Minister referred to it, to the presentation by Sean Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce of the Industrial Relations Bill of 1946 which set up the court.  It was like the night of the bombs in Dublin. The night it was going through the House 6,000 of our members were on the streets in the middle of a most bitter dispute with the Government.  There is no doubt in my mind that is the only reason we were excluded from access to the Labour Court and that we got this nonsensical section 23 which says that in the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 1976 &ldquo;worker means any person aged 15 years or more who has entered into or works under a contract for manual labour, clerical work except a person who is employed by or under the State ... a teacher in a secondary school, a teacher in a national school and an officer of a vocational education committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mention that last one because there has been some dispute in the past two years as to what was an officer and a servant of vocational education committees and some VECs took the view that their teachers were servants and others took the view that their teachers were officers.  That led to confusion and teachers in the vocational sector certainly <Col N="2123" /> on one occasion, had access to the Labour Court on the basis that they were considered to be servants rather than officers.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful, it is unsustainable, it is untenable.  It means my union are the only union I know who do not have access to a conciliation and arbitration procedure for conditions of service and do not have access to the Labour Court.  If there is another group of workers in the State with that difficulty I will eat my words.  I am not talking about access to the Labour Court only.  The national teachers are the only group who have neither access to the Labour Court nor to a conciliation and arbitration procedure.  This leads to all sorts of problems and I would like to hear the Minister's view on the matter.  I raised it with him in January 1988 in the middle of other difficulties.  At that particular stage the view of the leader of the present Government and the leader of the then Government was that this was something which should be looked into. There have been problems in between about getting involved in it.  I want to hear the Minister's justification for excluding national teachers from access to the Labour Court, considering that they do not have a conciliation and arbitration procedure with the Department of Education in order to deal with conditions of service.</P>
    <P>It is untenable, it goes against everything in this Bill.  It goes against all the speeches that have been made about it from all sides of the House and from all sides of the management-labour-Government triangle.  In fact, in the 1946 debate there were constant references to the teachers on the streets.  I regret it very much.  It has caused a lot of damage and difficulty over the years.  It is unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the question which is not clear at all from the legislation.  Section 23 continues the ban on national teachers of access to the Labour Court. I get the impression from it also that it refuses us access to the commission but I am not clear about that because it does not actually outline who and what groups <Col N="2124" /> or workforce has access to the Labour Relations Commission.  This is very significant and it will be of importance to those workers who are excluded from the Labour Court.  Perhaps the Minister has been through this in the other House but I would want to hear it for the record of the House, I have not seen it discussed anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Are the groups of workers mentioned in section 23 (1) (a) to (f) barred from access to the Labour Relations Commission? I quote the relevent paragraphs:</P>
    <P>(a)  a person who is employed by or under the State,</P>
    <P>(b)  a teacher in a secondary school,</P>
    <P>(c)  a teacher in a national school,</P>
    <P>(d)  an officer of a local authority,</P>
    <P>(e)  an officer of a vocational education committee, or</P>
    <P>(f)  an officer of a school attendance committee.</P>
    <P>Can the functions of the Labour Relations Commissions to prevent and resolve disputes be used in those areas? If not, it seems odd that at the beginning of Part III we have put in this exclusion paragraph which is an anathema to me. Does it apply to the whole of Part III of the Bill?  I want to know if the people who are excluded from the Labour Court will also be excluded from the Labour Relations Commission.  That should be made absolutely clear in the Bill.  I want to know how it will be interpreted.  I believe it should have been made absolutely clear that if they are excluded from the Labour Court they may not be excluded from the Labour Relations Commission.  Of course, I am quite conscious of the conflict this will create if the Minister stands up and tells me they have access to the Labour Relations Commission but do not have access to the Labour Court because the <i>raison d'être</i> of the Labour Relations Commission is that it solves problems before they go to the Labour Court and, therefore, there is another vacuum created down the line.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the definition of an employer.  Under the terms of the 1906 Act an employer was someone who employed workers and in the famous case <Col N="2125" /> of the pub in Artane where there was a dispute the company renamed itself.  It did not employ any workers but made all the previous workers directors of the company, and all the directors did the bar work, etc.  Therefore, for the purposes of the legislation, they were not seen to be employers.  I am simplifying a very complex case.  This Bill does not seem to have tidied up that anomaly or escape clause and I would like to hear the Minister's views on that aspect of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 24 on the Labour Relations Commission.  It is necessary.  I can think of situations even in Leinster House in recent years where it would have been very helpful indeed.  I can think of many other examples also where it would have been useful.  It gives greater authority to the Labour Court by having this intervening position.  We now have the structure of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, but at the top of the pinnacle is the Minister. Now it will be the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Minister for Labour.  We very often hear in the second day of a dispute that the matter has been referred to the Minister for Labour.  That is not a very desirable practice and I am sure the Minister shares my views on that.  One's effectiveness becomes eroded by constant exposure and it becomes more difficult to accomplish one's objective.</P>
    <P>I am quite taken by the directive given to the Labour Relations Commission that their job is the prevention and settlement of disputes.  That is very important.  It is straightforward.  They go in there and settle the dispute or try to prevent it.  I am not quite sure how they go about preventing a dispute or at how early a stage, but I see that reports have to be done on that kind of thing.  They can decide to look at things of their own volition and they can be directed by the Minister to look at certain things.  I would like to hear more about that.  If a trade union felt that the involvement of the Labour Relations Commission might be useful and helpful in resolving a dispute which was imminent, how do we get the <Col N="2126" /> ball rolling?  Does somebody make a telephone call to the commission or what?  I would like to hear about that practice.</P>
    <P>I have some worries about section 9 (2) which relates to domestic remedy in individual cases.  My worries are based on experience of this section.  It is saying that before somebody can have access to the courts on an individual case of suspension, sacking, removal, recognition or whatever, that person must have gone through some kind of domestic remedy.  I am sure we are talking about local grievance procedures where there is an agreement in the employment that when difficulties arise, we set up a tribunal or we go through an informal, formal and then tribunal stage to resolve the difficulties and if that has not been done, there should not be access to the courts.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty whatsoever with that thinking.  I have always advised that judges should throw out cases if people have side-stepped a local domestic remedy for dealing with the problem. However, through bitter experience, I do not believe that will work as it is written in this section.  The difficulty lies with domestic remedies.</P>
    <P>Let us say we are setting up a company and negotiating different conditions of service, pay and so on.  The usual procedure is gone through, and there is generally an air of co-operation.  In the middle of these negotiations somebody says: we should also have some way of dealing with grievances that a worker might have or any problems that might arise rather than having conflict.  That is a very praiseworthy objective and it is recommended by the ICTU to all their member unions that they would have ways of dealing with these problems by some sort of grievance procedure.  The difficulty, however, is that these issues are negotiated in good faith in peace time and the nit-picking and the dissention only start when the war begins or when they are in the middle of a problem.  My difficulty is that whereas I agree with the thrust of what is in that section, what happens if the domestic procedure is challenged as <Col N="2127" /> being in breach of the tenets of natural justice or constitutional rights?</P>
    <P>Suppose the grievance procedure is set up in such a way that the person who has appealed to it says it is not fair, that that cannot be right, that he is not getting a fair trial, that a fair investigation is not being carried out.  There must be a way of testing that.  Somebody may not be able to go to the courts on the grievance but that person could well go to the courts on whether the grievance procedure at factory floor level was legal and constitutional and was in the context of natural justice and constitutional rights.  I want to know about that.</P>
    <P>Domestic remedy, in very extreme cases, can sometimes have what is called a safeguarding suspension.  If a very serious allegation was made about a worker, he might be immediately suspended. That happens in the Garda Síochána quite regularly and in other workplaces as well.  In the UK last year officers of the British Midland Police were suspended during the period of an investigation.  I am not making any value judgements on the reason for that action because I do not want to go into that area, but this can happen at shop floor level.  We need to be careful here.  It is not so clear cut that this would work if the procedure operated at local level was clearly and absolutely legal, correct and constitutional and also tight.  I want to deal with that.</P>
    <P>Grievance procedures and domestic remedies tend to have stages.  They all follow a pattern.  There is a problem and somebody is on his or her last chance or warning and that person goes through various stages of reprimands, warnings, etc. and then there is a grievance.  The way of dealing with the grievance follows the pattern of an informal stage where the employer or somebody representing the employer &mdash; in an Irish company the personnel officer &mdash; would meet with the worker.  The people in the middle of the conflict would meet to try to resolve their difficulties.  If that does not work, there is another slightly more formal procedure <Col N="2128" /> where the personnel officer or representative of the company and the trade union representative would meet with the two people and the four would sit down together, and they would try to resolve the difficulty.  If that does not resolve the issue the next stage is usually some sort of an independent tribunal &mdash; you have three people, one representing the worker, one representing management and an agreed independent chairperson. However, there is a question that is not answered in the legislation.  The legislation says that the worker will not have access to the court until the domestic remedy is &ldquo;deemed to have been exhausted&rdquo;. That is easier said than done.</P>
    <P>I have bitter experience in these areas and if the Minister checks workplaces right around the country he will find that many of them have a crucial flaw in their internal procedures, that is, there is not a built-in timescale between one stage and another.  We go through stage 1 &mdash; informal &mdash; and it does not work; then go to stage 2 &mdash; the formal stage &mdash; it does not work; then we say go to stage 3 to get this dispute resolved; stage 3 depends on the employer nominating a representative, the trade union nominating a representative and agreeing on an individual in the middle.</P>
    <P>Suppose an employer does not actually refuse to nominate somebody but just does not do it, at what stage does time run out?  At what stage do we deem the procedure to have been exhausted?  That is a problem that certainly will arise under that stage.  It is the individual case that goes to court quicker than any other kind. Unions negotiate across a negotiating table in general terms but the individual with a sense of grievance, with a sense of wrong, will run to the courts.  That is another section of the Bill which will be tested again and again in the courts.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that I would try to be brief.  I recognise that I have not been brief and for that my colleagues will not thank me.  I could go on at some length.  There are many other aspects of the Bill which I intend to tease out on Committee Stage by putting down amendments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> As I am restricting myself to certain areas of the Bill my presentation may sound more negative than I intended.  I do not intend to be negative and I certainly do not intend putting this Stage to a vote.  I support the general thrust of the legislation.  It is positive, and I hope it will work.  I have pointed out things I believe will not work, things I do believe will create difficulties, and I have raised specific questions which I see affecting myself &mdash; the amalgamation of unions and access to the Labour Court and to the Labour Relations Commission, to which I certainly want to hear replies.</P>
    <P>In a general context, taking all things together, I welcome the Bill.  I would like to compliment the Minister, Congress and the people in management who saw fit to involve themselves in this.  I always recognise in such a triangular set of negotiations the middle point will not satisfy anybody.  My view is that we should satisfy the trade union movement and let the others fit in with it.  This has not been impossible in this particular scene.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the Minister that since the introduction of this Bill in the other House many changes have been made to it.  There are aspects of the industrial action which I have some difficulty with and Congress have some difficulty with, but it is a tribute to the way the Minister for Labour operates that he is always ready to listen to one's point of view to try and take it on board if necessary. Those officers of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who have spent long hours in dealing with proposals for the legislation and indeed the individual unions of Congress, who have teased through the legislation and put forward their viewpoints are to be complimented.  Certainly two years ago I had long meetings on this legislation with officers of Congress and looked at the principles which might be covered under the heads of Bill etc.  A lot of work has gone into it on all sides.  It would be churlish of me not to mention that group of people I support each time I stand up here, the public servants who have drafted this Bill and have worked very hard in putting it together.  Many aspects of this Bill are a credit to them. <Col N="2130" /> I wish them well in their dealings with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I believe they will lose but I think they will do well otherwise.  I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a brief contribution on this very important Bill.  The Minister has pointed out that it provides a framework for the improved conduct of industrial relations and for the resolution of trade disputes with the aim of maintaining a stable and orderly industrial relations climate.  The Industrial Relations Bill is to be welcomed. Much has been said on the Bill already and there is a tremendous interest in it.  This new legislation is coming at a most appropriate time.  We have over the years heard a lot of talk about the Trade Disputes Act of 1906.  For many years there have been calls from the public for new legislation dealing with strikes and picketing.  The main bone of contention was lightening or sudden strikes.</P>
      <P>One point coming through in this new proposal is that of a strike ballot.  This was a feature of the 1906 Act with regard to industrial relations and trade union regulations.  The measures contained in this Bill have their immediate origin in <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i>. The Minister states that this committed him to holding discussions with the social partners about changes in industrial relations to provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement and help to create conditions for employment generation investment.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and the social partners involved in bringing the Bill to this stage.  The Minister, since taking over his portfolio, has involved himself in a dialogue and consultation for which he is to be congratulated. A commitment with regard to the Industrial Relations Bill was given in 1987.  With that now recognised successful form of recovery <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i>, it was essential in 1987 that the Government and social partners work together in a responsible and consultative manner.  It was this forum that brought about much needed change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2131" /> The Minister has also said that in entering these discussions he was aware that many unsuccessful attempts had been made in the past to secure agreement on fundamental changes in trade disputes and industrial relations law.  It was his view that any further attempts to secure complete agreement were unlikely to lead anywhere.  Given the respective positions and interests of employer and worker representatives, he went on to point out that he decided instead to identify a number of key areas which he considered needed attention and on this basis he developed a package of proposals.  These addressed the major issues and were designed to improve the collective bargaining environment with a view to minimising conflicts and maximising co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of a Labour Relations Commission for the procedures of the commission, for the funding, staffing and in particular the industrial relations officers and advisory services which is in line with the commission of inquiry on industrial relations published in 1981.  They recommended that a new system of industrial relations should operate within a framework; labour relations coming to them will have responsibility for the wide range of functions to promote good industrial relations, to prevent dispute and encourage resolutions, including the provision of a conciliation and advisory service, and to draw up codes of practice.  This new dimension will prove a valuable service and will definitely develop industrial co-operation between the employer and employee and trade union.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the commission, the aim of which will be to ensure that conflicts in the industrial area are kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to envisage the damage done by disputes to industrial relations and existing industrial and commercial structures and it also reflects on our image in relation to foreign investment coming to this country.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the steps he has taken to discourage the formation of new unions.  I <Col N="2132" /> would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the FWUI on their amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a point made by the Minister with regard to mergers. It is designed to encourage mergers between unions and to discourage the formation of new or breakaway unions. The Trade Union Act, 1975, permitted the introduction of a system of grants towards expenses incurred by unions in the successful merger.  As the prospect of a merger attempt being unsuccessful and the associated expenses can deter smaller unions from attempting mergers the Minister is providing that unions which attempt to merger or which fail in the attempt may claim expenses relating to the two year period prior to the failure. This, no doubt, will help a trend towards union rationalisation.  He has also referred &mdash; I welcome the proposal &mdash; to the change involving doubling of the membership required for a new union seeking to negotiate a licence.  That membership will be increased from 500 to 1,000 members and a substantial increase in the level of the High Court deposit required by such union.  I believe these are moves in the right direction.  It certainly must give great confidence all round for the future of the trade union movement in their capacity to give the highest level of service.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and I repeat, that a responsible, dedicated and united trade union movement is one of the greatest advantages that workers can have to ensure that their future wages, conditions and other aspects of their working lives are kept abreast of the general trends throughout Europe.  This is very important legislation as it puts structures in place and updates the 1906 Act.  It will also assist the further development of industrial peace.  We have witnessed over the past three years the consensus and partnership of Government and the social partners and the compromises made.  The commitment to reform and to put in place a framework for industrial relations is of the upmost national importance and will certainly help to continue the successful <Col N="2133" /> trend in our economy.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I see him very often in the north inner city and it is nice to see him here in the Upper House from time to time.</P>
      <P>In general terms I welcome the thrust of this legislation and indeed admire the scope of the measure.  Its comprehensive nature is an indication that this is really the first substantial review of industrial relations since the 1906 Trade Disputes Act, that important legislation that predated this State and which has been the basis of our industrial relations since that time.</P>
      <P>This is probably the most important legislation that has come before this House since I have been a member.  It affects virtually all of us whether in terms of employer, employee or families thereof.  It is like most legislation which comes before us, something of the curate's egg: it has its good parts and it has its bad parts.  There are areas about which I have reservations and would like to see amended and there are areas I would wholeheartedly support.  I am concerned about the restrictions imposed on picketing, both on primary and secondary picketing, and consider the restrictions there are not fully understanding of the implications, particularly in the area of secondary picketing, and the harm and the damage it could cause.  At the same time, I appreciate the Minister's concern to deal with an area which needs delicate treatment.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about secret ballots. This is very much at the heart of the legislation.  The Minister would see it as an attempt to ensure that there would be a representative balloting of members prior to strike action but because the provisions are so extensive it could cause problems in terms of wildcat strikes and it may very well be counterproductive.  I am concerned about the statement &ldquo;immunities from prosecution&rdquo; which the legislation gives rather than giving a straight &ldquo;right to strike&rdquo; which is the position I would uphold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> Senator O'Toole referred to the definition of &ldquo;workers&rdquo; and I am concerned about that also.  What exactly is meant by that, who is included and who is excluded?  In section 8 in relation to certain arms of the security forces, the Garda and the Army are excluded but not the prison staff.  We had the reverse in the legislation dealing with abolition of the death penalty where on that occasion it was the Army who were excluded.  In my own sector, that is education, I would like the Minister to deal with the matter of the public sector, the Civil Service and specifically teachers who are excluded from the terms of that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the movement towards rationalisation.  I know the Minister is extremely interested in this area.  I wholeheartedly support rationalisation of the trade unions.  It is particularly pertinent at present because my own union, the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, is involved in moves towards establishing a council of teacher unions and rationalisation of the three teacher unions and, hopefully, going further to the other teacher union not immediately involved, the Irish Federation of University Teachers.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate on the fact that if an attempted amalgamation is unsuccessful expenses can be obtained for a two year period.  I would have preferred a more positive statement and encouragement in relation to mergers. I would like clarification on that because it is a very short period of time. Perhaps an amendment could be introduced that would extend it further because, in my case, if there is a merger it will take place over an extended period.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Labour Relations Commission. It is an important body and it is a comprehensive approach to deal with industrial relations in terms of research, review and monitoring a situation to try to prevent industrial relations degenerating to the final stage of strike action.  It will resolve problems at an earlier stage and will give proper status to the Labour Court.  I also welcome the attempt to remedy the abuse of <i>ex parte</i> injunctions <Col N="2135" /> by employers which I believe have been increasingly abused in recent years.  It is a useful section and I hope it will be effective.  I am delighted to see those provisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the code of practice.  It is a good idea that guidelines are given so that there are clear processes and procedures to be followed, as long as they are voluntary guidelines.  I am not too happy with the idea that they can be used in evidence against people later on down the line if complaints are brought forward.  I would be worried about that.  The idea is a very good one as long as it is a case of voluntary guidelines and as long as it is guidelines rather than an imposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this legislation arose out of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and his attempt to deal with collective agreements and the necessity to have a more streamlined approach to the matter.  It is not quite correct to say that because if one looks at the background major elements of these provisions were already recommended in a committee set up in 1978 by the Government to inquire into industrial relations. That committee reported in 1981.  Unfortunately the Irish Congress of Trade Unions withdrew from that committee and, therefore, it was somewhat hamstrung and the absence of the Congress had an effect on the recommendations made.</P>
    <P>The committee reported in its recommendations that there would be a greater role for law and for legal mechanisms in the resolution of disputes.  That, of course, was not feasible but some of the major recommendations have, to my mind, become the basis of this legislation. For example, it was recommended that the traditional immunity for trades disputes under the 1906 Act would be lost unless secret ballots and proper concilation procedures were followed.  The provisions that are heart of this legislation have been unearthed from the 1981 report.</P>
    <P>It was recommended by the committee in 1981 that the Trades Disputes Act, 1906 be repealed and that it be restated in <Col N="2136" /> other legislation with certain restrictions. Effectively that is what we have here.  It sought to retain the legal immunities for industrial action instead of making a positive statement of strike action which would be the entitlement of every citizen in a trade dispute.  I am unhappy the Minister has gone down this road and has refused the recognise the right to strike. In this respect we are lagging behind the European Community and EC law where the right to strike is expressly stated.  It is expressly stated in the European Social Charter which was promulgated in 1989. I will read from the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.  On page 16, Article 13 states:</P>
    <P>The right to resort to collective action in the event of a conflict of interests shall include the right to strike, subject to the obligations arising under national regulations and collective agreements.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the settlement of industrial disputes, the establishment and utilisation at the appropriate levels of conciliation, mediation and arbitration procedures should be encouraged in accordance with national practice.</P>
    <P>In that there is a suggested code of practice and there is the express statement that the right to strike should be granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in the Minister's reply he might refer to that and give us some of the arguments Congress used.  I would appreciate that.</P>
      <P>In relation to some of the provisions in the Bill, section 10 is a restatement of the law on conspiracy.  Section 10 (1) is a copy of section 3 of the 1875 Act relating to trade disputes.  It provides that an agreement between two or more persons to do an act which is lawful in itself in furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be a criminal conspiracy.  This is nonsense. The law on criminal conspiracy is very vague and open to abuse, as recent cases have demonstrated.  It needs to be overhauled and probably repealed, not tinkered with.  More seriously, the protection from conspiracy is only available where the action is taken &ldquo;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo; as defined in the Bill.  Therefore, the Bill is saying that an agreement to do a lawful act but not in relation to a trade dispute could still in certain circumstances amount to a criminal conspiracy. This is badly thought out and the Minister might again look at that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 which refers to protection for peaceful picketing is very important and is a restatement of section 2 of the <Col N="2138" /> Trades Dispute Act, 1906, as the 1981 committee recommended.  The right to picket is confined to trade disputes as defined by the Act only.  The right to picket is lost if the procedures are not followed and if there is no secret ballot or conciliation.  Section 9 deals with all that.  That is a fundamentally wrong principle because there is a constitutional right involved and it is available to everybody. I do not think one can take away from that right simply because it is not part of a Trades Dispute Act or because no ballot has taken place or no procedures have been followed.  I refer the Minister to the textbook relating to picketing, <i>Irish Trade Union Law</i> by Tony Kerr and Gerry Whyte, on page 284, which states:</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution expressly guarantees liberty for the exercise of the right of citizens to assemble peacefully and without arms.  Indeed since picketing is primarily a form of communication, the ability to picket could also be viewed as falling within Article 40.6.1 which guarantees liberty for the exercise of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>In his opening address, the Minister stated that this legislation would give a clear presumption of constitutionality.  I wonder if the Minister would refer to that in his reply and state whether there is the possibility of a challenge in relation to the right to picket in this section.  It seems that it is a constitutional right that cannot be taken away by the provisions of a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <P>With regard to secondary picketing, which is dealt with in the same section, I would have some problems.  I know from looking at the Bill as initiated and the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann, that there was an amendment to that section, but there is still a problem there.  On the one hand, there is the question of the employer colluding with another employer, firm or business to break a strike; that is not uncommon, that takes place; but the onus is shifted on to the employee to prove that an employer had directly assisted their employer in the <Col N="2139" /> manner that would prevent the strike from continuing or would interfere with employment.  In the past there have been very many instances of a trade dispute being broken by collusion between employers and here we have the Minister stating that the employees in question must believe that an employer has directly assisted their employer.  How does one actually prove that?  It is proved only by the employee in question.  I know there can be a problem with secondary picketing, but I am not sure if this in itself will solve the problem.  It brings it down to a matter for the courts.  It makes it very difficult to deal with and will cause all sorts of frustrations and problems.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the possible dismissal of employees for taking industrial action, there is need for protection here.  This is something for which there is not sufficient protection in the Bill.  The Bill should provide that where an employee is involved in an official industrial action he cannot in any circumstances be dismissed. I am not satisfied that the Unfair Dismissals Acts sufficiently cover the matter.  There should be specific provision in this legislation to cover that.</P>
    <P>The heart of the Bill is section 14 dealing with the secret ballot.  I have some problems with this.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The rules of every trade union shall contain a provision that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike or other industrial action without a secret ballot, entitlement to vote in which shall be accorded equally to all members whom it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for the union concerned to believe will be called upon to engage in the strike or other industrial action;</P>
    <P>That is probably the strongest and most severe statement in the Bill and places a major obligation on the trade union movement in terms of its operation.  It includes a provision which is more in line <Col N="2140" /> with some of the developments that have taken place in Britain than in this country in the recent past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Secret ballots are desirable. Most trades unions have secret ballots as part of their procedures.  That is normal.  It is normal in my trade union. It is normal in most of the trades unions I know of but the fatal flaw in this is that it will require a secret ballot for all industrial disputes, no matter how trivial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator knows you cannot define &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo; when it comes to industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Very recently my union was engaged in an industrial dispute in relation to a post of responsibility.  We are a very reasonable union.  We do not put a picket on a school immediately.  We follow the correct procedures and the code of conduct which we have ourselves. We asked our members to withdraw their services in relation to that post because of the dispute.  That was done as a token gesture.  We would not regard that as a major action because the schools kept working normally but the specific posts which were the subject of the dispute were not manned by our members.  We did not need to escalate the action because that carried the day.  The management saw the light, so to speak.  If that had not happened we would have escalated the dispute and this had been decided by the delegate conference of 400 members not by a full secret ballot, by withdrawing voluntary activities in the schools.  Voluntary activities are activities we perform, as trade union members, on a voluntary basis because otherwise the schools would scarcely be able to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do I interpret from this legislation that the withdrawal of voluntary activity, which I am not obliged to do contractually as it does not form part of my contract with my management, is industrial action which necessitates having a secret ballot of all the members of my union?  This is voluntary labour which <Col N="2141" /> they are not obliged to do in the first place.  The norm in industrial disputes is that it takes place at shopfloor level and then the matter may or may not escalate, but if you demand that the entire workforce, which may be thousands or tens of thousands strong, has to embark on a secret ballot in the first instance then you are creating a recipe for chaos and frustration and for all sorts of wildcat industrial action.  I would be delighted to hear the Minister's response to that section.</P>
    <P>As regards the timescale, it is very difficult to conduct a secret ballot on any sort of national basis without allowing two weeks in which to have ballot papers printed and circulated, to hold branch meetings or have postal ballots depending on what form of action or procedures a union follows.  Then the result has to be made to known to members.  I share the reservations of Senator O'Toole about making known to members the actual percentage response.  It is showing one's hand and the Minister could very usefully amend that section because it is really too much to say in section 14 (2) (f) that the number of votes in favour of the proposal and the number of votes against the proposal will be made known to all the members.  Obviously if it is made known to all the members, it is made known to the people you are negotiating with so they will know precisely the strength or weakness of your hand. That is a real problem for the trade union movement.  I would like to see the Minister accepting an amendment to delete these two points in paragraph (f).</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Senator misunderstands, the union official would only make the results known to his own members, not to management.  The logic behind it is very important.  The only person who can take an action against the behaviour of the union is a member of that union.  The employers side wanted me to allow management to take a case against a union for his misbehaviour.  If a member is the only one allowed to take an action he has to know the result <Col N="2142" /> otherwise you are taking away his constitutional right.  That is the reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What is in the legislation is the number of votes, it is not the result. If it was the result of the ballot that would be a horse of a different colour.  If the Minister could substitute in that section &ldquo;the result of the ballot&rdquo; as distinct from the number of votes cast one way or the other, it would be a big improvement from a negotiating point of view.  My union would be very pleased with that. It would be fair because if the actual numbers are given to every member, it means in a union of 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 members it will be public information and the management will be quite aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Would every member not be entitled to know the result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the result of the ballot, but the precise numbers and the number of spoiled votes would not be a fundamental entitlement.  The result of the ballot is a fundamental entitlement and I accept that.  I urge the Minister to have a second look at that paragraph.</P>
      <P>As regards the timescale, I was saying that it would take about two weeks to organise a secret ballot on a national basis.  It would take most of another week to inform the members of the result and then we would have to notify the employer.  Then the employer could go to court and get a court hearing which could take another week.  We are talking about a month.  The timescale is extraordinarily long compared with the existing situation.  No immediate action can be taken where an employer is at fault and I can see our members being frustrated. I can see it being costly and the delay creating many problems that may not have been envisaged by the Minister in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> Another very important feature which I referred to earlier is the Labour Relations Commission.  I will not dwell on it unduly.  Most of the things I have to say about it are favourable.  I welcome it and the new status it intends to give to the Labour Court.  It is a comprehensive approach to labour relations as is the code of conduct.  I hope it is not used as evidence against an employee but rather as a guideline.</P>
    <P>There is one other area to which I would draw the Minister's attention and that is what I would regard as the scandal of low pay.  I know he is very concerned about it also.  The Minister apparently has great faith in the Joint Labour Committee as a system of ensuring fair pay for non-unionised sectors.  The Bill proposes various minor reforms in the Joint Labour Committee system but the Minister shies away from the essential area of reform.  The only way, to my mind, in which the question of low pay can be addressed is through the provision of a statutory minimum wage.  That is the way to go about this matter but it has not been referred to.  A statutory minimum wage is commonplace in EC countries and in other western countries and the EC charter is strong on it as well.  Article 5, states that &ldquo;all employment shall be fairly remunerated&rdquo;.  The only way to ensure fair remuneration is to ensure that everybody has a right to a statutory minimum wage.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is worth mentioning, in relation to industrial action in the public service, that distinctions are made.  I would like the Minister to address why the Garda and the Army are specifically excluded from the definiton of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in section 8.  They are not so excluded in other countries in Europe and I do not see why there should be a specific exclusion here.  As I referred to earlier, the Defence Forces were excluded in other legislation.  If there are three arms of the Security Forces why should a distinction be made for one and not the other?  I would like the Minister to explain the distinction and to address the whole area <Col N="2144" /> of the Civil Service and the public service and why my union members are excluded in the context of section 23.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  I have outlined some serious reservations in relation to secret ballots, secondary picketing and the definition of workers.  There are many areas that I am pleased with and I congratulate the Minister on putting together a very comprehensive Bill.  It is the first comprehensive legislation that has been introduced in the industrial relations sector since before the foundation of the State and the Minister is to be congratulated on doing so.  I wish him well in the future and hope he will accept one or two of the reasonable amendments that will be introduced on the next section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill which is timely and comprehensive. Obviously, a lot of the debate has centered around industrial disputes but we must accept that industrial disputes are a last resort in industrial relations, and for most employees and employers they are a rare occurrence. The need for continuous good industrial relations in all sectors of employment is important.  As somebody who has been a manager and responsible for industrial relations in a concern for a long time, I believe that the concept of unionisation is good.  The concept of working through procedures is very important.  It is an aid to management as well as to the protection of the rights of workers because where there are proper structures and proper procedures, in normal circumstances there should be no need for industrial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the good running of industry and commerce that workers recognise that they must operate through given structures.  I welcome in the Bill, for example, an exception being made of disputes between worker and worker.  In all my experience with trade unions I have found them reasonable in accepting that there are times when management, in the interests of the common good, have to take steps against employees that are <Col N="2145" /> not popular.  However, I see that as being the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>Getting down to the specific provisions of the Bill, the steps being taken to reform the law as it applies to trade disputes and, particularly, to introduce the concept of secret ballots, are to be welcomed. It is a serious step to enter into an industrial dispute; it is more serious still both for employer and employee to take the decision to go on strike.  Many workers, in effect, would find that by going on strike they would be jeopardising their employment because it might not be able to withstand the economic effects of a strike.  Therefore, it is very important to ensure that before an industrial dispute is entered into, all possible means of negotiation have been exhausted, that proper procedures have been followed and a majority of the membership wish to proceed with such a step.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we should welcome facilitating the further rationalisation of the trade union movement.  How often in the past have we seen problems between unions within the same employment being the cause of industrial relation problems?  If one considers the concept of a union being beyond a purely financial bargaining counter and an instrument of industrial disputes, and looks at it in its broadest concept, it is important that our unions are strong enough to fulfil this function.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is provision for setting up the Labour Relations Commission.  As has been pointed out, it is not good that the Labour Court should become a court of first appeal rather than a court of final appeal.  It is important that there are mechanisms by which parties can sit down together and settle disputes and that if they fail at that level they have the Labour Court to fall back on.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the expediency of appealing to the Minister &mdash; I congratulate the Minister on his fine work since he became Minister for Labour &mdash; should only be resorted to on very rare occasions because the effectiveness of such a step is eroded by over-use.  The idea of drawing a Minister into many <Col N="2146" /> disputes does not serve either the Minister or industrial relations in general well.</P>
    <P>The functions of the commission and the provision of an advisory service are important.  From my experience in industrial relations, most industrial disputes tend to arise from a breakdown in human communications, often from the neglect of small matters accumulated over time, where there are not methods to deal expeditiously with complaints, be they major or minor.</P>
    <P>One of the important areas for development is the whole question of education, of creating structures within industries, factories and the workplace where small problems can be sorted out effectively.  The rights of workers to good working conditions, to flexibility within the overall budgetary constraints an employer would have and to information as to what is proposed, costs nothing to the employer but often saves time and money in the long run.  I have used to good effect within the industry I manage what I would call an expanded safety committee procedure to ensure that matters of safety, conditions and information up and down the line can be transmitted from worker to manager and from manager to worker in a regular manner so that possible areas of conflict are headed off before they become matters of serious conflict.  In this way not only does it not cost money but, as I have said, in the long term money and time are saved.  A happy workforce normally is an effective workforce, a safe workforce is an effective workforce.  A workforce who feel they can participate in the place they work, that they have a role in making suggestions about improvements, and so on, normally do not wind up in an industrial dispute with their employers.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this Bill is welcomed.  It goes far beyond laying down simple rules for the resolution of disputes, although that obviously is a very important part of this law.  It is important that the work that has been done in the past few years in developing this economy is not now lost in an outbreak of industrial disputes which would threaten to put us <Col N="2147" /> back to where we were a few years ago. Facing into 1992, all people, employers, managers and employees &mdash; at times we tend to forget that most managers are also employees &mdash; will have to work together to ensure that through industrial harmony we will be able to compete in the new Europe we will face after 1992.</P>
    <P>It is with deep concern that, as a Senator, I have watched the escalation of various disputes, among them the Waterford Glass dispute and the dispute in the <i>Irish Press</i> office.  I hope that good industrial relations will prevail.  It would not be proper for me to make any comment on the disputes except to hope that they are not the precursor of a series of such disputes that might and could, if they continue, lead to serious job losses. Everybody involved in employment, employer and employee, has an obligation to ensure that we do not add to the dole queue, that employment is maintained through good industrial relations and that we do not allow, through obduracy on either side, a situation to arise where good and viable employment is lost.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, ba mhaith liom anfháilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the Industrial Relations Bill, 1990 it is interesting to trace the development of the law in this area.  The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875 virtually <Col N="2148" /> excluded common law criminal liability in the field of trade disputes.  The action of employers and of the courts was to turn to the law of tort which provided remedies against conduct deliberately aimed at causing financial loss.  The ability of employees to take effective industrial action was thus placed in jeopardy by the threat, not of criminal prosecution, but by awards of considerable damages and by orders for injunctions. Tortious liability for conspiracy replaced criminal liability and this process culminated in the decision of Quinn <i>v</i>. Leathem in 1901.  In that case, the House of Lords held that trade union officials who threatened an employer with a strike if he did not dismiss non-union members and who persuaded customers not to deal with him, were liable for the tort of conspiracy to injury.</P>
      <P>An equally significant development was the decision of the House of Lords in the same year in Taff-Vale Railway Company <i>v</i>. the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants in 1901, that a trade union registered under the Trade Union Act, 1871 was a legal entity capable of suing and being sued under its registered name for the tortious acts of its members and officials.  The union in that case found itself liable for £23,000 in damages and for a substantial sum in respect of costs as well.  The unions campaigned vigorously for changes in the law but, as Wedderburn has convincingly argued, they made not ideological demands but practical demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parliament proceeded to consider the conferring of immunities on trade unions in certain circumstances, that is to say, recognising the inherent unlawfulness of what they were doing but exempting them specifically from any penalty that might follow.  This was, of course, a very basic change in the whole approach to the law and it manifested itself in that very important Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  In view of its vast influence on trade union law, both in philosophical terms and in practice, the 1906 Act is remarkably brief, consisting of a mere five sections and capable of being written on a single sheet of paper.  It sets out to <Col N="2149" /> remedy directly and explicitly the difficulties which had arisen by reason of the court's interpretation of the 1871 Act.</P>
    <P>After a remarkable parliamentary career during which a number of important amendments were made, the 1906 Act was enacted on 20 December 1906. Kidner has described the 1906 Act as a legislative coup of the greatest proportions for the trade union movement. The immunities conferred by sections 1, 2 and 3 of the 1906 Act in respect of conspiracy, picketing and inducement of breach of contract, are restricted to persons acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  It is, of course, in the interpretation of this formula which has been dubbed &ldquo;the golden formula&rdquo; by Wedderburn, that the boundaries of lawful industrial action are defined.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of that Act provides that an act done in pursuance of an agreement or combination by two or more persons, if done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, shall not be actionable unless the act, if done without such agreement or combination, would be actionable. Section 2(1) provides that it shall be lawful for one or more persons acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union, in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a house or place where a person resides, or works or carries on business, or happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information or peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of that Act provides that an act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable on the ground only that it induces some other person to break a contract of employment or that it is an interference with the trade, business or employment of some other person.  It will be noticed that the activities mentioned in sections 1 and 3 are not made lawful but are rendered immune from legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the case of picketing, however, the 1906 Act actually legitimated this <Col N="2150" /> activity, provided it was peaceful.  The Judiciary, therefore, plays a central role in determining the legality of industrial action and the Irish courts have always taken the view that the 1906 Act, since it abrogates and curtails common law rights, ought to be construed with reasonable strictness and given no wider scope than is clearly marked out in the Act. Moreover, the 1906 Act has been described by Mr. Justice Parke in Goulding Chemicals v. Bolger of 1977 as a child of political expediency, hastily conceived and prematurely delivered with many inbred imperfections.  In the same case Mr. Justice Kenny said that the 1906 Act was introduced to redeem an election pledge of the Liberal Party, that there were many indications it was hurriedly drafted and that its wordings did not receive adequate consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1906 Act provided that action against a trade union in respect of any tortious acts alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of a trade union shall not be entertained by any court.  The intention here, of course, was to protect the funds of trade unions in the aftermath of the Taff-Vale case of 1901.  While section 4 originally provided immunity to registered and unregistered trade unions alike, whether of workers or employees, it now applies, following the enactment of the Trade Union Act, 1941, only to registered trade unions holding a negotiating licence and to members and officials sued in a representative capacity on behalf of such a union.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (3) of the 1906 Act, on the other hand, provided that the expression &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; means any dispute between employers and workmen or between workmen and workmen which is connected with employment or non-employment or the terms of employment or the conditions of labour of any person. In order for the golden formula to apply the following criteria must be met: (1) there must be a dispute, actual or imminent; (2) the dispute must be between the proper parties; (3) the dispute must be connected with one or more of a number of specific matters, and (4) the <Col N="2151" /> action must be taken in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the restricted application of the 1906 Act to persons employed in trade or business has given rise indeed to much debate.  This phrase was interpreted by the courts in a manner which excluded public servants and all those not involved in commercial or industrial activities.  After much contention the matter was resolved by the Trade Dispute (Amendment) Act, 1982, and the traditional immunities were extended to all employees other than members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Talbot (Ireland) <i>v</i>. Merrigan of 1981 is a good example of how narrowly the 1906 Act has been interpreted by the courts. In that case the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was restrained by an interlocutory injunction which was granted by the Supreme Court in this country from imposing an embargo on the products of the plaintiff company.  This decision of the Supreme Court that trade unions may not bring pressure to bear upon an employer means that trade unions are deprived of a considerable element of their economic strength.  That decision is one of the most important decisions in the field of labour law in recent years and yet, as we know, there is no record of the court's reasoning and, indeed, no transcript of the court's judgment.  In that case the plaintiffs were in the process of scaling down their Irish operations and they had reduced the number of persons employed by the end of 1980 from 500 to 122.  In 1981 the plaintiffs announced that a further 86 were to be laid off and ministerial permission was granted. However, a number of employees occupied the plaintiffs' premises.  An injunction was used to restrain the continuance of the sit in and picketing commenced.</P>
    <P>The trade union representing the employees, the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, decided to increase the pressure on the plaintiffs by seeking the support of other trade unions and they announced an embargo on the plaintiffs' products.  The decision to place the embargo was endorsed by the Irish <Col N="2152" /> Congress of Trade Unions.  All members of trade unions affiliated to the Congress were asked not to permit the importation of Talbot cars and other components, not to handle them within this country and not to permit services to be carried out in connection with the plaintiffs' activities. The plaintiffs successfully applied for an injunction restraining both Matt Merrigan, the general secretary of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions from imposing the embargo.  The Supreme Court upheld the High Court decision to grant the injunction and the boycott, as we all know, was called off.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Henchy is reported as saying that there were many matters to support the finding.  The embargo was no empty request but an implemented direction which, in effect, procured the breach of many contracts between the company and third parties.  Mr. Justice Kenny stated that the 1906 Act had no application to the case.  Section 3 of the 1906 Act only provides immunity where the defendant, in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, induced a breach of a contract of employment.  The contracts that were broken in the Talbot case were commercial contracts.  In the context of picketing the courts in this country and in the United Kingdom have put very strong emphasis on &ldquo;peacefully&rdquo;. In the Brendan Dunne Limited <i>v</i>. Fitzpatrick 1977 case Mr. Justice Budd stated:</P>
    <P>1.  the method of picketing must be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances;</P>
    <P>2.  it would not be reasonable to place a picket consisting of 100 or so persons on a small suburban business premises with one or two of a staff; on the other hand, it might be quite reasonable to place several quite large pickets on a large factory with several entrances;</P>
    <P>4.  it is a matter of degree according to the circumstances; and</P>
    <P>5.  the number of pickets should bear <Col N="2153" /> reasonable relations to the nature of the premises and the number of persons with whom the dispute arises.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Budd concluded in that case that 60 persons parading outside the plaintiffs' premises in Dawson Street in Dublin 2 was an unduly large picket and one calculated to frighten and overcome those picketed and members of the public wishing to do business with the company.</P>
    <P>In another case, Ryan <i>v</i>. Cook, 1928 the plaintiff, Agnes Ryan carried on a retail dairy and creamery business in 20 shops in Dublin, including one in Henry Street.  None of her assistants was a member of any trade union.  The defendants, on behalf of a trade union, sought and obtained permission from the plaintiff to canvass her assistants to become members of their union.  Letters were written by the union to her assistants inviting them to join the trade union and forms of application to join the union were then distributed.  Notwithstanding their efforts, no member of the plaintiffs' staff joined the trade union.  Four letters were then written by the trade union to the plaintiff asking her for an assurance that she would only employ trade union labour and would observe trade union conditions and stating that failure to give the required assurance would lead to the placing of a picket on the plaintiff's premises at Henry Street.  No reply was made by the plaintiff to these letters and a picket was placed on her premises. Members of the picket carried posters inscribed as follows: &ldquo;This firm refuses to employ trade union labour&rdquo; etc.</P>
    <P>The plaintiff never, of course, refused to employ trade union labour.  She brought an action against the defendants claiming an injunction to restrain them from attending at her premises for the purpose of watching or picketing her premises, from disturbing her in the conduct of her business and from interfering with her employees and her customers. In that case, Mr. Justice Johnson held on the evidence that there was no trade dispute within the meaning of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  Therefore, the 1906 <Col N="2154" /> Act afforded no protection for the defendant's acts.  The conduct was therefore wrongful whether viewed from the point of view of conspiracy or nuisance and the plaintiff was entitled to the injunction claimed.  The dissemination of falsehood, as was done by the defendants in this case, since the inscriptions on the banners were untrue, could not be described as a peaceful way of communicating information within the contemplation of section 2 of the 1906 Act.</P>
    <P>In a similar case, Esplanade Pharmacy Ltd. <i>v</i>. Larkin in 1977, the Supreme Court held: (1) the action of the union was an attempt to enforce an agreement as to the trading hours for the particular premises involved; (2) this was a matter concerned with the employer's business rather than with the employees conditions; and (3) there was therefore no trade dispute in existence and the picket should again be restrained.</P>
    <P>In a similar case, Tynan <i>v</i>. Balmer in 1966, an official strike concerning draftsmen was in progress at a factory.  The defendant was the leader of the striking draftsmen and he was chairman of the negotiating committee.  It was indeed a well-managed strike, entirely lacking in disturbance and bad temper and the strikers maintained friendly relations with the police.  Pickets had been placed at all gates leading to the factory and two police constables who had been on duty outside the factory saw the defendant leading about 40 pickets moving in a circle at the main entrance and extending this circle into the public highway.  The police constable requested the defendant to stop the pickets from circling in this manner.  The defendant refused and was arrested.  He was charged with wilfully obstructing a police constable in the course of his duty.  The defendant sought to rely on section 2 (1) of the 1906 Act. The court, however, held that since part of the object of the pickets was to seal off the highway and cause vehicles approaching the premises to stop, their conduct was a nuisance at common law and, therefore, it was an unreasonable user of the highway.  Section 2 of the 1906 Act did not render picketing a lawful user <Col N="2155" /> of the highway in all circumstances.  The picketers' conduct could be the subject of interference by the police and again, accordingly, the defendant was guilty of the offence charged.</P>
    <P>In another case, Hunt <i>v</i>.  Broome in 1973, the defendant was on a strike picket during an industrial dispute.  He stood holding a placard in front of a vehicle on a highway urging the driver not to work at a site nearby and preventing him from proceeding along the highway as he wished.  The defendant was charged with obstructing the highway and again the House of Lords held in that case that the 1906 Act made lawful the attendance of pickets only for the purposes specified therein.  The 1906 Act did not require the person whom it was sought to persuade to submit to any constraint or restriction on his or her right to personal freedom. The defendant had a statutory right to invite the driver to stop and listen to him so long as that was done in a reasonable manner.  The defendant was not entitled to compel the driver to do so and, accordingly, he had committed the offence charged.</P>
    <P>In the course of his judgment in that case, Lord Reid, laid down a number of points.  There was no ground for implying any right to require the person whom it was sought to persuade to submit to any kind of constraint or restriction on his personal freedom.  One is familiar with a person at the side of a road signalling to a person requesting him to stop.  It is then for the driver to decide whether he will stop or not.  That a picket is entitled to do.  If the driver stops, the picket can talk to him, but only for so long as the driver is willing to listen.  If a picket has a purpose beyond those set out in the section of the Act, then his presence becomes unlawful.</P>
    <P>In many cases it would not be difficult to infer as a matter of fact that pickets who assemble in unreasonably large numbers do have the purpose of preventing free passage.</P>
    <P>I think obviously, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, Senator Honan must be trying to <Col N="2156" /> prevent me from making my contribution here this evening.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the 1906 Act merely commits persons to attend at or near and not in or on premises.  Section 2 of the Act does not confer a licence on trade union officials to enter upon property for the purpose of addressing employees, even at the request of the employees.  That was shown in the case of Larkin and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners in 1908.  Neither are the employees protected.  If they go beyond picketing and occupy or seize the whole or part of the premises, the occupation itself may be extremely peaceful and cause no actual damage but nevertheless it is a clear interference in the property rights of the employer, and indeed the property rights of others.  It constitutes a trespass and may involve those concerned in civil and criminal liability.  The occupation may also attract a criminal prosecution under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>It is in the context, therefore, of the 1906 Act and indeed of the case law as developed by our courts and by the courts in the United Kingdom, that I think we can see the strengths and the weaknesses of this Industrial Relations Bill, 1990. The Long Title of the Bill describes it as an Act to make further and better provision for promoting harmonious relations between workers and employers in this country.  That is something we all look forward to.  The provisions of the Bill, as the Minister has indicated, range over a number of areas and can be roughly divided broadly between (1) trade union law, Part II, sections 8 to 22 and (2) industrial relations generally, Part III, sections 23 to 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the broad heading of trade union law, there are provisions first, to reform trade dispute law; second, to introduce pre-strike secret ballots; third, to restrict the use of injunctions in trade <Col N="2157" /> disputes and fourth, to facilitate the further rationalisation of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Under the broad heading of industrial relations generally, there are provisions to establish a new industrial relations commission which will have responsibility for a comprehensive range of functions, including the provision of conciliation and advisory services and the drawing up of codes of practice.  The approach in the area of trade disputes law is to repeal the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, and the Trade Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1982 and to reintroduce the main provisions of these Acts with appropriate amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill deals with peaceful picketing.  Section 11 (1) amends section 2 (1) of the 1906 Act and confines the immunity to picketing at a place where their employer works or carries on business or where that is not practicable at the approaches to a place where their employer works or carries on business. Section 11 (2) provides that secondary picketing will be permissible only where workers have a reasonable belief both at the commencement of and throughout their continuance of attendance on a secondary picket that a secondary employer has acted in the way calculated to frustrate a strike or other industrial action by directly assisting the employer who is a party to the dispute.</P>
    <P>Section 12 re-enacts section 3 of the 1906 Act with the addition of a provision in section 12 (b) to grant immunity to a person who threatens to induce a breach of a contract of employment and a threat by a person to break his own contract of employment.  Although section 12 makes the inducement or threatened inducement of a breach of contract not an actionable behaviour, it does not deal with the situation that arose in the Talbot (Ireland) Limited case against Merrigan in 1981 in respect of breaches of commercial contracts.  I would like to know whether the Minister has in mind any changes in the Bill to take into consideration breaches of commercial contracts.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the removal of <Col N="2158" /> the immunities from civil action under sections 10, 11 and 12 in respect of proceedings arising out of a strike or other industrial action in this regard contrary to the outcome of a secret ballot.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides if a secret ballot favours industrial action and a trade union gives at least one week's notice to the employer concerned, then the employer shall not apply to the court for an <i>ex parte</i> injunction and the court shall not grant any other injunction if the trade union establishes a fair case that it was acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  There may be some doubts about the constitutionality of that section, and I am sure it is something the Minister has considered, but I would suggest again that it would be wise to get the advice of the Attorney General or the other appropriate law advisers that the Minister has at his disposal.</P>
    <P>Section 19 (4) provides that the provisions of section 19 shall not apply in the case of unlawful entry or indeed of trespass or action likely to cause death or personal injury.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I hope this Bill is successful in promoting, as the long Title has indicated, harmonious industrial relations in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the time so I will be extremely brief.  I welcome this Bill which provides for major reform of the law on industrial relations.  I also welcome the fact that the main provisions of the Bill resulted from the comprehensive and detailed discussion and consultation which took place between the Minister for Labour, the Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I would like to compliment everybody who was involved in these discussions on the extent of the consensus which was obviously achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A favourable industrial relations climate is essential if the kind of employment creation that we would all like to see is to be achieved.  This legislation will contribute significantly to the achievement of such a climate.  It is also important, as we move closer to the Single <Col N="2159" /> European Market, that we would have put in place the best possible framework for the conduct of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions to reform trade dispute law, to introduce pre-strike ballots, to restrict the use of injunctions in trade disputes and to facilitate the further rationalisation of the trade union movement.  These are all areas of trade union law which needed updating and revision.</P>
    <P>The new Labour Relations Commission which the Bill proposes to establish is also a welcome provision.  I believe that this labour relations commission will have a key role to play in the maintenance of good industrial relations and in ensuring that minor disagreements are amicably settled before they can escalate or become major disputes.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years this country has achieved a major economic recovery. The road to recovery was not an easy one.  Many sacrifices were called for along the way.  The co-operation which the Government received from the social partners, and especially from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, was vital to the process of recovery.  That co-operation is again evident from the level of agreement which was reached in relation to provisions of this Bill.  The leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has once again demonstrated a level of maturity and responsibility and a degree of commitment to the well being of this nation that has to be commended.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another triumph for the present Minister for Labour and I would like to join with the other speakers who have paid many tributes to him for the successes he has achieved in that office since he was first appointed.  I join with previous speakers in welcoming this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to use the opportunity to welcome the Bill.  The Irish industrial relation scene makes the time opportune.  It is nice to recall that in 1989 the level of man days lost through industrial disputes was the lowest since 1922.  This is a tribute to the parties to the industrial relations area, the <Col N="2160" /> employers the trade unions and the workers.  The approach of these parties to the pay agreements has reduced the potential for conflict.  The Government must encourage the parties, by their policies towards the industrial relations environment, to continue with a positive approach to national pay bargaining.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the 1980s, up to 1988 there has been on average 40 strikes each year in pursuit of pay claims giving rise to a loss of about 190,000 man days per day.  In 1988 due to the return of central bargaining on pay there were just six strikes resulting in the loss of 11,000 man days, less than 10 per cent of the total man days lost.  While national pay bargaining has been positive in its approach to industrial relations, I would caution about national pay bargaining in the long term because it does reduce the role of the trade union official and indeed the role of management in the negotiations in the industrial relations area and can lead to conflict outside of the exact pay bargaining when the industrial relations personnel try to re-establish their position with their various constituents. While in the short-term central bargaining is productive it tends to lose its effect in the longer term.</P>
      <P>Concern must be expressed about the deteriorating situation in the employment figures for last month.  While the Industrial Relations Bill deals with the employed we must also concern ourselves with those who do not have the opportunity of employment, our emigrants and our unemployed at home.  While we congratulate ourselves on the improved economic performance, the Government must seriously examine our failure to translate this into real jobs on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in unemployment of 6,200 in June, bringing the number of unemployed to 221,800 despite the fact that almost 1,000 people per week emigrate, is in stark contrast to the optimistic reports which have been turned out over the past 12 months.  I believe that the Government and the Minister &mdash; especially as it is a Government responsibility &mdash; should set up a task force to tackle the <Col N="2161" /> unemployment and emigration problem. I would like to highlight quickly three of the principal causes of unemployment. First, high income tax, PRSI and overheads make it too costly to put £1 in a worker's pocket; second, the overlay of social legislation makes the employment of labour unattractive; and third, the multitude of poverty traps which has grown from official policy.  A person going off social welfare benefit and taking up employment should in all circumstances be better off.  In this context I would ask the Minister and the Government to look at the creation of a new Department of Employment.  This should merge the Department of Labour with the industrial development function of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the unemployment benefit section of the Department of Social Welfare to tackle our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being introduced at a time when the power balance between the employers and the unions is weighted towards the employer.  This is due to the economic situation over the past ten years and to the factors which I have already outlined.  There is an over-supply of labour for the available vacancies. Most employers have responded to this in a responsible manner and have not misused their power to the detriment of their employees.  Many have rightly corrected their out of line production costs, which were a relic of the late sixties and early seventies when the reverse situation applied, when there was an under-supply of labour for the available positions.  On too many occasions during that period the trades unions used their power to extract high wage increases which caused extreme problems for these organisations when economic circumstances changed.</P>
    <P>Many good and formerly successful organisations went out of business because of their failure to readjust their costs when the economic environment changed.  Management in such companies failed to head off the problem and did not have the necessary personnel management skills to negotiate a readjustment when times changed. <Col N="2162" /> Unfortunately too many organisations did not recognise the value of such skills and paid the price.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, today there are a small number of employers who seize the opportunity to take advantage of the current employment situation by introducing draconian conditions of employment and very low wages.  These employers give the majority of employers a bad name. They pride themselves on their strong, autocratic management system with no concern for the views or morale of their employees.</P>
    <P>The current labour market, where people have little or no alternative employment facilitates this approach by these employers.  They can, by such an approach, incur much lower production costs than their competitors and are in a position to undercut them in the marketplace. This, what I call &ldquo;macho-management approach&rdquo; is very shortsighted and is very dangerous.  I would like to quote the case of a company involved in an industrial dispute which went on for several weeks.  Following the dispute they wrote to their workers in the following fashion:</P>
    <P>Following the termination of the recent industrial dispute it is very clear that 1.  About 2/3 of our employees wish this company to continue in existence and to expand and prosper... 2.  Unfortunately there is a smaller number making up most or all of the remaining 1/3, who by their vote and by the subsequent actions of most of them have demonstrated very clearly that they are not of the same mind. Those employees in group 2 above should be aware of their rights [and this took place where there were considerable changes of employment conditions] under the redundancy Act which allows them to legally claim redundancy if the new payment structures are not acceptable to them.  They have 1 month from the commencement of the new structures to make such a claim which, unless the company contests it as unreasonable, must be complied with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> You may be assured that we will not contest such a claim as we are profoundly of the opinion that the interests of both the company and those in group 1 would be best served if the dissatisfied employees left the company sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>This typifies the approach to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Economic trends will change and it would be hard to persuade employees of such organisations not to misuse their muscle power when the employment market changes and the power base between the unions and employers shifts towards labour.  Such employers are making the same mistake in using their position as did the trade union movement in the late sixties and early seventies.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the majority of employers who take a totally different approach and who have progressive personnel policies. I especially wish to mention many of the multinationals who see spending in this area as an investment rather than a cost.</P>
    <P>There have been many misrepresentations regarding the whole area of industrial relations.  If one mentions that one works in this area one often gets the response from the general public as if one were engaged in activity akin to war.  The truth is far different.  War is the promotion of conflict in an extreme way; industrial relations is the containment and control of inter-personal and intergroup conflict in a positive way.</P>
    <P>At this stage we should define industrial relations because nobody has defined it in this debate so far.  Industrial relations is concerned with the systems, rules and procedures used by unions and employers to determine the reward for effort and other conditions of employment to protect the interests of the employed and their employees and to regulate the ways in which employers treat their employees.  It includes the process of collective bargaining as well as formal procedural agreements.  Industrial relations also includes the role of the parties involved in this system such as <Col N="2164" /> management, union officials, shop stewards and employees and the relationships between them.  It can be regarded as a system of rules, jointly agreed by the representatives to the employment relations.  This reference to joint agreement is important because the agreement between the parties makes for ready acceptance of the procedure rather than if they were imposed by a third party or the State.  The Irish system of industrial relations is, therefore, essentially a voluntary one.  The system was mainly influenced by the UK system which developed from the <i>laissez-faire</i> philosophy of the last century.  This system encouraged individual bargaining at the workplace.  The system broke down because of the unequal bargaining power where the employers had much more economic and social power than their workers.  Workers, therefore, came together to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the Trade Union Acts since 1871.  This removed the illegality of unions.  It meant that members of a trade union need not be in fear of prosecution in respect of criminal conspiracy.</P>

    <Title>Televising of Seanad and Committee Proceedings: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the following arrangements for the televising of the proceedings of the Seanad, recommended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, be adopted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that an in-House, television broadcast system covering the proceedings of Seanad Éireann each day from the commencement of the Sitting to the adjournment of the Seanad be installed,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  that three members of Seanad Éireann be appointed to the Broadcasting Control Committee established by Dáil Éireann on 30th March, 1990 to make the necessary <Col N="2165" /> administrative and financial arrangements for televising of the proceedings,</P>
    <P>(iii)  that Windmill Lane Pictures Limited be engaged under contract to record, reproduce and supply a clean feed of the proceedings to Members and to the broadcasting companies and that broadcasting companies in turn contribute towards the annual production costs,</P>
    <P>(iv)  that the television system be supplied by the contractor on a lease/contract may be renewed at the discretion of Seanad Éireann, the installation and maintenance of the equipment and the production of the clean feed to be supplied under contract and the equipment under lease,</P>
    <P>(v)  that the contractor provide the technical staff to operate the system,</P>
    <P>(vi)  that copyright of all material be vested in the Houses of the Oireachtas,</P>
    <P>(vii)  that the necessary technical arrangements for televising be undertaken by the contractor in conjunction with the appropriate authorities and subject to final review by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges,</P>
    <P>(viii)  that subject to paragraph (xii)  the Rules of coverage be determined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges,</P>
    <P>(ix)  that subject to paragraph (xii) televising of proceedings be either live or in any of the edited forms to be determined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges,</P>
    <P>(x)  that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges appoint a sub-committee to monitor televising on an ongoing basis,</P>
    <P>(xi)  that the contractor establish and maintain an archive of recordings of proceedings, for which rules of access will be laid down by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges,</P>
    <P>(xii)  that televising of proceedings be authorised to commence as soon as possible after the 1990 Christmas <Col N="2166" /> recess and that broadcasting of proceedings of Committees meeting in public and not hearing evidence be authorised to commence as soon as possible thereafter, and</P>
    <P>(xiii)  that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges report to the House on its recommendations in regard to paragraphs (viii) and (ix) hereof, not later than October, 1990.</P>
    <P>The motion seeks the approval of the Seanad to a number of recommendations made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to provide for the televising of the proceedings of the Seanad. The contract of the televising of the Dáil proceedings was awarded by the Dáil to Windmill Lane Pictures following consideration of proposals submitted by RTE, Windmill Lane, Gandon and a consortium of Strongbow-Screen Scene.</P>
    <P>As the introduction of televising will involve considerable expenditure on equipment, installation, maintenance and production, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided that the best course open to the Seanad was to recommend the same approach as adopted by the Dáil and thereby, avail of the facilities to be provided for televising the Dáil.  The only sensible approach, particularly in regard to the considerable cost, involved, is for both Houses to share the facilities to be made available in Leinster House.  By expanding the contract with Windmill Lane Pictures Limited to include the televising of the Seanad proceedings, the optimum commercial advantage will accrue to Seanad Éireann in relation to the ordering, supply and the installation of the necessary equipment.  Furthermore, there will be considerable time saving in carrying out the necessary contractual work.</P>
    <P>The reason I am moving this motion now is to enable the installation and the construction work to take place during a period of recess with the minimum disruption to the working of the Seanad. The motion is being moved now so that formal approval for televising by the Seanad is in hand before a Supplementary Estimate to be taken in the <Col N="2167" /> Dáil &mdash; I believe that will be taken tomorrow &mdash; for the televising of the Dáil can include provision for the televising of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>To come back to the motion itself, many of its provisions are self-explanatory. Senator Lydon raised one particular matter.  He wanted to know what a &ldquo;clean feed&rdquo; meant.  Under the proposals for televised broadcasting a distinction is made between producing a signal as a clean feed and broadcasting the signal. Windmill Lane are being contracted to produce the signal to provide a clean feed for other broadcasting companies such as RTE and, in time, the independent TV channel, to broadcast under conditions to be laid down by our own Committee on Procedure and Privileges subject to the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>Under the motion a step-by-step or development approach to televising the Seanad is recommended.  The first step is to avail of the forthcoming summer recess to have the necessary technical equipment installed.  As I said already, this is the primary purpose of moving this motion now.  Secondly, the CPP are to draw up guidelines for the coverage, the type of programme and so on and to report back to the House not later than October this year.  The third step is to have an experimental period of the House broadcasting for Members monitors. The final step on foot of the successful experimental period is to commence televising itself.  I would not like at this stage to put a timescale on the latter two stages.  It is not vital that both Houses would commence televising at the same time.  That is unlikely at this stage and, in any event, may be a bit of a wasted effort in terms of public impact in that the Dáil is to commence with televising the budget.  Notwithstanding these considerations, the question of a commencement time is left open.</P>
    <P>The televising of the Seanad proceedings last year on 10 May in honour of the sitting in the refurbished Chamber threw up some technical difficulties peculiar to the Seanad Chamber and not apparent to the Dáil such as glare from <Col N="2168" /> the numerous windows and so on.  These problems will be addressed.  I am mentioning them now so as to set a mark as to our commencement time.  It is not as straightforward as a layman would think. When we go ahead everything must be right.  I would prefer to wait and ensure that the highest possible standards have been achieved to show that the proceedings of this House in the homes of our people is in the best light possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for his courtesy and graciousness in affording us this opportunity to discuss this important matter and, in deference to his courtesy, I will attempt to be brief.  It is not my intention to call a vote because that would be rather heartless at this time of the night.  I would like also to pay tribute to the members of the staff of the House who are working these unsocial hours with very good grace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly glad we are discussing this matter because I felt this morning it would be a pity if this very historic development was not marked, marked in a positive sense but also with some small degree of positive criticism.  I hope the development of television broadcasting of Seanad Éireann will lead to an increased perception by the people of Ireland of the value of Seanad Éireann, of which I certainly am aware and have been increasingly aware as a result of my participation in the House.  I say that because I have noticed, with regard to the radio broadcast of the proceedings of the Oireachtas, that of recent weeks there has been a consistent decline in the percentage of time awarded to Seanad Éireann.  Over the last couple of weeks it has dropped under 15 per cent.  Once or twice it was 20 per cent, once or twice we did not get a mention at all except for the bare statement that we actually met. Tonight it was about two and a half to three minutes which dealt with what, with all due deference to the people who actually tabled the amendment, was not the most important amendment on a very important Bill where there were some major developments with regard to an <Col N="2169" /> all-party agreement about the value of a particular amendment.  It is a pity that was not taken.  I am suggesting that, perhaps the committee that has been established, would make strong representations to the broadcasting company and that they would ensure that Seanad Éireann is treated with proper respect and with proper understanding of the significant contribution it makes to the political life of the country.</P>
    <P>I have to say that we do this, in a context which is not particularly helpful because it is quite clear to me from the way in which this emerged, &mdash; I completely accept what the Leader of the House said and I hold him totally guiltless in this regard &mdash; that once again the Seanad is being treated with complete contempt by the Dáil.  They have pushed ahead with their own arrangements for broadcasting of the Oireachtas as if they were the only House of the Oireachtas. A strong message should go from Seanad Éireann that they are not the only House of the Oireachtas, they are joint partners with us.  It is for this reason that I feel strongly about paragraph (ii) which says:</P>
    <P>that three Members of Seanad Éireann be appointed to the Broadcasting Control Committee established by Dáil Éireann on 30 March 1990 to make the necessary administrative and financial arrangements for televising of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>In other words, we are simply being added in at a late hour as an adjunct to the decisions that have already been made, apparently on behalf of the complete Oireachtas by one Chamber.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is good enough.  It is all of a pattern with the fact that we consistently have the presence of Ministers, who, whatever their excellence intellectually are not always the most appropriate in terms of their skills.  I am not making this, in a partisan sense.  I understand this has happened under all Administrations and there are sometimes practical reasons why this happens.  It is a pity.  I really hope all of us, acting together, can so enhance the dignity, the professionalism and efficiency of the <Col N="2170" /> Seanad that we will make it unlikely that these particular forms of contempt will arise again.</P>
    <P>I would like to enter one or two points rapidly with regard to some further provisions of the motion.  On paragraph (iii) on the appointment of Windmill Lane, I presume we have the opportunity not to appoint Windmill Lane for the Seanad.  I do not know.  I would like to feel we had that degree of room for manoeuvre. There is more than one television broadcasting company in the country, including RTE, who could do this.  Again, the decision has been taken outside Seanad Éireann and we are simply faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>.  I do not want to criticise Windmill Lane.  I have had some association with them and the facilities they develop for both sound and visual recording are quite superb and a great addition to the country but it was notable that they did not seem capable of televising the Mandela visit in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph (iv), I would like the House to realise I am not pettyfogging but this is gramatically strange.  It says: &ldquo;that the television system be supplied by the contractor on a lease contract may be renewed&rdquo;&mdash; I think that should be &ldquo;which may be renewed&rdquo;, otherwise it does not make sense.  It may not affect the legal import but it really is not grammar at all &mdash;&ldquo;at the discretion of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;, the comma should be a semi-colon.  Those two amendments will make sense of it.  I do not know if it is possible to make them.  I draw them to the attention of the House because that is my particular expertise.</P>
    <P>Finally, on paragraph (vi) &mdash;&ldquo;that copyright of all material be vested in the Houses of the Oireachtas,&rdquo;&mdash; this is a claim that is <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the Oireachtas because some of us do, occasionally to the irritation of other Members, quote, for example, from works of literature in which the Oireachtas cannot possibly be held to hold rights of copyright for those quotations. I am not convinced that legally, in regard to paragraph (vi) we can make <Col N="2171" /> this claim in its entirety in the form that it is made.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome this opportunity for Seanad Éireann to shine in the eyes of the public.  I have no doubt some of us, including myself, will occasionally be absurd or a little bit flippant but if it is treated with balance by the recording company, then the people of Ireland will realise that they get a very good deal from Seanad Éireann and that the standards of debate, both in terms of hard, technical content and in terms of oratory, are at least as good as the other House.  I would like to thank the Acting Chairman and the Leader for so courteously making time available this evening.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  I welcome very much this motion, if I can call it that.  I have just come back from Hungary and it strikes me as quite extraordinary that on Hungarian television we could see every evening the proceedings and the voting procedures of the Hungarian Parliament.  Television is the most effective and pervasive medium the western world and it is quite extraordinary that this Oireachtas is one of the last parliaments in the world to be televised. Maybe it is an indication of our lack of self-confidence that it has taken us so long to make available to the general public the proceedings in this House and in the Oireachtas in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Norris's views in relation to radio coverage of the proceedings of this House.  I have noted over recent weeks that some of the matters which we discussed, and which I would consider to be of grave importance, got very limited coverage on RTE.  Perhaps <Col N="2172" /> they were trying to make a point in relation to other matters which are germane to their activities.  I submit that televising the proceedings of this House and the other House is long overdue. People should be able to see what our Legislature is about.  It is the essence of democracy that they should be able to see how Parliament conducts itself, or at times mis-conducts itself.</P>

      <P>I realise for Senator O'Toole that would never be the case. Television is the most telling medium and we should have enough confidence in ourselves as parliamentarians to submit ourselves to the scrutiny of the electorate every evening through the medium of television.  I hope we can advance this matter expeditiously so that the people can see what happens in this House and, ultimately, in the Dáil as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am very anxious to place on record my support for the televising of Seanad Éireann.  Over the last few months we debated and gave more time to global issues, Third World issues, NESC reports and so on than the Dáil ever gave to what I would consider very relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Norris, I feel it was rather presumptuous of the Dáil to look for coverage just for that House.  It is very important that we, in the Upper House, should press for what we would consider adequate coverage, because not alone is the level of debate in this House as good, if not better, than in the Dáil, but the Seanad Chamber would lend itself to television. For many people who have not had an opportunity to visit Seanad Éireann surely the debates within the hallowed and extraordinarily attractive surroundings would make for excellent coverage.  I support the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cutting down of radio time given to Seanad Éireann is disappointing particularly when we just have two newspapers covering our regular contributions. It would put us on the map.  It would show that we are as relevant as <Col N="2173" /> the other House.  It is interesting that in Britain the House of Lords got television coverage before the other Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>With my colleagues, I welcome the televising of Seanad Éireann.  As somebody who sat on a committee many years ago that decided to bring in broadcasting, I recall quite clearly the opposition to the broadcasting of either House.  I was supportive then of broadcasting and, I had confidence in both Houses, and especially in Seanad Éireann.  I was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the joint committee &mdash; I think, I was Leas-Chathaoirleach at the time, but I am not sure &mdash; and I had strong views which at the time were not popular.  I do not know who had fears of broadcasting the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I will be brief.  I hope there will be some kind of monitoring system and that, because it was the Seanad that set the ball rolling for broadcasting the proceedings of the two Houses, and not the Dáil &mdash; I would like to put that on record &mdash; I would hate to find us treated as the poor relation.  I better be careful because I get votes there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a strong responsibility immediately laid on the shoulders of the three appointed Members to see that the Seanad gets proper coverage and, at some time they should and must come back to the floor of the House to make sure that we are satisfied.</P>
      <P>With regard to my colleagues commenting on the amount of time we are getting from RTE on coverage of the Seanad, I thought &mdash; I am often wrong and maybe I am wrong now again &mdash; there was some way we would be able to go back if we had a strong criticism that the Seanad was not getting proper coverage. None of us fears the cameras coming into the Seanad.  Like Senator Jackman I believe it will do a lot for all of us if we have television cameras here and I welcome this development.</P>
      <P>I put it on record tonight that the three Senators who sit on this committee will have a great responsibility to make sure that this House gets justice.  We were the people who set the trend towards broadcasting our proceedings when not too many wanted it and we should now, at least, get our fair share.  It is not right that RTE, Windmill Lane or anybody else should use the Seanad to get the television cameras in and then not cover the Seanad.  The Dáil has been televised already on the occasion of visits of Heads of State such as President Mitterrand, President Kennedy and President Reagan and the proceedings of the Seanad were televised when we assembled in our newly refurbished Chamber.  I understand these programmes were successful.  I welcome this motion, but I put the marker down to the three Senators and their responsibility to the rest of us and to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be that the reason we do not get the coverage on RTE is because we would be boring, irrelevant and not newsworthy and we might just be bottom of the TAM ratings.  I am not saying that we are, of course, but I <Col N="2175" /> just voice the thought.  Until such time as we order business in a newsy, attractive and viewer-friendly way we can expect to be treated in the same way.  We have had proposals put before this House for a long time on how we might introduce items that are topical and suggestions have been made on how we might order our business in a way that would create an interest for a wider audience.  Until we do that we cannot expect, as a matter of right, that viewers will accept us.</P>
      <P>In a sense, we put ourselves above criticism.  Why do we need to monitor in this case?  Are we afraid of being ridiculed by the population?  These rules, which are not included in this motion, as to how the recordings may be used, the very careful way in which they are to be dealt with by the recording company in case they are used for any kind of a satirical programme or in any way that might show us in a somewhat less than a pleasant light, are surely a reflection on the quality of the contributions.  I am just making the point that we may be overly defensive.</P>
      <P>As my colleague Senator Norris said, I believe we can stand on the quality of the contributions we make and take our chances in the wide world.  In doing that we also need to be absolutely certain in our own minds that if we are going in to meet the media, if we are going into the TAM ratings business, we need to make our contributions more interesting, attractive and topical.  That is the reality of life.  It is a marketplace out there, as they keep telling us from the other side of the House.  If it is a marketplace, let us get in there and give them a product that will woo the viewers.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an leagan Gaeilge den rún atá os ár gcomhair ceart ar an bpointe a phlé an Seanadóir Norris, mar go bhfuil an &ldquo;a&rdquo; ansin: &ldquo;go gcuirfidh an conráitheoir ... leasa / conartha do thréimhse cúig bliana, a fhéadfar a athnuachan de rogha Sheanad Éireann...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said those few words, I want to deal in a serious way with some of the other issues dealt with here.  I believe it <Col N="2176" /> is outragous the way this matter is being dealt with by the Government Chief Whip in the other House, who has &mdash; I am saying this for the record &mdash; carefully excluded the officers of this House, the Clerk of this House and representation from the Members of this House in the discussions so far on the televising of Oireacthas proceedings.  I raised this at the current Committee on Procedure and Privileges and at the previous committee as Senator Honan will confirm.  Senator Honan is as aware of this as I am, but perhaps I have more freedom to make the points.  The reality is that the CPP of the Seanad proposed that the Clerk of this House would sit on the committee organising this whole issue.  That was not acceptable either to the Government of the day or the Chief Whip who run the CPP of the other House.  I do not know which it was but I find it utterly unacceptable. The fact is that we are coming in on the coat-tails of the Dáil at this stage.  The reality is that during the week when this House was being televised on the first day of its return to this Chamber, the Members of the other House decided they would go to Canada to see how the proceedings of Parliament might be covered by television.  That is utterly and totally unacceptable.  Our attitude should be that we now present a product that is newsy and worth presenting; therefore, we demand our time on the national media, we then demand on this monitoring committee proper representation in terms of broadcasting time for the proceedings of this House.  It is as simple as that.  With regard to the people on the committee, they will have to be people who will put the boot in hard if they do not agree with what is going on.  I do not see any signs of that around, but it will be done from these benches without a shadow of a doubt.  If this House is not getting representation, we will demand it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to paragraph (iii)  of the motion, that Windmill Lane Pictures Limited be engaged under contract. I am a realist and a pragmatist. Windmill Lane are the operators.  I could say a lot about how they became to be <Col N="2177" /> the operators and much of it will be relevant to the present discussion on the Broadcasting Bill.  I have supported RTE to do this right from the beginning.  I thought the presentation RTE made to the CPP of the Dáil was deplorable, and I have said that to the people in RTE. Nevertheless, I believe that Windmill Lane got it for other reasons which had more to do with politics than with anything else.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris made a passing reference to the coverage of the Mandela visit last week.  The Mandela visit was to be covered by Windmill Lane Pictures; that was the decision of the CPP of the Dáil.  Windmill Lane Pictures were not able to cover it and RTE had to be asked to present their cameras and do the coverage.  RTE presented the coverage last week; if any Senators looked closely they could see the RTE logo on the cameras covered over with tape.  I also want to point out that the coverage was not seen outside this country; it was the first time that coverage of Oireachtas proceedings in this House was not sold abroad.  It was not sold abroad because the people with the capacity to enter into that venture &mdash; in other words, RTE &mdash; were not involved in the selling of it and, therefore, it was not sold to any other European country.  That is for the record as I know it and I stand to be corrected on it.  I intend to find out about it.  This was appalling and what we are going into worries me slightly.</P>
    <P>When the design and installations for this House were being decided and discussed in the CPP of the previous Administration, we made proposals.  We discussed at length the fact that the sound, light and camera installation points in this Chamber would be suitable, without any further costs, for television. We now find they are not.  That is appalling. I would like to put on the record that the previous CPP under the Chair of Senator Honan, at the time, made it quite clear that all the preparations should be made.  I find it appalling that it is now costing thousands of pounds to get that underway.  I believe, however, that instead of carping about the level of <Col N="2178" /> coverage, we should seriously address the matter of preparation of a product that will be acceptable in the marketplace and will draw its own audience.  I welcome the proposal and ask the CPP to get the matter underway as quickly as possible. I support the motion.  I hope it will be put into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>If there is even the slightest attempt to begin in one House and ignore the other, we will be leading the charge from here. We hope that the words that were spoken tonight will be backed up by actions later. Somebody needs to tell the Government what we are about and we will have the first test of it when we come back after the summer recess.  The reality is that the person who chairs this committee is also the person who doles our legislation to either House.  We have had less legislation introduced in this House in the past year than we have had in any year over the past five years.  Until such time as the people on the other side put pressure on the Government to insist that legislation is initiated in this House and that the news is created in this House we cannot whinge, worry and complain if the news media do not find what we have to say attractive.  It is up to us to prepare the product.  It is up to us to insist on coverage. It is put to us to make it work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the proposal to televise the proceedings of this House.  It is high time that was done.  I would say a word of caution because I do not think there is any great demand from the general public for the proceedings of either House of the Oireachtas to be recorded.  I listened to the recording of the House of Commons proceedings and it did not impress me.  The same would apply to many listeners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that enacting legislation is very serious business.  It will not get high TAM ratings or anything like that but that should not be a matter for concern. We have to be cautious.  I am quite satisfied that unless we are very careful, certain Members of the House will take over a lot of the broadcasting time and very often it is not the people who make the greatest contribution to legislation or to <Col N="2179" /> the proceedings of the House who get that kind of coverage.  I hope when this comes about we will get more time than we are getting at present on the radio programme.  I listened a few times recently to that programme and I was amazed that out of 40 minutes or thereabouts broadcasting time only 3 minutes were devoted to the proceedings of the Seanad.  Those who represent this House on the committee must make sure that we will get a fair share of the broadcasting time.</P>

In so far as the motion is concerned, Members can rest assured that there are many inbuilt safeguards to ensure that the House will have the best televised system which will best reflect the interests of the Seanad and its Members.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for waiting for such a long time.  I wonder if he has ever had <Col N="2180" /> to wait in this House until 12.40 a.m. for a motion on the Adjournment.  I think he realises it was because of the previous motion for which a half an hour had to be found at some time in the sitting.  I thank him very much for his patience.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because I am asking the Minister to confer official sanction or and give formal approval to Kilfinane education centre in County Limerick. Both he and Minister O'Rourke visited the centre and I know they have been very enthusiastic in their expression of support for it.  I am requesting formal approval of the centre.  I ask the Minister if it would now merit a director to run it.</P>
      <P>It has been in operation as a successful outdoor education centre since 1982.  It has acquired a tremendous reputation since its development by the County Limerick VEC, of which I am a member. The CEO at that time instead of just looking at what might have become a derelict site, as was the case in many parts of the county where many of these buildings were allowed to fall into dereliction, had the foresight to develop it. It is now a centre of integrated development and is an infrastructural gem in an underdeveloped, though beautifully scenic region.  It is on the borderland of County Limerick and Cork.</P>
      <P>It started small but it has developed as a language centre with European students visiting regularly which obviously shows that the centre anticipated 1992 a long time before 1992 became a buzz word.  There are many international students, German, French, etc.  coming there on an annual basis. That is extraordinary in a country where up to now the facilities for educational development and language development were always in urban areas.  That is one innovative aspect which preceded the demand for second languages for students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It provides a second chance education in a rural area.  Again, second chance education is usually associated with large urban areas, towns, cities, etc.  It also provides adult literacy classes, which is very important in rural areas, and a full range of services and facilities which have <Col N="2181" /> been expanded and developed over the years.  There are various courses &mdash; orienteering, hill walking, rock climbing, sailing, camping, canoeing, English and a foreign language, cultural activities, boat sailing, bowling, caving, forest walks, nature trails, gym and green activities and field studies.  It has obviously a very comprehensive range of activities.</P>
    <P>The centre is very well appointed with excellent facilities and a high standard of service.  I had occasion over a period of two years to go there regularly, once every three weeks, for in-service in relation to development education.  It shows the excellence of the service that teachers from the four corners of the country actually converged on Kilfinane rather than going to a hotel because of the privacy and the facilities it afforded us.  Its remoteness in a scenic area meant we could apply our minds to curriculum development.  It is interesting that it is seen as a haven where you can escape from disturbances and distractions and can apply yourself to the task in hand.</P>
    <P>Kilfinane is a town that has seen better days.  It had fine shops which, unfortunately, have fallen into disrepair.  It is interesting that it is an area of fairly rich farmland but this centre has now brought an infusion of life to a sleepy town and it has contributed extraordinarily well to the development of a local rural tourism co-operative.  Within the context of the mid-western plan for tourist development Ballyhoura is one of the key areas for development and has moved very quickly in relation to agri-tourism and associated services.  Kilfinane is extremely busy and popular and when I was teaching it was necessary to book 12 months in advance if you were going for a weekend of outdoor activities.  I taught in an inner city school but there was a 12 months waiting list even though we were in County Limerick.  One could imagine the length of time those outside the county had to wait.</P>
    <P>Nowadays we are far more aware of the importance of outdoor education in the curriculum which shows that Kilfinane was ahead of its time.  Their facilities lend themselves very much towards <Col N="2182" /> this area.  There are unusual features in the centre which you do not find in other education centres.  For instance, there is an arboretum and a herbarium.  There are facilities for croquet, a sporting activity associated with Victorian days but it has made a come back in Kilfinane.  Likewise there are more modern facilities such as a gymnasium, and there are activities like archery, gymnastics, squash and so on. There are formal grounds which facilitate bowling as well as croquet and golf.</P>
    <P>The accommodation is very satisfactory and in the vicinity there are guest-houses and Irish cottage type holiday houses.  In other words, it has led to the development of the area.  This is extraordinary for an education centre. As a member of County Limerick VEC I am aware of the potential of Kilfinane, as are the many people who use it.  The area in which it is located is considered to be remote even though it is only 26 miles south-east of Limerick.  It is not quite on a national route.  It could be developed still further in conjunction with another scenic and archaeologically important spot, Loch Gur, and with Slievefelim and would be competition for Bunratty.</P>
    <P>What I am really looking for is a commitment from the Minister that formal approval will be given to Kilfinane.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Jackman for the positive contribution she has made to this debate on the development of Kilfinane Outdoor Education Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 a working group recommended the establishment of outdoor pursuit centres and education centres throughout the country.  Unfortunately, right up to the time I took office in 1987 the previous Government decided that it would not be possible to give financial support to the eight outdoor pursuit centres which had been established by my Department. Consequently when I took over in the Department of Education I found that seven of the centres had closed and the final one in Cappanalea in County Kerry was due to close.  I looked at the potential <Col N="2183" /> of those centres both from the point of view of the outdoor education facilities they provided for young people and their tourism potential.  I decided that I should attempt to convince the Government that finance should be made available for the re-establishment of those centres, for their proper staffing and indeed for their development.</P>
    <P>As a result of a proposal that I made to Government, funding of £400,000 was made available in 1988 for staffing.  This resulted in the centres at Achill, the Burren, Birr, Cappanalea, County Kerry, Gartan in Donegal, Kinsale, Petersburg in Galway and Shielbeggan in Wexford being identified as the eight recognised outdoor pursuit centres in the country.  One of the conditions I placed on all those centres was that they should become active in the private sector market with a view to generating substantial funds towards their further development.  I am pleased to say that all centres took on the challenge of not alone providing outdoor education for the children in their catchment areas but in providing a very important part of the tourist infrastructure of their region, and consequently generated quite a significant amount of income.</P>
    <P>Kilfinane Outdoor Education Centre located in the Ballyhoura countryside of south-east Limerick, as the Senator said, was not one of those which was chosen in the original eight.  It operates on an all year round basis and provides a range of facilities for hill walking, rock climbing, canoeing, orienteering, etc.  While the centre specialises primarily in outdoor education, it has also been centrally involved in developing the local community tourism co-operative.  County Limerick VEC have made continuous representations to the Department to have Kilfinane centre added to the network <Col N="2184" /> of centres already in receipt of funds from the proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator that when I visited the Kilfinane centre following numerous requests from local Deputies Gerard Collins and Michael Noonan and the CEO of the VEC, Seán Burke, some months ago, I was very impressed not only by the developments which had taken place in the centre but also by the initiatives which were taken by the community in that part of south-east Limerick in their Ballyhoura Fáilte development. I must say that not alone was I impressed by the work that is being done there by the local community, but I feel that this is a pointer to the rest of the country on the way development in rural tourism should take place.</P>
    <P>Following my visit I undertook to examine further the proposal from Limerick VEC that we should consider Kilfinane as a centre of outdoor education. I was glad to announce a couple of months ago that I had decided to recognise Kilfinane as an outdoor education centre and that we would provide funds from our Department towards the staffing of the centre.  Recognition of the centre is dependent on the Department of Finance agreeing to my proposal to include Kilfinane in the network of outdoor education centres currently in receipt of funding.  I have recently sought the approval of the Department of Finance for the inclusion of the centre and at present I await their approval for its inclusion.</P>
