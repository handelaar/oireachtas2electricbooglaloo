      <P>I have notice from Senator Tony McKenna that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that approved extension to the primary school, at Carrig, Birr, County Offaly, is completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Pól Ó Foighil of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the <Col N="3" /> Environment to make funds available to bodies of approved status for the annual maintenance of accommodation built under section 5 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make provisions for the retention of the Health Research Board Laboratories in Trinity College, Dublin, which has made a huge contribution through fundamental research in combating leprosy and other diseases.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that proper safety standards are maintained in large, old vehicles which have a capacity to carry passengers.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator John Dardis of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide Kilcullen, County Kildare, with a northern access road off the new motorway by-pass of that town.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McKenna, Norris, Ross, Ó Foighil, Costello and Upton as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McKenna's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ross, Ó Foighil, Costello and Upton may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Dardis is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 4 as the first item &mdash; the Criminal Law Rape) (Amendment) Bill &mdash; and <Col N="4" /> the intention is to continue that debate until 6 o'clock.  From 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. we will have a sos followed by motion 89, the Independent motion and statements in relation to motion 79.  If we find that Item No. 4 concludes before 6 o'clock we may move into the statements on motion 79 and continue then after 8 o'clock.  In regard to that matter, I am suggesting &mdash; and I understand there is agreement &mdash; that the first speaker will speak for 20 minutes and each speaker thereafter for 15 minutes.  These are statements.  We are saying two hours, but obviously if you feel that you want an extension to three hours we can agree on that, but certainly we are saying two hours at this time.</P>

      <P>Before I come to the detail of today's business may I express the pleasure of my group at the appointment of Miss Deirdre Lane as Clerk of the House and wish her every success. We know she will be a splendid Clerk. At the risk of being childish at this moment, a Chathaoirligh, may I point out that when the legislation that governs the appointments of the Clerk and Clerk Assistant was being put through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the fifties a categoric assurance was given then that the leaders of the Opposition parties would be consulted in that process.  There may have been an oversight, but that certainly did not happen.  While the outcome would certainly have been the same, and the new clerk will have all our full support, I regret that the promise given then was not carried through on this occasion.  I suspect it may have been an oversight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I comment, first of all that I was not aware of any such commitment having been given and the advice given me by the former Clerk of the Seanad in connection with this matter was set down in a certain form and that form was strictly adhered to. This, and the advice given, and not having knowledge of any commitment given&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely accept what <Col N="5" /> the Cathaoirleach says.  Perhaps we could have this matter raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges later so that it can be clarified.  In any event, the outcome is as it would have been.</P>
      <P>We are not agreeing to the Order of Business today, as was made clear at the Whips meeting last week.  Before I get into the reason, could I have clarification from the Leader of the House about the time limit on speeches on Motion 79? Our Whip is not aware that any agreement was made.  Perhaps the Whips could talk about it afterwards, but certainly we have not agreed to any time limit on speeches on Motion 79.  The Leader of the House said there would be statements on Motion 79 and that indicates there will not be a vote.</P>
      <P>The reason we are opposing the Order of Business today, and will do so tomorrow and Friday, is because of warnings I have been giving here for the past three or four weeks, and warnings which have come from all groups on this side of the House, about the way in which it is intended to deal with the Companies Bill. The Companies Bill, as everybody knows, is in effect a new Bill.  It comes back here with 297 amendments from the Dáil Committee.  It left here over two years ago.  It is a very different Bill to the Bill which left this House.  Under the procedures under which the Bill will be debated people will be allowed to make statements on the different parts of the Bill, but there can only be one vote and that is at the end.</P>
      <P>There is no way in which anything said in this House will in any way alter the content of that Bill; in other words, we are being given a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said two or three weeks ago that the Bill would be on the Statute Book before Christmas. The Leader of the House at that stage said to us that he would consider whether we could recommit it to Committee Stage or whether some way could be found in which this Bill could be looked at in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arrived from the Dáil at the beginning of this week.  The debates on Report Stage in the Dáil have not yet <Col N="6" /> been published.  Many of the major newspapers and the professional groups have said that this Bill is still defective, that there are important items to be addressed in it.  What we are being asked to do is put this Bill through in less than two days here in an extremely restricted debate, a Report Stage debate.  We are being asked to have a Report Stage debate on a Bill which effectively has not gone through Committee or indeed through Second Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>I and the other groups here have said that we do not want to be obstuctive but we want to do our duty.  It would be better if we just put this Bill through on the nod rather than go through the charade of being here for two days and speaking at length in a way which will have no effect whatsoever on the Bill, knowing that the Minister simply wants to get it out and on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>What we are being asked to do is to participate in a charade which is clearly in contempt of this House and my group will have no part in that.  For that reason we will be opposing the Order of Business today, tomorrow and Friday unless the Leader of the House can convene the Whips after the Order of Business today and see if something satisfactory can be arranged.</P>
    <P>For example, our spokesman on Industry and Commerce got the Bill yesterday and got the amendments today.  He has not even got a weekend &mdash; we are meeting on Friday &mdash; to go through the Bill. It is totally unsatisfactory and for that reason we will oppose the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Creidim go gcuirfear tús amárach leis an gcóras nua craolachán teilifíse agus cuirim fáilte roimhe. Is oth liom go mór, afách, nach bhfuil <Col N="7" /> aon chóras aistriúcháin ar fáil go fóill. Tá breis agus bliain gafa thart anois ó d'árdaigh an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil an cheist seo.  Ní fheicim go bhfuil aon dul ar aghaidh déanta agus beidh sé scannalach má bhíonn ar an Seanadóir dul ar bhóthar na cúirte chun a chearta bunreachtúla a bhaint amach.</P>
      <P>It is customary on the Order of Business to urge debates about violations of human rights in other countries.  We should also note the beam in our own eye.  I asked the Leader of the House to bring to the attention of the Government that many Members on this side support the call by Amnesty International &mdash; I speak as a hawk on law and order, but I do support this and I am very uneasy about it &mdash; in the last few days for an inquiry into the alleged Garda ill-treatment of those arrested for the Sallins mail train robbery.  I should like to know whether the Government will respond to our concern on that.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that two days of varied business last week went virtually unreported in the press while extensive coverage was given to a relatively trivial argument on the Order of Business.  I am not for a moment suggesting that we should dictate to the press.  Obviously, the press will have to do whatever is its job, it will have to supply what it considers to be of most entertainment value to its readers as well of information value. But it certainly should concern us that the image of the House which is thus presented will bring into further disrepute, I think, the already indifferent public perception of the Seanad.  Not so long ago, one columnist contemptuously described this House as a &ldquo;one ring circus&rdquo;.  I think the ringmaster and the clowns should take note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to request the leader of the House to give very serious consideration to the points raised by Senator Manning.  I hope, a Chathaoirligh, that you will bear with me and keep in mind that I am my party's spokesman on Industry and Commerce.  For that reason I am expected, if the Leader of the House and <Col N="8" /> the Government party have their way to deal tomorrow and Friday with a most complex piece of legislation.  I asked at the Whips meeting, and I am repeating that appeal today to the Leader of the House, to please recommit the Companies Bill to Committee Stage in Seanad Éireann.  Very briefly, a Chathaoirligh, my difficulty, as I said, is that I am my party's spokesman on this side.  I have received both the amendments and the Bill this morning.  Therefore, if the proposal from the Leader of the House goes through, I have only a matter of hours this evening to deal with this proposed legislation, to read through it and to consider my position on it &mdash; a piece of legislation that occupied 21 days sittings of the Dáil Committee.</P>
      <P>It is very important legislation and we on this side of the House want to do justice to it but I feel we are not being given the opportunity of making the contribution that would be expected of us. I also wish to make the point that by requesting the Seanad to deal in two days with a Bill that took 21 days to be dealt with in the Dáil Committee is a reflection on the independence, capacity and the integrity of Seanad Éireann.  Therefore, I am urging as strongly as I can on the Leader of the House to consider this afternoon my request to recommit this Bill.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would point out that it is a Bill with almost 300 amendments to it since it left this House.  Incidentally, I was not a member of the Seanad that dealt with this legislation, and that is an added disadvantage.  Of the 300 amendments that have been made to the Bill, almost two-thirds of them have come from the Minister.  Fundamentally, therefore it is a new Bill.  It is not the Bill that the Seanad dealt with previously; it is an entirely new measure.  It is a most complex and important piece of legislation. Therefore, it is important that the Seanad, in its role as a review Chamber, would be given every opportunity to do itself justice and to do the legislation justice.  I earnestly ask the Leader of the House to consider my request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to motion No. 79, which deals with a matter of human rights.  I am always puzzled by the fact that when there is another motion down dealing with human rights we jump from one item to another and there is not continuity on matters of social concern. For example, we have now a statement on the outcome of a court case.  I know it could be confusing to have the whole lot discussed, but there should be an opportunity to deal with motion No. 89, which also deals with human rights. People who are alone also come under human rights, so I believe there should be continuity in that respect.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have to oppose the Order of Business today, even though we have had a very good working relationship with the Government Whip, Senator Wright.  He has been very helpful and cooperative. I explained to him beforehand and we came to an agreement of sorts that it would be necessary, because of the build-up of pressure this week from the Judiciary and others, to look at motion No. 87 and dispose of it.  If we are going to let it hang the same way as we have left hang the matter of the decision of the European Court of Justice on the rights of homosexuals, then we will be arguing about it for many days.  We have a special reason for this &mdash; we are being pressured &mdash; and therefore we are going to stay at it until we get some satisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Senator speaking from the other side of the House indicated that it was customary to allow statements to be made in regard to breaches of human rights in any part of the world. Would the Cathaoirleach be kind enough to clarify this for me?  I have raised this matter previously and I would appreciate very much your ruling and decision on it. Would you clarify for me the position about papers laid before the House?  I refer in particular to the Road Traffic (Liceensing of Trailers and Semi-Trailers) (Amendment) Regulations, 1990. This is a subject of major importance and I believe that it is one on which this House would have a view to express.  I am going on the simple philosophy that if there is <Col N="10" /> an order for a paper to be laid before the House I do not see the purpose of laying the paper before the House if there is no provision for the House to comment upon such a paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say first of all that of course I agree with Senator Manning that the suggestion &mdash; indeed, Senator Howard put it very eloquently &mdash; that the Companies Bill should be rushed through would be outrageous.  I am glad to see Fine Gael returning to the natural role of an Opposition, given their somewhat suspect role in setting up one of my colleagues to be effectively demolished by the Leader of the House last week.  I am glad to see that they are no longer in any sort of involvement with the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Senator Harte move an amendment to the Order of Business? If he did, I want to second it; if he did not, I want to move it.  He did?  I want to second Senator Harte's motion that item No. 87 be taken today.  I think there is an overwhelming reason for this, given the horrific content of the report of the Prison Visiting Committee in Mount joy.  To have 15 year old girls locked up in that environment is a disgrace and would be a disgrace in the most primitive countries in the world.  It is time it was stopped.  It should stop now.  We do not need major legislation.  I would appeal to the Leader of the House in the interests of the relevance of this House to have the matter of our prisons discussed at the earliest possible time.  It is no longer suitable as Private Members' Business.  It is too big, too serious and too fundamental.  It is a reflection on the country.  It is not a small <Col N="11" /> domestic issue.  The treatment of prisoners in those circumstances is a reflection on civilisation in this country and it should end immediately.  That report is among the most horrific that has ever been published in my lifetime.  It is a scandal and we should have an immediate debate on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  May I also ask, Sir, and I beg your indulgence on this, if it would be possible for the Leader of the House to do something that I think he would like to do but which may not be entirely relevant to the Order of Business?  Could he take up with the Minister for the Environment the fact that there is £.5 million, allocated to alleviating the plight of the homeless, sitting in the Department of the Environment, which will not be spent this year and which will be returned to the Department of Finance in three weeks and, given what Senator Ó Foighil attempted to raise on the Order of Business, could he take up with the Minister the question of that money being used in the time that remains?  It is available under section 10. It has not been used, or availed of.  It would be scandalous if the homeless were left without the effective distribution of £.5 million because of bureaucratic delays.  I would ask the Leader of the House to pursue the matter with the Minister in the three weeks that remain to see that that money does not return to the Department of Finance, as it has done on at least one previous occasion.  It is not something that either we, or the <Col N="12" /> Leader or the Minister for the Environment, I am sure, would like to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in regard to two matters.  On the Order Paper, item No. 2 is the Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill, 1990.  My understanding is that Lord Altamount recently circulated Members of this House with a very adequate and succinct explanatory memorandum about the background to this case.  I would urge the Leader of the House to see that this matter comes before the Seanad as soon as possible.  If is his general response he might refer to this I would be greatly obliged.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to raise is that I agree with Senators Manning and Howard in relation to the Companies Bill, because my understanding is that the Minister wants it to have very quick passage through this House.  Given that next week will be the last week we will be sitting before Christmas, I applaud you for having allowed some brief discusions in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would regard it as entirely inadequate that we have only a Report Stage dealing with this issue.  It goes back to the fundamental nature of what this Seanad is about, the Upper Chamber, a supposed Chamber of vocational interest.  My mind goes back to membership of the Seanad over a decade ago when in areas such as Companies Bills we had Senators such as Alexis Fitzgerald and Eoin Ryan who, because of their eminence in this particular area were allowed weeks by the Cathaoirleach and by the Leader of the House to tease out the <i>minutae</i> of legislation such as this.  I would have thought that this is the prime purpose of the Seanad, a reflective Chamber which can reflect in a vocational and in a non-political sense.  The other point is that in business circles this Companies Bill is regarded as the most fundamental legislation that is going through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to cut across Senator Staunton, but I must point out that we are dealing with something that is not on the Order of Business today.  I have given considerable latitude <Col N="13" /> to Senator Manning and to Senator Howard because of the special position that Senator Howard pleaded.  I would ask Senator Staunton, in the interest of trying to get the Order of Business concluded, to be as brief as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always found the Cathaoirleach tolerant; three more sentences will do me and there is the precedent of my two colleagues before me. This is effectively a new Bill.  Since it was last in the Seanad 297 amendments have been made to it.  It is a Bill which contains 12 pages in the index alone, with 262 sections of the most fundamentally important legislation.  The final point I wish to make is that we must do justice to this Seanad in allowing an adequate debate on this Bill.  At issue is our own relevance.  If the Leader of the House chooses to push this through with a rapid guillotine we are merely signifying our own irrelevance.  I would say to the Leader &mdash; he is a very reasonable person and we do not want to make trouble here &mdash; that on reflection he might accede to the views being expressed here for a lengthy debate on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the decision of the Leader of the House to place on our Order of Business for today motion No. 79, proposed by Senator Norris and Senator Shane Ross for the opportunity for statements to be made.  I would like to raise another matter in relation to motions on the Order of Business.  A motion tabled by one or other, or both, of the same Senators has now, I am glad to say, been withdrawn.  It was a motion based on very erroneous information regarding the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, picked up on Saturday in a major cross-channel newspaper.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House what is the procedure for removing motions from the Order of Paper.  I am glad that this motion has now been removed but I think it stayed on the Order Paper for a fairly considerable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to add my congratulations to Miss Lane on her appointment.  I will not deal with the issue as regards the Companies Bill but as a new Senator I found it is virtually impossible over the last few days to go through that weighty document.  I certainly add my support to the points made by the Fine Gael Senators.  My major concern is to put a question to the Leader of the House regarding the long promised debate on education.</P>
      <P>Last week in Private Members Time, at least six Senators did not get an opportunity to speak, not because of lack of interest on their part but because of there were only three hours allowed between the two weeks.  Because of that and the subsequent publication of the report of the Primary School Review Body and the recommendations that emanated from that, I am asking for a specific date in January on which Senators who have not yet spoken and who still wish to debate a matter that will be very important for 1991, will get an opportunity to do so in a full debate on education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate our new Clerk and wish her many years of happy association in her present job with the Seanad.  I, too, would express major concern about the manner in which the Companies Bill is being reintroduced into this House.  The Bill has been changed essentially and fundamentally in the other House.  The idea that it can be railroaded through the House in a space of two days or less certainly does not do justice to the Bill in physical terms or in its importance.  To give due respect to this House a more appropriate length of time is required in order to ensure that the Bill can be discussed, having regard to the fact that it has essentially changed in nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Leader of the House in bringing foward motion No. 79 on the question of human rights in relation to homosexuality.  I would also fully endorse motion No. 89, which deals with the other area of human rights.  That motion has been proposed and seconded and is the first item on the Order of Business today. <Col N="15" /> Hardly a week has gone by that there has not been a crisis in the prison system. Now the official visiting committee have made a report describing horrific conditions in prisons the least we can do is to give that report the authority, acknowledgment and status of being debated here so that we can all discuss it rather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again, I must remind the Senator that he is engaging in a speech.  In fairness to everybody, he should put a question to the Leader and allow him to reply to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I put a question which is twofold.  I would ask the Leader of the House to make it the first item on the Order of Business, secondly, that a committee of the House would appoint representatives from each of the parties to visit the prisons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a process in this House whereby Senators can make such a proposal.  The Senator is not using the Order of Business for the purpose for which it is intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I also would like the debate on Education to be extended.  It was impossible to have the length of debate required having regard to the crisis that exists in education at present.</P>

      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Miss Lane on her appointment.  She is a neighbour of mine in County Tipperary and she comes from that famous historical parish of Lorrha which has that knack of producing excellent people at times.  We are extremely fortunate in having someone of her calibre to take over from Mr. Coughlan.  I wish her long years of success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to congratulate Miss Lane on her appointment to the top civil service post she now occupies. To the best of my knowledge, she is the first of my gender to occupy the <Col N="16" /> post.  I wish her well.  It is not before its time that we had a woman of her calibre in the post.  I hope she has all health and happiness for many years here in the Seanad.  These are heartfelt remarks.</P>
      <P>We welcome the opportunity to discuss motion No. 79.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House when we can expect the Second Stage of item No. 3, a most important piece of legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator was forgetting about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not forgetting about it.  This is a most important piece of legislation that all of us have been requesting for some time.  I would like to have some assurances that it will receive priority in this House as soon as we return after Christmas and that there will be no attempt to short-circuit or circumvent discussion on any of its Stages in this House because.  It is a Bill to which we all have to do justice, for reasons that are self-explanatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy raised a most important point when he questioned the limited coverage of a very small item last week in the Seanad.  Could I just add to that a point that been made to me?  I live in a rural constituency.  Perhaps the vast majority of Senators do, I am taking a risk in saying that but many Members of this House are from rural Ireland.  My plea would be that the newspapers other than <i>The Irish Times</i> who do report the proceedings of the Seanad would make a greater effort to allow rural Ireland know what happens in this Chamber.  Traditionally the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> are the papers of rural Ireland for different reasons.  Only last night I was asked in a small village which Senator Byrne will know, Tymon in County Wexford, what do you do up in the Seanad?  We never know a thing about it.  I asked &ldquo;what paper do you buy&rdquo; and I was told, if I may briefly advertise, the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  For all our sakes and for the sake of the Seanad, so that we will appear to be as relevant as I feel we are to the proceedings in this State, could I ask for broader press coverage <Col N="17" /> from the other papers?  One newspaper does it very well.  The others do not for some reason; it may be an editorial decision.  I would welcome broader representation by the press of what goes on this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>While the relationship between the press and the Members of this House would appear to have some considerable relevance to individual Members, it does not appear to me to have great significance to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you.  As one who is only too well aware of the importance of the press I think the Cathaoirleach will appreciate the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly not on the Order of Business.  I might add that the Senator seems to have obtained a sufficient opportunity on her own behalf and should stick to the Order of Business at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be advised by you. My point is well made.  I support the point that Senator Murphy made in relation to the press.</P>
      <P>On, perhaps, a slightly more serious note, even though I was quite serious in what I have said so far, could I concur with my colleagues, Senators Manning, Howard and Staunton in relation to the Companies Bill?  I am afraid I have to ask the Leader of the House whether the treatment being meted out to the Seanad in the next few days in dealing with this most important Bill is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is legislation that was in the Seanad during the last Seanad session when many of us had not been elected to the Seanad.  That point is being lost sight of.  We are being asked to come in on Report Stage with a Bill which went through a previous Seanad comprised of different Members.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether the Minister involved is requesting this Seanad Chamber merely to rubber stamp what has happened in the Dáil.  Is this the treatment being meted out to the Seanad <Col N="18" /> and is this the Government's view of the relevance of Seanad Éireann?  I certainly do not accept it and I would like to know from the Leader of the House whether he is prepared to show the independence of this House and whether he will insist that the Bill be recommitted to Committee Stage so that we can have a full and thorough debate on this most important Bill.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the Companies Bill, given the history and importance of the Bill and the fact that there is a different Seanad now from when the Bill was initiated in this House whiffs of a dictator's hand somewhere down the line. That does not mean the Leader of the House.  I think he realises what I am saying.  There is a whiff there of a dictator's hand and I do not like the treatment being meted out to the Chamber. Is it any wonder our relevance is questioned by the people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I deplore the mixed metaphor that we have just been treated to?  I have never heard of the whiff of a hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural aroma from the hand, perhaps.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome the undertaking given by the Leader of the House that we will have an opportunity to make statements on motion No. 79 or in the related area.  I noted with interest that he said he has made provision for a two-hour period but would be prepared to consider three hours.  I would like very much if he would extend it to three hours. If there are not sufficient speakers, then the debate will collapse.  There might be some considerable interest and I ask if he would consider allowing three hours for that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, if it is possible to draw the attention of the House and of the Leader of the House to a matter that concerns me.  It is not perhaps the most important matter but I think it is significant, that is, the fact that Members of this House were barred from access to <Col N="19" /> both restaurants and this Chamber last Monday because there was a meeting of the British and Irish Parliamentary Association.  In view of the fact that some of us feel that the composition of the representation was made by gerrymander&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.  The House decided some time ago that this Chamber would be used for that meeting.  If the Senator has some unhappiness about the facilities he should use another forum which he has on occasion used for the purpose of having his problems aired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your advice and I will not pursue the matter, at least in this forum.</P>
      <P>I share the concern on this side of the House that I believe is probably shared by some members of the Government side as well, about the way in which the business is being treated.  I am not going to repeat all the arguments but it is perfectly clear if you read the reports that there has been a period of idleness and coming up to Christmas, as usual, a mad rush where legislation is simply pushed through at a rate that does not allow for proper discussion.  This seems to be to be a subversion of the proper role of the Seanad.  I am not going to go into it any more but I want to make that point.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point raised by Senator Conroy concerning the item dealing with the aboriginal's head, indeed it has been withdrawn but because it is a permanent list until the Christmas recess it cannot disappear.  I quite accept &mdash; and I think it was largely due to Senator Professor Conroy's intervention &mdash; that the matter was satisfactorily resolved and I am surprised it surfaced in a foreign newspaper. I regret that this happened.</P>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Murphy said about the Sallins mail train case and what appeared to have been a serious miscarriage of justice, especially in the case of Nicky Kelly.  I hope there may be an opportunity for recognising this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> May I say with regard to items a number of people have raised about the business last week, I do not think what was reported was at all trivial.  If it illuminated the operation of a second set of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, Senator, is history.  We should consign last week to history and stick with the Order of Business, which is very much in the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed and in the present may I thank Senator Doyle for her clarification because when I mentioned to her that I felt she had set me up she smiled and said &ldquo;That is interesting&rdquo;.  I very much welcome the fact that she has been more forthcoming to the House.  I am quite aware of the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I just say with a whiff of my hand and a Senatorial smile on my lips that far from bringing the House into disrepute in the interesting exchanges that occurred in recent history, what brought this House into disrepute was the fact that Members from all parties indicated very clearly that they were not interested in this House and they intended at the earliest opportunity to seek election to the Dáil.  That is what brings the House to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I have just one final comment, if I may.  With regard to newspaper coverage it should be noted that not just <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; never the <i>Irish Press</i> which is regrettable &mdash; but, indeed, <i>The Cork Examiner</i> gives very full coverage. I am not saying that that is a rural or provincial paper but it is a very good paper.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the Order of Business; we seem to have spent a lot of time on it at this stage; but I am surprised that none of the Opposition Senators have congratulated the Leader of the House on his role in ensuring that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill is being initiated in the Seanad.  This is the type of action which we all want to see and, therefore, as no Senator has congratulated the Leader of the House, I would like to congratulate him for ensuring that this major piece of legislation has been initiated in the Seanad. It demonstrates quite clearly that the Government take this House very seriously.</P>
      <P>My second point has been referred to by Senator Norris.  It is my understanding and belief that <i>The Cork Examiner</i> gives this House very adequate coverage and that is to be welcomed.  RTE cater for a rural population as well.  They, also, are to be congratulated on the coverage they give to Seanad business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to join in the well-deserved congratulations to Miss Deirdre Lane on her elevation to this very important office.  It is a personal achievement for her and for mná na hÉireann also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to allude to two specific items and to put them to the Leader of the House.  First, I ask him please to accept <Col N="22" /> the plea of my colleague, Senator Jackman for a debate on education very early in the New Year.  I ask the Leader of the House if he is aware of the great level of discontent that exists at the moment among teacher unions and educational interests.  This needs to be dealt with by way of a proper debate on the issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the achievement of the Leader of the House in bringing the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to the Seanad and I ask him if, in his quest to establish the relevance of the House he would be prepared to have the other very important area of social policy debated in this House early in the New Year.  I am very genuinely appealing to him on behalf of so many persons who are affected to commit himself to a one-day special debate on the health services in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I ask the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach to make this point: I do not accept it is adequate to say that we can put motions down.  There are motions down in the names of Senator Manning and myself on the health services.  That is not a panacea for what I consider to be an emergency situation permeating the entire health services at the moment.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to give this matter the kind of priority it needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody with special interest in Tipperary I would like to join in congratulating Miss Deirdre Lane.  I would like to support Senator Harte's proposal for a discussion of the prison system.  The report is absolutely unbelievable. The women's prison in particular is a sore on society and something must be done about it without further delay.  I would like the debate to be broadened to include a discussion on this week's proposals of the Minister for Justice in relation to crime and crime control which is only touching the problems, but not going to the root of the problems.  A broad discussion here would be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House to give time in the near future for a discussion of the decision that is likely to emanate from the High Court <Col N="23" /> with regard to the Goodman affairs, whereby the farmers of Ireland will be asked to support the banks to help them out of difficulties caused by bad decisions on their part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, on behalf of my party, join in the congratulations to Miss Lane on her promotion and say I believe it has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with ability; that is the reason she got her well deserved promotion.</P>
      <P>In relation to the coverage, or lack of coverage, by newspapers it would be appropriate to suggest that the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> would send a correspondent so that the people of rural Ireland would be able to have a vision and a taste of what is happening in the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy raised the televising of the proceedings of the House.  Can I ask the Leader what progress has been made in relation to the &ldquo;Yokes&rdquo; on the wall?  They seem to have spawned an offspring since we were last here and I would not like it to continue because we would wind up with a whole family of cameras.  Can anything be done to ensure that the character of the Chamber will be maintained?  This is something which has been discussed and it is something which needs to be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to extend my congratulations and good wishes to Miss Deirdre Lane on her appointment as Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>There are two points I would like to address.  First, I believe the Leader should listen very carefully to the points made by Senators Manning, Howard and others in relation to the Companies Bill and allow sufficient time for a meaningful debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to support the point made in regard to education.  As one of the persons who did not have an opportunity to speak on the education motion last week, for reasons of time, I would advocate, together with those who have already done so, a special time being <Col N="24" /> allowed in the New Year for a debate on the education motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to comment on the elevation of Miss Deirdre Lane to the position of Clerk of the Seanad.  I join with my colleague, Senator Dardis, in assuring her that she will have the whole-hearted support of our party, as indeed she will of the entire Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I, too, would like warmly to congratulate Miss Deirdre Lane on her elevation to the post of Clerk of the Seanad.  I have no doubt she will prove a very excellent Clerk of the Seanad.  She is excellent in Seanad procedure.  She will fill the bill admirably. I wish her well in her new post.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning explained the problem he has in regard to the Companies Bill, as did many other Senators.  These arrangements can easily be made when the Whips meet later.  The Companies Bill has been in the Seanad for the best part of two years, it was in the Dáil for the best part of two years.  The world of business is waiting anxiously for this Bill. I would imagine that after that length of time much has been achieved in the way of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to any amendments that may be suggested in this House on Report Stage, the Minister has indicated that he can take on board the aspirations of these amendments and, if appropriate, he can implement them by regulation or ministerial order.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about Item No. 79 on the Order Paper, as did other Senators, and welcomed the fact that it was on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy spoke about Amnesty International and a debate on Human Rights.  This is an important matter an something which can be discussed in the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an cheist faoin chóras aistriúcháin, ba mhaith liom a rá nach bhfuil <Col N="25" /> dabht ar bith agam ach go mbeidh an córas ar fáil sa Teach seo i gcionn cúpla mí nó mar sin.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment on a point made by Senator Howard in regard to the Companies Bill.  I accept the importance of the Bill and I want to stress that.  I would hope that the spirit of co-operation that has always existed with Senator Howard, whom I regard as an extremely helpful and responsible Whip, will continue when we meet this evening.  We are meeting tomorrow and Friday to discuss the Companies Bill and as I have explained, we have spent a lot of time dealing with this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Companies (No. 2) Bill at all times.  I accept that there are major amendments.  Senator Harte proposed that we accept item No. 87 and requested a debate on this matter which I agree is very important.  Last night, on television, I heard the district justice talk about this problem.  He said it was a problem that has been there for 20 years and that no Government in that time did anything seriously about it. While I have no plan for a debate on that important matter before Christmas, certainly it is something I will consider very seriously after Christmas.  I can guarantee that.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan asked a question which was more appropriate to the Cathaoirleach.  Senator Brendan Ryan seconded the vote of Senator Harte and asked about the £.5 million for the homeless. Again, it is not appropriate to the Order of Business.  I would like to think that that money will not be returned to the Minister for Finance, that it will be spent in the area for which it was earmarked under section 10 of the Bill.  I will certainly speak to the Minister in regard to this matter, as the Senator asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staunton asked about the Altamont Bill.  He made a point that we did receive correspondence, as I am sure all members did.  I am waiting for the explanatory memorandum which, hopefully, will be very detailed.  That will be <Col N="26" /> more important than the letter we received from Lord Altamont.  The Senator also referred to the Companies Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy referred to a review of motions.  That is an ongoing matter we examine and look at from time to time and rightly so.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman asked for a debate on education, in Government time presumably. Again, I would say to her that we had a debate set up with the Minister on Government time but in the meantime the Fine Gael Party put down a Private Members' motion for the three hours.  In my opinion, there should not be debates on education, agriculture or whatever every second week.  We had a fairly extensive debate, although it was only for three hours, on education.  I do not foresee that we will have a debate on education in the near future.  Senator Costello supported item No. 87 and asked for a joint committee to deal with the issue of prisoners. That is not appropriate to the Order of Business but perhaps we can have a debate on the issue of young people in jail, and the prison system generally in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna expressed congratulations to Miss Lane as did Senator Doyle.  She referred to item No. 79. Somebody asked if it was a two hour or a three hour debate.  It was intended to be two hours but if there is need for an extra hour, it can be extended.</P>
    <P>I am very happy that we have the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. We received it yesterday evening.  It is something that I, and Senators Wright and Brendan Ryan have been pushing for.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State for the Environment who were very helpful in giving us this Bill.  It is something we should examine and analyse in detail over Christmas.  It will be one of the priorities when we come back in the new year. While I try to allocate as much time as I can to all legislation, this legislation will require a lot of time and from my point of view, as much time as is necessary will be given to it.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the press by <Col N="27" /> Senator Doyle and others which is not appropriate to the Order of Business.  In fairness, I would have to say that two reporters, one from <i>The Irish Times</i> and one from the <i>Irish Independent</i>, are great friends of the Seanad and I read regularly of debates in the Seanad.  I am sure they are not happy with what is put into their papers.  They write a lot of material dealing with the Seanad proceedings and I thank them for that.  Also, I would include in this to a lesser extent, the <i>Irish Press</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner.</i>  I would say to them to continue the good work and try to have more coverage in future, if that is possible.  The question of TV coverage was also mentioned.  I understand that in-House proceedings will commence fairly soon.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to the Companies Bill and the treatment of it.  I explained how long that is going on. Senator Norris welcomed the debate on item No. 79 and raised the question of being barred from this House.  That is not appropriate to the Order of Business.  He also mentioned the newspaper item.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Haughey for his words on the EPA Bill.  As far as I am concerned, I will continue to have as much legislation as possible initiated in this House.  I assure Senators of that.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator ÓFoighil, I replied &ldquo;as Gaeilge', limited as my Gaeilge is, regarding an córas aistriúcháin.  Senator O'Reilly congratulated Miss Lane and asked for a debate on education.  He also asked for a one-day debate on health issues.  I do not think that is possible but maybe in the future we might have a limited debate on health.  Senator Neville <Col N="28" /> supported having a debate on the prison system.  The Goodman affair is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the cameras. I understand this is a temporary arrangement and hopefully they will not be here when we come back in the new year.  Senator Hourigan expressed support for the Companies Bill and a debate on education.  Senator Keogh was the last speaker and also congratulated Miss Lane on her new post.</P>

      <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of laying documents before the House and Standing Order No. 122 deals with it: (1) A document shall be deemed to have been laid before the Seanad on delivery of a copy of the document of the Clerk for that purpose and (2) All documents laid before the Seanad shall be considered public.  If any Member of the House wants to request the House for time to discuss documents laid before the House that is a matter for the House.  I hope that answers sufficiently the question raised by Senator McGowan.  We have an amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Harte and seconded by Senator Ryan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill was presented to Seanad Éireann on 25 November 1988.  The Bill received a very favourable first reception in this House as a major piece of reforming legislation. However, there were reservations expressed about a limited number of issues.  During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil I put forward a number of initiatives to address these reservations and I hope the Members of this House will agree that the Bill as amended in Dáil Éireann represents a major step forward in the law's treatment of sexual assault offences and the victims thereof.</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced by the Government because of their desire to ensure that victims of serious sexual assaults and, in particular, women victims, should have the full protection of the criminal law and that the trauma and distress suffered by victims should be reduced to a minimum.  In pursuit of these objectives the Bill proposed to introduce a number of major reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as first presented to the Seanad abolished the common law rule that a husband could not generally be found guilty of raping his wife.  In future, a husband who rapes his wife will be liable to the full rigours of the criminal law. The Bill also abolished the old common law rule which presumed that a boy under <Col N="32" /> 14 was physically incapable of sexual intercourse and as such could not be charged with rape.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the gravity with which the Government view serious sexual assaults the Bill provided that trials for such offences will henceforth be held in the Central Criminal Court rather than the Circuit Court.  To reduce the distress to the victim the public will be excluded from these trials.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions protecting the identity of rape victims and restricting cross-examination on previous sexual history were stengthened by the Bill and extended to all victims of sexual assaults.</P>
    <P>One of the major criticisms had been that the existing criminal law did not recognise that certain types of serious sexual assaults can be as traumatic for the victims as rape.  In response to this, the Bill provided for the creation of a new offence of aggravated sexual assault with the same penalty and procedures as rape.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the creation of the new offence of aggravated sexual assault there were still calls that the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should be applied to such offences.  This was, perhaps, the most controversial issue to arise during the debate on the Bill.  The Law Reform Commission themselves were split on the matter.  Three of the commissioners were in favour of an extended definition of rape while the remaining two, including the president of the commission, argued strongly against an extended definition.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which I took a special interest.  From my discussions with individuals and various women's interest groups, I was aware that this was an issue over which many women felt strongly.  It was represented to me that certain serious sexual assaults, particularly those involving forced oral or anal intercourse, or penetration of the women's vagina by objects, need to be termed rape to provide the psychological re-assurance and sense of vindication necessary for the well-being of the victims of those horrendous offences.</P>
    <P>We will want to ensure that this legislation is the best possible.  If there is <Col N="33" /> something which can be done which might reduce the trauma and distress suffered by victims of these terrible crimes then we will have to give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>My proposal which provides for the new offence of rape under section 4 was well received in the Dáil.  The amendments relating to this proposal are amendments Nos. 1, 4 to 10, 12, 13, 19, 20 and 22.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is the key amendment. Because of its importance I think that it would be appropriate to read out in full the new section 4 which is being inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>4. (1) In this Act &lsquo;rape under section 4&rsquo; means a sexual assault that includes;</P>
    <P>(a)  penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or</P>
    <P>(b)  penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person guilty of rape under section 4 shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.</P>
    <P>(3)  Rape under section 4 shall be a felony.</P>
    <P>By virtue of this provision it will be possible to provide the psychological re-assurance sought by victims of these crimes without attracting any of the disadvantages of interfering with the existing definition of rape.</P>
    <P>The new offence of rape under section 4 will be limited to serious sexual assaults involving penetration of the body by a sexual organ or penetration of a sexual organ by an object.  It is intended to retain the offence of aggravated sexual assault to cover those serious sexual assaults not involving sexual penetration.  However, the definition of aggravated sexual assault is being altered by amendment No. 4 to delete the specific references to the matters which will form the new offence of rape under section 4.  The existing offence of rape is not affected in any way by these amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 6 to 10, 12, 13, <Col N="34" /> 19, 20 and 22 are all consequential on the creation of the new offence of rape under section 4.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with the other amendments not relating to rape under section 4, I feel that, as a matter of courtesy, I should inform this House about certain measures being taken to reduce the sense of isolation and bewilderment felt by complainants during court proceedings. In both Houses the question of separate legal representation for the complainant was raised.  Such a proposal has been examined by the Law Reform Commission and was strongly rejected. The Government agreed with the views of the Law Reform Commission on this issue.  The Commission did, however, point out in their consultation paper that it is already perfectly permissible for a woman who has been raped to consult a lawyer and to bring a lawyer with her, in the capacity of a friend, to the court during the hearing of the trial.</P>
    <P>There is already a provision in the civil legal aid scheme under which legal advice may be given in connection with criminal proceedings where the matter arises out of the same circumstances which have already given rise to the grant of civil legal aid or advice.  In such a situation the board's solicitor would provide &ldquo;such additional services to the assisted person in respect of the criminal proceedings to the extent that a solicitor in private practice would do&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have decided to make the necessary changes to the scheme so that in future this provision will apply to victims of rape, rape under section 4 and aggravated sexual assault regardless of whether these victims have already received legal services under the civil legal aid scheme. I appreciate that this may place extra pressure on the scheme and I envisage that extra staff will be made available to the Legal Aid Board for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In future, therefore, when criminal proceedings are initiated the victims of these offences will, subject to the usual conditions as to means under the scheme, be able to consult with a legal aid solicitor in advance of the trial who will be able to explain to her how the criminal law <Col N="35" /> process works in relation to the offence in question and what her position will be in that process.  In addition, if she so wishes, the legal aid solicitor may accompany her into court and provide support for her during the trial without, however, having the right to participate in the trial.</P>
    <P>This is a major step forward and should go a long way in reducing the sense of isolation, bewilderment and helplessness that many victims feel when called as witnesses in rape trials.  This initiative is being taken in addition to measures being implemented by the Director of Public Prosecutions providing for pre-trial consultations with all witnesses and the familiarisation of the complainant with the procedure and layout of the court.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the less controversial areas which were the subject of amendments in the Dáil.  Amendment No. 2 is merely a drafting matter and need not detain us.  Amendment No. 3 provides that sexual assault shall be a felony.  This amendment was made at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions who wished that in appropriate cases the Garda should have power to arrest a person where they suspect a sexual assault has been committed.  By making sexual assault a felony the offence attracts a common law power of arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 14 are minor drafting improvements.  Amendment No. 15 relates to the anonymity of the accused.  Part (b) is merely a restatement of what was already in the Bill.  Part (a), however, is new.  It is possible that revealing the identity of the accused might indirectly reveal the identity of the complainant; for example, in a case where a man is charged with raping his wife.  The purpose of this amendment and the related amendment, amendment No. 16, is to make it clear that a judge should not lift the restrictions on revealing the identity of the accused until they have considered how that might affect the anonymity of the complainant under the provisions of section 7 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> Amendment No. 17 arose out of concern expressed in the Dáil about the low level of the penalty for the offence of indecent exposure.  The amendment increases the maximum penalty for public indecency under section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 from a fine of £2 or one month's imprisonment to a fine of £500 and/or six months imprisonment. Amendment No. 18 was required because of amendments made to the Defence Act, 1954 by the Criminal Justice Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The last amendment I need to refer to is amendment No. 21 which substituted a new section for the original section in the Bill dealing with the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  Under the original provision the District Court in the case of rape or aggravated sexual assault, would not have had jurisdiction to (i) grant bail; (ii) send forward for sentencing an accused on a signed plea of guilty, or (iii) deal summarily with the offence.  The case was made by the Law Society and in the Dáil that the District Court should continue to have jurisdiction to grant bail in these cases.  The Director of Public Prosecutions was consulted and he also was in favour of retaining the District Court jurisdiction to grant bail.  Furtheremore, he was anxious that the District Court should continue to be in a position to send an accused forward on a signed plea of guilty.  Amendment No. 21 takes these views into account.  The District Court will now retain jurisdiction to grant bail or send forward an accused on a signed plea of guilty.  However, the District Court will not have the jurisdiction to try summarily a case of rape, rape under section 4 or aggravated sexual assault.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I believe that the amendments made to the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill have improved the legislation.  I hope the Bill as amended will receive the wholehearted support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on bringing the Bill to a conclusion before Christmas and <Col N="37" /> allowing our new President, as one of her first official acts, to sign the Bill.  It is appropriate that she should do this.  The Bill is a major step forward in regard to the definition of rape and sexual assault offences and in regard to the victims thereof.  I welcome the extension of the Act to include serious sexual assaults outside the accepted meaning of rape.  These assaults can be as traumatic, and perhaps more traumatic, than rape as at present defined.  The Bill recognises the seriousness of those acts.  It provides a psychological reassurance for victims of rape of all kinds.  Such acts now attract the stigma and odium which is attached to the crime of rape.  A person who suffers from such an horrendous assault is entitled to be protected under the law as outlined in the Bill.  The amendment meets the recommendations of the Rape Crisis Centre and, to some extent, the Law Reform Commission and this is welcome.  It corrects the central deficiency inherent in the Bill originally introduced in the Seanad.  To pass the legislation in its original form would be to pass defective legislation.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the whole area of pornography and its link with rape, as now defined in the Bill, and other sexual assaults?  This is a difficult area with overtones of suppressive censorship. We must not return to the days of restrictive censorship.  We must, however, ensure that standards of decency are maintained in the interests of society. Pornographic material must not be allowed where it results in bodily violation and humiliation of victims.</P>
      <P>The increase of sanctions for indecent exposure from a £2 fine and/or six months' imprisonment is also welcomed. The Minister is to be congratulated for extending free legal aid to victims of rape on the basis of assistance from a friend rather than in an official capacity which the law would not allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trauma of a victim of rape going to court and giving evidence cannot be over-emphasised.  The victim becomes the focal point at the hearing and is exposed to detailed discussion and cross-examination of her experiences during <Col N="38" /> the crime.  The victim is often made to feel like a defendant rather than a victim and the Bill redresses this to some extent. The extension of the facility of free legal aid to victims who cannot afford it is to be welcomed.  It is extending common justice to people who cannot afford such aid.</P>
    <P>I welcome amendment No. 3 which provides that sexual assault will be a felony.  It is a necessary improvement that the Garda have the power to arrest where they suspect a sexual assault has been committed and that they can do so immediately without the necessity to obtain a warrant.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Minister on his initiative in bringing the Bill to the House before Christmas, and, again, I endorse the Bill in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Neville I, too, welcome the Minister and congratulate him on the manner in which he took on board certain amendments to the original Bill which was introduced here almost three years ago.  The legislation is, indeed, widely welcomed.  I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my welcome for this Bill.  The whole thrust of the Bill is a step in the right direction to ensure that certain anomalies and shortfall in our legislation, particularly in relation to the abominable crime of rape, are addressed.</P>
      <P>The broadening of the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should be welcomed by all interested parties in the legal system.  In the past, rape basically dealt with penetration by the penis.  This has now been extended to cover other types of penetration, such as penetration by objects and so on.  This is, indeed, widely welcomed and should be lauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has created a felony out of sexual assaults and has brought with it the serious penalty that attaches to such crimes and this must also be welcomed. The abolishing of the marital exemption is one which I welcome.  Under the old legislation and in common law a man could not be found guilty of raping his wife.  That has now been amended and this is indeed a welcome amendment. <Col N="39" /> The old common law defence, where a male under the age of 14 years could not be found guilty or capable of committing an act of rape, has been dealt with and this defence has been deleted in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Some changes were made to the Bill in the Dáil.  A particular one, which I have already covered in relation to the broadening of the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo;, is the protection of the complainant and providing greater anonymity to a complainant, whether in the case of marital rape or otherwise.  Statistics have proved that, as serious as rape is in the criminal law code, a great deal of women in particular are afraid to come forward and face cross-examination. They do not like going to court and relating to the prosecution, and to the court generally, the trauma of what they encountered.  The judge now has the discretion in certain cases to refuse to disclose the name of the complainant. This is a pretty wide discretion and is, indeed welcome.</P>
    <P>I want also to compliment the Minister on his vision in extending the civil legal aid scheme to cover victims.  The complainant can now avail of the civil legal aid scheme and, indeed, the criminal legal aid scheme.  There was some criticism in the media over the weekend about a problem in relation to the funding of the civil legal aid scheme.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, has established the framework for this important aspect to enable the civil legal aid scheme to apply to people, particularly women, who can get advice and are prepared for the trauma of going to court.  For many it will be their first time in a court system which in itself, is somewhat traumatic. This is very welcome and the Minister must be lauded in this respect.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Bill has gone through this House and the Dáil and that today we are merely concerning ourselves with a number of very important amendments, it would be wrong of me to go through the whole Bill again. The amendments made in the Dáil were wise and prudent and all those concerned, both the Minister and the <Col N="40" /> speakers from the Opposition, must be lauded for their sensible approach to this important legislation.  This legislation will go down in history as being forward looking, innovative and grasping the nettle as far as certain problems are concerned.  I am quite certain that this legislation will be well received.  I would recommend it to the House and ask that it be given unanimous support and a safe passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  Like previous Senators, I agree that the amending legislation does not call for any extended debate.  I was interested in some of the public comments made on the amended Bill over the last few days.  I am glad to see that the Minister has promised that the legal aid advice will be strengthened by additonal recruitment.  This was one criticism made by people who felt that the scheme would clog up at this point.  Also, the director of the Rape Crisis Centre is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 10 December as welcoming the legal aid advice but complaining that it does not go far enough, that what is called for is separate legal representation so that the victim will have a direct voice in court.  However, the present state will have to be accepted. There is, after all a role for the judge here as always.  I think that this legislation when passed will put a new psychological pressure on judges and on cross-examining lawyers which will further improve the atmosphere in which the unfortunate victim has to give evidence.  I think that introducing a direct legal representation would confuse the procedures and would also deprive or, perhaps, put at risk the legal rights of the accused, and the accused does have legal rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The atmosphere of revulsion or repugnance against the alleged perpetrators of rape is such that we sometimes are tempted to express ourselves in very vehement terms &mdash; as a Member of the other House did &mdash; as to what should happen to these alleged perpetrators but we must remember that first and foremost we simply cannot intern or arbitrarily proceed to execute justice on these <Col N="41" /> alleged perpetrators.  They are entitled, even in the interests of their victims and in the interests of society at large, to proper examination in the court.  The introduction of an additional legal representation, as requested by people like the Rape Crisis Centre would not in the end serve the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy, however, with another criticism: while there was some unease about extending the definition of rape it seems to me that if it has to be extended, and we have to, as it were, flesh out the semantic definitions of rape, then it is illogical not to extend it all the way.  I had much sympathy with a view expressed in the other House that rape should logically be extended to constitute the penetration of all bodily orifices by the penis or all inanimate objects.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is substance in the view that transferring the hearing of rape cases to the Central Criminal Court is in the nature of a gesture.  I welcome the psychological move underlining the importance that the State attaches to the new law, but this will be counterproductive if cases clog up the Central Criminal Court.  After all, the important thing is the severity of the sentences rather than the actual location of the court.  But none of those criticisms merit any serious pushing at this stage and I am happy to congratulate the Minister on very progressive legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the congratulations that have been extended to the Minister on this legislation. It is historic legislation.  What strikes me, in particular is that in formulating this Bill and these amendments, he took on board the advice that was given to him by various women's groups and the Rape Crisis Centre.  I do not want to bore everybody by going over all the ground again but, in particular, I welcome the inclusion of a section on aggravated sexual assault.  As Senator Murphy said, I have some sympathy with the idea that the widened scope, under section 4, could have included an amendment which might have made the offence less <Col N="42" /> gender-related, but I would not quarrel with the Minister over the thrust of that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section on the abolition of marital exemption in relation to rape, and I am sure that is something we all welcome.  It was also mentioned that trials would now take place in the Central Criminal Court.  To a certain extent that might be seen as a cosmetic exercise but psychologically, that is very important because, after all, that is the court where murderers are tried and if we take on board the fact that rape is a heinous crime, an extremely serious crime, it gives a recognition and an acceptance of the seriousness of the crime.  It is up to the Judiciary and the bureaucrats to ensure there is no delay in any of the trials.</P>
      <P>There is no point in picking holes in this.  The fact that the victims will have recourse to legal aid advice is very good and I am delighted with the assurance we got from the Minister this afternoon that there will be more resources available to that body.  I am sure the succour that the victim will get will also encourage women who are frightened or dismayed at the ordeal they feel they will have to undergo in court.  They will now feel that the law is more on their side and that they will not have to suffer, as they have in the past, the type of harassment, which is the only way I can describe the approach of some defending barristers.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister; this is a tremendous tribute to his zeal in reforming this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also very much welcome the Bill before us.  The amendments the Minister has taken on board in the other House in many ways make this Bill and turn it into a very substantial and important Bill.  I certainly congratulate the Minister on his willingness to take on board relevant and very useful amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three major areas that I consider have been dealt with in the amendments and have contributed enormously to the quality of the Bill.  The first one is, of course, the extension of the definition of rape.  The Bill would have been sorely <Col N="43" /> lacking in strength if the definition of rape had not been extended under section 4 by amendment No. 5.  This means that rape can be dealt with in a much more comprehensive fashion rather than in the restricted fashion proposed in the original legislation.  Secondly, in the area of marriage, previously marital rape does not exist in law but it did, of course, exist in practice.  That is a very important amendment in section 5 (1) of the new legislation. I am glad the Minister has taken that one on board as well.</P>
    <P>Another area in which this Bill is of tremendous importance is in regard to court proceedings, in that it has improved and facilitated court proceedings to the extent that now it is much more feasible for a victim to deal with court procedures compared to the almost traumatic experience that it was in the past.  Certainly, the legislation has improved that to a considerable degree in relation to the manner in which uncorroborated evidence is available, in the manner in which previous sexual experience or past history cannot be delved into.  These are very welcome developments.</P>
    <P>The new definition in section 9 in relation to consent is very welcome because too often the argument had come forward that somebody, simply because they did not resist in an agressive fashion, had, therefore, consented to what had happened.</P>
    <P>The penalities in the Bill underline the enormity of this offence.  On the other side of the coin, I have reservations on some matters that I would like the Minister to address.  First, in relation to the definitions and the interpretations, in line 15 of the new Bill sexual assault has the meaning assigned to it by section 2 but, of course, section 2 does not go on to define anything.  It simply states: &ldquo;The offence of indecent assault upon any male person and the offence of indecent assault upon any female person shall be known as sexual assault&rdquo;.  But what is the offence? How do we define it?  That is simply a further description, another title given to the same act, but we are not told what the act is.  Therefore, to call &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo;<Col N="44" />&ldquo;indecent assault&rdquo; and <i>vice versa</i> does not elaborate or elucidate in any way. Perhaps the Minister might refer to that even though it is not specifically part of the amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 5(2) is the one about which I have most reservations.  Criminal proceedings against a man in respect of the rape by him of his wife shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is strange that a distinction should be made in that respect, that an action by the wife can only be taken with the say so of the Director of Public Prosecutions and with him actually prosecuting.  It seems to take from the credibility of a wife taking an action against her husband if it can only be done on the authority of the DPP. Why can an action not be taken directly without having to go through that particular process?  Perhaps the Minister might refer to that.  That ties up with the fact that actions are to be taken in the Central Criminal Court as distinct from the District Court and I would have certain reservations about that also.  The intention is good in that it underlines the enormity of the offence, but with the extension of the definition it means that many more cases will be going before the courts.  With the easing up of the procedures in the courts I would imagine that we could easily have a situation where the courts would get clogged up and it could be difficult to deal with cases simply from a logistical point of view.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 7, there is a new element there that I have not seen in any other legislation, the question of the possibility of convicting a person on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. I understand the intent and the purpose of this but it certainly raises a question, perhaps a constitutional question, about our due process, about somebody being convicted on uncorroborated evidence.  It is a matter that we are well aware of in this country, in the totality of the island, and I wonder if that has a strict legal and constitutional basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to civil legal aid &mdash; and I welcome the Minister's statement that he is extending civil legal aid to cover the <Col N="45" /> area that is covered in this Bill &mdash; I am concerned about the manner in which it can be done, that the victim can be accompanied only by a solicitor.  That solicitor cannot act on behalf of the victim.  That is a flaw in the legislation, because the major point that comes through from reading the newspapers in relation to any type of sexual harassment case is the attempt by the opposing barrister to blacken the character of the complainant. That is where they are particularly vulnerable and I would be worried that they would still be subject to harrassment.  Certainly a solicitor or a lawyer representing a victim should be able to represent her in court and should at least have the authority to ward off damaging emotional type questions that are directed to undermine the evidence of the complainant.</P>
    <P>The other side of the problem is the difficulty in having the civil legal aid system operating efficiently.  The Minister has again suggested that extra resources will be put into that area but the present position in relation to the civil legal aid system is totally unsatisfactory. I am sure the Minister knows this.  It is totally under-staffed, under-resourced and it is unable to deal with the existing matters that come before it.  That is not putting it too strongly.  We do not have an adequate system of civil legal aid and, therefore, I am not at all satisfied that our civil legal aid system will be able to function effectively in providing the service that, no doubt, the Minister intends and which we would also like to see in place.  The resources will be a key area in providing the backing and the underpinning of this new legislation.  I would like to see substantial recruitment in that area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to something I find I have to refer to in all legislation of a criminal nature that comes before the House, that is the nature of penalties.  While I welcome the strength of the penalties that are being put in place in this legislation I would always refer to the fact that we have a limited number of penalties on offer.  It is simply imprisonment or fines and we have not gone <Col N="46" /> beyond that.  Certainly, research that has been done suggests that there may be in many cases considerable medical and psychological problems in relation to people who commit these horrendous crimes.  Rather than the blunt instrument of a prison sentence, I would love to have seen some attempt to put in place some community-based or therapeutic-based sanction.  The legislation makes no reference to this whatsoever.  That is a disappointment just as it is a disappointment in every piece of legislation that comes up with a sanction for criminal activity.  I would ask the Minister &mdash; I presume he is not going to be able to address it in this legislation &mdash; in future to take that proposal on board, to see that sanction can reflect not just the enormity of the offence but also the appropriateness so that you have the appropriate sanction to the appropriate offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Minister here this afternoon and thank him sincerely for the extraordinary amount of common sense and attention he gave in the Seanad on the amendments to this important legislation.  This is the way all legislation should be dealt with and it is nice to see that the Minister, Deputy Burke, has gone down that road on this most important Bill.  There is an extraordinary amount of cruelty and sadness involved and for that reason legislation such as this is needed.  It is important to put on record here this afternoon that when this Bill is signed by Uachtarán na hÉireann we will be way ahead of some of the EC member states in regard to such legislation.  The Minister listened to the Law Reform Commission, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and many other groups. I put emphasis again on the fact that he listened and I thank the Minister for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill came into this House away back in November 1988 at the time I was in another place.  I am pleased to be back here again going through the Final Stages of the Bill.  The Bill is much improved as a result of the amendments.  There is no doubt that the offenders must pay the <Col N="47" /> price for the dreadful deeds they do.  We do not know how common rape is.  I understand that only about 30 per cent of victims come forward and of that number only a very small percentage bring the case to court.  I presume this is because we in Ireland have not grasped that offenders must be brought to court and dealt with for their offences.  It is important to point out that this is not just a city offence; it is happening in rural Ireland.  Some people are afraid to talk about rape, as if it is not happening.  Other people talk about it as if it is only a city occurrence.  The reality is that in rural areas there are old women and widows living alone who are attacked in their homes.  This legislation will deal with that crime.</P>
    <P>My only concern is that there would be delay in implementing the legislation.  I know that this would not be the fault of the Minister or of his Department, but sometimes we are slow to ensure that tough legislation is implemented and offenders dealt with.  Also there may be a waiting list in the courts: God preserve us from waiting lists in other areas.  The last thing we need is a delay in getting a rape case to court.  I would therefore ask the Minister to ensure that these cases be dealt with immediately.  I would put it to him that more judges should be appointed.  Perhaps he would appoint a woman or two.  A woman can do the job as good as a man.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not qualify. Every sane person knows that tough legislation is needed to deal with the crime of rape.  Everybody would like to see this legislation go through and be a success.  Rape is an outrageous crime.  I rarely speak as a woman, but on this occasion I am going to say that I think it is wrong to accuse some women of looking for rape to happen.  That is a wrong image.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his address here this afternoon put emphasis on section 4.  I will not read it through because the <Col N="48" /> House has it before it.  He made reference to all of his amendments.  He said:</P>
    <P>This is a major step forward and should go a long way in reducing the sense of isolation, bewilderment and helplessness that many victims feel when called as witnesses in rape trials.</P>
    <P>That confirms how clear the Minister was about the way he wanted the problem addressed when bringing this legislation before the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to something in the Bill but about which I hope the Minister will see his way to doing something about at another time.  I refer to the treatment of sexual offences against the mentally handicpaped.  I would ask the Minister in his own time to look at this matter.  He knows my close association with this group.  I was disappointed that it was not included in the Bill and I am sure there is a reason.  I would ask him to ensure that the mentally handicapped are also protected.  They are a very vulnerable group of people in our society.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the treatment and punishment of offenders.  Both the victim and the offender need treatment. The person who commits the crime of rape certainly needs treatment; the victim needs great care and treatment.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that both the offender and the victim receive the proper treatment.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for this very progressive legislation and for his whole approach to it.  Since I came in here in 1977 I always felt, whether we were in Opposition or in Government, that Ministers should be big enough to accept amendments and to listen with care to the views of all TDs and Senators, because it is they who have the ear of the people who elected them.  The Minister has done this and I thank him for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, like the other speakers, I welcome the Minister and thank him, as Senator Honan has said, for listening so carefully to the strong lobbies, going back through the last number of months, from women's groups throughout the country and particularly <Col N="49" /> from rape crisis centres, who work so hard under very small budgets to assist victims of rape.  I am glad he took on board many of the amendments that they wish to see in the Bill &mdash; not all but the very important ones.</P>
      <P>The first one, obviously, is the extension of the definition of rape.  It is a well known fact that women who have been attacked sexually other than raped suffer the same trauma and feel they have been raped.  They consider themselves to have been raped and are so considered by society in general.  Therefore, the extension to define and itemise will give women in general the feeling that they are protected in society.  There are specifics, as enumerated in section 4 (1) (a) and (b).</P>
      <P>The second point I welcome from the Minister is the interpretation of rape as a crime of violence, to see it as a crime of violence and not of sexual passion as has often been suggested in court.  By putting it under the title of felony deals with that and I am glad the Minister saw fit to include that.</P>
      <P>Again, I welcome the free legal aid facility for victims who cannot afford to pay for legal advice.  I welcome the abolition of marital exemption in relation to rape, but as Senator Honan said, in relation to sentencing there is one aspect I feel the Minister could have taken on board.  The sentence handed down must reflect the seriousness of the crime.  I accept that in relation to sentencing that is so but it is an issue of community safety. It is rural and urban.  It can extend the lack of safety, as it were, towards young children and older women.  The extension of the definition takes those aspects into account.  But it is the safety aspect that I feel very concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of treatment and punishment, it is well known internationally from research that there is a high risk of reoffending when the prisoners are released from prison.  As we well know, patterns of behaviour can be changed through therapeutic help.  It is very important that the risk of reoffending is reduced.  So, I would have hoped that the Minister would have looked at the treatment section.  I suppose community <Col N="50" /> sympathy goes to the victim, but the offender too, particularly if he continues to offend on being released, must be taken into account.  Provision for a treatment programme is very important.  The community for safety reasons needs to know that when a sex offender is released from prison a statutory body is monitoring his rehabilitation.  That is very important.  Senator Honan pointed out that at the end of the day the community really can feel safe as a result of therapeutic help for people who commit the crime.</P>
    <P>Overall it is a good day for &mdash; I do not want specifically to say the women of Ireland &mdash; but a good day for the whole community of Ireland that a Bill such as this has been widely accepted in the Dáil and here.  It shows enlightened reaction towards something which up to years ago people would not even have dared comment on or have discussed openly.  We have gone very much to the fore as regards the EC and other countries in putting this legislation through.  I congratulate the Minister on listening to the various lobby groups, particularly when they fight so hard for something which at the end of the day will be of community benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I want to congratulate the Minister for coming here this evening and also on the way he has dealt with the various lobbies for the past number of months.  It is historic legislation.</P>
      <P>At this stage, with your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh I would like to avail of the opportunity to congratulate Miss Deirdre Lane on her well deserved promotion. As you know, she worked with us on the Committee of Public Accounts and we knew it was only a matter of time before she would achieve this well derserved promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it is in its historic context that the Bill must be measured.  Strictly speaking, the basic aim of the Bill is to ensure that someone who has gone through the trauma of rape or sexual assault will not have that trauma added <Col N="51" /> to by their experience in court in the prosecution of the person responsible.</P>
    <P>This Bill now improves the protection of the victim of rape or of a sexual crime, because the provisions set out in it are very substantial.  They are most welcome since they remove serious defects in the 1981 Act.  In particular it is proposed that all rape and sexual assault cases be heard in the Central Criminal Court, and to exclude the public from all cases.  The Bill offers additional protection and will also make it somewhat easier for the victim to come forward to ensure that the rapist is convicted and punished.  It will at least reduce the ordeal that has to be faced by the victim in a court case.  The mere fact that it will be easier for the victim to go to court should have the effect of acting as a deterrent.  It is well established that the less chance a person has of being detained and prosecuted, the higher the incidence of the particular crime.</P>
    <P>This Bill will redress the balance in favour of the victim.  In the past the woman unfortunately had a most embarrassing experience if she had to go to court to hear all the intimate details of her private life discussed before an audience. Thankfully, as a result of this Bill, this will not now be the position in the future. The extension of particular measures which currently apply to rape trials to cover all victims of sexual assault is welcome. Since the 1981 Act the name of the rape victim cannot be made public and under this Bill the names of the victims of sexual assault will also be protected. There are additional restrictions in regard to sexual assault cases in that the prohibition on the introduction of evidence by cross-examination or otherwise of the sexual history of the victim, which currently applies to rape cases, will also be extended to sexual assault cases.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill will lead to more successful prosecution for rape and facilitate and encourage the victims of rape to come forward to ensure that the rapist is prosecuted.  I also welcome the statement of the Minister that in future a husband who rapes his wife will be liable <Col N="52" /> to the full rigours of the criminal law. The Bill has also abolished the old Common Law rule which presumed that a boy under 14 was physically incapable of sexual intercourse and as such could not be charged with rape.  I also welcome the civil aid extension to the remit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 was made at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions and I certainly welcome it.  It means that the Garda should have the power to arrest a person where they suspect a sexual assault has been committed. By making sexual assault a felony, the offence attracts a Common Law power of arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17, which increases the maximum penalty for public indecency under section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, from a fine of £2 or one month's imprisonment to a fine of £500 or six months imprisonment, is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am satisfied that this Bill will help to improve the situation of the unfortunate victims of this terrible crime.  I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is not inappropriate for me to say that this is a Bill which communicates and vindicates the rights of women in particular.  It is appropriate that it will be among the first pieces of legislation that President Robinson will be signing.  I also think it should go on the record that the campaign for the reform of our legislation with regard to rape began in this House many years ago, 13 years ago &mdash; the political campaign, the initial debates about reform. It is a function that this House has served consistently, not a function that I claim makes us better or superior to the other House of the Oireachtas.  It is just that we are different.  This House has been able to do that because of the difference in political priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fine piece of legislation.  It is and will be a considerable memorial to the Minister, a tribute to his willingness to take on board the increasing depths of public concern about it, his willingness to listen to arguments.  Wearing his other <Col N="53" /> hat, I wish he had listened to arguments about a certain other piece of controversial legislation that came here before the summer.  We will disagree on that one.</P>
    <P>One of the central things &mdash; and it is specifically related to the first of these amendments &mdash; is the extension of the definition of rape in the rather creative way the Minister has done it there, rape under section 4, and also the extension to &ldquo;penetration of the vagina by any object held or manipulated&rdquo; and &ldquo;penetration of the anus or mouth by the penis&rdquo;.  This is extremely important because that together, particularly the specific reference to penetration of bodily orifices, particularly the penetration of the vagina by an object, encapsulates the very important fact that rape is an act of violence against women.  It is not an act of sexual gratification; it is inherently and demonstratively an act of violence against women in particular.  The amendments to this Bill which underline and extend that fact are most welcome and are a credit to the Minister.  I do think he deserves to be credited for it.</P>
    <P>It is also important, in terms of our affirmation of our view of a shared sense of outrage at the crime of rape, that we should use the terminology in our legislation to describe these offences which best describe what the person offended against feels.  They feel violated, they feel raped and, therefore, it is quite right that whatever the complications &mdash; and I appreciate the arguments; we went through them at great length in this House when this Bill originally began in this House &mdash; but I still believe that it is extremely important in the sense of symbolically drawing all of our society together into a common outrage at the offence.  It is important that the word which best describes the sense of violation of the victim should be attached to this offence.  Therefore, I welcome and compliment the Minister on those amendments which include those sexual assaults which involve penetration of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration of the vagina by an object held or manipulated by another person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> It is a good day for the Oireachtas to have these related amendments going through &mdash; and high time, because it needs to be said, by a man in particular, that there has been and still is, particularly in all male company, something close to ambivalence about violent sex if not about rape, not an endorsement but a capacity to be slightly less than forthright in the language that men will use in all male company about matters like this. Therefore, it is extremely important that our legislation should be vigorous in the assertion of society's &mdash; and male society in particular &mdash; rejection of anything which implies in any way the objectification of women as sexual objects.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the amendments, and I will try and confine myself entirely to the amendments.  I had a long session with the Minister on the original Bill and I do not propose to go through that again.  On the question of legal representation I am glad about what the Minister has announced, but, at the risk of repeating what other people have said, I am not sure that it goes far enough; but that is perhaps a debate for another day about the degree of accessibility of the civil legal aid scheme and the degree of resources available to that scheme.  I am not entirely sure, given the pressure of time on that scheme, that it would be possible to ensure, for instance, that the extra resources the Minister has announced will be available simply to the victims of rape; or will we still have problems about queues and delays.  I am not talking about the marginal delays but extraordinary complaints about the extent of overburdening of that extremely important service, a service which in its broadest sense is a necessary condition for the operation of a constitutional democracy in which all of us are equal under the law and have, therefore, access to the law in order to assert that equality.  The limitations of the civil legal aid scheme may well present problems and difficulties, but nevertheless I am glad to acknowledge that the Minister has accepted the difficulty and once more underlined and underscored &mdash; I know he has done consistently in this legislation <Col N="55" />&mdash; the increasing concern and solidarity of society with women who are victims of this most appalling crime.</P>
    <P>Something deserves to be said about what the Minister mentioned here: the initiative being taken in addition to measures being implemented by the Director of Public Prosecutions providing for pre-trial consultations with all witnesses. It is important in those pre-trial consultations that people whose means perhaps would not allow them to avail of the free legal aid scheme should be advised of the value of getting a legal representative to assist them and advise them in the course of the pre-trial period.  I must say I cannot imagine anything more painful or stressful than the situation of a woman who has been raped and who has to wait for the usual perhaps three months or six months for a court case in anticipation of the possibilities of the sort of cross-examinations that, no matter what we try to do, seem to be unavoidable in cases of rape.</P>
    <P>I have never been able to and cannot offer here a solution to the trauma of a rape victim, where in some cases they can feel that they are actually more severely treated in the case than the accused.  It is apparently inherent in our legal system, this type of adversarial position and quite horrific cross-questioning.  I am moving more and more to the position that the previous sexual history of a victim of rape should be totally excluded.  I appreciate the problems.  I have been through this with this Minister and with other people before.  More and more, in order to protect people from extraordinary traumatic attacks, by I am sure well intentioned defending counsel, I am coming to the conclusion that the decision about rape ought to be on the evidence of the specific act.  I know the restrictions are considerably greater, but we have to move further and further along.</P>
    <P>I accept fully the validity of amendment No. 3 providing that a sexual assault should be a felony.  It seems extraordinary that until this amendment was introduced there was not the possibility of arrest <Col N="56" /> without warrant where the Garda suspect a sexual assault has been committed, a crime of that degree of foulness &mdash; and I rarely use language like this about crime. I think a lot of what is said about law and order is excessive and intemperate and does no more than create fears in our society that are perhaps unjustified by the statistics but rape is, short of murder, one of the most profoundly degrading offences that can be committed against another human being.  Some of the cases that have come before the courts of women in their seventies, and almost in their eighties, being raped in a violent fashion deserve the fullest and most complete condemnation.  It is quite surprising and I am glad this amendment has been introduced.  The House is aware that I am not among those who are most enthusiastic about arresting people without warrant.  It seems there are good reasons to do with the safety of the victim, the validity of the use of evidence and the access to evidence.  The Criminal Justice Act, which provided for detention for questioning, did not give powers of arrest in this case without, presumably longer procedures.  Therefore, I compliment the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has made further amendments to secure the anonymity of the accused.  Again it is an all-important part of the assertion by all of us of an identification with the trauma of the victims of rape that no hint of evidence should be available that would identify a victim.  Enough has been suffered by the victims without having to go through with that.</P>
    <P>Contrary to a larger held view, I am not entirely happy with amendment No. 17 in relation to indecent exposure.  It covers a wide variety of offences from some which are blantantly and offensively sexual to people who through the influence of alcohol or for other reasons, perhaps urinate in public.  It covers a large spectrum of offences from the slightly disturbing to the profoundly offensive and threatening.  Somebody who exposes himself in an offensive way to young children is in my view a different category <Col N="57" /> of offender from somebody who is intoxicated and urinates in public.  I am not sure that the same offence should cover them.  I have had acquaintance with people who have been convicted of indecent exposure because of intoxication among other things.  A possible penalty of six months imprisonment seems just a little bit in the line of adding to the enormous problems the Minister already has with the prison service.  He is adding to the list of people who in many cases should not be in prison for what constitutes the offence of indecent exposure.</P>
    <P>This Bill, soon to become an Act, containing as it does the provision for penalities of life imprisonment, could and should raise the question of whether our prisons are in a position to handle offenders like this.  It is a fact that persons convicted of sexual offences are at considerable risk in our prisons, that most prisoners take a very hostile view of sexual offenders and, therefore, in most jurisdictions they need to be kept in separate confinement.  I cannot imagine given the state of at least one of our biggest prisons, Mountjoy, how that can be done in a way that is reasonable and humane.  All of us are perfectly right to express our support for severe penalties for rape and the severe penalty is the extent of deprivation of liberty.  Severe penalty does not involve further degradation in a degrading prison system and should not be interpreted as such.  The deprivation of liberty is both a necessary and sufficient penalty for serious offences like this.</P>
    <P>With that small reservation, I want to say that this is legislation for which the Minister deserves congratulations.  He has moved in considerable degree with the opinion of all sides of the Houses of the Oireachtas, about the need to extend the provisions of the law.</P>
    <P>May I say, in conclusion, and I would have said this two months ago as much as I say it now, it is further evidence of our position to some who would categorise this as a backward country.  Let us remember there are considerable parts of this legislation that are still not part of the law of our nearest neighbour, for <Col N="58" /> instance, the specific statement that there is no such thing as protection for rape within marriage.  It has taken the Judiciary in Britain to push the legislators and they still have not entirely caught up with where are now.  Those who would categorise this country as being backward would want to recognise areas of legislation like this which are forthcoming, positive and extraordinarily assertive of the rights of women in particular and in a particular area, and particularly of the right of women within marriage not to be subjected to degradation or violence in the name of some strange concept of the marital contract.  This is very welcome legislation for which the Minister, and the Government, deserve to be congratulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister to the House, and like other Senators, I welcome the legislation before the House.  All of us totally condemn and repudiate any assault on people.  What would horrify us even more is any type of sexual assault on women and children.  We have read in recent times of horrific cases of rape of elderly women, attacks on children, teenagers and on women of other ages.  All of us condemn this in no uncertain way and want to see such offences firmly dealt with, in a way that will ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes will not be able to escape under any technical copout when charged with the offence of rape.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that an organisation such as the Rape Crisis Centre be given adequate funding for the very delicate and important cases they deal with.  I am sure the Minister would agree that compensation and support can undo some of the damage or try to ameliorate the position.  Any type of psychiatric support given to victims would be welcome.</P>
      <P>I welcome in section 4 the new offence of rape and the extended definition of rape to include a husband who rapes his wife.  It is important that the law as amended, be rigorously enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to trials, I would like to ask <Col N="59" /> the Minister when he is replying to give us some information, first, on the extra advice which will be available to parties and be provided by the civil legal aid centres.  He has indicated that extra resources and/or staff will be made available. I am sure the Minister is aware that such centres carry out very considerable duties, that they are undermanned and, generally, not given enough support.  I ask the Minister to make a special effort in relation to providing extra facilities, extra support, extra manpower because the staff in many of these places work very long hours against deadlines trying to deal with some very difficult and very human and tragic situations.  They certainly deserve all of our support, I would ask the Minister in considering his Department's Estimate, to pay particular attention to giving extra support to them.</P>
    <P>I also want to speak to the Minister in relation to the question of these trials now taking place in the Central Criminal Court.  I recently heard an eminent Senior Counsel who does a lot of criminal work saying that he can see all the courts getting bogged down and delays taking place.  It is clear that extra judges will have to be appointed.  I am sure the Minister does not want such cases being delayed unduly, causing further anguish and grief to the complainant.  In order that these extra cases can be dealt with as speedily as possible the Minister should consider whether it is necessary to have a special judge on stand-by, when the Books of Evidence are ready.  In most cases now, even those involving common assault, this is necessary.  There is a case where an assault took place about a year ago and the trial is unlikely to take place until March or April.  It is a relatively straight-forward case.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Central Criminal Court will have the necessary manpower?</P>
    <P>I concur with what Senator Ryan said in regard to the menfolk in this Chamber, that they would give total support.  At times, there is double-think and when men are in male company, there are jokes and comments made and they do not give serious attention or thought to matters <Col N="60" /> such as we are discussing here.  It is important that all of us would support this legislation in a very positive manner.</P>
    <P>The extended definition is to be welcomed. It is important that when a complainant is being cross-examined or in court she is not questioned as if she were the accused.  I welcome the fact that proceedings will be in camera and that certain rules and regulations in relation to naming persons will be reviewed.  If the accused, is found guilty and named, he may be affected psychologically or another person could be affected &mdash; his wife or a person who would be known as somebody who was acquainted with the accused.</P>
    <P>Like the other Members, I welcome the legislation at present before the House.  I would ask the Minister to consider some of the matters I and other Senators have raised.  We are all glad in this House that the Minister has brought forward this legislation following long consultation.  This is a difficult area.  It is difficult to get the legislation right and to ensure that it is fair and just and deals with the reality of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I take a divided view of the Minister, I have to say. I always feel he is a little bit like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  As Minister for Justice, he is definitely Dr. Jekyll; as Minister for Communications, I sometime feel there is a touch of the Mr. Hyde about him.  However, he is always good-humoured and we always get an intelligent and considered response from him even if we do not agree with it.</P>
      <P>I am not going to re-hash all the arguments. There are one or two things I would like to say.  First, there is a general welcome for this Bill.  It is sensitive, it is humane, it is progressive.  I echo what Senator Brendan Ryan said about the people of this country that, on balance, they are tolerant, decent, and civilised people and I am glad this is now being expressed in law in this very precarious and difficult area of rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, I think the Minister is reflecting in this legislation, that rape <Col N="61" /> is not really a sexual crime; it is a crime of violence and it expresses not a sexual interest in the victim but contempt for the victim and a desire to impose dominance. I am glad the Minister has introduced in this law, a non-gender specific approach to rape and has indicated that under the terms of the amendments rape can be committed upon a man.  This is very important.  Senator Ryan referred to the question of the situation inside prisons and the situation for sexual offenders because they are very frequently under attack.  I would also like to expand on that and say that there is a considerable incidence of rape of men by men within the custodial system, not just in this country; it is a frequent phenomenon throughout the world.  I welcome very much the fact that this is non-gender specific and that it addresses this problem. I am glad also that the Minister has decided to abolish the old common law principle that presumes that a male person is incapable of any form of rape under the age of 14.  Here, again, an arbitrary and capricious line is being drawn.  The Minister is quite right in what he has decided to do in this connection.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has placed the trials of such offences in the Central Criminal Court rather than the Circuit Court and he says that to reduce the distress to the victim the public would be excluded from these trials.  Again, I welcome that.  I would like to put in a slight nuance here with regard to the victim.  It comes up again with regard to the question of anonymity because I have to underline the fact that one has to have the highest regard for the question of the presumption of innocence.  For that reason I feel it is very important that the anonymity of the accused be preserved also until that accused is found guilty.  I am not saying that there are many false accusations of rape but it is not unknown for persons to be charged with rape and subsequently to be found not guilty.  It seems to be an unnecessarily harsh penalty to exact upon somebody who is accused of rape, subsequently vindicated by a court, to have his name splashed all over the newspapers and his address <Col N="62" /> possibly given.  There is also the matter of publicity which will affect the family of this person.</P>
    <P>I underline these points because I think it is very important that we pay due respect to the question of the presumption of innocence.  I would also like to underline the fact that I am not making a case suggesting that women, or indeed men, make a great number of unsustainable allegations of rape.  We should be prepared to bear this consideration in mind.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by the sensitivity displayed in the Minister's speech with regard to the question of language and his feeling with which I agree, that it is necessary in terms of psychological support for the victim to continue to employ the term rape.  It is a crime that is disgusting and violent.  I believe that people who have been the victims of this appalling crime need all the psychological reassurance they can get.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister pays particular attention to amendment No. 5, which is a new section 4 in the Bill.  I am not going to delay the House very long but I would like to make a technical point in this regard.  It reads: &ldquo;4.&mdash;(1) In this Act rape under section 4 means a sexual assault that includes (a) penetration, however slight, of the anus or mouth by the penis or (b) penetration, however slight, of the vagina held or manipulated by any other person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I just make the point from experience representing people in court that sexual assault can occur even where there is consent.  I say this because I recall a case in which I was involved as an adviser. There was a very good solicitor in the case.  It was a private consensual act betwen two young men, one of whom I think was 20 and the other was 17 years and 11 months or so.  The fact that the second junior partner was under the age of 18 meant that the charge was sexual assault.  The explanation given in court that day was that under a certain age it was impossible to give consent or something. I cannot remember the technicalities but I am sure the Minister's advisers will be able to bear out what I <Col N="63" /> say or to challenge it technically.  In other words, in certain circumstances &mdash; and I take the view that a person of 17 years and 11 months is capable of giving consent to sexual activity &mdash; the partner may very well be charged with assault simply because this is the correct legal charge because of the question of age.  I would like the Minister perhaps to see if there is any implication for his legislation in this circumstance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is aware that many victims of rape would like to be legally represented.  This has been said by other Senators so I am not going into it in any great detail, but he says if the victim wishes &mdash; and I note he says consistently in this passage, &ldquo;she&rdquo;, but I take it in this case the female pronoun includes the male, &mdash; she may get the legal aid solicitor to accompany her to court.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could say something about funding because there seems to be an indication here that there will be a greater demand for services through the Legal Aid Board system and so on.  In the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights we recently had a submission from the Chairman of FLAC, for example, and it was quite clear that despite the best efforts, it is virtually impossible for them to carry out their work because of the deficiency in terms of funding.  I wonder if the Minister could indicate in the light of this Bill and its excellent provisions, if additional funding will be made available to cater for the greater requirement placed upon the services of the State in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the question of the anonymity of the victim but it is important to underline it because the Minister referred specifically to it when he is talking about amendment No. 15. He said:</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 relates to the anonymity of the accused.  Part B is merely a restatement of what was already in the Bill.  Part A, however, is new.  It is possible that revealing the identity of the accused might indirectly <Col N="64" /> reveal the identity of the complainant, for example, in a case where a man is charged with raping his wife.  The purpose of this amendment and a related amendment, amendment No. 16, is to make clear that a judge should not lift the restrictions on revealing the identity of the accused until they have considered how that might affect the anonymity of the complainant under the provisions of section 7 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>The implication, it seems to me, in that is that it is perfectly legitimate to reveal the identity of the accused once they have satisfied the condition in the second half of that clause.  In other words, if they have considered how revealing the identity of the accused would affect the anonymity of the complainant and if the learned judge is then satisfied that by revealing the identity of the accused he will not be prejudicing the anonymity of the complainant, then he can go ahead and reveal it.  I do not think that is right. The accused should be entitled to the full protection of anonymity until proven guilty.  I return again to this notion that one is presumed innocent until found guilty by a court of law in this land.</P>
    <P>Probably the worst punishment for the family, anyway, is the surrounding publicity. You are going to have somebody who may be innocent &mdash; supposing he was discharged and he would already have been punished by the publicity.  There would be many people in a little local town in Ireland or even in the suburbs of Dublin who would say, &ldquo;Well, you know, there is no smoke without fire.  Why did they charge him?  What was he doing?&rdquo; That is very unfortunate and extremely unfair.</P>
    <P>There are just two further points.  I was glad to hear Senator Ryan introduce the business of indecent exposure.  I rather agree with him.  I do not think it is particularly pleasant, sanitary, or a hygienic thing to do when people get intoxicated and they urinate in public all over the place.  I see it quite frequently in the inner city.  It is unhealthy and disgusting but to fine somebody £500 or to send them to <Col N="65" /> prison for a couple of months for doing this when, if you like, the balance of the mind is temporarily disturbed, is rather severe.  The other point I would have to make is that people who do engage in acts of indecent exposure are, in my opinion, most times more to be pitied than to be feared.  I believe that most people who expose themselves &mdash; flashers, or whatever they are called &mdash; are, very unlikely to move on to rape.  They just get a cheap thrill out of showing off what they have got.</P>
    <P>I recall, in fact, hearing a woman being interviewed on the radio and I thought she was remarkably sensible when she explained how a man had exposed himself to her in the street and she just looked at him and said &ldquo;how silly&rdquo;.  I am glad to say the man was completely deflated and he certainly did not do her any damage. I do not want to treat this with anything less than seriousness but for somebody like that there should be some form of remedial treatment rather than being jailed.  Six months imprisonment seems rather harsh.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on that.</P>
    <P>My final point is a technical one.  In a sense it relates back to this question of sexual assault as in the new section 4.  I note the Minister stresses the fact that these new extended definitions of rape, and so on, are classified as a felony.  That is a word that rather interests me because there is an antique provision in our law known as misprision of felony.  Misprision of felony means that if somebody commits a crime which is categorised as a felony &mdash; and I think a felony is something that carries a penalty of over five years imprisonment, I am not quite sure &mdash; and reports the commission of this crime to a third party, that third party being thereby made aware of the commission of crime, that third party commits a criminal offence by not communicating knowledge of the commission of the offence to a prosecuting authority.  This has substantial and serious implications, for example, for the confidentiality of the relationship between doctor and patient and between the priest in the Roman Catholic Church and the confessor in the <Col N="66" /> sacrament of confession and bears particularly on material that we will be dealing with a little later this evening because homosexual offences are felonies.  This means that under the law of the land at the moment &mdash; and it is directly relevant to the new section 4 because of the question of the theoretical non-existence of consent because of a difference in age &mdash; people who, for example, go to a counsellor or seek legal advice may be placing their adviser in a situation where by not reporting the crime or the alleged crime to the authorities, they are themselves committing a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Having made those few qualifications, this is excellent and forward-looking legislation.  It is one with which we can be justly pleased.  It is not perfect but very little in this life is perfect.  I was pleased that Senator Ryan and others indicated that in this area we are in advance of our sister island particularly in terms of the question of rape within marriage.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and congratulate him for introducing this fine legislation on which he has taken the advice of Members of both Houses.  I look forward to the Bill becoming law very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what I wanted to say has already been said.  I will not detain the Minister.  I congratulate him on this very imaginative legislation.  He deserves a lot of credit.  He has shown himself to be a mature and enlightened Minister and it is great to see legislation coming through that has so much support. Many people have told me how much they appreciate this Bill and how welcome it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 deals with a £500 fine for indecent exposure.  Does that cover people urinating in public?  As a city councillor I receive endless complaints about this.  There is quite a big problem in the city of men urinating in the street after the pubs close.  The gardaí have a problem in that the fine is only £2.  Does section 17 cover it?  If it does, many people will welcome it.  It is just a habit <Col N="67" /> with people.  If more people were prosecuted then the problem would cease.  It is a problem especially in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators from all sides for the welcome they have given the amendments which were made to this Bill in the Dáil and I thank them for their generous comments in relation to my handling of this Bill.  A number of points were raised.  I will not attempt to answer all of them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the transfer of rape trials to the Central Criminal Court and the fear of delays in the Central Criminal Court, there is no appreciable delay in the hearing of criminal cases in the Central Criminal Court at present and I have no reason to believe that the transfer of rape trials to the court will change that position.  The President of the High Court will, of course, have to make a judge available for more time in the Central Criminal Court to cope with these cases. The overall position in the High Court will become clear only after the arrangements have been worked for some time and I propose to keep the situation under review.  I should point out that the delay sometimes associated with the hearing of civil cases in the High Court arise from a variety of factors which are not relevant to the hearing of criminal cases.</P>
      <P>In regard to the civil legal aid scheme under which legal advice will from now on be available to rape victims, the position is, as I have stated, that my initiative may place extra pressure on the scheme but I envisage extra staff will be made available to the legal aid board for this purpose.  Senator Honan raised the question of sexual offences against the mentally handicapped.  The reason it was not dealt with in the Bill is that the matter was still under examination by the Law Reform Commission when the Bill was being drafted and handled.  The report of the commission on sexual offences against the mentally handicapped has recently been published.  It is now under examination in my Department and I will act on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the question of <Col N="68" /> the anonymity of the accused.  This is catered for in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981 where it is provided that an accused charged with a rape offence will remain anonymous unless and until he is convicted.  In regard to revealing the identity of the accused, what we are dealing with in this Bill are applications by the accused himself to lift his own anonymity.  There was no restriction on this in the 1981 Act.  All amendment No. 15 seeks to do is to enable a judge who is dealing with an application from an acccused to lift his own anonymity to have regard to the anonymity of the complainant. This is particularly important in the situation that now arises where the exclusion of rape within marriage is being done away with.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the question of indecent exposure and asked whether the behaviour he outlined was covered.  The offence of public indecency covers all acts which offend against modesty and I am sure the situation outlined by Senator Ryan can now be tackled by the Garda. I share his concern that the fine was only £2.  It has now been increased to £500.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of the treatment of offenders.  To try to improve the situation and reduce the risk of people re-offending on release, various approaches are used by those dealing with prisoners.  Individual counselling has up to recently been a major approach and this counselling is carried out by welfare officers, psychiatrists or psychologists and, of course, chaplins have a particular role to play in this area also.  A group approach has been introduced at Arbour Hill Prison and the progress of this group will be carefully monitored to see what changes emerge. This multi-discipline approach is, I believe, appropriate and correct.</P>
    <P>The general position in relation to the treatment of sex offenders is that programmes which prove successful will be continued and, where appropriate, extended.  A point that must be emphasised is that there is no treatment or indeed assessment process to which people can be subjected which will lead to a cure.  The efforts of those professionals <Col N="69" /> dealing in this area must be commended but their efforts cannot be guaranteed to lead to success in any individual case.  I should add that there can be no question that all sex offenders should have to undergo assessment and treatment. Apart from the human rights implications, what would be the value of a mandatory requirement that psychiatric treatment be provided in cases where the medical view was that the cause of an offence did not lie in any psychiatric disorder or where an offender simply refuses to speak with the psychiatrist?</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the point raised in relation to anonymity of offenders. This was raised by Senator Norris.  The anonymity of the accused is catered for in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981 which provided that an accused charged with a rape offence will remain anonymous unless and until he is convicted, so that is already covered.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the welcome they have given to these amendments.  It is major legislation and all sides in both Houses can be proud of the contribution they have made to the debate.  As this is the final time I will speak on it, I would like to thank those who gave me advice, assistance and those who had consultations with me &mdash; members of the Rape Crisis Centre, other interested groups and individuals.  I thank my own officials in the Department of Justice for the work and commitment that they have given to this legislation.  I thank Members also for their words of praise and appreciation of my own efforts and I would be less than honest if I did not say that I am very proud of this legislation which is a major step forward in our enlightened approach to this horrendous crime.  I hope the passage of this legislation will give psychological comfort and care to the victims of this horrendous crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to explain the position of the Government on the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the question of male homosexual behaviour.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the European Court was delivered on 26 October 1988.  It found that our laws in relation to homosexual offences are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in that they interfere with the right to respect for private life under article 8.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The legislation is at sections 61 and 62 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 and section 11 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885. Section 61 of the 1861 Act provides that whosoever shall be convicted of the &ldquo;abominable crime of buggery committed with mankind or with any animal shall be liable to life imprisonment.&rdquo;  Section 62 provides that an attempt to commit buggery carries a penalty on conviction of up to ten years imprisonment. Section 11 of the 1885 Act makes it an offence for any male person, in public or in private, to commit or to be a party to the commission by any male person of any gross indecency with another male person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we did not already have legislation which penalises homosexual acts in private between consenting male adults, I do not think that today any reasonable person could seriously argue for such legislation.  I do not, for example, hear of any demand to penalise homosexual activity between females.  However, we do have on our Statute Book legislation proscribing male homosexual acts and we <Col N="71" /> are faced with the problem of dealing with it.  Precisely how one goes about doing that is the question that needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission examined the judgment on the basis of the referral of the question of sexual offences generally to it by the Attorney General under section 4 (2) (c) of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.  The commission issued a report on rape and allied offences in May 1988, which gave rise to the Bill at present before the Oireachtas.  The commission then examined the law on child sexual abuse.  While engaged in this examination the European Court of Human Rights issued its judgment.  The commission took the opportunity afforded by the work in progress to examine that judgment.  The commission's provisional recommendations in relation to the law proscribing homosexual acts were outlined in its consultation paper on child sexual abuse in August 1989.  Their final recommendations are contained in the report on child sexual abuse published in September 1990.</P>
    <P>It would have been precipitious to have brought forward proposals for changes in the law while the matter was being considered by the Law Reform Commission. The commission's final report was published only a few weeks ago, in September, and its recommendations on homosexual activity are being examined in my Department.  For that reason I do not intend to comment on those recommendations today but I will, for the information of Senators, briefly outline the main recommendations of the commission under the heading in the report of homosexual activity.</P>
    <P>First of all, the commission proceeded on the assumption that our laws will, in due course, be brought into conformity with the judgment of the European Court.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended that sections 61 and 62 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 and section 11 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885, should be repealed and there should be the same protection against <Col N="72" /> both homosexual and heterosexual exploitation of the young.  It follows from this recommendation that the &ldquo;child sexual abuse&rdquo; offence which they recommended should be created to replace the present offence of &ldquo;indecent assault with consent&rdquo;, should apply equally in the case of homosexual activity.  The present minimum legal age of 17 for heterosexual acts would also be a minimum legal age for homosexual acts.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended that vaginal sexual intercourse with girls between the ages of 15 and 17 should cease to be an offence, save where the male participant is a &ldquo;person in authority&rdquo; or is more than five years older than the girl.  However, they also recommend that anal penetration of boys and girls continue to be an offence.  Finally, they recommend that the new offence of child sexual abuse should continue to be an offence in the case of boys and girls between the ages of 15 and 17 where the perpetrator is a &ldquo;person in authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senators will be interested to know that I will be bringing forward proposals to Government during the next year to change the law with regard to homosexuality, taking account of the European Court's judgment.  I want to emphasise, in saying that it will be during the course of the next year, that it is not the intention to delay this legislation.  It is merely from the point of view of being totally frank with the House that I want to ensure that the resources are available to me within the Department with the legislative programme that I have, which is quite extensive, as Senators know.  I do not want to make a false promise here in relation to a specific time.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that as early as I can within a year it will be brought forward. Having said that, I will listen with interest to these statements to hear suggestions as to what should be included in the forthcoming legislation.  I will bring it forward and introduce it in the House during the course of next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement which gives some ground for optimism.  Within the short space of time <Col N="73" /> allowed it will not be possible to go into all its ramifications.  Perhaps it would be possible, since the Minister has indicated goodwill in this regard, for me to have some discussions with him or with his officials.  It is an area in which, over the last 20 years, I have acquired a fair amount of knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole subject is rapidly becoming rather tedious to me.  After 20 years I will be heartily glad when this matter is disposed of because there are other things on my agenda and I am quite sure there are other things on the Minister's agenda as well.  I note his very wise and balanced comment that if this legislation did not exist on the Statute Book he did not believe the Irish people would consider it an appropriate use of their parliamentary time to introduce such proposals.  It is important to put this in context without being too academic.  What the Minister referred to was &ldquo;our&rdquo; laws.  I do not believe they are our laws.  As an Irishman I repudiate them totally.  They did not originate in this country.  They were never discussed in this country.  They were never debated in parliament.  The 1885 Act was not.  The Offences Against The Person Act, 1861, was a liberalising statute that mitigated the penalty which up to that had been death by hanging.  It reduced it to life imprisonment. Although I know that a subsequent Act of Parliament permitted a judge to impose a lighter sentence &mdash; it was an Act of the late 1890s &mdash; at the same time technically on the Statute Book there still exists this law of 1861 which says that for this offence whether or not there is consent, no matter what the age &mdash; it is a broad sweep &mdash; the penalty shall be from ten years to life imprisonment.  If you look at the language in which the provisions are couched, they reveal the source of prejudice &mdash; buggery and sodomy.  These words do not actually properly describe any activity at all because the definitions of buggery in various jurisdictions, across America for example, can cover a very wide and disparate range of sexual activities, including quite a number that take place <Col N="74" /> between married persons within the privacy of their home.</P>
    <P>In the state of New England, for example, everything except the strict missionary position No. 1 is classified as an act of sodomy.  Where did it come from?  Sodomy comes from a misinterpretation of the Old Testament story of the city of Sodom.  I am sure the Minister's advisers are aware that the evidence of the Palestinian pseudepigrapha indicates quite clearly that the inclusion of the question of homosexuality was a subsequent addition to a previously existing legend which referred entirely and exclusively to a violation of hospitality rituals.  Buggery comes from the middle French word for Bulgaria, the <i>Boulgre</i>, because in the time of the Albigensian heresy charges were laid by the central authorities in the Vatican against those engaging in unnatural sexual practices.  It was a political targeting. These two words which people imagined are perhaps an onomatopoeic description of these specific acts, are nothing other than indicators which show precisely the origin of the taboo against male homosexuality and expose it as being fundamentally a religous one.</P>
    <P>In the Old Testament, in <i>Leviticus</i>, there is a tabulation of behavioural codes which include other things such as, for example, the eating of shellfish and the wearing of worsted cloth, which carry equal penalities.  I had a prawn cocktail with my lunch.  I committed an offence, in the eyes of the Old Testament prophets, equal to the act of buggery.  I am wearing worsted cloth.  I did it twice.  Why do we need to retain outdated ideas?  We have modified our views with regard to the eating of shellfish, the wearing of worsted cloth and also other sexual crimes.  Adultery is considered in religious terms as a sexual crime in the Old Testament and a woman taken in adultery shall be stoned to death.  Yet we have modified our view in this area.  Why can we not do so with regard to the question of homosexuality?</P>
    <P>The religious background is important because homosexuality only became a crime by accident when in 1537, or whenever it was.  I cannot remember the exact <Col N="75" /> date but it was sometime in the 1530s, Henry VIII as part of his lust for power grabbed the monasteries and coincidentally, he grabbed jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical courts.  It was the ecclesiastical courts who adjudicated on the question of the sin of sodomy or buggery. By accident, this question of homosexuality came into the civil law as a result of the action of Henry VIII seizing the monasteries.  As the Minister probably knows, by some technical quirk this did not extend to Ireland.  There was a sensational case in the 1630s involving an Irish peer.  It was found as a result of this that the provisions of the English law did not extend to Ireland and a campaign, a kind of primitive &ldquo;save Ireland from sodomy&rdquo; campaign was launched by a Bishop in Wexford.  The Bishop, John Atherton, did this for purely political purposes, to advance his own career.  He succeeded in having this law written into the Irish Statute Book and I am very glad to be able to inform the House that he was charged with the crime himself and suffered the ultimate penalty of being executed for sodomy outside Christ Church Catherdral on Christmas Day, 1637.  So those who urge extreme penalties in this area should beware.</P>
    <P>The law continued until 1861 when the penalties were reduced to ten years or life imprisonment.  But in 1885 there was a much more serious development and that was the introduction of the so called Labouchere amendment, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885.  This was a particularly nasty piece of legislation because what it criminalised was any form of indecency, gross indecency between males.  Perhaps somebody more learned and more intelligent and more perceptive than I can define &ldquo;gross&rdquo; indecency.  When does indecency stop being merely indecent and become gross indecency?  I have to say that the learned judges who sat in my case betrayed a quite extraordinary absence of commonsense when they decided on the question of discrimination between lesbians on the one hand and gay men on the other, that whereas men were capable of <Col N="76" /> gross indecency women were only capable of indecency.  Women could not be capable of gross indecency.  This was absurd and I feel that the intellectual processes stutter when certain kinds of mind are confronted with what is sometimes an embarrassing subject of intimate sexual behaviour.</P>
    <P>The <i>Labouchere</i> amendment was never discussed at all.  It was introduced after midnight in the House of Commons by the Liberal MP for Liverpool, Henry Labouchere, as an adjunct to a Bill which principally addressed the subject of the seduction of minors and the abduction of young girls.  It had no direct relationship to the body of the Bill.  It was accepted by the government.  It was never discussed. There was no debate and there was no vote.  It was scarcely very democratic.  I do not claim this nasty legislation as ours. I do not think there is anything particularly Irish about it.  It is a prudish, nasty, villainous piece of English legislation which was rightly condemned by Sir John Wolfenden as the blackmailer's charter and that is precisely what it is.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 1885 Act, its operations are pernicious in the extreme because there is no definition, as I have said, of gross indecency so you rely on case law to tell you what constitutes gross indecency.  In the fifties in England two airmen were successfully prosecuted and convicted under this legislation on the basis that they had, and I quote, &ldquo;exchanged lascivious looks&rdquo;.  It is quite extraordinary and insupportable in a democracy that this kind of absurd, discredited and disgraceful legislation should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I am very heartened that the Minister, whom I have just spent some minutes complimenting for his foresight and vision on the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, has drawn the attention of the House to the Law Reform Commission report.  This is the precise context within which the legislation should be framed.  I will be looking for nothing less than the full implementation of the Law Reform Commission recommendations. After all, I have waited 20 years for this.  I was brought up in a <Col N="77" /> society that was not understanding of my particular circumstance.  The laws under which I have lived out my 46 years of life are the exact and direct parallel of the Penal Laws which discriminated against Roman Catholics in this country, to the shame of the then Government.  I am discriminated against in precisely the way Roman Catholics were discriminated against under the Penal Laws; in precisely the way black people in the southern states of America were discriminated against and in exactly those areas where Roman Catholic civil rights activists charged the Stormont Government with discriminating against them.  I look forward to an anti-discrimination Bill from this progressive Minister which will outlaw discrimination in areas such as housing and employment because that is where the matter will bite.</P>
    <P>With regard to the acceptability of this legislation the Minister has not said very much about it except that he feels that people would not now want to introduce such a law.  I have been working in this area for about 20 years.  The distinguished statistician/researcher/sociologist Professor Michael MacGrail produced a book in about 1969-70 before I or my colleagues had any impact on the public consciousness of this country.  It was called &ldquo;Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland&rdquo; and among the tables Professor MacGrail shows that at the turn of the sixties just coming into 1970 a plurality of Irish people believed that the criminal law should not be sustained, that it should be changed.  That is an important fact and it bears out what Senator Ryan said about the Irish people and their qualities of tolerance and decency.  I have no doubt that figure has significantly increased.  I direct the Minister to, for example, I suppose a sort of <i>vox populi</i>, the Gay Byrne radio show, on which during a debate recently, there was what they call a tele-poll.  I am not suggesting that it is necessarily completely accurate.</P>
    <P>Everybody dismisses polls when they do not suit them and accept them warmly when they do, but in that poll of 11,000 people &mdash; it could not possibly have been <Col N="78" /> rigged &mdash; 66 per cent thought the law should be changed.  Maybe it is a little bit more, maybe it should be a little bit less, but it is a very interesting indicator of the kind of support that could be anticipated.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission came down four square on equality with regard to the age of consent for heterosexual and homosexual intercourse.  I fully endorse that.  The law in Britain is spectacularly bad with regard to the age of consent and the conditions of privacy.  I would like the Minister to take into consideration in framing this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting the increasing commitment to a pluralist inclusive vision of Ireland, recognising that the unemployed are the State's largest excluded minority, calls on the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the dignity and self-respect of unemployed people are enhanced by the social welfare system and other services, and calls specifically for:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> 1.  an increase in payments to unemployed people to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare;</P>
    <P>2.  a revamping of social employment schemes to ensure that scheme workers are not deprived of Christmas bonuses, family income supplement, and supplementary welfare;</P>
    <P>3.  an end, for the long term unemployed, of the invidious requirement to sign on;</P>
    <P>4.  an end, for the long term unemployed of the cruel and degrading demand to &ldquo;actively seek employment&rdquo; in a society where no employment is available;</P>
    <P>5.  a fundamental review, for the long term unemployed, of the manner in which alleged &ldquo;non availability for work&rdquo; is used to harass unemployed people, diminish their initiative and is particularly used against unemployed women with children.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount that needs to be said on this issue and, indeed, even in half an hour I am sure that I can cover it.  May I say first of all that I would like to put on record my gratitude to the Minister's Department &mdash; I sought a considerable amount of information from the Department and it was promptly and comprehensively forthcoming, and I am grateful for that and I thank the Minister. What I want to do in this debate is not so much to focus on the unemployed, though I will do that, as to focus on the unemployed as a large, excluded minority in our State.</P>
    <P>There are many minorities in Ireland. There are many oppressed groups in Ireland and I think that along with my colleagues here and, indeed, with many other people in Irish politics, I have made considerable efforts to support all of those minorities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  In recent weeks, with a certain irony I have heard a lot of people rush to nail their pluralist credentials to the mast.  I would invite all of those people to think through their pluralism, to the country's largest excluded minority.  I use the word carefully because women are actually a majority in our society and therefore do not fall under the category of excluded minorities.</P>
      <P>We should begin to recognise our unemployed for what they are: a large homogenous minority, invisible to a considerable extent, sharing a common experience of pain and humilitation of a variety of kinds.  I can quote from this evening's <i>Evening Press.</i>  This is a report of a lecture given by Dr. Declan McLoughlin of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. He said that the long term unemployed complained of increasing anxiety, depression, insomnia and lack of confidence. He also said that the mental and physical effects of unemployment on such a young population would wreak havoc in the community if the issue were not addressed.  He listed the various symptoms and consequences of unemployment for its victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All surveys show that the majority of unemployed people want a job and think that unemployment is a bad experience. However, there comes a point when people can no longer sustain their motivation in the face of continual rejection, heightened awareness of their own shortcomings, disillusion with job-finding services, belief that all options have been conveyed and the knowledge that jobs are scarce anyway.  I quote that because it is one of the regrettable and painful facts about unemployment that many people subscribe to quite extraordinary prejudices about the unemployed, and not only people who are uninformed. John Blackwell, in a background paper to the report to the Commission on Social Welfare, on the alleged effect of unemployment compensation and the work <Col N="81" /> incentive, showed that there is no conclusive evidence.  In a survey on the literature he quotes the so-called experts, and this is precisely what he says: &ldquo;The literature assumes, in general, that unemployment brings with it a leisure component which yields positive satisfaction.&rdquo; These are the so-called experts surveyed by an expert and an expert who was not particularly sympathetic to those experts.</P>
    <P>We start off considering the perception of the unemployed with that extraordinary assertion of the experts that there is something positive about unemployment; there is a sort of a leisure contribution &mdash; the free time thing.  The first thing to be said is that all of the human statistics as distinct from the economic analysis of unemployment, say the opposite: unemployed people do not find it positive, beneficial, helpful or anything like that.  They find it quite the opposite and, in the words of the doctor, depressing and heartbreaking, etc.  That is the first thing that needs to be said about the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The second thing to remember is that one of the reasons we can have these contradictory and, indeed, untrue statements about the unemployed is because they are effectively, largely and geographically invisible.  If we had, as I have said before, a racial minority which was concentrated overwhelmingly in certain areas of our cities, with poor housing imposed upon it, together with overcrowded, underfunded schools, a diminished if not destroyed physical environment, and increasing problems of substance abuse among its young people, large sections of our liberal establishment would scream &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;.  They would scream &ldquo;this is wrong, this is a minority that has been victimised&rdquo;, but when it happens to our unemployed it apparently becomes an issue which can be ignored.  It has none of the &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; qualities of many of the other areas of minority rights and yet the unemployed are the largest minority in our society. We have many different minorities and many people complain about them. Within that minority of the unemployed, <Col N="82" /> for instance, I will briefly refer to one minority and they are the travelling community.</P>
    <P>The travelling community all round the country are required to sign on at 11.30 a.m. on a Thursday morning.  If our Jewish countrymen or our Muslim countrymen or our black fellow countrymen or Church of Ireland fellow brethern were required to sign on at a particular time at every labour exchange in the country, every single member of the liberal Establishment would scream blue murder and yet the travelling community are subject to this.  You can go to any labour exchange anywhere and pick out the travelling community; they are the people who sign on at 11.30 a.m.  The joke is that this Government, and successive Governments, will deny that, and have done so.  They will deny it by saying we do not pick on the travelling community, it applies to persons of no fixed abode.  The joke of that is, of course, that the official rules of the Department of Social Welfare say you cannot get unemployment assistance if you do not have an address, so therefore, it does not apply to persons of no fixed abode.  The truth is that it applies to the travellers and I think Senator O'Toole when he speaks will elaborate somewhat on that.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing recognition of the devastation of the unemployed.  It is recognised by the variety of schemes which the present Minister to his credit has introduced: schemes on educational opportunities, on part-time work, on participation and voluntary work.  All of these are welcome but they are a little like the South African Government recognising the oppression of apartheid and making concessions on the margins of apartheid to make it more palatable. There are perhaps 1,000 people out of the 220,000 unemployed involved in education schemes.  I do not know how many are involved in voluntary work.  It is still a very small number out of 220,000 people of whom, according to the Department's own figures, perhaps 135,000 are long term unemployed. These schemes are there for most of those people but they do not seem to get <Col N="83" /> through to them and it is worth wondering why.</P>
    <P>These are indications that we are doing something to these people; these are recognitions that these people suffer.  The doctor I quoted said that they suffer; there is considerable evidence on the subject from some other people and every community group will tell you that these people suffer from unemployment.  It is not just the temporary loss of a job; it is the long term effects of exclusion from the job market.  You have to look carefully at what it means to be unemployed and at what we do to the unemployed. The statistic of unemployment is thrown around as if it were the statistic of inflation &mdash; a thing that goes up and down.  Eminent economic commentators do this.  They say that inflation is 4 per cent, unemployment is 17 per cent; two different statistics.  One is a measure of the price of goods and services; the other is a measure of human degradation.  They should not be treated as if they were interchangeable calculations in an economic matrix.  They are two totally different quantities; one refers to people, the other to things.</P>
    <P>One of the popular perceptions of the unemployed is of a large-scale willingness or tendency to fiddle at the first possible opportunity.  Sadly this is prejudice that is widely fostered by certain sections of the media with an enthusiasm that goes far beyond the factual evidence.  The best evidence I have is from the summary of the report of the Craig Gardner Management consultant's review on payment systems issued by the Department.  On page 10 of that report, the Craig Gardner report summary which refers to Dublin, says:</P>
    <P>In terms of monetary expenditure, these figures suggest that about 1 per cent of unemployment payments and something like .8 per cent of disability benefit payments are claimed fraudulently.</P>
    <P>We are talking about figures as low as 1.5 per cent.  I do not think that that represents unemployment schemes being <Col N="84" /> abused on a grand scale.  I do not think it represents anything other than the minuscule tail of abuse in a system which apparently has succeeded in squeezing out most of the abuse.  The problem is what else it has squeezed out in the process of dealing with abuse.</P>
    <P>To understand what is squeezed out of people in this system you have to understand what is done to people.  To qualify for unemployment assistance which is the one which I am most concerned about because it affects the long term unemployed, you have to do a number of things.  The first is that you have to be actively seeking employment and the second is that you must be available for work.  They all sound like laudable options except that when people's unemployment period stretches on for two months, four months and six months you still say that people must be actively seeking employment, must be actively available for work.</P>
    <P>Actively seeking employment means proving you are looking for work.  That would be very fine in a society where there was plenty of work available or where there was a prospect of plenty of work being available but neither is the case.  There are 221,000 people unemployed in this country.  The best forecasts for the next ten years will not push us much below 150,000 and that is being extremely optimistic.  It could stay as high as 170,000 or 180,000 even with the most optimistic forecasts.  You are talking about a large pool of people with an inadequate supply of jobs being told that they must be actively seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Those who run the system, through no fault of their own are forced into impossible dilemmas which cause impossible pain for the unemployed by forcing unfortunate wretches to go through the sham of looking of jobs when everybody knows that there is not a single job available. I met a personnel manager in a factory in County Galway recently, who said he was sick and tired of having to write letters to people telling them that he had no work.  He was only doing it <Col N="85" /> because the unfortunate person who contacted him would be told that he could not qualify for unemployment assistance if he did not have evidence that he had actively sought work.  This man had no jobs available.  I know of many instances of foremen on building sites with big signs outside saying &ldquo;no vacancies&rdquo;, still having to go through the ritual of telling men that they have no work because the men were told that if they did not go and look for work they would be disqualified. It is a humiliating, degrading ritual and there is a simple alternative to it.</P>
    <P>The second requirement, of course, is that you must be available for work.  This is the one which has produced the education scheme, the part-time work scheme, the voluntary work scheme. They are all very well but the one thing to remember in all of these is that for an unemployed person to do anything they must get approval.  To go on voluntary work they must get approval, to go on an education scheme they must get approval.  They must get approval to do a whole lot of things.  Though it is well-intentioned and a good idea, as far as it goes, it still conveys the impression of a suspect minority needing to be controlled, needing to be kept under the watchful eye of those of us who will make sure that they do not stray from the straight and narrow.</P>
    <P>If it were done to a racial minority or to a religious minority we would be up in arms in outrage.  Yet, it is done to our largest excluded minority consistently by the system, not by the individuals who run the system, but by the system itself.  It is the system that is wrong; it is the system that hurts people.  The &ldquo;availability for work&rdquo; provision has at times been loosened but essentially you must be either idle or doing something the system approves of or else you are not available to work.  It is meaningless in a society where work is not available.  It explains nothing and it means nothing in a society where work is not available.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain to the Minister a simple alternative to all of this.  The simple alternative is as follows.  If one <Col N="86" /> wants to know whether people are actively seeking employment, if one wants to know whether people are available for work, offer them a job.  Offer them a job that has pay and conditions similar to those which a trade union in the area would agree with.  If somebody says, &ldquo;No, I do not want that job,&rdquo; then you have proved that they are not available for work and you can say, &ldquo;These people are not really looking for work because when they were offered a job they would not take it.&rdquo;  So why do we not do that?  Because there are not jobs available.  We go through this meaningless ritual of degradation and humiliation to do something that is impossible. There are no jobs available for all these people.  I do not know why it is not so self-evidently correct as to be demanding and screaming out for a change.  We put a quarter of a million people through a ritual like this to search for jobs, to prove they are looking for jobs, for something that does not exist.  It is a dreadful system. It is a hangover from a totally different world.</P>
    <P>We have gone through extremes of this.  I produced a report two years ago on the job search scheme in which I surveyed all the centres for the unemployed around the country asking them what they thought of the job search scheme and they all though very little of it.  The Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice have produced a report in which they concluded it was simply a scheme to harass the unemployed, to put pressure on the unemployed, to keep them under control. Lots of people have come to the same conclusion about that scheme and it is now, thankfully, fading out.  The best estimates of the Department of Social Welfare show that 10,000 full-time jobs were filled through the job search scheme, not because of it, but through it. The real survey would have to be done to see how many of them would have been filled anyway, even if there were no job search scheme.  That was a ritual which further stigmatised the unemployed and tied them down.</P>
    <P>Adding to our insistence on availability for work &mdash; this non-existent work &mdash;<Col N="87" /> are the conditions attached to the social employment scheme.  The problem always is that a whole lot of well-intentioned things are done &mdash; for example, the education programme, the part-time work scheme, the social employment scheme.  They are done with the best intentions in the world.  But it becomes another badge of humiliation.  Anybody who saw those angry people marching up and down outside the gate last week would have to wonder why it is something that actually gives people work could be so hurtful.  The reason is, first, that many of them feel they are shanghaied into doing something that pays them very little more than they get on the dole; but they have to do it or else their unemployment assistance will be cut off.  It pays somewhat more, not a lot more.  But they have a problem.  If they look for the family income supplement they will be told they cannot have it because they are not working.  Therefore, they have a financial crisis and they go to the community welfare officer who tells them, &ldquo;You cannot have it because you are working.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the story of the people outside the gate of this House this week.  One side of the system tells them, &ldquo;You cannot have our benefit because you are not working&rdquo; and the other side tells them, &ldquo;You cannot have our benefit because you are working.&rdquo;  On top of that, they are told that because they are on the social employment scheme they are not eligible for the Christmas bonus that people on the dole get.</P>
    <P>Talk about a scheme that is full of good intentions.  It is so tied up with a perception of the unemployed that they have to be squeezed in on every side.  The problem is a central perception that these people cannot be trusted with their own lives, incomes and so on.  It is a classic perception of a society of a suspect minority, a minority which cannot be trusted not to run away with, metaphorically speaking, the family silver, that is, the unemployment assistance; a suspect minority which cannot be trusted to look for work under its own initiative, which <Col N="88" /> apparently we presume will not work unless it is coerced to work.  This is a classic majority perception of a racial or religious minority, a classic one from Northern Ireland, the US, wherever you like to go.</P>
    <P>A classic perception by the majority of the minority is that they will not work because they do not want to work, not because there is no work available.  Out of all that comes this increasingly invisible homogenous non-thought about a minority. It is time we thought about the unemployed instead of talking about unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to this House a succession of proposals.  I want to go through each of them with some thought at this stage.  They are the proposals contained in the motion.  Each of them deserves to be elaborated upon.  The first of these is the necessity for a substantial increase in the rate of payments.  There are two reasons for this.  One is the sheer justice of the case which is that the money that is available currently is inadequate. The figures at this stage should be £61 for a single person and £100 for a single person with an adult dependant.  The current rates for unemployment assistance for the long term unemployed are £52 for a single person and £31 for an adult dependant, which adds up to £83.  We are talking not about large incomes but minimum incomes and we are still a long way away from the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare.  It is important to appreciate that those figures understate the recommendation, because the Commission on Social Welfare recommend that child dependant rates for unemployed people should be big enough to support the children, which means that a quite dramatic increase in the child dependant figures is also necessary. That is the first primary requirement. Let us get away from the side arguments that this would represent a disincentive to work.  The overwhelming evidence is that people want to work. The only people who believe that the unemployed do not want to work are econmists who never talk to the unemployed, who look at statistical evidence, <Col N="89" /> who attempt to generate cause and effect relationships where none exist.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has spoken to unemployed people will know the lengths to which they will go to work.  I knew a man who actually hitched 30 miles every morning and evening in order to do a social employment scheme just because he wanted to do something.  He ended up, like everybody else, being degraded, humiliated and hurt by that.  The list of people is endless.  The Department's own statistics are endless and prove beyond doubt that people do not abuse social welfare.  Social welfare abuses people. It is not the fault of the Department's officials.  It is the system and its perception that has degraded people and humiliated them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the signing on requirment, I am not sure what it is supposed to prove.  When we had no information technology, when we had all the other problems of cumbersome paperwork, etc., there may have been a reason.  One only needs to talk to somebody about the shock of the first visit to the labour exchange.  I have a friend, a journalist, who was put temporarily out of work by an industrial dispute which did not affect him.  He went down to his local labour exchange to sign on.  He is a confident, articulate, self-assured person who knows his rights.  He came out of it after one visit with a large lump of his dignity taken from him, not by the officials, but by the system.  One visit by an educated, articulate, confident man &mdash; a man who had a job as a by-line specialist correspondent in a national newspaper &mdash; to the labour exchange and he felt that he had lost a large portion of his dignity.  For people who do this week after week for a large part of their adult lives it is guaranteed to destroy their dignity.  It cannot be any other way.</P>
    <P>I have described at length the actively seeking employment requirement.  In a society where there was a shortage of labour and a surplus of jobs, it may have been an idea but in a society where work is scarce and people without work are numerous, to send one quarter of a million people chasing jobs around the <Col N="90" /> country is an exercise in collective humiliation of a minority.  It should end.  If there is a need for control then it is up to those who administer the system.  Successive Governments have looked at this.  It is not the fault of any particular Government. It is up to them to devise an alternative system.  For anybody who has been on the dole for six months, for whom FÁS, the Department of Social Welfare and all the other schemes have failed to provide anything, can we at least say after six months &ldquo;Yes, we have failed you.  We cannot give you a job, we cannot offer you the hope of a job, we cannot offer you anything.  All we can do is give you a few miserable bob to keep you away from total humiliation.&rdquo;  Let us drop this requirement to go seeking work on people who have been humiliated over weeks and months and, in some cases, years &mdash; drop it completely.  Similarly, with the whole question of non-availability for work: for the long term unemployed it is a meaningless phrase.  To suggest that people have to prove their idleness or have to have their non-idleness approved of by the system is, again, to add to their humiliation and degradation.</P>
    <P>The issue is not simply modification to the system; it is an end to the system, because what the system has done is to create a stigmatised minority of about a quarter of a million people and, with their dependants and children, at least a half a million people in our society.  It has created it, stigmatised it, put labels around it of &ldquo;dosser&rdquo;, &ldquo;fiddler&rdquo;, etc., and in the process has given them not enough money, but an excess of pain and suffering, and has achieved no purpose either for the Exchequer, for the unemployed or for the labour market.</P>
    <P>May I say, in conclusion, that if the argument is to be made that the real solution to unemployment is the creation of jobs, I would be the first to stand up and cheer.  I remind the House that the best forecasts suggest that we will have at least 150,000 people unemployed by the year 2000 and it will probably be closer to 175,000 or 180,000 or maybe <Col N="91" /> even 200,000 depending on what happens. Those 200,000 people are a homogeneous, coherent minority &mdash; excluded, invisible and unheard.  They do not appear on television, they do not have anything.  There are more people unemployed than go on continental holidays; yet, we do not hear about them the way we do about continental holidays.  There are more people unemployed than buy expensive clothes in Grafton Street, and yet we have a television programme every week about expensive clothes in Grafton Street.  We make them invisible and, once made invisible, we humiliate them by our assumptions, by our systems and by the continuing presumption of their unworthiness of our support.  I suggest to this House that modifications and tinkering at the margins of the system will not do.  It is the system which destroys them, it is the system which must be changed and it is with that in view that I move the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan has given a most comprehensive outline of the thinking behind this motion.  In seconding it, all I can do is perhaps to add to the edges of what he has already said to us. The point I immediately want to make is that I wish to emphasise the group of people about whom we are speaking.  The unemployed of Ireland are the people who populate our prisons, are the people who populate our labour exchanges, are the people who populate our most overcrowded areas.  The unemployed lose out in every aspect of life.  They lose out both in the social media in which they operate and also in the way they are treated by the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe &mdash; and neither does Senator Ryan, the proposer of the motion &mdash; that there is any great conspiracy out there to get the unemployed, but it is the uncaring response of bureaucracy which has created such huge levels of indignity for the unemployed.  In many ways it is perhaps fair to say that the system responds to the views of the population. The truth is &mdash; and we have all seen it happen &mdash; somebody has been working, <Col N="92" /> and working hard, for 20 or 30 years and suddenly through no fault of his or hers the factory, the office, the company or whatever closes down and that person finds himself or herself in late middle-age with no employment.  He or she is suddenly a member of the ranks of the unemployed and becomes somebody who is spoken about in hushed tones around the neighbourhood.  From that moment on it is as if there is some stigma attached to that person because he does not work, because he is unemployed.  That is there in society.  The continuation of that, and where it gets worse, is when those who in a sense feel superior &mdash; indeed, they are superior because they are in employment &mdash; and have been somewhat looking down at the unemployed person &mdash; suddenly in turn find themselves unemployed.  Then it is indignity piled upon indignity.  They can no longer cope with their changed status and they also see themselves in terms of low self-esteem and they too comply to the type we assign to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I want to make a comment which I often make about people in any form of employment whenever I hear people talk about lazy politicians or politicians not doing their job, whenever I hear people say the same about any group of people, whether they be teachers, doctors, solicitors, or roadworkers.  There will always be the philosopher in the pub who will in a generic statement say that they are all a shower of dossers.  The reality is that the percentage of idlers or lazers among the unemployed is no higher than it is among the employed.  That is the reality. The number of people who are prepared to doss does not vary between employment and unemployment except for a very small minority.  The vast majority of the unemployed are people who wish to work, who have made every attempt to find work and many of whom worked as long as there was work available to them. They worked hard and did their work well.  It is unfair then that they are cast suddenly as leeches on society, are presented as people who seem prepared to suck us dry, when all they really want to do is work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> Without a shadow of a doubt, we have failed to bridge the gap, we have failed to make our community understand that to be unemployed is a handicap we should respond to in the way we would to other handicaps by helping and supporting people.  We do not do that.  In this society it is much easier for us to point the finger, to blame and to take the cruel line that that person is unemployed, therefore, that person is a drain on society; the attitude is &ldquo;That person is sucking us dry.  We can do without him&rdquo;.  Therefore, when you get a tax bill there is a tendency to say &ldquo;Here am I going to work early in the morning and coming home late and your man did not get up yet and when he did it was only to watch television&rdquo;.  There is nothing as bad &mdash; and many of us I am sure would have come across it &mdash; as knowing the person whose life was routine, clockwork &mdash; up in the morning, out to work, pride in his or her work, doing everything that was required to be done, supporting the family, contributing to the community &mdash; suddenly finding himself or herself unemployed.  This person goes through the system of the labour exchange, suffers the total indignity &mdash; as outlined so graphically by Senator Ryan when he spoke &mdash; and then finds himself without dignity, unable to keep his head up in society.  He finds himself cowering behind closed curtains during the mornings and afternoons and getting up to watch satellite television for half the night &mdash; anything rather than face people out there.  This is all because we have made it a crime to be unemployed; we have made it unacceptable to be unemployed, though we have not offered the jobs.</P>
    <P>The solution to unemployment is job creation and we have failed in job creation.  When I say we have failed, I think we all have played some part in that failure.  All of us elected public representatives have failed to make it work.  I am not taking the easy option here; I just want to create some sort of consensus here today.  It is easy enough to point the finger at Government &mdash; and, indeed, I would be critical of Government at many levels &mdash; but this is stretching far above and beyond that.  We have failed as <Col N="94" /> elected public representatives to create the climate for job creation or to force job creation onto the sectors who can do that.  We have not managed to do it for our people.</P>
    <P>The group who were demonstrating and agitating last week outside the House were those on the social employment schemes.  I know many of them.  There are 2,000 of them working in national schools throughout the country.  I use the word &ldquo;working&rdquo;, because of course they are working.  As Senator Ryan so clearly illustrated, it is strange how they can be working for one set of circumstances and not for another set of circumstances. Without a doubt these are people who are dependent on a wage per week which is no more, or marginally more, than they would be getting if they were not doing any work at all.  It seems an incredible harsh and cruel thing to do &mdash; to punish them for working by not giving them the Christmas bonus which is available to everybody else on social welfare.  I appeal to the Minister not to come back and tell me that working on an social employment scheme is not social welfare.  I am not interested in titles; I am not interested in letters, I am just interested in the reality of the poverty and the indignity and the suffering of these people.  It seems incredible that we would create a system where we would punish those who are trying to make ends meet, to do their best, to contribute in the only way open to them, which for many of them is the social employment scheme, with all its flaws, at least creates an outlet, an opportunity, a work <i>milieu</i> for people who would otherwise be unemployed and who get for their work only the most minimal of wages. They are without a shadow of a doubt entitled to their Christmas bonus.  It seems a most heartless thing that we have refused to give them that.</P>
    <P>I urge that that would be one of the things that the Minister would respond to in a very positive way and at least clear it up for the future if we have lost out on it for this year.  Those people are indeed facing a very poor Christmas.  They are being punished for working.  I met many of them last week and they said they were <Col N="95" /> marginally better off by being on the social employment scheme.  Certainly, coming up to Christmas they would have been far better off to be sitting at home in the morning and just collecting welfare at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the logic of signing on.  I really want to press this point.  The State needs accountability for every cheque it hands out.  I do not have anything difficulty with that; I thoroughly support that.  In all walks of life the State should insist on getting its value and check every cheque that goes out to make sure it is going to the right place and that it is required to be spent.  I want to make that quite clear, and I think Senator Ryan made it quite clear, that this is not an attempt to create a situation where the State can be defrauded.  I think that is the least part of the State's worry.  The State knows the number unemployed and knows the amount being paid to them.  If there is a very small proportion of people who are defrauding the State by collecting and at the same time working on the black economy, then I suggest we employ people to make sure that does not happen again, because nobody supports it and those of us who speak on behalf of the unemployed do not support defrauding the State either, under any system.  For those tiny minority who are at it, another structure should be set up to root them out and to deal with them in the way required by the law.</P>
    <P>But the illogicality of requiring people to get into the queue every week and to go through the whole torture of inquisition, or whichever way it is dealt with in different ways in different places, does not make any sense to me.  It is part of the unemployment industry.  That is what it is.  There are many people whose structures and bureaucracies depend in fact on a continuation of unemployment.  Those people would be better off by doing other things, and I have not the slightest doubt they would be the first to say so themselves. It seems that coupling this with the requirement that they be seen to be <Col N="96" /> actively seeking employment is the greatest nonsense imaginable.  I do not understand how people can be actively seeking employment when the employment does not exist.</P>
    <P>Where are all these jobs that are not being filled?  Where are all the vacancies that are not being filled?  Where are all the employers who are crying out looking for workers and cannot get the workers? It is an utter nonsense.  Many of these people on unemployment are wasting valuable bus fares or petrol money or whatever it is, travelling around trying to participate in the charade of actively seeking employment which does not exist.  Chasing a dream is what it is, Minister. It certainly does not make any sense at all.  There could be a far more effective and efficient way of accounting.  I would not insult the Minister by going through the various different ways.  Senator Ryan, in passing, mentioned information technology. It would be just as easy to push a card into the wall every week as it is to go through this whole process of procedure and charade that is there at the moment.</P>
    <P>I also want to reiterate the point raised by Senator Ryan about the travellers.  It is nothing other than sectarianism.  It is nothing other than apartheid.  I had a meeting with a group of travellers last night.  It was with the Dublin Travellers Education Group.  They described to me, as they do on a regular basis, what it is like being a traveller, being unemployed, trying to cope with the system, the barriers that are put in their way, the difficulties that are created for them and how they are made to feel like a herd of the lowest untouchables in the State. Many of these people are very articulate in the way they can put forward their point of view.  It seems utterly unacceptable that this group, of all the groups in the State, should be treated so differently, that they have to do what they have to do.  Anybody can see this on a Thursday morning.  They have the children with them as they dare not leave them in the trailers, particularly at this time of the year with heaters and everything else on and a danger of fire in these <Col N="97" /> trailers and, as we saw during the week, deaths from hypothermia and so on.  So they have to take the children with them. Does the Minister know that on any Thursday the education classes for travellers around this city are halved, because the children are all brought into town with their parents while they are trying to cope with the system of gaining unemployment. Any teacher of travellers in this city will confirm that view.  It is an utter nonsense and it achieves nothing except further hardship for an already persecuted group of people, people with their own cultural identity.</P>
    <P>I had intended dealing with many other issues but I just want to make one passing reference to a matter which is very close to my own heart in the area of the unemployed and that is a group of long-term unemployed who never get to claim for anything.  I am talking about teachers.  I had a meeting two weeks ago with three teachers who have been teaching for the last five years.  They have been teaching for as many days employment as they can get over the last five years &mdash; a day here, two days there.  There would hardly be a week over the last five years when they have not had some form of employment, but they have never had enough to put up stamps.  They are a group of people who despite being available for work, despite actively seeking work in the sense of showing up at our head office every morning and waiting for somebody to ring up and call them in to do a day's substitute teaching or whatever, are never able to put up the requisite number of 39 stamps or whatever it is in order to get into the system.  Those are people at the two ends of the spectrum: the third level professionally educated people, the teachers, who do not get to claim at all; and the travellers at the other end of the scale, who have not had access to education, have also been discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The system does not make sense at the moment.  The Minister is a man who has brought in many reforms and made many changes for the better.  That is widely recognised.  He has tried to consolidate the legislation, tried to create a sense of <Col N="98" /> awareness and response to the needs of the community.  I appeal to the Minister tonight to look at the points in this motion to see if there is a way by which this could be achieved with more dignity; to see if there is a way that this problem can be addressed, where we do not give offence to those who are already suffering from the trauma, hardship and cruelty of being unemployed.  I appeal to the Minister to respond positively to this motion and I appeal to my colleagues on the Government benches to withdraw the amendment, which does nothing at all to address the issues which we have raised in the motion.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;having regard to the problems associated with unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment:</P>
      <P>(a)  welcomes the substantial progress that has been made by the Government in implementing the rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare for this disadvantaged group through special increases given in successive budgets,</P>
      <P>(b)  welcomes the introduction by the Minister for Social Welfare of a flexible and innovative approach through special educational schemes and employment-related measures specifically directed at the long-term unemployed,</P>
      <P>(c)  acknowledges the Government's record of improvements in the delivery of social welfare services with particular emphasis on the dignity and privacy of those dependent on those services,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  notes the priority attached by the Minister for Labour to the problems of the long-term unemployed through the continuation and <Col N="99" /> improvements in training-employment schemes to assist that group return to the workforce, and</P>
    <P>(e)  notes the resolution on the long-term unemployed adopted by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers during the Irish Presidency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The commitment by Fianna Fáil to social welfare goes back to the first time we came into Government, when in 1933 they introduced unemployment assistance for the first time.  The situation about the unemployed is that obviously the long-term solution must lie in trying to provide employment for as many people as possible.  However, it appears that for the foreseeable future there will be people who will be dependent on unemployment assistance.  It is my experience that there can be &mdash; and I would accept this &mdash; an indignity for people being unemployed.  There is a whole social problem associated with unemployment. For example, I have so often noted a big difference between small farmers dependent on unemployment assistance to supplement their income and people who are unemployed. However, in the last few years progress has been made in improving the system.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the staff in the Department of Social Welfare.  As somebody who does a lot of work with people who depend on social welfare, I find the staff of the Department courteous and very helpful in providing information quickly.  However, I would highlight a problem that I have often come up against.  A person in business will hire a consultant to deal with the tax office on their behalf.  Obviously that remedy is not available to those in receipt of unemployment benefit and they can experience difficulties in dealing with the system, not because the system itself is malign but because they do not normally deal with bureaucratic systems.  It is important that people would be available to advise them on how to avail of what is due to them.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Bill introduced this year there were increases of up to 11 <Col N="100" /> per cent.  Wide ranging steps were taken to provide better benefits for people, for example, the age for the dependent child allowance was raised in certain cases. A lone parent allowance and a carer's allowance were introduced and this is particularly relevant to the question of actively seeking employment.  One group of people I used to feel sorry for were those people who were not able to seek employment because they were actively caring for people who needed care.  This year that group were catered for with the introduction of this new scheme.  It often worries me that with the negative approach that is taken at times, people do not understand that new schemes were introduced and that steps were taken to provide for people in those circumstances. That scheme opened up new horizons for people who had no work and who also had the difficulty that they had to look after somebody in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>There was also an improvement in means testing, which is very important for unemployed people.  For example, bhí ceist mná tí na Gaeltachta.  Bhí sé sin an-tábhachtach don dream atá ag brath orthu siúd an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Ach chomh maith leis sin, bhí feabhas ar an gcaoi a mheastar ioncam feirmeoirí i mbliana.  Steps were taken through the family income supplement to improve the lot of the low income worker.  At the end of the day, we must give an incentive to employers to take as many people as possible into gainful employment.  Many other schemes were introduced which enable people to take up gainful employment for example, the part-time job incentive scheme, the new education opportunity scheme for the unemployed and the voluntary work option.  All these give a wide choice to people on unemployment assistance to engage in voluntary work, education, part-time work or whatever.  I am sure the Minister would like to do a lot more in this area. As urban unemployment increased there was not only that problem to be faced but also the lack of activity in that area.  The demand for the social employment <Col N="101" /> schemes proves their success.  The introduction of the child dependance allowance last year was a great step forward in social employment schemes.  For married people or people with child dependants, the social employment schemes became attractive.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that for people with small farms, etc., who are means tested and go on social employment schemes, the benefit of being in the scheme, compared to social assistance, is great.  One of the improvements I would like to see is to have the schemes running slightly longer than at present.  Perhaps a two-year term could be introduced over a period, which would enable more work to be done.</P>
    <P>One point that has not been stressed is that the social employment scheme also affords somebody an opportunity to take up any other type of employment they want to when they are off.  These social employment schemes either work on a two-and-a-half day week on and a two-and-a-half day week off or a week on, week off system.  It has afforded people an opportunity to take up employment on a small scale without being worried about means testing.  Many young people are not aware that they can do this under the social employment scheme.  I would like to see this point being stressed.  As a co-op manager, I know that we were often able to give supplementary work to people on social employment schemes when we needed temporary employees. This boosted their income considerably. I understand that a single person on long-term unemployment assistance, including the bonus at Christmas, will earn £244 over the Christmas period compared to £278 for somebody on a social employment scheme.  So a person on a social employment scheme will be considerably better off over the Christmas period than somebody on unemployment assistance. As well as that, as I pointed out, they have freedom to supplement their income either from self-employment or paid employment during this period.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that over the last few years there has been an innovative reforming approach to social welfare. <Col N="102" /> The rates of payments and the whole social welfare code here now compare very favourably with what our neighbours across the water have.  We must build on what has been done.  We have to ensure that the rough edges in the system &mdash; and I would be the first to admit that there are still rough edges &mdash; are eroded in a step-by-step approach.  It is very important that the attitude of the public at large towards people on social security should change.  As politicians, we can influence that.</P>
    <P>In the community where I live no differentiation is made between those who are in employment and those who unfortunately are unemployed in either social standing or any other way.  That is an attitude that has been generated by that community.  That is not something that can be laid down by Government.  We lead by example.  As a co-op manager and as a politician I would not treat differently somebody who is on unemployment assistance and somebody who has a job.</P>
    <P>The main problem arises in an urban context in that people have different lifestyles and are more segregated than they are in rural areas.  The only way to tackle that problem is to encourage more integrated communities, particularly in urban areas.  In rural areas we do not have this divide.  There is no sense of shame attached to a person who is signing on.  That attitude reflects the structure of the community rather than the structure of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Regarding the signing-on aspect, it is true there is a move away from that.  A major step was taken in the pre-retirement scheme where a person over 60 years of age no longer has to sign on.  I hope further steps will be taken to ensure that the necessity for signing on will be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Mar a deirim, tá an tAire le moladh as an méid athruithe atá curtha i bhfeidhm aige le cúpla bliain anuas.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Commission on Social Welfare sets out the principles on which a modern social welfare system should be founded.  They stated:</P>
      <P>A social welfare system should have explicit underlying principles.  These have not been clearly enunciated in the Irish context.  We therefore, considered that the guiding principles should be adequacy, redistribution, comprehensiveness, consistency and simplicity.</P>
      <P>It is in the context of these underlying principles that I support this motion which calls for an increase in the rates of payment to unemployed people to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare; a revamping of the social employment scheme so that those 10,000 people or so who are employed in these schemes and who are doing such excellent work throughout the country in urban and rural areas are not deprived of a Christmas bonus, fuel allowances, butter vouchers and indeed are not made subject to local authority rent increases because they have participated in these very valuable schemes.</P>
      <P>I support this motion because it calls for an end to the invidious and humilitating requirement which is placed on the long-term unemployed to sign on; because it calls for an end to the cruel and degrading requirement that the long-term unemployed &ldquo;actively seek employment&rdquo; and this is at a time when the Government Estimates and the Government social welfare budget is based on an unemployment figure of 221,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this motion because it calls for a fundamental review in respect of long-term unemployed on the way in which the alleged non-availability for work is used to harass unemployed people, to diminish their initiative and their morale and because it is particularly used against unemployed women with children.  With regard to the question of <Col N="104" /> the basic payment structure, the commission's report emphasises that the most important issue dealt with in the report is the specification of a minimum adequate income.  That report states:</P>
    <P>Social Welfare payments should be set at a level that ensures a minimum adequate standard of living relative to incomes and to living standards in society generally.  While some social welfare recipients have additional sources of income, or are living in households with additional sources of income, we believe that in establishing an adequate minimum income and an adequate basic level for social welfare payments, our primary concern should be to ensure that social welfare payments offer an adequate standard of living to social welfare recipients whatever their household circumstances and independent of any other income sources accruing to individuals or households.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>We recognise that for about half the households with a social welfare recipient there is no income source other than social welfare, and for many more, the individuals and families are dependent on social welfare.  The minimum income from social welfare must, therefore, be set at a sufficiently high level to provide for total income needs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of administration and the delivery process, the report states that, in general, the quality of the service is in marked contrast with the standard which claimants are entitled to expect.  This is evidenced from delays in processing claims, lack of access to information and the general appearance of buildings.  The report stresses that the sense of entitlement should prevail in relation to social insurance and social assistance and that arrangements for means testing should not be socially stigmatising.</P>
    <P>The report summarises its conclusion in regard to the delivery process as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> The system should be administered in a manner which enables it to respond quickly and efficiently to the needs of the applicants, and which respects their individual rights and dignity.  The present high level of dependency on social welfare with over one-third of the population dependent on these payments for all or part of their income, gives added impetus to the need to maximise efficiency within the system.</P>
    <P>The report considers that the administration of the social welfare system should be localised as far as possible and in this connection I believe there is a strong case to be made for the regionalisation of the social welfare system so that all social welfare schemes and all determinations can be dealt with on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> dated 3 August, 1988 entitled &ldquo;The Long-Term Unemployed &mdash; How Business Can Tap The Wasted Potential&rdquo;, Richard Jackman of the London School of Economics and Political Science stated &ldquo;the greatest social evil of our time is long-term unemployment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Professor Junankar of the University of Essex in a report prepared for the Commission of the European Communities entitled &ldquo;The Very Long-Term Unemployed in the European Community&rdquo; points out that since the beginning of the eighties there has been an enormous increase in unemployment in the European Community and a concomitant increase in long-term unemployment where the duration is for one year or more and in very long-term unemployment where the duration is two years or more.  For the European Community as a whole unemployment increased from about 12 million in 1983 to 13 million in 1986, while very long-term unemployment increased over the same period from two million in 1983 to three million in 1986.  These enormous increases suggest a crisis in the European labour market which requires concerted action by the European Community to alleviate <Col N="106" /> the social and economic costs of unemployment. The extent of the problem in Ireland was highlighted in a submission made on 7 June 1989 to the ministerial committee on employment by the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice entitled Long-Term Unemployment.  That submission states that the eighties have seen a massive increase in the numbers of people unemployed in the Republic of Ireland and that, in addition, the character of unemployment has changed significantly. Throughout the eighties the numbers of people trapped in long-term unemployment grew even more rapidly than total unemployment.  At the latest count, according to the report of October 1988, there were 109,000 long-term unemployed on the live register in this country.  This represented 47 per cent of the total unemployed at that time.  It seems, therefore, that a long-term strategy of job creation must be at the centre of efforts to combat unemployment. However, all the available evidence suggests that, as things stand, the long-term unemployed will be the last to benefit from any general increase in employment. They are, in effect, locked out of the labour market.  Special measures are necessary to enable them to break back in.</P>
    <P>That submission from the Jesuit Centre draws the following important conclusions in relation to policy.  They say that it cannot be doubted that special interventions are needed to combat long-term unemployment.  This point was made forcefully by the OECD report in a recent publication.  They state:</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment will not disappear of its own accord, even in the event of substantial economic and employment growth.  There has to be, therefore, an acceptance that its resolution will require special measures. If the situation is allowed to drift, with insufficient assistance provided for those out of work for a long time, in many countries this would indeed be tantamount to consigning large numbers of long-term unemployed people to near permament social oblivion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> On a more hopeful note, intervention can make a difference.  As Professor Junankar points out, the available data suggests that countries that have an active policy towards long-term unemployed and the very long-term unemployed, such as Denmark and France, have succeeded in decreasing long-term unemployment and very long-term unemployment.  The experience of Sweden, as Richard Jackman points out, also highlights the effectiveness of intervention.</P>
    <P>The second conclusion drawn by that submission is that the overall extent of intervention to date in this country is clearly inadequate given the scale of the problem and we risk falling into the category of countries in which the situation is allowed to drift with all the obvious unwelcome consequences.  The third conclusion drawn is the need for targeting. This must be emphasised.  In this connection, the OECD report of 1988 emphasises that once a policy decision has been taken to support disadvantaged groups, such as the long-term unemployed, measures must be taken with provisions which direct, concentrate and, indeed, target assistance on the groups concerned.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the social employment scheme.  This, of course, is a direct employment scheme and it is primarily targeted on the long-term unemployed.  It was designed to achieve two basic objectives: (1) to help the long-term unemployed workers to re-enter the active work place and (2) to help public bodies such as local authorities and voluntary groups to do worthwhile work which they could not otherwise have undertaken.  Such schemes expand the opportunities open to the unemployed and they also act as a stepping-stone back into mainstream employment.  However, there is urgent need at the moment to improve and revamp the social employment scheme to ensure that those who participate should not be seen to be penalised and degraded by being deprived of such modest concessions as Christmas bonuses and fuel allowances.</P>
    <P>It is also of interest to note that the <Col N="108" /> National Campaign for Welfare Reform in their report of July 1990 carried out a detailed analysis of the action, if any, which is being taken on the 65 recommendations which were made by the Commission on Social Welfare.  They noted that of the 65 recommendations, seven have been implemented, 20 have been partly implemented but a further 38 have not been implemented at all.  For example, in recommendation 38 the commission recommended that the present signing-on arrangements should be modified so as to provide claimants with a greater choice as to the method of payment. These are some of the suggestions contained in the report.</P>
    <P>I agree with speakers who said that the Minister for Social Welfare has shown great wisdom in many areas and has shown innovation in improving the system.  There are some important recommendations contained in the commission's report which should be acted upon.  It gives me great pleasure to support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the points which have been made by Senators and I will have an opportunity to reply to them on the next evening.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Senator Kennedy that the report of the Commission on Social Welfare is a 1986 report.  It lay on the shelf for a little while but I got it down and started to implement parts of it.  One of the elements that was implemented in a very big way is localisation and we have actually set out a regional structure.  I know it was only set up this summer but there is now a regional management structure.  Senators will see that coming into operation in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often suggested that a general upturn in the economy does not necessarily benefit those dependent on social welfare or on low incomes.  However, the improvement in public finances which has been secured under this Government has ensured that social welfare increases in real terms over the past three years have more than kept pace with inflation and in so far as the lowest rates of payment <Col N="109" /> are concerned, such as unemployment assistance, have outstripped anything that was achieved before.</P>
    <P>The Government have been particularly conscious of the need to ensure that those dependent on social welfare, benefit from the improvement in the economy as a whole.  Despite financial constraints, the Government continue their policy of sustained improvements in the social welfare area.  Over the past three years we have more than maintained all payments against inflation, given special increases to those on the lowest payments, introduced many improvements in existing schemes, introduced a number of major new schemes and services including the carer's allowance and the lone parent's allowance and improved in many respects the effectiveness of the delivery of our services.</P>
    <P>The new social welfare appeals office is a major development in the social welfare area.  This new office, with its own director and chief appeals officer, will ensure that social welfare clients have an appeals system which is clearly seen to be independent, modern, efficient, fair and easily accessible.  We invested an enormous amount of money in bringing about a situation where we can be flexible in our payment systems.  We are dealing with a huge system.  There are many offices involved.  It took enormous computerisation and investment to get to that stage.  We have made some significant changes but the day when social welfare recipients get their money from &ldquo;the hole in the wall&rdquo; depends on two things, the completion of that whole programme and the willingness and interest of our clients to receive their money in this way.  The situation still is that the majority of people on unemployment benefit want to receive their payments weekly in cash. That has a bearing on what is happening. Our design is intended to provide full flexibility.  In fact, there are people here today from Czechoslovakia looking at our modern system.  People from Canada with whom I was speaking recently are coming to look at the system here because, having looked at others, they <Col N="110" /> consider ours to be the most integrated, most modern system with the greatest potential for localisation and regionalisation of the service.  We have made enormous progress in a very short time. I take the points that have been made by Senators and I will reply at greater length later.</P>

      <P>I would like to complete what I had been saying about the age of consent.  It is important that we place this whole business into context.  The age of consent proposed by the Law Reform Commission of 17 is not at all adventurous, it is acceptable to me, and quite a good idea.  In the European context, I would like to indicate what some of the ages of consent are and also to say that Ireland has the unhappy distinction of being one of four jurisdictions in Europe that still retains this kind of law, the other three being Romania, the Soviet Union and the Greek section of Cyprus.  France reformed its law with a common age of consent of 15 in 1791 and Catholic Spain in 1822 with a common age of consent of 12.  Portugal has a common age of consent of 16 since 1852.  The Netherlands, since 1811, has a common age of consent of 16. Switzerland also has a consent age of 16. Italy since 1889 has an age of consent of 14.  Malta, since 1973, has an age of consent of 18.  East Germany had a common age of consent of 14.  Poland, good Catholic Poland, an ideal analogue to the State of Ireland, has an age of consent of 15 since 1932.  Greece has an age of consent of 15.  Albania has a common age of consent of 18.  In Turkey it is 18, in Norway it is 16, in Sweden it is 15 and in Denmark it is 15.  That is the kind of context within which this proposed change of the law which the Minister has indicated ought to be seen. Those statistics will be available to the Minister and his advisers.  I say that because it is important to know the background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> I will make another series of points, very briefly, because I know the time is limited.  Israel, a country which in biblical times produced the taboo, reformed the law a couple of years ago.  England, which is the source of our legislation, reformed the law in 1967 &mdash; although unsuccessfully. May I again say to the Minister that he is a good Minister for Justice and he spoke on the rape Bill earlier.  I am heartened by what he said about the Law Reform Commission's report.  I hope he will follow up the rape Bill and the incitement to hatred legislation which is commented upon extensively in Europe.  I travel a lot to European human rights conferences and it has been remarked upon.  I have been complimented, as a representative of Ireland, on the vision and foresight that was displayed by the Minister on that occasion.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to do what lazy Ministers of all Governments have done in the past, and that is to reach for the nearest available British precedent.  That would not satisfy the requirements and I am heartened by the indication the Minister has strongly given this evening that he will be looking positively at the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. I would like to encourage him to do that and I hope he will note that I have not been at all negative in what I have said today.  I would like to encourage him to implement those recommendations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the European Court, I know there was a kind of moral or political obligation on the Government to oppose my case in that they tried to sustain two totally opposed and contradictory notions.  One was that the moral fabric of Ireland would disintegrate if they did not keep the criminal law in operation and the other was that they did not use it anyway.  They were quite mutually exclusive and they illustrated the absurdity of the position in which people who oppose this kind of reform find themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the judgment of Mr. Justice McWilliam.  I do not have time to read it <Col N="112" /> into the record but I will just indicate that that judgment was almost a charter of gay rights when it was given.  At the end of it there was a little swerve which introduced the question of the democratic and Christian nature of the State.  May I say that the Government have known since 1981, after the Dudgeon judgment, that this was likely to be impugned here?  It was extraordinary and it was sad for me that the Supreme Court did not find the laws unconstitutional because I am pained by the fact that a law which has been found to violate fundamental human rights can still be in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would like to end on a note of optimism because, as I mentioned at the beginning of what I said this evening, my feelings as a gay man were that I was being treated in very much the same way a Roman Catholic would have been treated under the Penal Laws.  A great Irish politician, Daniel O'Connell, who fought valiantly and successfully in repealing the Penal Laws against the Roman Catholic religion said &mdash; I do not have the exact reference of his speech but I was very moved and taken when I read it some years ago &mdash; that human liberty and dignity are not a finite resource and that by giving dignity and freedom to other people you do not diminish your own freedom and your own dignity; in fact, you enhance the concept of dignity and freedom for all citizens.  I would like to commend that thought to the Minister because if he moves in that spirit and implements the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission he will have enhanced not only my freedom as a citizen of this country who happens to be homosexual, but will also enhance the freedoms and dignities of all citizens and at last put this matter to sleep.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, I would like to welcome the decision of the Leader of the House to give the Seanad the opportunity to make statements in relation to this very important matter which is one of deep emotion and concern and affects very directly a percentage of <Col N="113" /> our population.  Let me say also that I very much welcome the Minister's statement today.  He has shown us in the Bill which went through this House only a matter of hours ago how he is a practical and, at the same time, concerned reformer, not easily pushed by fashion into any particular act but willing to give consideration and then, if necessary, to give his full backing to a reform process. I am quite sure he will do the same in relation to the Bill that will be coming before us some time in the new year.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a few additional comments.  First, in relation to basic human rights, I certainly agree that there has been enormous intolerence, prejudice, ill-treatment and discrimination against people who happen to be homosexuals. It is high time that that was outlawed.  It should not be part of our society.  There is a basic human right here to people's individuality and that certainly was being totally infringed.  That does not mean in any sense that I necessarily agree with any or all of the comments &mdash; although I fully agree with some &mdash; that Senator Norris has made.  I do not believe that one can be entirely happy with the situation that has evolved in other countries.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris has rightly drawn attention to the age of consent, for example, in many other countries in Europe.  I appreciate his courtesy in making quite an amount of documentation available to me which has been very helpful.  In matters of changes in legislation and changes in fashion, one sometimes swings from one extreme to another.  It has been perhaps, unfortunate that the delay in introducing very necessary legislation, overdue legislation, in relation to homosexuality should on occasion have been taken advantage of by that particular group and carried, perhaps, to extremes. In the process that aroused further antagonism and further conflict between the heterosexual and the homosexual communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the outset that I consider it to be a matter of a basic right.  If an individual happens to be a homosexual, so be it; that is the way he or she happens <Col N="114" /> to be genetically and there should be absolutely no discrimination against that individual.  That does not necessarily mean, however, as some homosexuals seem to believe, that the majority of the population should accept that as in some sense the norm.  I do not accept it as the norm and I do not think it should in general society be accepted as the norm. When people move on from there to suggestions in relation to children being adopted by homosexual couples and matters of that nature, then the pendulum is being pushed a little too far in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in relation to the appalling epidemic of AIDS.  This is, perhaps, the most appalling medical epidemic the world has faced for centuries.  As happens with all things that terrify us, people tend to exaggerate in one sense or another. There is no doubt about it whatever that AIDS can be heterosexually transmitted. It can be transmitted by other means. There are unfortunate people here and in many other countries, who have been infected through a blood transfusion.  To go from there to suggest that in some sense or other the facts relating to the relatively high incidence in the gay community are not facts, as some documentation and some suggestions make out, is not doing anyone a service in any sense.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects to this. Sex and all its connotations, is one of the basic human driving forces.  It is something about which we are all inevitably extremely emotional.  I congratulate Senator Norris on presenting his statement in an extremely balanced and unemotional manner.  I hope we will continue our discussion in that manner.  I am quite sure the legislation the Minister will bring forward will be necessary, appropriate and balanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the statement by the Minister and recognise the need and the urgency to introduce this legislation.  Ireland is a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Convention has, by its terms, <Col N="115" /> a binding force on the Government of Ireland.  As a State, we have been found by the Court of Human Rights to be in contravention of Article 8 of the Convention and it is incumbent on us to correct that.  We cannot be a member of a group of countries upholding human rights and be seen to be breaching the terms of membership of that group.  We are obliged to obey the rules of our association.</P>
      <P>There is, however, concern throughout the State about changes that might be proposed in the law regarding gay sexual activity.  The concerns must be addressed and incorporated in any legislation introduced. While defending, and we have a firm duty to defend, the rights of all citizens regardless of their sexual orientation, we have a right to protect minorities.  It is our duty to do so.  As a European country we are subject to the rules that come from Europe in a broader sense, not just from the EC.  We are happy to receive aid from our European partners.  In a practical way the Common Agricultural Policy and the Regional and Social Funds have been of enormous benefit to our economy but membership of this club places other obligations on us. In regard to some, such as the one under present discussion, we tend to stand back. We should not do this.  We should thoroughly examine the implications of the proposal for society.  Our obligation is to protect human rights of all our citizens and we should formulate &mdash; I welcome the Minister's commitment to do so &mdash; legislation to fully cater for all our people's concerns.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to introduce the legislation.  We await the details and look forward to them.  In doing so I ask the Minister to ensure that the concerns of all interested parties, the promoters of the legislation, those who have concerns about the legislation and, above all, the views of the general public which will be expressed through the Oireachtas, are taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that sections 61 and 62 of the Offences Against the <Col N="116" /> Persons Act, 1861 and section 11 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885 should be repealed and that there should be the same protection of the young against both homosexual and heterosexual exploitation.  We welcome the recommendation that child sexual abuse should be an offence and replace the present offence of indecent assault.  That should apply equally in the case of homosexual activity.  Again, we look forward with anticipation to the proposals from the Minister being put through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to warmly welcome the Government's decision to finally act on the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  In doing so I congratulate the Minister for Justice on another example of the open, liberal and invigorating attitude he has so far shown on a number of issues under his Justice portfolio.  The record of the Oireachtas on the issue of homosexuality reflects very poorly on our ability as a legislature.  The relevant Acts dealing with the matter date as far back as 1861 and 1885.  Sixteen years ago the Department of Justice commented that the matter was under review.  Two years ago this country, as we know, was held by the European Court of Human Rights to be in breach but, unfortunately, it is only now that we are taking action.  On many occasions the Oireachtas has been exposed as incapable of dealing with emerging and changing issues.  On this question we have been exposed for an unwillingness to tackle a difficult and thorny problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same attitude has been reflected on other issues.  This week we had the appalling tragedy of a young traveller woman dying in a muddy grave from hypothermia on the outskirts of our capital city.  Day in, day out, Members of this House file past the huddled body of a homeless woman who lives out her life in a cardboard box in Molesworth Street, almost as a perpetual reminder to this House of our responsibilities and of our failures.  The common thread in all these, <Col N="117" /> and the countless other social problems facing this country, is the reservations we have as legislators to deal with them.  The moral must be that problems ignored are not problems solved.</P>
    <P>In view of the new worries and fears which have been unfairly raised about homosexuals in the light of AIDS, it is particularly important that we should be debating the whole issue and addressing ourselves to removing any discriminatory obstacles we possibly can.  Taking action to decriminalise homosexuality, as we are obliged to do, is the obvious place to start.  The debate which this will necessitate, however, provides us with an opportunity not just to bring ourselves into line with the European Court ruling but into line with the rest of Europe.  It has been stated that along with Ireland only Romania and Cyprus still treat homosexuality as a crime.</P>
    <P>This debate provides us with an opportunity to examine the whole question of homosexuality, our attitudes to it and steps which we can take to reduce the discrimination which exists at present.  To this end the work of the Oireachtas has been enormously helped by the work of the Law Reform Commission.  The work of the Commission must set the agenda for future discussions on the issue.  Our aim should not just be simply to decriminalise homosexual activity but to ensure that the remainder of our laws echo and reflect that attitude.  In the Minister's statement he referred to the recommendations of the Commission on section 61 and 62 of the Offences Against the Person Act.  I was very glad to see that inclusion because part of this whole debate can be a focus on the wrong issues; therefore, something that focuses on the minimum legal age of 17 for heterosexual acts would also focus on the minimum legal age for homosexual acts. Including issues like that is very helpful.</P>
    <P>We are not simply addressing the legitimate problems of one section of our community, we are indicating our sincerity in rooting out discrimination and maltreatment for the various sections of our community who suffer under the <i>status quo</i>, travellers, the homeless, the <Col N="118" /> poor, the underprivileged, the aged and &mdash; even still &mdash; women.  We have a responsibility to all those sections of our community to ensure that our laws treat all equally and fairly and provide equal opportunity.  That task, of necessity, will be on going and I welcome the start we are making tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the other Senators in their commendations of the Minister in dealing with human right matters. For me it does not stop there.  I do not think this is the beginning and end of it.  I welcome the Taoiseach's statement at the annual Presidential dinner of Fianna Fáil that Fianna Fáil will be sensitive to the changing needs of the people in our modern society.  In his speech the Taoiseach indicated that arising out of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in 1988 legislation to decriminalise homosexuality would be brought forward.  The Minister's short speech today has confirmed that.  To bring it a step further, I would like to quote from a report in the issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 December 1990:</P>
      <P>In that regard he, the Taoiseach, remarked our approach to legislation affecting human rights and personal freedoms is, as far as possible, to find a wide degree of consensus and to proceed with reforms which have a reasonable basis of public support and with which the community at large are sympathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of this I want to put a question seeking clarification rather than being dogmatic or offering a very strong point of view.  Is the Taoiseach suggesting to us that before he brings forward legislation arising out of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights he will seek a wide degree of consensus and will then give effect to that court's judgment only if he, and the Government, are satisfied there is a reasonable basis of public support for it, that the community at large are sympathetic towards it?  That is my reading of the article.  I hope my concern is not justified.  As I say, I am putting a <Col N="119" /> question rather than making a dogmatic statement.</P>
    <P>A clearer expression of the nature of the legislation to decriminalise homosexuality would have been very helpful. As I understand it, there is no appeal against this decision and, therefore, there is not really any problem.  We expect that effect will be given to the judgment as laid down, but we are not quite definite about that.  If we do not give effect to it as laid down our self-respect in the community will take a body blow.  I do not for one minute doubt the Minister but what of the Government's attitude when legislation is brought forward?  We are only talking about bringing it forward. We used the machinery to win our case in Europe against Britain on inhuman degrading treatment of prisoners in 1970.  We have used it on other matters as well.  It is sad to think that in the Dáil the Minister said that after 14 months the court's decision was still being examined, that the examination was incomplete.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach, on the issue of marital breakdown, confirmed that it was the Government's intention to carry out a comprehensive review of current developments and to publish a White Paper following that review.  What has marital breakdown got to do with decriminalising homosexuality?  The answer is that it has nothing to do with it.  Taking the Taoiseach's statement on his Government's intention or attitude towards human rights and personal freedoms, one has to give thought to what happens when a White Paper is introduced. A white Paper, as I understand it, is in the final analysis, the clearly stated position of the Government, as distinct from a Green Paper which when produced is open to all special interest groups and other groups to comment on.  I do not doubt that any White Paper the Government will produce will be the subject of consultations with interested parties. In my view the Green Paper approach is more open and guarantees a wider consensus, if that is what we are after.  If a White Paper is to be issued on <Col N="120" /> other aspects of human rights, such as homosexuality, the most democratic way forward is to use the wider consultative opportunities which a Green Paper offers first.  That would allow for a wider consensus.</P>
    <P>On the overall question of human rights this, and all Governments of the future will have to learn the art of establishing confidence between the various groups because, in my view, that is akin to the highest art of statemanship.  In this case the confidence has not been there. Fear, distrust and antagonism can only be eliminated by establishing confidence. We see this clearly on a regular basis in our domestic relations.  Yet, we lose sight of it so often elsewhere.  Our mentality is to postpone action on matters of human rights and this shows an indifference to the well-being of others.  It is difficult to deal with a mentality that shows such indifference.  In this day and age there is no excuse for a lack of sympathy towards others.  There is the handicap of distance which must be overcome by enlightened policies.  I was pleased to hear the Minister's speech today, which indicates that we are moving in the right direction. Many people are of the opinion that we must move towards the 21st Century at a faster pace.  Let us not view this as a sort of disguised truce in the absence of any clear-cut agreement between the Government and this social group.  These people are not in no man's land; a decision has been made on their behalf which, we hope will be carried out to the letter of the law.  To try to keep them in no man's land until a White Paper on this and related matters is published could lead to conflict.</P>
    <P>Attitude and spirit are all important in the field of human relations.  If it is done correctly and based on the right principles it will succeed.  We have been telling workers for years how important it is to accept change and that if they do not accept it nothing will be solved.  The workers agree and find themselves knocked out of work and struggling, at an early age, for re-employment.  We want everyone else to change but many of us &mdash; not necessarily the politicians or the <Col N="121" /> Government &mdash; are reluctant to meet those changes, or have not the courage to stand up and say exactly how we feel on a particular social issue.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to agree with the view that there is no private right, law or custom so absolute or inflexible that it cannot be cast aside if it can be clearly shown that it constitutes a threat to personal health or impedes the wellbeing of the community.  In this case we are not dealing with selfish individuals and it cannot be shown that their customs and practices in personal relationships menace personal health, or indeed that they stand in the way of community wellbeing.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Professor Conroy's views.  I think there is a lot of ignorance with regard to homosexuals.  Evidence is emerging now in some of the African countries that possibly almost half their population problems are of a heterosexual nature.  That would suggest that they are not a threat to health.  On the question of whether, in social or industrial relations, the claims of industry and humanity are opposed, I would suggest that the claims of industry must give way to the claims of humanity.  Many of our people will avoid the issue.  This is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>These are issues which have to be faced up to.  What happens because of this attitude or mentality is that there is an indifference, or a neglect, which leads to trouble and causes irritation.  Any long, continued oppression aggravates discontent and causes people to bide their time and seek revenge.  Perhaps the gay community has not sought revenge but rather sought justice.  The reason they did not seek revenge is because they are a very responsible body.  With regard to the whole question of AIDS they have shown their responsibility and they have to be given great credit for that.  There was no question of revenge there.  If we are not careful in other areas we will encounter instances of revenge. However, I have faith in what the Minister has said.  These people are prepared to go that road despite difficulties they may have amongst some of their <Col N="122" /> members and their organisation.  I am a little disappointed that from the outset we did not recognise the germ of a grievance and act on it.  It has been there for a very long time, since Victorian times.</P>
    <P>I remember gardaí going on television in the early stages of the drug problem here and saying there was no problem. What they meant was, it was not a big problem.  Problems grow if nothing is done about them.  What happened was that we neglected investigation when the problem first arose.  If we had investigated it earlier we might have found that adjustments would not have been so difficult to carry out.  We aggravated the situation and finished up with a 16-year process in the European Court which has had to do our work for us.</P>
    <P>What happens is that we postpone things and instead of having to make small adjustments, find ourselves in the situation where major corrections must be made in many things.  That is not the way it should be.  The Government know by now that any unaddressed wrong becomes a very virulent germ.  Certainly I appreciate the Minister's attitude now, he recognises that.  If we can get everyone else to recognise it we will be on the right road.  Through our expressed or implied sanction, injustice will continue until the necessary legislation is passed by both Houses.  I ask the Minister not to delay too much on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see it, there are two issues here &mdash; one is the judgment of the European Court and the second is the issue of what exactly is a right and what is not a right.  I do not believe that any judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg should overrule the Irish constitution as interpreted by the Irish Supreme Court.  If a judgment of the European court conflicts with the provisions of the Irish Constitution or if there is a wide degree of public consensus against the judgment, it is the Government's duty to seek derogation from that convention.  I do not believe that there is a very large consensus for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts.  There was an IMS poll in the <Col N="123" /><i>Sunday Independent</i> in February of this year which showed that the majority of the people were opposed to decriminalising homosexual acts.  In his judgment in the Norris case, Chief Justice O'Higgins in the 1983 Supreme Court case said:</P>
      <P>It indicates, however, that homosexual activity and its encouragement may not be consistent with respect in regard for marriage as an institution. I would not think it unreasonable to conclude that an open and general increase in homosexual activity in any society must have serious consequences of a harmful nature as far as marriage is concerned.</P>
      <P>He summarises his conclusion on this aspect as follows: &ldquo;Homosexual conduct can be inimical to marriage and is <i>per se</i> harmful to it as an institution.&rdquo;  We know the Constitution obliges the State to guard the institution of marriage on which the family is founded with special care to protect them and to protect the family in its constitution and authority.</P>
      <P>The decriminalisation of homosexual practices would lead to an immediately higher profile of homosexuality.  It would not lead to positive discrimination in favour of homosexual persons as happened in Canada.  It would make it more difficult in some cases for places to cope; for example, university colleges might consequently be required to recognise and fund societies which promote homosexuality. Schools might be required to promote homosexuality as a legitimate alternative lifestyle in their sex education programmes.  Publications would be more bold in their promotion of alternative lifestyles to the detriment of the whole society.  Ultimately, a higher profile for homosexuality can only serve to confuse many young people on the question of sexual identity and self-control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do decriminalise homosexual activity it could have serious consequences of a harmful nature.  However, I wonder what would happen if someone took a case to the European Court of Human Rights and it was decided we <Col N="124" /> should abide by what the Dutch Parliament decided the other day when, in order to reduce the incidence of sexual abuse, they decided to reduce to the age of 12 the age of consent between adults and young people.  Suppose there was another case taken where the children might be younger?  Is there anywhere the Supreme Court in this country and our Constitution can protect us against the invasions of a European court which can impose on us a moral standard which is not held or is in keeping with the moral standards of most people?</P>
    <P>There is the question of this right.  Article 2 of the Convention on Human Rights states:</P>
    <P>There should be no interference by a public authority that the exercise of the right except it is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedom of others.</P>
    <P>That is being used now to promote this right but I would say it argues against it on the question of morals.  It was old Mick Kitt who once said: &ldquo;No amount of laws can make legal what is morally wrong.&rdquo;  I believe that what is claimed as a right is morally wrong.  I do not believe that homosexual acts between males, or between females, are natural acts.  The rational consideration of the natural functioning of the human organs would not lead one to conclude that homosexual activity is a fulfilment of any of these functions.  Consequently, homosexual behaviour is a poor foundation on which to claim rights.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what acts we are going to legalise here?  Is it for what happens between homosexuals?  I would like somebody to tell me.  Are we going to legalise holding hands, which nobody would object to, gentle kissing, caressing? Are we going to legalise mutual masturbation or fellatio?  Are we going to legalise the insertion of a penis <Col N="125" /> into somebody's anus which is buggery or sodomy in my book and I believe to be an act against nature?  I have the utmost compassion for people who accept this as their orientation and way of life.  It is a big burden to place on them, to expect for one moment that they should be celibate, and I do not believe they are or ever will be, but I believe that by, in any way, promoting something which we believe to be inherently wrong we are one more step towards a society which loses all moral standards.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to go carefully on this one.  I know he has probably made up his own mind but nevertheless I have received many representations on this issue and I believe it is my duty as a representative to voice these issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister because I know he is a very caring Minister.  He has shown this in other legislation he has brought forward even today in this House, and he has shown it in other issues as well.  I appeal to him on behalf of the people who may not be here but who do have concerns to think carefully before introducing legislation which may have a deleterious effect on the moral fibre of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement and I congratulate Senator David Norris on his very fine opening statement.  Behind many attitudes to this matter is fear, puritanical fear, a fear of the guilty dissociation of sex from pleasure, biological fear which has been expressed by Senator Lydon that if one encourages or connive at homosexual activity then one is challenging the fundamental institution of marriage and of the procreation of the species to which homosexual activity would seem to be biologically contradictory. Fear also of ourselves, fear of our own psyches, fear that none of us is completely heterosexual.  In my own case I certainly can vouch almost overwhelmingly heterosexuality.  Nonetheless, one has to concede the case of those who say that there is no such animal as the totally heterosexual animal, that wittingly or unwittingly, there is a touch <Col N="126" /> of bisexuality in all of us, however, it finds expression however it is repressed.</P>
      <P>That fear is behind the traditional attitudes, in Ireland at any rate, to homosexuals. Senator Norris will forgive me if I do not use the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo;.  I simply will not accept the misappropriation of the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo; for that particular sexual orientation, not least because it deprives the English language of a unique adjective which cannot really be replaced. Besides I can no longer sing &ldquo;A Bachelor Gay&rdquo; without some misunderstanding.  I must insist, if rather pedantically, that it is not homo sexual but homosexual because the short homo is Greek meaning &ldquo;the same as&rdquo; and not the Latin homo meaning &ldquo;man&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Whatever about our fear we now have to come to terms with what is happening. It is Senator Norris, primarily, who has brought this matter to a head and the Minister and the Government have recognised they have to deal with this now and have to deal with the European Court judgment.  I do not think it is on anymore to derogate from the European judgment, to say we are different from the French, Germans, Spaniards and all of our European partners whom we so much admire and wish to emulate in other respects but on this one, no, we are special.  We are, as Frederick Ingles says, &ldquo;the <i>insula sancta</i> the holy island which must, on no account, be contaminated by outside influences&rdquo;.  It is not on anymore. I thought we would have learned that in the course of the Presidential election.</P>
      <P>It seems that in one sense the Minister's task is fairly easy.  The law must be decriminalised.  I find it very hard to evade the conclusions of the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network in their letter to Senators which I received this morning when they say that: &ldquo;Not only must the criminalisation of homosexuality be removed but there must be anti-discrimination laws as well.&rdquo;  These Houses had the generosity to go some way in that direction, and the Minister indeed, when the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, related perhaps, included a clause about homosexuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age of consent is similarily <Col N="127" /> unavoidable.  Seventeen is the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission. This age should not be lightly cast aside without some very radical reason which is not apparent to me, particularly considering that out of our European Community partners, of the other eleven, eight have a lower age of consent than we have; two have a slightly higher number than the one recommended in the Law Reform Commission, namely 18, and only, Great Britain, has a higher age of 21.  It is the case of the Gay and Lesbian Society that this has been a disastrous operation &mdash; this age of consent.</P>
    <P>I find that all these conclusions are pretty well inescapable but where do we go from there?  Not only should the law be decriminalised but it is a worthy principle, in my view, and here I would differ philosophically from Senator Lydon, that the State should not interfere in sexual activity between consenting adults.  I do not see how you can go against that principle and that is what the law does as it stands.  If Senator Lydon is advocating retention of the law, it seems to me that is a basic denial of human rights.  No court in the world, never mind Europe, would support him in that regard.</P>
    <P>I think it is good that the State should stop interfering in that area, and indeed in all other sexual areas.  That is a stand I have taken very consistently but where do we go beyond that?  That is my problem. That may not be the Minister's direct problem but it is certainly the problem of society in confronting this question. Do we, for example, having removed criminalisation, having guaranteed anti-discrimination, say that homosexuality is an alternative lifestyle, an alternative sexual culture, that it is as natural as heterosexuality.  Do we go that far?  I think Irish society would be very reluctant to go that far, if only because of the still preponderant influence of the Roman Catholic Church in its teachings which has proved quite adamant on this matter, that practising homosexuals are living in sin, as it were.  I am not for a moment challenging the teaching of the <Col N="128" /> Church because it is for practising members of that Church to deal with that matter.  I do not think it is a matter of people who are dissociated from the Church to criticise the rules of the club. Besides there is a certain consistency, I must say, about the old institution which secures my grudging admiration.  I am simply stating it as a fact that the influence of the Catholic Church in its attitude to homosexuality is going to determine the attitude of Irish society when it comes to consider the consequences and the limits of this legislation.</P>
    <P>If society is unwilling to consider homosexuality as an alternative culture, an alternative lifestyle &mdash; every bit as good as heterosexuality &mdash; then I think it will be even more reluctant to consider apparently more bizarre manifestations of homosexuality in other countries where legal restrictions have been removed, where homosexual couples go through a form of marriage, a marriage ceremony, where homosexual couples apply for the adoption of children.  It is all in this area beyond the actual matter of legislation that there is going to be very controversial debate in this country.</P>
    <P>I would differ from Senator Lydon, however, in his suggestion that the higher profile you give homosexuality, the more it encourages them to blatantly &ldquo;cock a snook&rdquo; at society.  That attitude has its own underlying assumptions but I simply want to instance the case of University College, Cork.  About two years ago, a meeting of the Governing Body at the suggestion of our very progressive President, recognised the Gay and Lesbian Society which had been looking for recognition for a long time.  There were those who were wringing their hands and saying this is the end of civilisation as we know it in the quadrangle in UCC, students on signing on will be harassed to change their sexual orientation and so on, and I may say nothing happened whatsoever. Not another word has been heard from the Gay and Lesbian Society.  To my knowledge, heterosexuality is as popular as ever it was in UCC.  I think that is a model to be considered in this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opening of what is a <Col N="129" /> national debate.  I commend the Minister for bringing in the statement.  I commend the Law Reform Commission in this and other areas.  In that latter area which I spoke about &mdash; the area beyond the law, whether we accept homosexuality as an alternative culture and so on &mdash; I have my own views on that which I will make known in time, as it were.  I am not at all sure that the answer to those questions is yes.  Nonetheless, I must, praise Senator Norris for getting the debate this far.  He may have forgotten that in 1977 he and his colleagues sought a meeting with me in Cork.  I remember it well in Moore's Hotel &mdash; I think I had just been elected to the Seanad &mdash; I considered myself very daring indeed for agreeing to meet them in the bar of Moore's Hotel.  I really thought I was most progressive to do that. I said that perhaps they had a case but they could not possibly agree or hope that we would permit them to go around kissing each other in public or holding hands, that they could not possibly expect us to be that tolerant.  Maybe that was a measure of my priggishness at the time but, even though I express it facetiously, that is one of the questions we will have to face.  Having decriminalised homosexuality, will we permit this expression in public?  Will we be able to take that in our stride, so to speak?</P>
    <P>Whatever happens, I think Senator Norris is to be congratulated and his name will be always linked with this particular progress.  He is not a man whose activities always command universal respect.  Last week, for example, he disgracefully hogged the whole publicity of the Seanad proceedings and on other occasions he can be very annoying but when you consider the flood of hatred he particularly has been exposed to you will understand what I mean.  Just before I came to this debate, I happened to be at his desk and I became aware of the hate mail he has pinned up on the wall &mdash; I must say it takes a lot of courage and humour to do that &mdash; and it really would upset anyone.  To have survived that for many years &mdash; also to have had the courage and humour &mdash; and he shows great humour about his own sexuality and <Col N="130" /> that is something all of us would want to show about sexuality in general &mdash; he certainly deserves the thanks of this country.  He does grace this House and I welcome this move as a milestone in our march towards proper human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement of last week that legislation would be introduced to reform the law relating to the decriminalisation of homosexual activity, very much obviously in line with the European Court of Human Rights judgment of last October.  It is two years since the European Court of Human Rights ruled that antiquated Victorian Acts, 1861 and 1885 were a breach of human rights.  As I said it was a Victorian Parliament in Britain that made those laws.  They were never discussed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and were repealed in the United Kingdom in 1967 with the Sexual Offences Act.  That has not been widely accepted in Britain and has led to quite a lot of controversy and I hope we will not follow that 1967 Act in relation to our legislation.  It is interesting that Scotland followed in 1980 and Northern Ireland in 1982 so we were not before our time in following through.</P>
      <P>I was very glad for the second time today to hear the Minister, Deputy Burke, in his statement to us stating that he intends having the proposals with us as early as possible in order to change the law.  He said it was not his intention to delay the Bill but he wished to be frank with the House.  That is the most important statement of the day, the frankness with which we can come in here and discuss issues that would have been taboo some years back.  It is interesting that it is the day on which the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill passed through that he is here twice on the one day in what I consider would be a liberal stance that he has shown on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back and looking at the history of facts and figures we have got already from Senator Norris &mdash; so I will not go through them in great detail &mdash; in a survey that was done of 30 countries both in <Col N="131" /> eastern and western Europe, excluding the little states of Andorra, Lichstenstein, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican, it is interesting that out of a population of 820 million people there are 50 to 60 million predominantly or exclusively lesbian or gay.  That statistic cannot be just thrown out of the window. It is a sizeable group.  The homosexual population could not be classified as being minority when you are talking in terms of 50 to 60 million.  Obviously, going through history, at different stages almost every European country has at some time decreed a total ban on homosexuality, applied in most cases to sex between men.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris gave us the dates &mdash; France, 18th century; Belgium/ Luxembourg, 18th century; the Netherlands, 19th century and Spain, a Catholic country, 19th century &mdash; when they had already decriminalised homosexual relations.  The four countries that have still a total ban on male homosexual acts are the Greek area of Cyprus, Ireland, Romania and the Soviet Union. So it is about time for us to address the situation.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we will be following very closely the recommendations from the Law Reform Commission.  It has been suggested that the present minimum legal age of 17 for such heterosexual acts would also be the minimum legal age for homosexual acts.  Again, the Minister in his address to us here quoted and referred to that minimum age which, I think, should be both for homosexual acts and heterosexual acts.  The Law Reform Commission's final report will be of great interest to all of us.  I did not get a chance to read it, but I am very interested obviously in following through the recommendations that will come from the Law Reform Commission.  We have seen advances.  Being in the Seanad just one year, I saw today, for instance, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill going through.  That defines sexual offences in a gender neutral way and proposes the repeal of section 61 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, <Col N="132" /> in respect of indecent assaults.  That was one advance coming forward this year. Again, as was mentioned by-other Senators, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill Act, 1989, includes sexual orientation among its protected statuses. We saw that through in 1989.  Again, the Law Reform Commission in 1989 supported the principle that homosexual conduct and heterosexual conduct should be put on an equal legal footing.</P>
    <P>These slow advances obviously are to be welcomed, but I have a few points just in relation to what we are really talking about in regard to discrimination.  When we are talking about human rights for homosexuals we are talking about human rights for homosexuals as Irish citizens who are entitled to equality with their heterosexual peers in treatment, in protection and in respect.  I think nobody could disagree with that statement.  What disturbs me &mdash; and I think Senator Murphy raised this point very eloquently &mdash; is the element of fear.  No matter what literature you read you come across negative images in relation to homosexuals, you find insulting caricatures, you find abusive language, you find guilt and confusion among young homosexuals and young lesbians; and, as a nation, if we expect human rights that is one area where surely in the 1990s we can discuss openly and in a frank way a situation which is extremely discourteous, to say the least of it.  We have a poor history here as regards minority groups.  Women can be discriminated against; travellers, coloured people in our community are not tolerated; ethnic groups are not tolerated very well.  These are matters we have to address if we see ourselves as Christian.  But we can be exceptionally unChristian in relation to minority groups.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to Senator Murphy's reference to the situation in UCC, it is interesting to point out that for many years now the Lesbian Support Group has been an affiliated group of the Council for the Status of Women and it does not attract any negative publicity one way or another because it is an accepted state of affairs and events.  That <Col N="133" /> council has a cross-section of affiliated groups from all corners of Ireland, urban and rural, old and young women.  There is no question at all of any confusion, guilt, shame, disrespect or discrimination against that support group.</P>
    <P>I consider it is very important that there would be a forum for such a group within the Council for the Status of Women if we are going to achieve anything in this country.  I do not consider this any big deal in relation to this issue. If we have an open, frank debate, if we follow very carefully the recommendations from the Law Reform Commission and if the Minister, Deputy Burke, is as open to recommendations for discussion from the floor as he has been in relation to the Rape Bill that we had before us today, I can see that we will go forward and we will address very quickly the human rights issue as was stated for us within the European situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sometimes wonder at the amount of time I have spent on debates in this House on issues that are connected with sexuality.  We have had a long debate, which I recall went on until about 4 a.m., on the issue of a limited liberalisation of the laws governing the sale of contraceptives.  I am not trying to get involved at all in a political argument with the Minister about this specific issue, but we have been talking a long time about the decriminalisation of homosexual acts involving men.</P>
      <P>There are a few things that should be said about human sexuality.  If I can quote a Member of the other House whom I would not normally be expected to be quoting, Deputy Brendan McGahon in an unforgettable phrase he said about sex that &ldquo;if God invented anything nicer he kept it for himself&rdquo;.  One of the things that should be said about human sexuality is that it is actually very nice, very good, very self-affirming and very life-affirming. It is a whole lot of very good things.  It is not something dangerous to be allowed within carefully defined constraints for fear we would all go berserk if we were not carefully kept on a short leash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> Many of those, of course, who would control our lives have long ago realised that sexuality is a very positive thing. If you want to become slightly poetical about sexuality, one of the fears I always suspected that many of our spiritual leaders have is that an act of healthy sexuality led to a very close integration between the physical and the spiritual in terms of the complex of experiences that go with happy sexuality.  They feared, in my view, a loss of control by them over people who were that much at one with themselves in terms of their sexuality and, indeed, of their spirituality.  There is no contradiction.  It is one of the great, sad things about many of the great religions of the world that apparently they have always found it necessary to keep themselves a long distance from any sort of act of sexuality.  I find that quite extraordinary and quite wrong.</P>
    <P>Sex &mdash; in a phrase that nearly cost me my seat in the Seanad on one occasion &mdash; is actually good fun.  We should not spend years and endless ages analysing it as if it was something terrible and dangerous that we are just about allowed to do once we are old enough not to be able to do it any more.  Sexuality is, in fact, about people escaping into freedom and into joy and ever more intimate relationships between themselves.  In our society we have been burdened by moralists who seem to believe that they have a particular obligation to go through the most intricate gynaecological analysis of what constitutes various forms of morally improper behaviour.  Catholic manuals on moral theology are particularly intriguing in this regard, not in terms of the principles of proper sexual morality, which in my view are quite simply atriculated in terms of equality of relationships of a non-exploitative nature between consenting individuals.  That is a good definition of a positive, vigorous and very demanding sexual morality &mdash; that nobody should be involved in a sexual relationship with anybody which is not based on the assumption of equality, which is not based on free consent and which does not involve any physical or, <Col N="135" /> indeed, psychological exploitation of the other person.</P>
    <P>I believe that of itself describes an extraordinarily demanding and very principled sexual morality.  It does not necessitate gynaecological analysis of degrees of penetration or indeed the extraordinarily ridiculous one about the Catholic moralist in Maynooth in the present day who got himself into the contorted position of talking about somebody using a condom during ejaculation but leaving a pinprick in it so as not to prevent the possibility of conception.  I defy ordinary practical people to believe that that is actually serious philosophically, spiritually based moral theology, but we have serious moralists making speeches like that or making statements like that on the national airways. I do not think we should take people like that seriously.  As adult human beings we should form our own values, our own views, about what is proper and what is wrong in the whole area of human sexuality and about the standards of behaviour.</P>
    <P>I think that our moralists were always aware of the insecurity of the ground they trod on because of the speed with which they have always rushed in to demand the support of the State in this area and not just on the question of homosexuality. You must remember that adultery has been illegal in many countries at many stages of their history.  Usually, of course, it is the woman who is penalised where the adultery has occurred.  It is rarely that there are very servere penalties against men for adultery.  The tradition of the fallen woman is long established in most western societies.  I have never heard of an equivalent expression for a fallen man &mdash; apparently they never existed.</P>
    <P>The interaction between attempts by society to regulate sexuality and various operations of control of people would be worthy of development as well, but not tonight because of time.  Oral sex was and perhaps still is illegal in some states of the United States.  I am always intrigued <Col N="136" /> as to how they enforce this kind of legislation, but it was actually illegal, and other various forms of non-traditional sexual expression, to use that phrase.  I am not too sure that anybody can make a distinction between what is natural and what is unnatural in the area of human sexuality.  As far as I know, since the idea was invented, people have been doing it in a variety of ways and a variety of situations which defy any categorisation of natural and unnatural.  Therefore, I am not prepared to accept that sort of language.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, we have the whole area of homosexual acts between men.  I heard Senator Norris describe the history of that particular matter.  I am fascinated by the fact that no similar legislation apparently was ever introduced about women.  But I do know that one of the reasons was that women were so severely restricted and so severely tied down by a whole host of other legislation that perhaps the necessity for legislation like this was never perceived to be a reality.  I know that at one stage &mdash; and perhaps it still exists &mdash; the official definition of a brothel was any house in which more than two women who are not married live together.  That was as good an expression of the perception of female sexuality, that if they were living on their own without a man they must be up to something.</P>
    <P>It all goes back to perceptions of morality, perceptions of sexuality and, indeed, in many cases, perceptions of women.  I would address this as much to myself as to other Members of this House.  One of the great contributions that Senator Norris has made to Irish politics and to Irish life is that his deliberate, active campaign has forced us all to confront the reality of homosexuality and to confront the reality of all the prejudices and all the fears that we have.  Many people say that the deepest fears that most men have are not about homosexuality but about the possibility that they are homosexual themselves.  I do not know about that, but what is quite true is that it is only when one is presented with situations one realises the depths of one's own prejudices and one's own resistence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> I remember the first time I saw two gay men kissing in a very non-sexual fashion to say good night, in the way that lots of men would happily kiss lots of women to say good night to them, in a reasonably expressive but not too passionate a fashion.  I remember having, metaphorically, to take a step backwards when it happened &mdash; I do believe Senator Norris was one of the people in question &mdash; but it did come as a considerable shock to me, I must say.  Of course, the truth is that in many other cultures, in many other societies, two men kissing would be a symbol of nothing other than the normal expression of affection, any more than two men holding hands would be regarded as anything more than a normal part of normal activity.  But we have created a culture where things that are taken as perfectly normal and having nothing to do with sexuality are seen in this country and in our kind of slightly cold blooded western society as being a sort of manifestation of something else.</P>
    <P>We really have to get down and confront all those prejudices; and I think the more one confronts all those prejudices the more one realises that the legislation about homosexual activity ought to be identical with the legislation about other forms of activity.  It has to do &mdash; and this is why I am quite happy with the age of consent of around 17 &mdash; with allowing our young people the freedom and space to come to terms with their own sexuality without external pressures on them, without any sort of forcible development, where they are forced to believe that it is necessary to be sexually active at a young age in order to prove some sort of independence or freedom.  Therefore I think our legislative process ought to be about enabling people to develop sexually in a society which does not have either an unhealthy obsession with denying sex or, indeed, an unhealthy obsession with sex, but allowing people to grow up in a society of freedom and tolerance.  That means allowing people to discover their own sexuality without, may I say, one <Col N="138" /> particular area &mdash; the increasing commercialisation of sexuality &mdash; which is neither healthy nor good for anybody because it is a major force which deprives people of the space and freedom to discover their own sexuality, without external pressure, at their own pace and in their own time. I think, therefore, that the report of the Law Reform Commission, as I understand it, is a proper basis for legislation and I hope that the Minister will see fit to implement it as it is there and without any concessions to some of the fears in our society.</P>
    <P>There are a few more comments I wish to make.  One is that it would be wrong to interpret the Supreme Court's decision on Senator Norris' case as being an implication that there is anything in the Constitution which would make legislation to legalise homosexual acts unconstitutional. What the Supreme Court said was that there was nothing in the Constitution which said that legislation of itself was inherently unconstitutional, which is not to say that amending legislation to remove this would have any problems with the Constitution.  There is no guaranteed right in the Constitution, according to the Supreme Court, to have this legislation quashed.  There is no suggestion that the Constitution would be a problem to the change in the legislation. Clearly, that was not the intention of their lordships at the time and I think that should be put on the record.  I do think, however, that as well as confronting our own fears we will have to confront society.  That is why it is necessary to have anti-discrimination legislation in regard to various groups in our society who have been victims of prejudice.</P>
    <P>The largest group, perhaps, were women &mdash; and we have begun to deal with legislation to prevent discrimination against women &mdash; but there are other minorities in our society, like the gay community and indeed the travelling <Col N="139" /> community, who would benefit enormously from anti-discrimination legislation. It might not be legislation that could be enforced in a very specific way, but again it would be a statement of our intent and it would be a deterrent to some of the more blatant, vigorous and offensive forms of prejudice against various minority groups.</P>
    <P>In regard, to displays of prejudice, I had the unfortunate experience of hearing a Garda superintendent say at a meeting I attended that most offences against children were carried out by homosexuals, which was a regrettable lack of perception on his part, and, may I say, a departure from the fairly tolerant position of our Garda, which, incidentally, has always been a good deal less prejudiced than that of their counterparts North of the Border.  The RUC had an unfortunate record of being quite hostile to people and of using legislation similar to our own in a quite unfair way against homosexuals.  I am very glad to say that our Garda have shown no such inclination. I think there was a slight problem after a recent spectacular murder case in which members of the gay community were given an excessively rough time; but I think by and large the Garda decided years ago that this legislation does not really apply in most cases.</P>
    <P>I heard what Senator Lydon had to say and I would not agree with one word of it.  I am not sure that we are right in this House to force people like Senator Lydon to vote one way or the other on the basis of a party whip.  On an issue like this as in other issues &mdash; I am not even sure that that would necessarily mean that the reforms that I want would go through &mdash; I am not sure that we should force people who have views like Senator Lydon to vote in a particular direction because the party whip says so.  I think there is room on issues like this for people to have the freedom to vote as they choose to vote. I believe the majority of the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas will <Col N="140" /> support reforming legislation of this kind without a party whip, which may cause people considerable difficulties with their own consciences.  There is not a word of what he said that I would agree with, but I believe that if I am to subscribe to a pluralist vision of Ireland the pluralism includes those people who dissent from me on the right as well as those who dissent from me on the left.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Government party, and to all the parties, that perhaps this is an appropriate issue on which, as the Leader of Fine Gael has said already, we should think about a free vote, where people are not bound by party whips but are free to express what they believe to be right or to be wrong on a particular issue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the intention of the Minister to change the law so as to take into account the European Court's judgment in relation to the topic that we are discussing this evening.  In many ways the day must be the Minister's day.  The Minister must be a rather puzzled Minister coming into the Seanad and finding that he is being welcomed and praised and so on after the reception he got when he was here for his Broadcasting Bill earlier this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly it is the topic that the Minister has chosen.  The Minister is obviously very good at sexual legislation. There can be no doubt at all about it. The European Court delivered its judgment in October 1988 and, as I understand it, that judgment was signalled for quite some time before it was actually given.  In many ways it is a pity that we did not get round to taking the steps which the Minister has now clearly indicated he is going to take to eliminate this discrimination in the law against the homosexual community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that most fair and openminded people in this country now would <Col N="141" /> accept that there is a general consensus in support of the outlawing of discrimination against gay men and lesbian women.  That is very much the position of our party.  It has been the position of our party for quite some time.  It is embodied very clearly in an Equal Status Bill which we published earlier on this year.  If I can read into the record the appropriate part of it, it refers to: &ldquo;Sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic groups including membership of the travelling community&rdquo;&mdash; any discrimination against those groups would be outlawed under that Bill, which I would hope at some stage would be enacted into law.</P>
    <P>Clearly, our party are very much in favour of outlawing discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation.  That also, I have to say, has been the position of the Congress of Trade Unions for quite some time.  In the early 1980s the Irish Congress of Trade Unions published a very clear and specific policy paper on this issue, where the Congress gave guidelines to the negotiators to encourage them to ensure that no discrimination was tolerated against people on the basis of their sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>In the past, as Senator Norris very ably indicated earlier this afternoon, there has been very great discrimination against homosexuals in society.  That discrimination has been very ugly in the case of some people who openly declared their homosexuality and were known to be homosexuals.  It created great problems and worries for their families.  It also created great problems for those people who were homosexuals but were afraid to admit it.  They lived in fear of their secrets being found out and that they would be subsequently exposed to blackmail and to discrimination.  It is very good to see that that is now about to be outlawed. The outlawing of this will help to remove some of the prejudices to which homosexuals are still exposed in this society.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the introduction <Col N="142" /> of the anti-discrimination laws will fully remove those prejudices.  It will help to remove them, and with the passage of time they will indeed fade away.  I would see it as a useful step, but I do not think that some of these prejudices &mdash; unfortunately, they are very deeply ingrained in some people &mdash; will be, as it were, removed at one stroke.  It is a step, however, and it is a very important step.</P>
    <P>It is very important that homosexuals should be allowed to live a life free from discrimination and free from any fear of blackmail.  This legislation will certainly help to do that.  It will help to give homosexuals equal status and allow them to develop without any fear of discrimination. It will allow them to pursue their economic independence.  It will allow them to be able to participate fully in the social, cultural and political life of the community in conditions of freedom, dignity and equality.</P>
    <P>The whole homosexual community, both gay men and lesbian women, owe a tremendous debt to Senator Norris who, over the years, has in a tremendously courageous manner &mdash; there can be no doubt about that &mdash; stated their case, made their case repeatedly in this forum and indeed in many of the media available to him.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I welcome the European Court's judgment.  I welcome the intention of the Minister to enact the principles of that judgment into Irish law and I welcome the fact that we are now about to move to undo this appalling Act &mdash; the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 &mdash; which, as somebody said earlier, was in effect a blackmailer's charter.  I welcome the fact that that is now about to be removed from the Statute Book.  I encourage the Minister to move to introduce the appropriate legislation as rapidly as he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to echo the words of Senator Upton.  It is ironic that the last time I saw the Minister in this Chamber I was leaving involuntarily as a <Col N="143" /> result of the Broadcasting Bill, which I opposed.  This time I welcome the Minister wearing his other hat.  It is appropriate that those of us on this side of the House who have watched his progress in Justice should say that he has been an extremely good and progressive Minister for Justice.  This is one of a series of liberal Bills which have to a certain extent surprised me and surprised others on this side of the House.  I think of the Criminal Law (Rape) Bill today, the Abolition of Hanging Bill and the incitement to hatred amendments which he brought to this House.  The Minister is to be greatly credited for showing this courage, because we realise the political difficulties involved in introducing a Bill of this sort or of the others I mentioned, in this House or in any other house.  It is very easy for us on this side of the House to propose legislation of the sort the Minister is bringing in because we do not have to take the responsibility or the political flak; and we have peculiar constituencies which respond much more readily to this sort of legislation than those of the Minister.  I welcome the legislation and I sincerely thank the Minister for bringing it forward and for having the courage to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second person I should say a few words about is Senator Norris.  It obviously has been a very long and on some occasions a very lonely furrow which he has had to plough.  Indeed I have benefited from the fact that Senator Norris has been ploughing this furrow, because he is a colleague of mine in the same constituency.  It was very difficult for him for many years standing on the platform of gay rights &mdash; not exclusively but it was the platform with which he was identified exclusively in the media &mdash; to win an election.  Senator Norris continued to stand unapologetically on that particular record; he did not withdraw it or hide it, and he got elected on it.  It is greatly to his credit that he succeeded in getting to this House in spite of the many <Col N="144" /> prejudices held against him.  I am afraid I benefited indirectly from those prejudices. He may have benefited from the prejudices against me, but those prejudices were probably legitimate and the ones against him were unfair.</P>
    <P>I was very fortunate in that Senator Norris some years ago opened my eyes to the gay community in that he took me to the Hirschfeld Centre for lunch.  Apart from the menu, which was quite horrific and far too expensive, the Hirschfeld Centre was an eye opener in that when I went in I did not know quite what to expect.  I admit I was wary.  It was something which I was going to write about.  I wanted to write about it but I expected something very strange and something very different.  The thing that struck me about it more than anything else I suppose was that the Hirschfeld Centre was rather depressingly normal.  It was full of normal people doing normal things, just looking after themselves and entertaining themselves in a normal way that anybody in a club of any normal sort might do. That is not meant to be a plug for the lottery funds which Senator Norris is looking for to rebuild the Hirschfeld Centre.  It was an experience.  It strikes you how normal what is going on and that these people are not different or are not something out of this world, which we are encouraged to believe by the sort of prejudices with which we have been brought up.</P>
    <P>The heterosexual community, if we have to divide people this way, owe the homosexual community a fair amount. There are many myths about the AIDS virus and Senator Conroy touched on that matter.  One of the myths is that the homosexual community are the sole spreaders of the AIDS virus and that was very useful for those who were anti-gay. It was initially true that the homosexual community spread it more rapidly but it is spreading rapidly through the heterosexual community.  The heterosexual community owe a debt to the homosexual community in that the gay community, <Col N="145" /> especially in Ireland, took the initiative on the AIDS problem which the Government, and this is not meant to be in any way a political point, were slow to take, maybe through ignorance, prejudice or simply not realising how bad the problem was or how bad it was likely to be.  The gay community tackled this problem responsibly and, presumably, protected many in that community and many heterosexuals from the AIDS virus.  That is something we should bear in mind when we are pointing out the differences between the two communities.</P>
    <P>Many people ask: what is the point of taking this law off the Statute Book &mdash; the gay community are not, in effect, prosecuted and therefore they are not discriminated against?  That may be true but so long as that law remains on the Statute Book, and says that these people are criminals, it encourages gangs of prejudiced people to preach the gospel of hate and to say things which are encouraged and legitimised by the law. The law says they are right.  That is a very sound and tangible reason why the statute must be changed.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister, when he comes to draft the legislation to take on board the advice and recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  I encourage him to go the whole hog, despite obvious difficulties he will have, and put heterosexuals and homosexuals on a completely equal basis before the law so that there simply will be no difference in what they can do and cannot do.  We should not be able to get up and say they can do this or that.  There should not be a cause, nor should there be any prejudice.  The issue would simply disappear. The Minister has power to do this by literally abolishing any distinction in what both communities can do legally.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, when he is introducing this legislation, to bear in mind that it would be very welcome and it would be appropriate if it were initiated in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>There is very little left to add to the debate.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has come in to explain the situation.  There was a sense of frustration building up on our benches in that we did not have a clear line on the view of the Government.  I thank the Minister for making the position quite clear to us today.  I also welcome the fact that he has signalled that he is prepared to bring in this progressive legislation.  It will mark his Ministry for posterity.  I compliment him on that.</P>
      <P>Earlier tonight we discussed the matter of a pluralist society, the need to accommodate differences and the need to be aware that a democracy will always be tested.  The yardstick of democracy is the way in which it treats its minorities.  I enjoyed the discussion on minorities and normality.  I listened earlier to Senator Conroy saying that homosexuality would never be the norm.  I was going to interrupt and say if it was not the norm, might it be a norm?  How would it be if it happened that by some quirk of nature, or by the forces of demography, 51 per cent of the population happened to be homosexual at any one time, or 51 per cent of the population in any given area happened to be homosexual at any one time? What would be the norm then?  Normality is just simply a statistic and it is nothing more.  It has nothing to do with democracy. Majority rules but majority must rule keeping in mind the rights and the sensitivities of the minority at all times.</P>
      <P>Article 40 of the Constitution states that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.  This is really the issue that is being discussed this evening.  That is what it comes down to at the end of the day.  Article 40 further states that the State guarantees in its laws to respect and as far as practicable by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizens.  That is what we are about here tonight, even though I am quite sure it was not written with that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would welcome the early introduction <Col N="147" /> of this legislation.  It has long been the policy of the trade union movement that such legislation should be put in place. We have hammered this Minister from these benches for the last number of months about this matter but there were other Ministers before him.  Somebody will have to take the decision on it and it now looks as if it will be the present Minister.</P>
    <P>When I first came into this House in 1987 I had met Senator Norris on a number of occasions but I did not know him very well.  I knew him as somebody who defended gay rights.  I have quite a number of friends who defend gay rights in a public way who are not themselves gay.  I must have been the only person in Ireland who did not know that Senator Norris was gay.  I asked him: &ldquo;Would you mind telling me, David are you gay?&rdquo;  He was shocked that I did not know and had to ask him.  I have quite a number of gay friends but he is the only one who has ever told me that he is gay.</P>

I want, as a gesture of solidarity to my colleague, to say that we welcome what is proposed and we hope the recommendations will be fully implemented.  We also hope that it will be done quickly and we look forward to dealing with the legislation at that time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter and I appreciate the fact that he is here with us.  It is in relation to a primary school in Carrig, Birr, County Offaly.  I would like briefly to outline the background and development of Carrig as a vibrant community and the excellent name that the primary school has established for itself over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The community in Carrig is somewhat unique in that it is in County Offaly but comes under the auspices of Tipperary North Riding County Council for administration purposes.  Being on the periphery, it could be argued that it is at somewhat of a disadvantage.  The community have never seen things in that way and at present while other rural areas have difficulty in keeping their population from falling, the population in Carrig is increasing.  More and more people are coming to settle there.  It says a great deal for the spirit of the community and the kind of people who are living there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Sunday we witnessed one of the greatest days in the history of Carrig when an ecumenical service was held to mark the official opening of a new community centre at which all the dignitaries of North Tipperary and Offaly were present.  This outstanding achievement is a monument to the enthusiasm, dedication, spirit and pride in their area of the people.  Rather than sit back and expect others to do things for them, they got up <Col N="149" /> and did it for themselves.  That community centre was a tremendous achievement. They received £10,000 from the national lottery but £70,000 was collected by the local community.  It is important to point out that it is a very small, local community.  In fact, before the doors were open last Sunday every single penny that it took to build this community centre, about £85,000, was collected. They have a few pounds in the bank as well.</P>
    <P>It is with a spirit and pride and dedication that I raise the issue of the school in Carrig.  The community centre has the added advantage of being right beside the school and this is of immense benefit to the pupils.</P>
    <P>The school in Carrig is a three teacher school and comprises two small rooms and a prefab that is in a very bad state of repair at the moment.  Enrolment in 1989 was 81 and that is a far cry from the position that obtained some ten years ago when it was in the process of being closed. The school was built in 1911.  The rooms are half the recommended size of the Department's regulations.  The children have 1.5 square metres of space per head, and that is not taking furniture into account.</P>
    <P>As you would expect, the school is very congested.  There is no staff room, storage facilities or library.  Medical inspection has to be carried out in the porch which is definitely not suitable. There is no heating or hot water.  There is one washhand basin and two toilets for 40 girls and one washand basin plus one urinal for 40 boys.  The condition of the toilets are extremely bad.  The roof is leaking.  The recommended degrees of heating are 68ºF for the classroom and 17ºF in the cloakrooms and toilets.  These temperatures are never reached because of the poor condition of the doors and windows and the very high ceilings.  It will be appreciated that, as the school was built in 1911, the ceilings tend to be extremely high.  Conditions could be described as being rather primitive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> The condition of the prefab is extremely bad.  All the windows are leaking and they have tried on occasions to do something about them.  Different workmen and builders who have inspected the premises have said that the windows cannot be repaired because if they try to do something with them they will disintegrate.</P>
    <P>Art materials and other items are continually eaten by mice who destroy everything.  I hasten to add that responsibility for the condition of the school cannot be laid at the door of the present Minister.  The difficulties that exist arose prior to the Minister assuming office. Last April she granted approval for a new extension which will include two extra classrooms, converting the existing two classrooms into one classroom, adding a staff room, a library-cum-medical room, proper toilet facilities and extra play space.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that there will not be any delay in providing the extension and that the much needed facility will be put in place in 1991.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his patience and interest in the problems of Carrig School.  I know that approval having been given, he will ensure that the extension is completed with all possible haste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McKenna for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The school is the focal point in many communities. The Minister is aware of this given his own background.  I caution Senator McKenna that my grandfather always said to me, &ldquo;never let them see the money in your hands, son&rdquo;.  I would not tell the Minister I had money in the bank while looking for a grant at the same time.  It is a very fair recommendation of the commitment and contribution made by the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, the Minister knows and Senator McKenna knows that education just cannot continue in an environment <Col N="151" /> which is so hostile to learning as outlined by the Senator.  It would be facile for me to blame the Minister but this problem has existed for a number of years.  Now is the time for it to be resolved.  As a result of the overcrowded conditions in the school the curriculum cannot be implemented.  We all know that.  Urgent action needs to be taken.  Every year at this time £1 million or £0.5 million is unspent on buildings.  I recall two years we had it out hammer and tongs during the months of October, November and December and I nearly cracked up in January when I found out that money was sent back.  We were both misinformed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the budget for building next year has been reduced.  This school building has been there for a long number of years.  It is not one of the old 20×20 classrooms, as we called them. They are smaller.  The new curriculum cannot be implemented because there is no space for children to move.  There is no space for teachers to operate.  The Minister said recently in a newspaper his job was his hobby.  Sport is his hobby as well as his job.  It is great to see somebody happy in his job.  I am happy in mine.  I urge him to give this parish a chance to do what the teachers want to do what the parents are demanding and what he knows is necessary to be done in order that the curriculum operate.  I urge the Minister to act sympathetically and quickly.</P>
    <P>I thank, Senator McKenna not just for giving me some time but also for raising the matter because it is nice to see this gesture from the Government benches. It was not raised in an aggressive way but to describe a problem which needs to be resolved.  The Minister's signature at the bottom of a cheque will resolve the problem.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator McKenna has given me the opportunity of outlining the Department's intentions in relation to Carrig national school, County Tipperary.  The school has three teachers and an enrolment of 80 pupils approximately.  The accommodation consists of a permanent building with two classrooms and a prefab.  I readily accept that the conditions are not satisfactory. A major extension of the school was proposed in 1986 but it was not possible for this project to proceed because of the cost which would have been involved. However, because of the strong representations by the school authorities to my Department, and indeed representations by Senator McKenna and others, I was glad to be able to approve earlier this year a modified project for Carrig national school.  This was in line with the general policies for national schools which have been successfully in place since I took office in 1987, that is to concentrate the available capital on essential classroom accommodation and other basic facilities.</P>
      <P>The following are the specific proposals in this case: a permanent extension of two classrooms and a conversion of the existing school building into one standard classroom; a staff room; a library and medical room.  In addition, suitable toilet facilities and an adequate hard paved area will also be provided.  I am glad to say that these proposals have the full acceptance of the school authorities and I know that when implemented they will be a source of great pride to all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  I acknowledge that the Department have been a bit behind on the necessary planning for the project but this was due to the large number of projects on hands.  As Senators may be aware, senior officials from my Department met a deputation from the school recently and the whole matter was fully discussed.  I am glad to say that my Department's assurances were fully accepted by the deputation.  Architects from my Department visited the school a few days after that and completed the necessary survey. As a result, a sketch plan for the project will be completed at the earliest possible date and will then be sent to the school authorities to enable them to apply for local authority planning permission.</P>
      <P>As the Senators will appreciate, there are a number of factors in relation to the project outside the control of my Department and because of this I am not in a position at this stage to say when tenders can be invited or a contract placed.  However, I assure Senators and all those concerned that any necessary delay will be kept to an absolute minimum. As a result of this debate, we will be in contact with Senator McKenna in order to be more specific about when we can go to tender for the project and also give an indication as to when a contract can be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two salient factors that might be mentioned in regard to this project. It is typical of a number of schools in this deplorable condition throughout the country.  I am glad to say that the number is steadily becoming smaller.  I am the first to admit what Senators O'Toole and McKenna have said on a number of occasions to me, both in the House and privately, that it is disgraceful that any school should find itself in this position. It typifies more than anything else the wrong approach that was taken over the years to the provision of adequate school buildings.  I spoke about this in the House already so I will not go back over it. The proper approach is now being taken <Col N="154" /> where we cut costs without cutting quality. Both Senators will agree that the projects we have completed are to a very high standard of construction and finish and have been done at a fraction of the cost that was proposed in earlier plans. That is the case with this school.</P>

      <P>We have left out GP rooms.  There was much soul-searching on the part of the Minister and myself and our officials about this because we accept the necessity for GP rooms in primary schools.  It was a question of deciding whether we wanted to deal with all of the hovels as quickly as possible or tackling all the major problem schools as quickly as possible.  We decided to put in essential classroom accommodation to leave over GP room development to a later date.  I hope that now that we are getting through the last remaining hovels, and this is certainly one of them, we can proceed to add on GP rooms to schools which need them.  In that context, I encourage schools to fund-raise and provide the GP room as part of the construction project.  That is being done very successfully.  People have got together and taken the initiative.  For very little money they have provided the GP room themselves in addition to the essential classroom and other ancillary accommodation we provide.  Senator O'Toole shakes his head and says that that is not good enough.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  We were careful to ensure that in large schools, especially in workingclass areas, we provided general purpose rooms.  They have not been left out everywhere.  In small schools, like the one in question, it has been necessary to leave out the general purpose room.  Three years ago when we took office the first question put to our officials was, &ldquo;How long will it take to deal with the unacceptable school <Col N="155" /> buildings throughout the country?&rdquo;  The answer was, &ldquo;Eight years&rdquo;.  To continue on with the way things were it would have taken us eight years to deal with the Carrigs of this world.  We have gone more than two-thirds of the way in clearing the worst projects.  By the end of 1991, we will have completed all the bad projects. We will have done it on a reduced budget in one-third of the time that was projected under the old scheme.</P>
      <P>There has been significant progress.  I know that Senator O'Toole in particular has said many things over the years, and rightly so.  He should now acknowledge the progress that has been made and look at some of the projects.  I could give examples, for instance, of schools where architectural planning was completed at a cost of £350,000.  We have since built the same school for £200,000.</P>

      <P>Progress has been made. I am quite happy to take constructive criticism on the chin when it is warranted. It was warranted in regard to the school building programme of the Department of Education and a number of bad schools.  We have got over that now and that should be recognised.  I know Senator O'Toole will be one of the first to recognise it.  I know that Senator McKenna is very appreciative of the progress that has been made.</P>
