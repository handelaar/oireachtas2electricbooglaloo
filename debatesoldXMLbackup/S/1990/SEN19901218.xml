      <P>I have notice from Senator Pat Upton that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that proper safety standards are maintained in large, old vehicles which have a capacity to carry passengers.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to clarify if he proposes to continue with his policy of current compulsory stop-over of transatlantic flights at Shannon particularly in view of recent announcements by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator John A. Murphy of the following matter.</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Communications to allocate a half-minute per hour extra advertising time to RTE, and so afford RTE the opportunity of applying the additional revenue to retain the RTE Chamber Choir, chorus and the Van Brugh String Quartet.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Upton, Norris, Ross and Jackman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Upton's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ross and Jackman may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Murphy as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that it involves legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is Item No. 3 on the Order Paper. At the conclusion of Item No. 3 it is proposed to take Item No. 3a on the supplementary Order Paper which was circulated to Senators this morning.  We are having a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I say, on behalf of my own group and everybody in the House, the great sorrow we all feel that the case of the Birmingham Six was not brought to some sort of satisfactory resolution yesterday. We hope the delay will not be allowed to continue much longer and that the voice of this House will go out to support the views of the Government and the Opposition parties in the other House this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I am a bit confused about the Order of Business.  It was my understanding that we were taking Item No. 3 today and Item No. 7, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1990 and I am wondering why that change has taken place.  I stand to be corrected on that.  I am a bit reluctant to take Item No. 3a today.  I have read it and it seems straightforward.  The Royal Hospital is a splendid institution.  The changes seem to be fairly straightforward but I do not think it is right in principle that Members of the House be handed documentation as they walk into the House and asked to approve it there and then.  I would prefer to leave this item until tomorrow.  I do not see any difficulty with it but in principle I have great difficulty in putting something like this through just in the way outlined.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House has said on the Order of Business that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill will be taken on the first day after the recess. Can he give us any indication as to when he expects us to resume after the recess? Will he also take on board the view of my group that we would be willing to come back early because we want to have debates in this House on a number of important issues which are a spill-over from this session, particularly the point raised last week by the Labour group and by Senator Neville on the question of penal reform?  There is also the full debate on education which we all believe is due and, perhaps most important of all, a continuation of the debate on developments in Europe.  We now have a situation where week by week enormous changes are taking place within the European Community.  The other House apparently has very little time to debate these major changes and we, as the Upper Chamber, should carve out a role for ourselves and do some public service by having a continuous debate on developments in the European Community. I would suggest we come back early to make that into reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning.  I am pleased that the <Col N="332" /> issue of the Birmingham Six is once again back on centre stage and I am sure all sides of the House will support Senator Manning's call to the Leader of the House that he would convey the urgency of this case to the Government and that the matter be expedited as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Manning in his call for ongoing debate in relation to the developments in Europe.  I am sure Senator Manning and the House will be pleased to know that, as recently as one hour ago, our group discussed this matter in the context of bringing forward proposals in this area and I hope that the Leader in his reply will expand a little on that matter.  Perhaps it is something which this House could address itself to in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to those who spoke on the subject of the Birmingham Six and to say that I found it a completely atrocious statement of the judge that he would not allow this to upset his Christmas.  I deplore it totally and I hope that this feeling, which is shared by all Members of the House, will be conveyed by the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader just one question, that is, if it is intended shortly to bring forward amendments to the Companies Act which we just passed last week.  The reason I do this is because I did not speak on it for the simple reason that it was not possible in that time to amend it.  My words were proved correct by the fact that on the very day it passed into operation a defect was found in that Bill involving Government stocks.  This defect was addressed by my colleague, Senator Ross, during an earlier part of the Companies Act.  I think it a pity we were not able to amend it.  I believe it is important that we now remedy a defect that has been dramatically underlined by events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, too, on behalf of the Labour Party, associate myself with the remarks of the previous speakers when they expressed concern about the situation regarding the Birmingham Six. <Col N="333" /> I find the tone of the remarks of the British judge yesterday, when he spoke in terms of not upsetting his Christmas, extremely disturbing; that anybody should adopt that attitude in a case such as this which has received so much attention and which is so important to all of us in this country is most disturbing indeed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House when he proposes to accede to our request for a debate on the prisons?  He very graciously outlined the principle that he was going to accede to our request.  I would welcome it if he could give us some details of when that debate is liable to take place.  I would also like to ask the Leader if it would be possible to allow the full day's sitting on Thursday to be devoted to the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats add our voice to the remarks regarding the Birmingham Six, to express our great disappointment at the results of yesterday's proceedings and indeed to impress upon the Leader of the House if he could bring home to the Government that no effort, be spared, particularly this week to try to get the Birmingham Six released before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Secondly, with regard to the possibility of this House focusing on European affairs, I would refer back to a speech I made here nearly 12 months ago when I spent some time emphasising the potential use of this House in looking at the current activities at European level. Obviously, we are glad to see that there is support for that point of view.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I raise again the matter of the foreign affairs committee with the Leader of the House?  It is a matter that has been consistently raised in both Houses and the Progressive Democrats are anxious to see this matter brought to fruition.  As developments have shown, we are in dire need of such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the words of Senator Manning to the Leader of the House when he appealed to him not to give us copies of Bills and <Col N="334" /> explanatory memoranda on our way into the House.  I happen to have responsibility as spokesperson for Health in our party and I find it very unsatisfactory to be given an order going in the door.  It is unlikely that this matter will be contentious, but that is not the point.  It is the wrong way to go about parliamentary business.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House if, given the season that is in it, he would convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance the concern of this House at the continuing famine and great shortage of food and resources in the Sudan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest the Senator has in that matter is well known and understood, but this is not the appropriate time for it to be raised here. The Senator knows the procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to ask the Leader of the House if he intends to convey our concern about the Sudan to the relevant Minister and to get a decent level of aid for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning and Senator Upton in asking the Leader of the House for an early debate on the changes in the penal system and also, coupled with that, a debate on the inadequate proposals of the Minister for Justice to grant an improvement in the resources of the Garda to fight crime.  I would also like to ask the leader if he will allow time to debate before Christmas the serious situation developing as a result of the proposals to save the Goodman Group, whereby one of our largest and most important industries is now going to be controlled by foreign banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the remarks of those Senators who mentioned the Birmingham Six.  It is not just the Birmingham Six; it is also the Maguires, who are waiting for justice, as His Grace, the Archbishop, said in a statement the other day.  I find it extraordinary that we still <Col N="335" /> continue to extradite people to be tried in what is obviously a corrupt judicial&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was lenient.  I think in fairness it was correct to allow Members time to express themselves on a matter as fundamentally important as the rights of the persons involved, but I do not wish the comments being made to be expanded or enlarged in any other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Cathaoirleach would allow me make a point before I ask questions of the Leader, that is, that the minor partners in the Coalition Government in this House seem not to realise that it has been Fine Gael policy for over three years now to give a right of audience to MEPs in this House and, indeed, to use this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We were there before you, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as an ongoing forum to keep abreast of and to discuss the changes in the issues in Europe generally. May I ask the Leader of the House a specific question and I hope I will get a specific answer.  I understood that Whips' meetings on the Wednesday or Thursday of a previous week were to agree business, if at all possible, for the forthcoming week.  I understood also that this week's business was agreed by the Whips. What this group agreed to was to take No. 3 today, followed by No. 7 &mdash; the Electoral (Amendment) Bill &mdash; which was to commence.  For tomorrow we were to continue with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill up to Private Members' time.  No. 3 (a) has been produced as we come in the door &mdash; the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook (Charter Amendment) Order, 1990.  We have no difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House why the Order of Business was changed when it had been specifically agreed, without any reference to the Whips, certainly our Whip; I do not know if other Whips got any indication?  Is that the way business <Col N="336" /> will be conducted in the future?  Why hold Whips' meetings if they are to be totally disregarded?</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House also if he would consider taking No. 3a first thing tomorrow morning.  The Whips could meet after the Order of Business today and slot it in either tomorrow or Thursday.  It is not contentious, but we at least want to read it and find out what is in the order that has been circulated. The Royal Hospital order could be commenced after the Order of Business in the morning and we could continue on with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. We must clarify the role of Whips meetings and whether they are to be overridden at the whim of the Government when business commences here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House a question in connection with the Altamont Bill, 1990, No. 2 on the Order Paper.  The Leader and other Senators will be aware that recently Lord Altamont circulated to Members here and Members of the Dáil a very adequate memorandum of what this Bill is about.  It would seem to me that that would be regarded by the Leader of the House as adequate documentation to allow him to reconsider the reintroduction of this Bill which would be moved by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I would appreciate it if that could be expedited and if the Leader could advise me of his views on the present position.</P>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator Norris, Senator Manning and other Senators, concerning the Birmingham Six.  I too, found outrageous the remarks of a British judge, the jocose manner in which he suggested that sitting over Christmas might not be altogether convenient because it might upset his Christmas dinner.  Having regard to what these people have been through, I found it a most appalling, facetious and unacceptable remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Leader of the House that the Royal Hospital order should not be moved today.  It is entirely unacceptable that in respect of an order, a copy of which, it is stated, was laid before <Col N="337" /> this House for the first time ever today, we are expected to put it through on the nod without knowing what it is about. Procedurally it is wrong.  It should be taken tomorrow or Thursday, if it is necessary to take it at all.</P>
    <P>Finally, I implore the Leader of the House to talk again to his superiors in Government about this question of a foreign affairs committee of the Oireachtas, or, if not of the entire Oireachtas then of this House.  It may seem repetitious for some of us to continually advert to this matter in the House, and no doubt it is, but we have to be repetitious if the Government are going to do nothing about it.  We are apparently the only country in western Europe which does not have such a committee.  There is a crying need for it for all of the reasons we have enumerated previously.  In particular, I believe the time is ripe again for another debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You will appreciate that you are making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you very much. I wish you a happy Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and other Senators regarding the appalling travesty of justice to which we were compelled to listen over the past two days, which is just part of a very long-standing series of incidents which, I must say, make it very difficult for us.  We have all on both sides of the House, with a considerable degree of sacrifice, agreed to extradition.  I must say that, if this is the sort of justice people are going to get, we will have to look at that again.  I rise, however, on another matter.  This is presumably the last series of sittings we are going to have in his year.  When we resume &mdash; perhaps a date will be stated &mdash; the situation is that on 15 January an ultimatum of the gravest importance expires.  This ultimatum could conceivably mean &mdash; we all hope it will not &mdash; the greatest conflagration since the Second World War.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if there <Col N="338" /> is any intention of recalling this House in the event that that ultimatum does go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the various other Senators concerning the appalling stalemate in relation to the Birmingham Six and also the grossly insulting comments of one particular judge.  I would like also to express to the Leader of the House my concern at the decision over the weekend to release a convicted child sex abuser for on whatever grounds.  I am asking the Leader of the House if he would convey the concern of many people about this. As we all know, child sex abuse is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed.  I would hate to think there would be a type of leniency creeping in where people who were convicted would be released&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out that the Leader of the House may reply and, if he wishes on a personal basis, he may convey, but for the purpose of the Business of the House a question must be put in such a way that the function of reply is the one that will be exercised by the Leader of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader of the House if he would respond to the extraordinary statement made by Senator Norris, seeking an amendment to the Companies Bill when he, among other Independents, held up the ordering of business last week for three hours, when he failed to contribute to that Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning, as did many other Senators, referred to the Birmingham Six.  I share the concern of all the Senators in this House regarding this terrible problem.  Obviously, our hope would be that they would be released before Christmas, which does not now seem possible, but certainly at the earliest opportunity after the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning referred to Item No. 7.  That is being taken tomorrow and I will deal with it further down the list. He also asked about Item No. 3a.  Like Senator Manning, I received the Supplementary Order Paper today for the first time.  I agree with the Senator's view and the view of Senator O'Reilly that it is not good enough that we should get these, but it happens from time to time. I would prefer that it would not happen. While I have it ordered for today, if it can be taken.  I would ask that it be taken at the conclusion of the Exchange Control Bill but, if needs be, and if the Whips agree, I have no objection to it being taken tomorrow morning if that is possible.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked when we will be coming back after Christmas.  My intention is that we would come back before the Dáil, which I understand will be back on Budget day, and I understand that is 30 January.  We will certainly be back before that and the Environment Protection Agency Bill will be with us for discussion at that time.</P>
      <P>The Senator, as did other Senators, also raised the question as to whether we should have debates on education, on Europe, and on law and order.  I have no objection to trying to arrange discussions on the important matters Senator Manning has raised as soon as we get back to business after the Christmas recess. Senator Mooney also referred to the question of the Birmingham Six and raised the question of debates on ongoing problems in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris also raised the matter of the Birmingham Six and expressed his <Col N="340" /> concern, as we all do.  He referred to amendments to the Companies Bill.  My understanding is that this Bill has now been passed and there will be no amendments to the Bill.  In fairness, I want to support what has been said.  On last Thursday we had the leak regarding the inflation rates and we had the subsequent controversy, which is still ongoing.  It was ironic that on the very day this happened &mdash; something we are trying to eliminate in the Companies Bill, which was being discussed in the House on that day &mdash; many people, particularly the Independent Members, who had been calling for this Companies Bill to come to us, did not even attend during the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any point?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that our speakers on this side of the House found very little difficulty with the Minister in going through the Bill.  I am sure when Senators Doyle and Howard got into the Bill they could probably say the same.  I know they would have liked to have had more time and that they asked for more time.  My only criticism of the Minister is that he went overboard in his explanations to the House about what was going on.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton also asked about the Birmingham Six, the prison system and the Appropriation Bill, in particular.  I would prefer a form of adjournment debate on the Appropriation Bill such as that mentioned some time ago by Senator O'Toole.  The procedure over the past seven or eight years has been that we take the Appropriation Bill, have one speaker from each side, and the Minister, pass the Bill and then we come back for a day's debate after the Christmas recess. That is something we will be pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cullen also mentioned the Birmingham Six and the European situation. He also asked about a foreign affairs Committee, as did Senator Staunton subsequently. That has been requested many times, not just here but in the other House.  It has been spelt out that the Joint <Col N="341" /> Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC assumes in many ways the role of a foreign affairs Committee.  That is the Government's standing at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred to the Altamont Bill.  While we did receive a letter from Lord Altamont, we are waiting, I understand &mdash; I have to discuss it with the Leas-Chathaoirleach &mdash; a more detailed explanatory memorandum and when we have that we will discuss what we might do.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy raised the question of the Birmingham Six.  He also asked about the Gulf crisis and I certainly hope that what he indicated in regard to any plans for reconvening before 15 January will not arise.  Senator Reilly asked about the Royal Hospital and I have explained that. He also made a statement on the famine in the Sudan.  Senator Neville referred to the penal systems and crime, to which I have referred.  He mentioned something about the Goodman Group, which is not appropriate to the Order of Business. Neither was Senator Lydon's point, apart from his reference to the Birmingham Six.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the ongoing discussions on Europe and also about times agreed with the Whips for today and for the rest of the week.  I hope that when we come back after Christmas more of the Whips will attend these meetings, because it is the way forward.  It leads to a better understanding of what is happening in the House and gives the House a better opportunity to run on the proper lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I want to make it clear that Senator Howard was present, and always is, as my Whip is now saying to me.  I understand that, while a general programme was arranged, there were no specific times laid down.  In fairness to Senator Doyle's Whip, I think that because she is spokesperson for Finance I have a feeling he wanted Senator Doyle to have as much time as possible on the Exchange Control Bill today.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the existing exchange <Col N="343" /> control legislation in operation for a further two years.  The 1954 Exchange Control Act, as amended by the 1978 Act, forms the legal basis for Irish exchange controls.  It had been hoped, when the Act was first introduced, that the controls, which it permitted, would not be required on a long term basis.  It was, therefore, given a limited time-span &mdash; initially four years.  However, in the intervening years it was not found possible to dispense with exchange control.  The Act has, therefore, been renewed on a four yearly basis.  The last renewal, in 1986, continued the Act in operation until the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Since 1986, the situation has changed dramatically.  Over the past three years, great progress has been made in phasing out exchange controls and the day is in sight when Ireland will no longer operate a system of exchange control as a matter of continuing policy.  The process of dismantling the controls has, of necessity, been a gradual one and we still have some way to go.  To provide a legal basis for those controls which are still in operation, we need to renew the legislation for a further period.  However, since the Government are firmly committed to completing the liberalisation process by the end of 1992 at the latest, to do so for the customary period of four years would be inappropriate.  The Bill before the House today will, therefore, provide a statutory basis for exchange controls for a further two years only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the 1954 legislation prohibited a wide range of payments and other financial transactions with non-residents, it gave discretionary power to the Minister for Finance, and by delegation from him to the Central Bank, to grant permissions for individual transactions or ranges of transactions.  Thus, down through the years, general permissions have been given which enabled many operations to be conducted freely.  Even from the beginning, payments relating to trade, commercial and other current operations could be made without restriction.  Such payments were merely supervised, to <Col N="344" /> ensure that unauthorised capital transfers did not take place in the guise of current payments.  Many capital operations were also permitted, in particular those which facilitated inflows of capital from abroad. Following our entry to the European Community, Irish residents could freely make direct investments, or real estate investments, in other Community countries.</P>
    <P>However, the push for completely free movement of capital did not come until the late 1980s, when it became obvious that this would be one of the principal pillars of the Single European Market. Encouraged by the dramatic turn-around in our economy in 1987, my predecessor was able to announce, in October of that year, the Government's intention to dismantle exchange controls on a phased basis.  In June of the following year, the EC Council of Ministers adopted a new directive to finally implement the Treaty of Rome objective of full freedom of capital movements between Community countries.  In line with the terms of that directive, the eight stronger member states had achieved full capital liberalisation by July of this year.  Ireland, with Greece, Spain and Portugal, has until the end of 1992 to complete the process of dismantling its controls.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister's announcement in October 1987, we have come a long way towards achieving that end.  Irish residents can now freely invest in medium and long term foreign securities.  The rules governing the forward cover market and many of the innovative instruments of the international financial world &mdash; like swaps, futures and options &mdash; have been greatly eased.  Irish financial institutions have considerable freedom to accept Irish pound deposits from non-residents and much of the administrative burden which exchange control imposed on the business and financial communities has been lifted.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill in Dáil Éireann, I was able to announce another package of relaxation measures which will advance our progress still further.  I indicated I proposed to begin relaxing the restrictions on foreign currency accounts. <Col N="345" /> Initially, individual residents will be permitted to operate fixed-term foreign currency accounts with financial institutions in the State.  The operation of these accounts will be subject to a number of conditions, including a minimum period of investment of three months.  To counter any loss of tax revenue from individuals moving funds into such accounts, I propose, in the 1991 Finance Bill, to extend the deposit interest retention tax to cover interest from these new personal foreign currency accounts held by Irish residents.  For this reason, the implementation of this particular measure will be deferred until next year's Finance Bill has been enacted &mdash; probably around the end of next May.</P>
    <P>The other changes, which I announced will take effect from the beginning of next month.  These include: allowing the conversion of Irish pounds for purchases by individual residents of short term foreign securities, subject to a limit of £10,000 per individual and an overall limit of £50 million for 1991; permitting residents to invest freely in foreign undertakings for collective investment in Transferable Securities, commonly known as UCITS.  The UCITS in question are those whose policy is to invest in short term foreign securities, or cash deposits, as long as they comply with the European Communities UCITS Regulations of 1989; extending to individual residents the freedom which institutional investors already have to acquire futures and options on foreign securities, for hedging purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also proposing to ease restrictions on direct investment and the purchase of personal property in countries outside the EC and to remove altogether the limit of £20,000 which currently applies to gifts and personal loans, made by Irish residents to residents of non-EC countries.  Finally, Irish financial institutions will be permitted to issue long term loans to non-residents for purposes other than trade, direct investment and the purchase of property.  In this context, long term is taken to mean for periods of five years or more.</P>
    <P>In adopting a programme to liberalise <Col N="346" /> exchange controls, we did not do so with our eyes closed.  We knew we would have to face certain risks.  Even allowing for the strengthening of economic and social cohesion within the Community, there will be greatly increased potential for capital outflows &mdash; particularly in the short term as investors seek to diversify their portfolios.  Indeed, we saw some of the effects of this in 1989, following the removal of restrictions on medium and long term foreign securities.  Happily, the situation was reversed this year when a significant portion of this investment in foreign securities was liquidated and repatriated.  We also experienced very large inflows into the banking system when we liberalised Irish pound deposits by non-residents.</P>
    <P>Full freedom of capital movements will also increase the volatility of such movements, particularly at times of exchange rate uncertainty.  The greater potential for, and the increased volatility of, capital flows are both factors which could put pressure on domestic interest rates, in either direction.  Monetary policy will, thus, have to play an increased role in regulating inward and outward flows of capital and in maintaining the stability of the exchange rate.  However, in considering these risks, we must bear in mind that the European Community, in adopting full capital liberalisation, did not leave us without safeguards.  The Council of Ministers appreciated the difficulties that would be faced by the economically weaker member states in implementing full capital liberalisation.  In recognition of this, a somewhat longer transition period was provided for those countries and we have availed of this to phase out exchange controls over a period of time. The Community directive also included a safeguard clause that will allow member states to reintroduce controls on certain capital movements, if short term capital movements of exceptional magnitude lead to serious disturbances in the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies. In addition, there is an enhanced scheme of medium-term financial support to assist member states who may <Col N="347" /> encounter difficulties as a result of capital liberalisation.</P>
    <P>However, I would not like to give the impression that the liberalisation of capital movements has only negative implications. There is also, of course, a very positive side.  An international perception of a control-free environment and the closer integration of the European market will enhance our attractiveness as an investment location. Provided our policies are right, we can look forward to increased capital inflows, with obvious beneficial consequences for the economy.  The increase in holdings of overseas assets by Irish residents will also generate income from these assets in the years ahead.  Furthermore, our business and financial communities will be able to compete more effectively in international markets, as they secure access to all the risk management techniques and means of financing that are available to their foreign counterparts.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress strongly enough that the most vital ingredient in our success in all of this will be the continued prudent management of the economy and of the public finances.  It is essential that investors, both foreign and domestic, have good reason to be confident in our performance in this regard.  In a situation of easier movement of capital, we would be punished very severely for any lapses. We must, therefore, recognise that this new situation will impose new disciplines on our management of the public finances. If we meet this challenge effectively, the potential benefits in the longer term will be very great indeed.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would just say again that we have made, and continue to make, very rapid progress towards our goal of full capital liberalisation.  As we do not yet find ourselves in a position to complete the process, it is not possible to dispense now with the legal basis for the remaining exchange controls.  Indeed, even when full liberalisation has been achieved, it will still be necessary to have enabling legislation to allow the re-introduction of controls in an emergency situation, for example if we had a severe <Col N="348" /> balance of payments crisis.  However, I am conscious that the existing legislation, which is very restrictive in philosophy, would be inappropriate in a fully liberalised situation.  It is our intention, therefore, to return to the Oireachtas before the end of 1992 with proposals for simpler and more positively worded legislation.  The existing format restricts all transactions, except with the permission of the Minister for Finance.  I would envisage that the new legislation would provide that capital movements be unrestricted, unless the Minister ordained otherwise by Statutory Order.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, it is necessary to renew the existing legislation for a further limited period.  I, therefore, commend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, all of us who welcome the Single Market and the goals of European economic and monetary union, and perhaps also political union at a later date, must support the Government and our institutions as they try to realise the goal of full capital liberalisation &mdash; to use the Minister's own words.  This very short Bill here today enables the Government to extend for a couple of years what is left of our exchange control regulations until 1 January 1993 when, hopefully, as the Minister says, the Government will be in a position to abolish all remaining controls. Perhaps that will be easier said than done. There are certain aspects of it that continue to cause concern perhaps only because I and others are ignorant of the exact impact and explanations in many cases might allay the concerns that exist. There was a very interesting debate in the Dáil on this particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very technical Bill.  The real difficulty that faces us would appear to be the fact that over the past few years we have been hand-picking the easier bits to achieve as we go along the road towards capital liberalisation in the European Community.  We have left ourselves &mdash; which is understandable in some ways &mdash; the more difficult bits to put in place now or to remove as the case may be. <Col N="349" /> Some of these aspects were touched on by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the Minister's reference to changes he will introduce in next year's budget and Finance Bill to extend the deposit interest retention tax to cover interest from these new personal foreign currency accounts held by Irish residents, to quote his own words.  I would ask the Minister in his concluding speech on Second Stage here today to expand somewhat on what he has in mind in this regard.  The difficulties in this area are immediate and the Minister would have to abolish DIRT tax or at least dramatically reduce the rate as is now exists in this country, or do something along the lines he is now proposing if he is not to have an outflow of funds from this country when full liberalisation is achieved.  Certainly, if savers have small or large sums of money to put on deposit they are not going to put it in an institution and pay 30 per cent tax if they had an option of investing in any of the European countries at either a new rate or a much lower rate of retention tax.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister envisage will be the collection system?  At what stage will the money be stopped?  Will it be stopped at source, or could it be stopped at source given the situation that exists in this country and the procedures that are in place at the moment?  I would be very interested in an expansion of the proposals the Minister has in mind for the Finance Bill and I am sure he knows what they are now.  At this stage he must know what the Finance Bill will hold.  This is one of perhaps two major areas of worry of the post-1992 situation when exchange controls have been removed as we now understand them.  An expansion in that area would be very welcome.  It may, indeed, allay the fears that exist and that were expressed while the Bill was going through the other House.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the UCITS.  Indeed, last week in the Companies Bill we had a part referring to UCITS and again this week in the unit trust legislation we will be dealing with UCITS.  It is amazing how suddenly those words appear; three or four times in a <Col N="350" /> fortnight we are dealing with a concept that I certainly did not know much about up to a fortnight ago or I would have been hard pressed to define exactly what they were.  Yet, in three Bills before the House in the space of eight days we are dealing with UCITS.  I just make that point.  It is really part of the times we are in.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect I would like the Minister to develop, that is, that many of the points he raised and many of the liberalisations are still time-framed.  The Minister said that the Irish financial institutions would be permitted to issue long term loans to non-residents for purchases other than trade, direct investment and the purchase of property.  He said that in this context &ldquo;long term&rdquo; is taken to mean for periods of five years or more.  Indeed at the moment, with non-residents accounts in this country, I think there is a three months minimum call-up time.  There are other time-frames too.  The Minister referred at another point to a time-frame on a certain aspect. My understanding is that in true and full liberalisation in this area the time-frames themselves will have to go also.  We are talking about the electronic movement of money.  You can take money from Frankfurt and put it into a financial institution in Dublin today, shift it on to somewhere else tomorrow, play the money markets, take benefit of interest rates in different countries and the relative difference in them.  Generally, does the Minister envisage our insisting on keeping time-frames of any kind in respect of any aspect of exchange controls in the post-1992 situation?  My understanding is that that would not be so.</P>
    <P>At the moment, certainly, the Central Bank and the institutions have certain controls.  When it comes to fixing the three-month interest rate and even in terms of the monthly interest rate, they have control as to the time-span within which money can be quickly shifted out of the country again.  Surely this will not be tenable with full liberalisation in this area.  How will we prevent large runs on our central reserves generally?  How <Col N="351" /> would we even prevent a regular occurrence of the type we appear to be seeing at the moment in this country when we understand that a lot of money came, in August and September, into our institutions and, indeed, very welcome it was because of the uncertainty in the Gulf and nervousness in financial markets elsewhere.  They obviously reckoned we were fairly secure and stable over here. I think £700 million was invested here in August and September.  Apparently, most, if not all, of this money has since exited, presumably on a three month call-up of some kind.</P>
    <P>We read in today's papers that the chances of a 1 per cent rise in the Central Bank interest rates are fairly certain.  The reason given by the financial correspondents appears to be that we have gone below the £3.5 billion reserve which is considered to be the critical level.  Some would give a much lower level as being the critical or the trigger level for increasing interest rates.  But, conventionally, the £3.5 billion has been accepted as the level below which the Central Bank look to increasing their interest rates so that there is not any further run and to keep the position of this country, relative to other investment countries, favourable.</P>
    <P>We read about the threat of an increase in interest rates at the moment because of the £700 million that has exited.  Can we expect a much more volatile situation in this area in the Europe of post-1992? How, with the exception of the emergency measures the Minister referred to, will we in fact be able to exact a certain amount of monetary control in our own country?  We either fully liberalise or we do not.  We will always be susceptible to changes in world financial markets but particularly in the European Community. With the apparent change in Central Bank policy now in relation to our parity with the Deutsche Mark and the knock-on effect that that has had in recent times, what do we learn from it all?  What controls does the Minister envisage?  Policies in themselves are not the switch of a button type controls.  You <Col N="352" /> have to build up to a situation whereby the strength of our economy is a control in itself.</P>
    <P>We are vulnerable to outside influences, as we all know.  Is there anything, apart from the emergency measures, that would be available to the Central Bank and to the institutions in this country to prevent outflows of money, literally by the pressing of an electronic keyboard in some other financial centre?  What are the controls that are envisaged in this type of situation that has given rise to quite a lot of concern in recent times?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the European Community did not leave us without safeguards, particularly the more vulnerable countries like ourselves.  The economically strong countries of the Community have full liberalisation in this area since July this year.  They call us the objective 1 countries, or some quaint expression like that.  We and Greece, Portugal and parts of Spain are all lumped together as slightly also rans when it comes to the economic and monetary situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Catching up, yes, that sounds better.  They are all lumped under this expression.  We benefited by being classified as objective 1 when it came to the Structural Funds and extra money in this area.  We are, perhaps, also benefiting now in that we are being given extra time gradually to phase out our present exchange controls and come to full liberalisation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Community did not leave us without safeguards.  I am not quite sure what safeguards, apart from the emergency measures which we could reintroduce to exert control on certain capital movements, if they were of exceptional magnitude leading to serious disturbances in the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies.  Could the Minister expand on what measures there are, apart from the emergency measures, if any?  Could he expand also how the <Col N="353" /> emergency measures might, in fact, be triggered off?</P>
    <P>The speed of reaction is very important when we are talking about the electronic movement of huge sums of money and preventing runs on our reserves in this country.  Will we have to get permission from, or be directed by, the European Central Bank that we talk about arriving on the scene sometime in the future?  Will there be some central point in Europe which will authorise the triggering of the reintroduction of controls on certain capital movements in the event of exceptional disturbances in policy in any one member state?  How will this be triggered into effect?  What other safeguards does the Community envisage?  Will they be available to countries such as Ireland in this regard?</P>
    <P>I understand that the original exchange control legislation was a war-time measure or was in response to war-time events.  As a nation, we should be as experienced as most, if not more experienced than some of our colleagues in the Community, in relation to operating in monetary union, because effectively that is what we did with the UK for so long until some time in the seventies.  Others would go further and say that we effectively had economic union as well.  With certain trade protection and various other measures in place it was not quite the economic union we envisage for the EC Twelve in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There are enormous questions still to be answered; for instance, in regard to the phasing out of the hardest bits, if you like, on our road to full capital liberalisation and the removal of all exchange controls.  How does the Minister envisage the changes in the DIRT tax that he has indicated?  I would appreciate it if the Minister could detail that in his response because the implications for DIRT tax and the Exchequer revenue are quite enormous if we do not compensate in some way.  Indeed, VAT harmonisation will cost this country a great deal if there is to be parity between ourselves and the rest of Europe, but particularly between ourselves and the UK, which would appear to be the more <Col N="354" /> pertinent issue.  If we also had to harmonise retention tax levels, what price does the Minister put on that?  Borrowing is not an option, increasing taxes is not an option, increasing personal taxation is not an option.  How does the Minister plan to compensate for the losses in these areas which would appear to be necessary if we are not to be put at a disadvantage in terms of investment or indeed VAT and excise disadvantage also in terms of the purchase of goods.  I let my case rest there, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>We will be supporting the Minister this afternoon.  I thank him for his comprehensive introduction to Part II in this fairly technical area and for indicating to us the process of dismantling the controls, as he put it himself.  I have major concern about the present situation regarding retention tax.  As long as funds are free to be invested in any European country or, indeed, elsewhere, how will we compensate? The Minister has hinted there will be something in the Finance Bill.  I await his response on that.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned, as I indicated, about the effect that full liberalisation might have on interest rates here.  If we had a very volatile situation and very free movement of funds into and out of the country without any time framing of that movement of money, what processes will be in place to ensure that we will not get to the crisis situation envisaged, apparently, in the Minister's speech when we can reintroduce emergency controls? Apart from that crisis management of the situation, I have no indication as to what controls can be put in place in this country if there is what we refer to as a run or an exodus of large sums of money such as we have seen in the past few months, and which has resulted in the suggestion in today's national daily papers that we are in for a 1 per cent increase in interest rates because of the outflow of funds. This is just a taste of what we might see in the future if we do not have in place a system of control to ensure that we are not vulnerable in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussing this Bill about exchange control reminds me of <Col N="355" /> the time when Castro came to power in Cuba and his Finance Minister absconded with a large sum of money.  He was asked the question: &ldquo;How did you get out with such a large amount of money?&rdquo; to which he replied: &ldquo;In a suitcase&rdquo;.  I hope that with all the regulations and controls this will not happen here.</P>
      <P>In discussing the Bill one would have to advert to Ireland's entry to the EMS and the UK's decision to opt out.  For the first time, it made us subject to the volatility of the exchange rate <i>vis-a-vis</i> sterling.  We countered that by introducing an amending Act in 1978 to extend coverage of the exchange control system to the UK.  Since then the primary twin objectives have been to strengthen the balance of payments and the external reserves, increase the capital available for productive purposes within the State and reduce disruptive currency flows at times of exchange rate uncertainty. While the 1954 Act vested discretionary powers in the Minister for Finance, that is, permission by statutory instrument or administrative decision for individual transactions or ranges of transactions, the responsibility for administering the controls was delegated to the Central Bank itself.  This primary responsibility still rests with them today.</P>
      <P>The proposal for a single EC Market led to a further easing of controls in October 1987.  This move was prompted by a Council of Ministers decision ordaining full freedom of capital movements within the Community and this was to be put in place in the case of Ireland by the end of 1992.  The relaxation process commenced in 1988 when the resident investors as were given certain limited freedom to acquire foreign securities. The most important phase of liberalisation came in 1989 when all the remaining restrictions on residents' purchase of medium and long term foreign securities were removed.  The result is that the only controls remaining are those pertaining to short-time capital movements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to bring in this relaxation, the Government had to embark on a policy <Col N="356" /> which would yield a stable economy and foster confidence in the economy, thereby encouraging foreign investors to place their capital investment here in Ireland.  The Government's policy has been so successful since 1987 that at the end of October the official external reserves stood at £3.7 billion, the highest ever recorded for this country.  So strong were our external reserves then that when the German interest rates were increased by half a percentage point, all the commentators expected that Irish interest rates would follow suit, yet they did not.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that since then &mdash; certainly since early November and at the moment it is not possible to estimate the exact amount &mdash; there has been a fairly significant outflow of funds.  What is possible for us to tabulate are the reasons. The German interest rates have gone up again and the Deutsche Mark has strengthened considerably not alone against the Irish currency but also against all other EC currencies.  The dollar also has weakened.  While it is not possible to estimate whether there will be an increase in interest rates, it is safe to say that the reserves are at a very safe level and not under threat at this particular time.</P>
    <P>It is also important to point out that day-to-day management of the financial market is the responsibility of the Central Bank.  It decides to intervene in the market in the light of the circumstances that prevail at any particular time, such as conditions in other markets and full flows out of the country.  We should remember that year in obligations require us to intervene only at the 2.25 per cent margin from the central rate.  The Irish pound has remained well within that range and movement outside the so-called narrower bands, for technical reasons, has not happened.</P>
    <P>It is also noteworthy to take our interest rates into account.  We had three reductions last year.  We had two half per cent increases this year.  If we compare our interest rates with Britain, we are 2¾ per cent below the UK rate at the moment.  If we compare ourselves with <Col N="357" /> the Deutsche Mark, in 1987 we were something like 9 per cent higher than the German rate.  Now we are down to a 2 per cent gap.  That must be seen by everybody as being an extremely significant achievement.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, the removal of exchange controls carries risks and also opportunities. At the end of 1992 Irish residents will be able to conduct financial transactions world-wide, the same as they would in Ireland, seeking the best return on their investment and the most competitive terms on any investments they make.  At the same time it is fair to say there will be a sizeable increase in the volume of funds that can move quickly in and out of the country.  Domestic interest rates, therefore, are likely to be much more volatile than we have been used to, and are likely to play a far greater role in regulating these flows and maintaining the exchange value of currency.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the degree of confidence in the Irish economic prospects will be of paramount importance.  It will be critical in attracting the overseas investment we so badly need and, at the same time, it will encourage domestic savers to invest at home.  In other words, how the risks and opportunities arising from dismantling exchange controls balance out will depend on how we conduct our affairs.  In the light of the Government's firm commitment to effective management of the economy, I am confident the benefits will continue to outweigh the risks.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that I commend the Bill for approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with all parties in this House in giving a general welcome to this Bill.  Exchange controls are a very difficult topic for discussion because, to a large extent, we are all shadow-boxing in the dark when we are discussing their effect or the effect of removing them.  They are preventive medicine rather than a cure for some sort of disease from which we are already suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are right in taking <Col N="358" /> a cautious view of lifting the exchange controls and making a gradualist approach to this problem.  We have had great difficulties as a State in the imposition of exchange controls, particularly since 1977-79 when we had the break with sterling and entry into the EMS.  I was familiar with the exchange control ruling at the time.  After we entered the EMS, and broke with sterling, there was quite obviously a great ignorance of the effect this would have on the economy and the inflows and outflows of capital.</P>
    <P>A very rigid exchange control mechanism was set up which restricted the movement of money out of this country to an excessive extent.  It was indicative at the time that when we broke with sterling, whereas we imposed extremely strong, rigid rules against outflows of small amounts of capital from here, particularly against the sterling area, we expected the UK Government to impose the same restrictions against us.  That did not happen because they did not have the same attitude to exchange controls as we had.  They never imposed exchange controls against us.  The reason for that was that their's was a more confident economy.  They had more experience of the imposition of exchange control.</P>
    <P>After 1979, the result of such stringent exchange control was that artificial markets built up in this country, particularly in the stock market, because there was such a build-up of money in the institutions and amongst individuals that they could not remove it from the country, and they had very few outlets into which to put it.  That presented great difficulties for the financial institutions here.  It presented difficulties for individuals with small sums of money to invest.  As a result, it was very difficult to measure the relative values of the stock market here against the stock market in countries where exchange control was not imposed.  It was difficult to measure the relative values of, say, the Irish bank shares against bank shares in the UK and in France, simply because we did not know at the time &mdash; and analysts in stockbroking firms and financial institutions did not know &mdash; how much money there <Col N="359" /> was in these shares and in Government stocks, simply because it had no where else to go.</P>
    <P>There was a feeling at the time that a large amount of money in the Irish market and in Irish investment was being put in at artificial prices because it could not be put anywhere except on deposit &mdash; buy Irish property or buy Irish shares.</P>
    <P>I do not think this was justified, but it was certainly the current thinking.  It was certainly something which was impossible to prove or disprove.  It was a measure of the fact that this was not justified that when exchange controls were lifted, with small concessions to pension funds and to individual investors, there was no great rush of money out of the country.  Investment advisers certainly told people to make use of their £5,000 limit at the time by spreading their portfolios.  But there was no panic.  There was no institutional rush of money out of the country to get into anything else except Irish paper.</P>
    <P>The restrictions at the time are something that we learned from.  They were far too draconian and unnecessary.  When the restrictions were lifted in a more tangible way by the Minister for Finance in 1987, there really was a new development in the Irish economy, in that far from money leaving the country, money was coming into the country.  I suppose it is one of the litmus tests for confidence in the economy of the country and for overseas investors' confidence in the economy of the country to see, when exchange controls are lifted, whether money goes out and how much money, if controls are not imposed by that country, is coming in from abroad.</P>
    <P>It was indicative, and it is to the credit of this Government and the 1987-89 Government, of the confidence which overseas investors felt in the financial measures being taken that money was pouring into Irish Government paper between the years of 1987 and 1989. There is no doubt that the measures being taken by the Government then were responded to by a massive inflow of funds.  The corollary of that is that when <Col N="360" /> exchange control was lifted those who had money invested here still regarded it as a safe and sensible place in which to put their money.  That remains the situation. It may not be quite as confidently placed in the economy here now as it was then but, by and large, because the economy and the public finances are in a better state, we can be more confident about lifting exchange control.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister one or two specific points about the exchange control regulations which are extremely complex.  I find difficult to understand the need for the continued existence of some of them.  I see that the Minister intends to lift the restriction on residents in this country investing in foreign security of less than two years' duration.  I have never quite understood why this was necessary in the first place.  It seems to me anomalous and foolish that individuals can put money in a three year security but they cannot put it in a security which is redeemed within two years. I do not think there is any great demand from individuals to put massive sums in very short based securities.  There is some demand.  Maybe it is being limited to £10,000 by the Minister in order to test the demand.  He is obviously putting a ceiling of, I think, £50 million in order to test the demand.  I would like to know what the basis for this is and what the basis for not holding bank accounts overseas is, as well.  It seems to be logical that money should be placed in short term securities overseas if they are going to be placed in medium-term securities overseas. I cannot see what the great distinction is.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, I note that the Minister said that he intends to implement the DIRT tax on deposits in bank accounts in foreign banks.  I do not know how he intends to implement that tax.  I would be interested to know how he is going to implement it.  I would have thought it would cause him great difficulty to implement DIRT tax on foreign bank accounts.  I do not believe it is practical. A lot of the money going into those bank accounts will be &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money which is <Col N="361" /> placed there already.  I doubt if the Minister finds that this is a source of revenue for him at all.  It is an optimistic assertion, but I would like to know actually how it is going to be implemented.</P>
    <P>There are several other questions which I would like to ask the Minister, but I will leave them until later.  I would like, on Second Stage, to say something about the Central Bank and the policing of exchange controls.  It is not my intention in any way to question the integrity, the ability or the good intentions of the Central Bank.  I note from the document I have here, the Central Bank's summary of exchange control notices, that it delegates the policing of these measures to various authorities.  It seems to me that whereas in many cases, including the case of unit trusts, including this case and many other financial instruments, we have delegated this power to the Central Bank to police these areas, the Central Bank immediately &mdash; through no fault of its own &mdash; re-delegates them to somebody else.  It seems that it is no coincidence &mdash; and the Minister can correct me on this &mdash; that there have been no prosecutions whatsoever under the Exchange Control Regulations since 1979.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to be alarmist about breaches of exchange control rules.  I certainly do not want to be but it is inconceivable that there have not been several serious breaches which have not been detected.  These breaches may not be intentional.  In the early imposition of the rules in 1979 nobody knew what they were.  Those to whom that authority was delegated by the Central Bank did not know what the rules were which they were meant to be imposing at the time. As a result of this, there was a certain amount of regulatory chaos in the financial markets as we settled down to get used to the new financial system and environment in which we were working. The symptom of the real difficulties we were working under was that nobody ever appears to have been reported to the Central Bank &mdash; and in many cases they do not have to be referred to the Central Bank &mdash; and no action appears to have been taken against offenders.  The only <Col N="362" /> conclusion I can draw from that is either that there were no offenders, which I do not believe, or that there is not the manpower to police these rules.</P>
    <P>The Minister might ease some of the fears of some Members of this House and some members of the financial community in giving the House some reassurance that these rules and other similar rules will be policed better in the future. It is a difficulty we have with the Unit Trust Bill as well which is coming before us on Thursday.  Whereas the Central Bank is given more power, it does not seem to have the will or the resources to exercise that power.  Whereas it is delegated to the banks, financial institutions, authorised agents and authorised dealers in the cases of exchange control, it does not seem those delegates were able or willing to take the measures to enforce these very serious rules which the Minister is proposing to us today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill but it is a very important one.  It deserves debate.  Before making my own comments on it, this is the first time I have spoken since the new Clerk of the Seanad was appointed.  I would like to take this opportunity of putting on the record my appreciation of the privilege we have in this House of such an outstanding person becoming Clerk of the Seanad, and of the courtesy and help she has given us all.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with capital and controls over the movement of capital.  Capital is the symbol of wealth, just as the mineral resources are the basic source of wealth internationally.  We see this in all sorts of different ways, whether it is in the Bill before us today, in which we are continuing a degree of control over the movement of capital in and out of this country, or whether we consider a book such as Marx's <i>Das Kapital</i>, for so many years was read in many countries throughout the world.  We are looking at something very basic and very important.  It may be a brief Bill &mdash; two sections &mdash; but you can say a lot in a very small space, and this Bill says a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It says that this Act is going to continue <Col N="363" /> for another two years control over a basic part of our economic foundation.  It implies a lot by the fact that now at long last it has a time limit which is shorter than the routine extensions of four years. That also says an enormous amount about the economic development, the maturity and the ability of this country to compete which has developed over the past few years.</P>
    <P>We also see that this Bill is continuing on the Exchange Control Act, 1954, a time when most of the population of this country were not born.  Those years long ago were very much the days of exchange control.  Governments were under the illusion that they could in some manner attempt to control this basic economic matter of capital simply by saying: We will pass regulations to control it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe referred in a jocose but also a serious manner to the difficulty in practice to sustain such controls. Even to this day in many parts of the world they are evaded.  The damage which exchange controls have done during the years to the economies of countries must be enormous.  They are always imposed with the best of intentions but usually they have the reverse effect.  I am delighted to see that at long last, even though it will be two years into the future, we intend to abolish them completely.  Over the past three years we have been quite rapidly dismantling them and not only have there been few, if any, negative effects but there have been a number of positive ones.</P>
    <P>The general principle of attempting to control exchange is very attractive in that in some way or other we could control our capital and let other people come in and invest here, but not let our own citizens move their money and invest it elsewhere.  If our small company were to adopt that attitude in overall terms, the tuppence-worth of capital we might export elsewhere would not be of the slightest relevance when what, in practice, we would be doing would be discouraging everyone else from investing in this country.  We would discourage them from setting up enterprises and creating <Col N="364" /> jobs in this country.  That would be the ultimate effect.  The short term effect would be very attractive but the long term effect could be disastrous to our economy and to the economies of countries that have attempted to maintain exchange controls.</P>
    <P>For many years we had, effectively, a free currency between ourselves and the United Kingdom, and we succeeded very well.  The circumstances were unusual, but we succeeded very well during that period.  The United Kingdom, tried to maintain exchange controls as was the great fashion of the fifties.  The socialist idea was that in some sense or other if you had controls on capital that prevented it from leaving the country and you could improve your economy and hold it in, but it never worked out that way.  They had people who walked out with suitcases full of money and other more sophisticated electronic methods were used.  People will not put money in if there is the slightest question in the mind of an outside person that in some manner or means his capital may not be retrievable.  There is no way in which he or she will invest in that country or jurisdiction in such circumstances.  If we are going to say to our own citizens: &ldquo;You can only invest in Ireland&rdquo; that is a very narrow and, ultimately, a self-defeating attitude.  It is very attractive in some ways, but the ultimate effects are disastrous.</P>
    <P>We are seeing some of those effects in eastern Europe today.  We have read about it.  Those of us who have visited there realise that their roubles and zlotys are worthless to the unfortunate citizens of those countries.  They will give almost anything for any foreign currency at all.</P>
    <P>The artificial control which they had over exchange control resulted in the ruination of their economy, their jobs, the competitive structure of their industry and that catastrophic effect is getting worse every year.  In the short term exchange controls have a certain attractiveness. If you want to control your economy or, in the case of a very weak economy, it would be very attractive to say that we will maintain controls and not <Col N="365" /> allow people to move capital from a weak or controlled economy but it does not work that way.  Usually the capital leaves and the economy collapses, rapidly or slowly as the case may be, but inevitably it collapses.</P>
    <P>It is hard to realise that less than 100 years ago Switzerland was regarded as the poor country of Europe.  People made sneering jokes about the Swiss and the land of the cowbells and so on.  Switzerland has continued to develp its economy. It took some very far-sighted and sensible decisions which at the time were revolutionary and totally outside the general fashionable attitude.  One of them basically was that capital would move freely, that they would not have exchange control regulations.  Today it is difficult to realise that this was the position.  It is difficult to even consider that Switzerland would require exchange control regulations. If there is any country in the world into which people want to put money, it is probably Switzerland. Money can be moved more freely from there than from any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>Of course, Switzerland is a very effective, economically competitive and prosperous country with one of the highest living standards in the world.  But let us not think of it as just being a very unusual example, that a country like Switzerland has some magic, that it is situated in the centre of Europe and that is has a very sophisticated population.  We can take a totally different example.</P>
    <P>We tend to think of the poverty of Asia.  God knows, it is bad enough there with people literally starving to death but there are a few examples where it is not so, where they have economies that are not only thriving but are highly competitive and that are attracting capital. One very obvious example is Hong Kong. Again, some 20 or 30 years ago it was almost a joke to say, &ldquo;Made in Hong Kong&rdquo; but it is very different today. Today the worry for that huge country, China, is whether in its takeover of Hong Kong, it can somehow manage to balance the benefits of a free economy, of an economy where perhaps the main feature <Col N="366" /> is the absence of exchange controls.  To this very day, even though it will be returned to China in 1997, people are still investing money in Hong Kong.</P>
    <P>One can take very different examples. One saying that is consistent is that if you do not have exchange controls you have a hope of a prosperous economy, that it certainly does not hurt the economy.  If you have exchange controls, usually there is no benefit to the economy and it may hurt it very severely.  It is not an easy thing to do.  There is a vicious circle.  If the economy is weak, the temptation is to make exchange controls even more stringent, the economy gets weaker so you are more afraid to relax your controls.</P>
    <P>One of the tremendous things that has occurred over the past two or three years is that at long last we have begun to get our economic basis and our financial controls right and to have some hope of competing.  If we can continue that process, there is no reason Ireland should not be a very prosperous country, one of the few countries in western Europe where one could genuinely come close to full employment.  It seems something one dare not even dream of today but if we could get our economy right, if we could be competitive, if we could be up there in the upper market niche, we would have a tremendous opportunity.</P>
    <P>Short as this Bill is, it is a crucial and essential move in the direction of at least allowing the possibility of our economy developing and our young people having the sort of jobs which they are perfectly capable of carrying out and which they do in many economies throughout the world.  However, they must have the chance to compete.  This Bill today, abstruce though it may seem, brief though it may seem, technical though it may seem, it is an essential component of this move forward and I am delighted to welcome it today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the legislation we are dealing with today, it seems to be somewhat unnecesary that we have been listening to Government Ministers and to those who know the economic <Col N="367" /> scene telling us about the need to prepare for 1992.  It appears unnecessary to have a further two years of exchange controls. I do not see any reason given in the Minister's speech for not moving straight into the position where we hope to be in 1992.  The reality is that in many ways we have been sold a pup on the whole question of exchange controls, the need to have controls over capital movement and so on.</P>
      <P>There are three or four different perspectives here.  The reality is that if one walks into a bank tomorrow morning to open a bank account, despite the fact that one might have a broad Kerry, Donegal or Sligo accent, the first thing one will be asked is if one is a resident or non-resident. To me that is answer enough to the way this legislation, the laws governing finances and the movement of capital from one country to another in the Community are being flouted.  We do not have any control and we ceased a long time ago to have control over the outflow or movement of capital from this country to any other country in the Community. We appear to have control but it has never really affected those people who wanted, for whatever reason, to move money in or out of the country.</P>
      <P>It might also be worthwhile bringing to the Minister's attention that some of the banks in Ireland at the moment are providing special deals for non-residents &mdash; when I say non-residents I mean people who live outside the jurisdiction with large buckets of loose money which they need to place in one way or another. Many banks are now preparing special deals for some of those people.  I also understand &mdash; and I ask the Minister to respond to this &mdash; that in many cases non-residents who lodge money in non-resident accounts in the Republic, in the event of the account holder becoming deceased, the money can be paid straight back into the estate of the main beneficiary without going through the normal probate arrangements.  What is the precise position on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always held the view that the same law should apply to all aspects of <Col N="368" /> the Community.  Is it the position now that a non-resident, because he or she happens to live along the Border &mdash; and that is precisely the issue I am dealing with at the moment &mdash; can open a non-resident's account in the State and in the event of the death of the account holder that money is paid directly into the estate of the main beneficiary of the non-resident account holder, without going through any of the Irish probate laws? How is that controlled?  Who controls that?  When is it controlled?  Which jurisdiction controls that kind of an arrangement? I do not understand how it can operate and it seems to go against all we understand.</P>
    <P>The main question to be raised from this legislation is that the Treaty of Rome is now a number of years old and the first issue the Treaty of Rome dealt with was the free movement of capital.  People might wonder why I am raising the need for the free movement of capital.  I raise it because in the trade union movement we have been misled down through the years about all the different things that affect the movement of capital, interest rates and inflation.  The reality is that as and from 1992 only one issue will affect our interest rates and that will be the movement of capital.</P>
    <P>We have the outflow of capital from the reserves at the moment and if that continues it will eventually affect the interest rates.  Nothing else will affect them.  We have seen an economic equation in which the variables have been held constant and after all we heard ten years ago about the need to get our inflation rate down to controllable levels, we have now the lowest inflation rate in Europe.  Nevertheless, our interest rate will be determined, not by our inflation rate at the moment, but simply by the movement of capital within and between the states in the European Community and the sooner we get into that position the better.</P>
    <P>Let us call a spade a spade, know exactly where we are going and attempt to control it at that point.  In doing that we will be in a position of strength because I believe the Irish economy has come <Col N="369" /> round, not least because of the major investment made by the social partners in the Government policy over the last three years, and we are now in a position where we can reap the benefits.  We do not need this kind of protection which, at the end of the day, is not in anybody's best interests.</P>
    <P>Are the Government afraid to deal with this issue?  Why do they need two more years of exchange controls?  As Senator Conroy said, if the Hong Kong experience is such a good one and if they have free movement why can we not do the same?  I have not heard an explanation of the need for this legislation. Government Ministers are going around the country telling us of the need to be prepared for 1992.  Is it not a fact that this legislation is contrary to what we are trying to achieve in 1992?  It slows down the operation; 1992 is not the time when things will happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, speaking in this House less than a year ago made it very clear that we are talking of changes that will take place before 1992 or changes which will have taken place by 1992 but the thrust is changing.  The thrust in this legislation is that we should hold everything until 1992 and then make the changes.  That was not what we had in mind when we discussed the Cecchini report and the other reports on a new and full market.  We did not have those things in mind.  We believed we would make the changes in the meantime.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill for those with millions. This is legislation to look after the wealthy. I do not see anything in it for the poor of the country, long term, short term or medium term.  The sooner we get involved economically to the full extent in the European Community the better off our people will be.  I have asked time and again that we make very definite connections and relationships with other aspects of the European Community. The Belgian economy is a very small one, somewhat like our own.  Two years ago the Belgian Government decided they would align their exchange mechanism and exchange changes with the Deutsche <Col N="370" /> Mark and I believe we should do something similiar.  Why do we not tie ourselves into the strong currencies?  Why do we not tie ourselves into the major movements and the major influencing currencies in the world?  That is open to us at this stage and we should do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is telling us, in different words, that we are moving towards a European central bank.  I do not know how that will operate.  I do not understand how a European central bank will work in terms of the requirement that national government would have certain inputs and influences over what happens to the currency.  Nevertheless, in the past week an Inter-governmental Committee was set up to work at precisely achieving that.  However, is it not fair to say that this Bill is working precisely in the opposite direction to the proposal the Taoiseach outlined following the meeting in Rome at the weekend.  That is my reading of it. I cannot understand it any other way.</P>
    <P>It appears we are running scared from this issue.  We need to loosen things, not to tighten things.  We have now got a strong economy, small but strong.  We have an economy that will have to take its place in the Europe of 1992 and we are better off doing so now than waiting until everything is in place in two or three years' time.  This Bill is regressive.  Normally these arrangements are put into place for four years but this time the Minister is asking that it be for two years. Why do it for two years?  Why not just take away the legislation or do it for a year or six months?  Why do it right up until 1992?  The Minister is creating another &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; situation where everything changes in 1992.  Let us get in there before the others.  Let us anticipate events before they happen.</P>
    <P>We should think again about the need to have such strict controls in place over the next two years when the trend is towards the breaking down of all controls, in every other aspect.  The Minister will be talking next month about the need to bring our VAT arrangements into line with the rest of Europe.  He mentioned the need to have the deposit interest retention tax brought into line and <Col N="371" /> changed, amended and modified.  I completely agree with this.  These are the kind of measures we would prefer to hear from the Minister today.  There will be enough change in 1992.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have heard about the changes that must take place before 1992.  This is a reversal of Government policy because what the Minister is doing here is ensuring that there will not be any changes before 1992.  In fact, he is saying that we should put everything on hold until then and let us all fall into the milieu of European currency exchange controls and capital movement at that time over which there will be no control.  Why drop all our defences at that time?  Why not move towards it between now and then? I fail to see the need for this legislation at this time.</P>

I do not mean in any way to be churlish or petty about his comments but I could not help but pick up one or two little pearls of wisdom.  For example, Senator O'Toole said there was nothing in this legislation for the poor.  He then went on to berate the Government for not moving towards the completion of the internal market faster and creating a better economic climate.  I would have thought that much of this legislation is about creating a better economic climate and that ultimately it would help the poor, at least that would be my interpretation of it.  I <Col N="372" /> could not help but think that perhaps there were people like Senator O'Toole many years ago in Japan, Malaysia and Hong Kong and, even as Senator Conroy said earlier, in Switzerland, who were prophets of doom and who berated their Governments for introducing legislation of a financial nature on the grounds that it would not help the poor.</P>

      <P>I will address the comments about non-resident accounts. Great strides have been made by the financial institutions here to attract non-resident accounts into this country and so benefit the economy as a whole.  As <Col N="373" /> someone who lived outside this country for several years and who did not have a non-resident account but who is familiar with many people who have such accounts.  I would have to advise caution in the area of suggesting that there should be any proposal regarding further controls in this area.  For example, one of the questions raised by Senator O'Toole was according to his information why on the death of the holder of a non-resident account the money in their account would go back to the estate without the normal probate process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At least that was my interpretation of what he said but I will bow to the Senator's comments.  It was certainly my interpretation that he was questioning the money going back to the estate.  All I wanted to say on that point was that if any suggestion emanated from this Chamber and found its way to the UK, where much of the non-resident money lodged in this country comes from, those people would run scared and pull their money out.  It has always been a problem wherever questions of mobility of finance is concerned, that the people who have the finance usually like to have reasonably cast iron guarantees about their money going into accounts, particularly overseas accounts.  While I would like to think that most former Irish residents would have an altruistic approach to putting their money into Irish banking circles, the sad reality is that they go wherever the highest interest rates are, wherever the money is guaranteed, wherever the confidentiality is guaranteed and, importantly, wherever the withdrawal process is simple and straightforward. It is important that I should make those points and if I misunderstood the Senator I am certainly not being malicious or mischievous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about one or two aspects of this legislation.  For example in relation to the definition of &ldquo;short term securities&rdquo;, I understand that under the proposed regulations potential investors may not be permitted to invest their <Col N="374" /> money in futures funds, particularly those carrying promissory notes.  I am referring to an increasing number of such funds which are high risk but in order to attract nervous investors, 60 per cent or thereabouts of the principal is invested under a promissory note guaranteeing the original sum invested.  Those funds have a lifespan of approximately five to seven years, at the end of which the original investor will most certainly have their original sum invested returned to them but due to the nature of those funds they are high risk and extremely speculative. Of course, over a period of five to seven years, taking inflation into account, even though they do get a guarantee of the return of their principal, in real terms their money value has reduced considerably.</P>
    <P>I understand that under the proposed Bill such funds are being referred to as &ldquo;short term securities&rdquo; when plainly they are far from that and have attached to them a high element of risk and speculation. In that context I suggest to the Minister that since the original 1954 Act, and even the more recent Act of 1978 were passed, the financial markets have changed drastically.  The futures markets are now the norm or certainly are increasingly seen as the outlet for most investors' funds.  They will increasingly be the method used by investors as the decade continues and into the next century. Consequently, I would be grateful if the Minister would address himself to this seeming anomaly in the legislation and recognise the futures fund as a short term security.  It seems from the information available to me that there is some confusion in this legislation and with the changes as I have outlined regarding futures funds, the legislation does not clarify the matter and the term &ldquo;fund&rdquo; is not actually used in the original legislation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister will permit investors to acquire futures and options on foreign securities for hedging purposes but the information available to me suggests that brokers are experiencing difficulties with the Central Bank in allowing investment on futures funds <Col N="375" /> for hedging purposes as well.  This is an area which, in the context of the proposed legislation, the Minister might examine. It seems it is causing some difficulties with the financial houses here.  I am not a financial expert but it was explained to me that if one, for example, were to purchase dollars for futures purposes and that the dollar, as it has been for some time, was rather volatile and therefore the value of the investment would be extremely volatile, depending on the ups and downs of the dollar, under this legislation one will be allowed, to use the financial term, &ldquo;go long or short on the dollar&rdquo;.  However, one would not be allowed to take one's money out of dollars and put it into another futures funds for hedging purposes.  That is a rather technical matter but this Bill is of a technical nature.  That certainly has a bearing on the motivation of potential investors and brokers would be anxious if, for example, the terminology was to be clarified and the question of funds would be treated as short term securities.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to encourage the Minister in his efforts to increase the trading capacity of the Financial Services Centre.  One positive initiative would be expeditious setting up of more managed futures funds.</P>
    <P>The Financial Services Centre has been moving along in a very encouraging manner since it was first mooted.  It is always a pleasure to note, as someone coming up from the country and passing that location twice a week, that practically every week there is some additional building there.  Those buildings house important financial institutions and we hear ongoing announcements from the Department of Finance, through the Minister for Finance, of yet further acquisitions and further locations in the financial centre.  All of this is to be encouraged and, indeed, this debate is an opportunity for me to single out the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance and all of the Ministers there who, along with the Taoiseach, took this <Col N="376" /> initiative some years ago.  It is obviously now beginning to bear fruit.</P>
    <P>In the context of the ongoing development of the Financial Services Centre, Ireland is the ideal and preferred location by many international futures traders. However, some foot-dragging, permitting the expansion of several important managed futures funds has resulted in fund managers looking to other locations, particularly the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and, more recently Luxembourg.  I am sure the Minister is aware that Luxembourg is seen as being in direct competition with this country in attracting more managed funds and especially managed future funds.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting in any way that the alleged foot-dragging is in any way malicious or mischievous.  Perhaps within the overall scheme of things, the general development of the Financial Services Centres and the speed at which many of the innovations have been executed, the question of the managed futures funds has been put on the back burner.  I am attempting here to articulate the views of people in financial services in this city towards expediting the setting up of those particular funds.  I would like to impress upon the Minister the need for urgency in this area.  With the speedy and orderly development of several managed futures funds, the resultant increased financial activity will generate hundreds of new jobs and facilitate the setting up of an international futures trading exchange which would most definitely put Dublin and Ireland on the international financial services map.  Here, again, is another response to my distinguished colleague Senator O'Toole.  I am not sure whether he would class people working in the Financial Services Centre as being poor but certainly if there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Those working on the building certainly are poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is a valuable, ongoing and expansive outlet for talented young people who wish to spend their careers in financial services without <Col N="377" /> having to leave this country, as many of them have done over the last decade and have found fame, fortune and glory in the London Financial Services Centre and elsewhere, then I welcome any development which would encourage them and create more jobs in the Financial Services Centre.  It is in that context that I make the point that the expeditious establishment of more managed funds in the Financial Services Centre, with the relaxation proposals in this legislation, would result, ultimately, in more jobs in that part of Dublin and, of course, would benefit the economy generally.</P>
      <P>In general terms, like my colleagues on all sides of the House, I welcome this latest easing of exchange control regulations. I do not believe that it would be in the best interest of this country that exchange controls should be totally liberalised at present.  The Government have chosen a wise and prudent road towards the ultimate easing of the remaining exchange control regulations. Certainly, like many Members on both sides of the House &mdash; indeed Senator Doyle in her initial address referred to the possibility of an increase in interest rates &mdash; I believe that speculations of the type which we have seen in the last couple of days, and especially today, in relation to a proposed hike in interest rates by the Central Bank, are not helpful.  It is not at all helpful that we should be subjected to this type of speculation in unpublished figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that the Government operate on the most recent Central Bank figures for external reserves, which were published at the end of October when the reserves stood at £3.7 billion. The speculative nature of new accounts which indicate that the external reserves have now been reduced as a result of the outflow of funds in the last six to eight weeks, will necessitate an interest rate hike, which is not helpful.  Certainly in the week before Christmas I would urge the Minister &mdash; I do not think he needs urging &mdash; to dampen down this speculation in the interest of our image abroad. More importantly, the knock-on effect of any interest rate hike by the Central Bank <Col N="378" /> would be an increase in mortgage rates. Considering the downward spiral of mortgage and interest rates in the last 12 months it would certainly take away Santa Claus's big day if we were to be faced with the possibility of a mortgage increase in the days leading up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the thrust and the content of the Bill and I look forward to seeing the Minister introduce further Bills of this nature between now and 1992 to bring us into line with the hopeful expansion and completion of the internal market.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my thanks to the Senators who have spoken for their constructive contribution to the debate on this Bill.  The Bill, as has been pointed out by a number of speakers, is essentially a technical one but it does provoke thought about the wide setting in which it is embedded, namely, the Single European Community Market and the EMU.  Certainly it was very gratifying to note that the Senators saw the Bill in this context and that they showed such a keen appreciation of the major issues involved in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I will endeavour in the time at my disposal, to deal with some of the points raised.  May I refer to Senator O'Toole and say that while we have 1992 and the legislation, we would be anxious to proceed as speedily as possible within that time frame&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to help you with an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel an amendment is really necessary.  A number of speakers dealt at length with the question of interest rates.  The level of interest rates is, of course, primarily a matter for the Central Bank in their efforts to maintain a firm exchange rate policy within the European Monetary System.  It is the <Col N="379" /> bank's principal concern, and it will seek to keep the level of interest rates as low as possible, consistent with that aim.  In the day-to-day management of interest rates the bank must take into account a number of factors, including the level of official external reserves, currency movements and credit growth.  In the final analysis, however, interest rates are determined by the market and the Central Bank cannot hold rates at any particular level against the established market trends.</P>
      <P>Recent events in regard to European interest rates have put pressure on Irish interest rates.  For example, key German, Belgian and Dutch money market interest rates have all increased by about one percentage point or more, since the end of October.  As a result, the Dublin bank rates have increased sharply in recent days.  The Government do, of course, play an important role in relation to interest rates.  That role is to provide sound and effective management of the economy and of public finances.  In so doing, they will foster the confidence necessary to support the strong exchange rate policy which will continue to attract overseas investment and persuade domestic savers to invest at home.</P>
      <P>A continuing adequate level of investment here is, of course, vital to the maintenance of low interest rates.  The measure of the success of the kind of policies being implemented is the performance of Irish market rates since 1987 relative to those in other countries.  It may be important to indicate these.  In March 1987 &mdash; to take the key three-month rate as the example &mdash; Irish interest rates were about 9 per cent higher than the corresponding German rate.  This differential has been reduced to less than 2 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The corresponding differential between Irish and UK rates has also improved by about six percentage points, with the result that Irish rates are now considerably lower than UK ones. <Col N="380" /> Of course, as you know, it will put us in a much better competitive position to deal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>Senator, allow the Minister to continue without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the specific impact which the liberalisation of exchange controls has had and will have on the external reserves and, hence, on interest rates.  The removal of restrictions on foreign security investments in 1989 undoubtedly led to outflows as investors moved to restructure their portfolios. However, there was a welcome reversal of this trend this year when the easing of controls on non-resident deposits with Irish financial institutions led to very substantial inflows.  We cannot say to what extent these movements of capital contributed to interest rate increases in 1989 or, indeed, to reductions in 1990, since it is impossible to divorce their effects from other factors, both international and domestic, which affect the level of reserves.  There was, for example, a strong trend towards higher interest rates in Europe generally in 1989.  The Irish interest rates were influenced by this.</P>
      <P>What we can say is that, since the major relaxation of exchange controls on 1 January 1989, differentials between Irish interest rates and rates in some low interest rate EMS countries have fallen. For example, Irish three-month interbank rates during this period have fallen, relative to corresponding rates in Germany and the Netherlands, by about 1.25 and 1 per cent respectively.  In the same way, it is impossible to quantify the effects which the complete removal of exchange controls will have on interest rates in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the new situation will undoubtedly increase still further the potential for capital to flow into and out of the country.  In so doing, it will impose <Col N="381" /> new disciplines on our management of the economy.  These are disciplines which we certainly do not wish to shirk from or will not shirk from.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross wondered why we have allowed our residents to invest in longer term foreign securities, for example, in shares and bonds while not permitting them free access to short term securities or allowing them to place bank deposits abroad.  You will appreciate that these short term capital movements have greater potential for allowing speculation against a currency particularly when the exchange rate may be under pressure.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to the time frames and sought confirmation that in the post-1992 situation the distinction between time frames for particular capital movements will disappear.  I can confirm that.  The point I want to make is that, when controls have been fully dismantled by the end of 1992, freedom of capital movement will apply to all investments, irrespective of maturity.  We have dealt first with the shorter-term ones and we will deal with this on a step-by-step basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>You imposed a new five year limit in your Bill.  Why bother for three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Dismantling will be on a phase-by-phase basis, dealing with the ones which are easier to deal with, initially, and then coming to those that create the greatest problems for us. Senator Ross and others mentioned DIRT tax and personal foreign currency accounts.  The present DIRT tax applies to all Irish currency accounts held by Irish residents, whether by companies or individuals.  Foreign currency accounts can only be held by non-residents of Irish resident companies which are operating for trade purposes only and DIRT does not apply in either case.  Under the next phase of the abolition of exchange controls, Irish resident individuals who at present cannot open foreign currency accounts will be permitted to open foreign currency accounts with Irish institutions, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> No change is proposed at this point in the ability of Irish companies to operate foreign currency accounts.  They will still be confined to accounts for trade purposes since interest on foreign currency accounts is not subject to DIRT tax.  Permitting resident Irish individuals to open foreign currency accounts with Irish institutions could, under present legislation, lead to tax evasion.  In order to prevent such evasion, interest on personal foreign currency accounts must be made subject to DIRT tax and provisions for the application of DIRT tax will be made in the 1991 Finance Bill.  Permission for the opening of new accounts will not be introduced until after enactment of the Bill which is expected to take place at the end of May.</P>
    <P>Foreign curency accounts held by non-residents or by Irish companies for trade purposes will remain free of DIRT tax. Application of DIRT tax to the new personal foreign currency accounts will not change the position in regard to these accounts.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross and others referred to the policing of exchange controls by the Central Bank.  They seem to be suggesting that additional resources are necessary in this regard.  Senator Ross also referred to the reliance by the Central Bank on authorised dealers, approved agents and others to implement the controls.  The 1954 Act provided for the delegation of powers by the Minister and, in turn, for the Minister to authorise the delegation of powers under the Act to other persons.  The provision was necessary to enable normal day-to-day transactions to be undertaken.  Indeed the Exchange Control Regulations, 1959, gave general exemptions from the requirement for virtually every foreign exchange transaction to be referred in advance to the Minister for Finance, a draconian method of doing business.</P>
    <P>In the powers delegated to the Central Bank in 1965 the Minister authorised the bank to delegate powers in consultation with the Minister, to bankers, etc., and I am sure the Senator would not wish to see a return to the situation where each and every transaction would be referred <Col N="383" /> in advance to the Central Bank.  I do not think that that would be the Senator's intention.</P>
    <P>With regard to resources, it is beyond question that exchange controls are being phased out.  In February of this year the Minister announced a series of administrative changes to reduce the bureaucracy and it resulted in a reduction in the number of exchange control forms from 17 to five.  The consequent reduction in correspondence regarding exchange controls with which the Central Bank has to deal, has enabled the bank to apply staff resources towards monitoring the important aspects of the remaining controls and towards carrying out the various additional and very important functions allotted to it by the Oireachtas under the Central Banks Act, 1989, the Building Societies Act, 1989 and the Undertakings for Collective Investment Regulations, 1989.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to safeguard measures which would be available in the future.  These will permit us to reintroduce certain exchange controls for temporary periods, in the event of, for instance, a severe balance of payments crisis, or short term capital outflows which necessitated action and which were imposing strains on the efficient operation of the exchange rate policy generally.  In this kind of situation it would be envisaged that temporary controls would be put in place.  While the directive indicates that the approval of the European Commission at the Council of Ministers will be necessary for such measures, this cannot necessarily be secured in retrospect.  If we need to take action as a matter of urgency, we would of course ensure that the measures will not become&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Government would determine the urgency.  I am confident anyway that if we can continue the same effective management of the economy, we shall continue to maintain <Col N="384" /> the progressive developments we have seen in this economy over the past few years and this would not then be necessary.</P>
      <P>I have covered most of the points that have been raised.  I would like to thank the Senators for the very constructive comments made here this afternoon on what is a very detailed and technical measure which raised many issues we had to deal with in the time at our disposal.</P>

      <P>You will recall that when I was speaking on the Bill I raised the issue of why we needed this legislation at all.  I listened very carefully to what the people on the far side of the House and to what the Minister said and I certainly would like to put a few points to the Minister.  First, I would like to deal with the major point my esteemed colleague, Senator Mooney, raised, in his contribution, namely, the need for expatriates living in the UK to have confidence in the Irish system, etc.  I would like to point out &mdash; and I would ask the Minister to verify and confirm this to Senator Mooney, &mdash; that nothing on this legislation will have any effect on non-residents who have money invested in this country.  Perhaps I misunderstand the legislation.  If that is the case, then I need to be informed about it.  My understanding is that all those Irish people, who for altruistic reasons or otherwise, decide to invest in this country can invest or withdraw their money at any stage and this legislation does not affect that.  Therefore, it was an irrelevancy, Senator Mooney, similar to much of the stuff you said earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is precisely the amendment and this is the reason for it.  I am trying to win support from the Government benches.  The other issue I would like to raise &mdash; I want to demolish the arguments given for the need for the legislation so far &mdash; is this discussion on non-residential money.  It is the same issue, basically, which Senator Mooney raised under another heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>You raised it.  I responded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Conroy raised it in particular in his references to Hong Kong.  It is my understanding that nothing in this legislation will affect those non-residents who wish to withdraw their money from the State.  It is also my understanding that a lot of the money that is moving in and out at the moment is such money.  I would like to understand why we need this legislation.  It does not cover any of those things.</P>
      <P>The other total irrelevancy is the Minister's reference to budget proposals. What is the relevance of budget proposals to this legislation?  Is it not fair to say that all the matters which the Minister has promised to introduce in the budget can be done without having this legislation in place?  Is that not a fact?</P>
      <P>This legislation is irrelevant to the worthiest of proposals which we have all agreed upon and which the Minister says he will introduce in the budget.  We welcome them and look forward to their being put into operation but they have no connection with this Bill.  The only change contained in this legislation is the continuation of the older exchange control. I am unconvinced that we need this legislation.  Certainly I have not heard the arguments for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I return to the basic point, which is that all of this is going to change in 1992.  The Government's own policy is to have our <Col N="386" /> changes in place before 1992.  I have gone to the last possible date before 1992, to the 31 December 1991.  I could not go any later than that.  We will have everything in position and in place for 1992. Therefore, I say to the Minister that even though I consider this legislation unnecessary, accepting that there is a need for a smooth changeover and to allow us to move things into place, let us get it done for 1991.  We have a year and two months to make whatever changes need to be made.  I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make refers to one the Minister himself made in his closing speech.  This confirms my view on this amendment.  The Minister said that in 1987 we had a very high inflation rate and that we now have a very low inflation rate.  What is the relevance of that to this legislation?  The low inflation rate that we have at the moment is producing a low interest rate, which has resulted in turn in money flowing out of the country.  I am not saying whether that is good or bad; I am making a statement of fact.  It has no relevance to this legislation and there is nothing in the legislation to deal with that.  As Senator Doyle so wisely said, it will be the European Central Bank that will be calling the shots when we come to 1992.  Let us get used to playing with the big boys, let us get this legislation into place and get our act together for 1992.  Let us do as the Taoiseach has asked us to do, which is to get the changes made before 1992.  There is no need to wait that long.  I am prepared to compromise and to say let us work it for a year instead of two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, by way of discussion and to extract from the Minister a rational explanation as to why we should not be phasing in full capital liberalisation slightly more quickly, I will support the amendment.  When one looks to the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the original Bill, one is reminded that the Exchange Control Act, 1954, 36 years ago, was originally given a life of four years.  It was indicated quite clearly at the time that the intention <Col N="387" /> was to dispense with the exchange controls. Since 1954, in phases of four years and now in two years, we have extended the life of the Exchange Control Regulations. I am concerned about going to the wire and then dropping all remaining controls because we really do not know, two years ahead, what we will be faced with in terms of the external financial climate, and what internal pressures may be upon us then.</P>
      <P>By way of debate, I support the amendment and I look forward to a reasoning from the Minister as to why, within the next 12 months, we should not phase out the last few remaining exchange control regulations that are in place.  The easier bits have been done.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The last few moves will be more difficult and will necessitate very strict economic controls from within, in terms of our own disciplines within this country and in terms of how we run the country and the economy generally.  Could the Minister please explain why we will leave it till we get right to the washer virtually to 1 January 1993, before we drop everything that is left?  Would it not be better to phase out in the next 12 months, so that we are up and running and know exactly what is before us, before 1 January 1993 is upon us?</P>

      <P>The Minister in his speech and the explanatory memorandum state that the Government are now committed to completing the elimination of exchange controls by the end of 1992. In the meantime a continuation of the legislation is required to allow the operation of the remaining controls that have yet to be dismantled.  Towards the end of his Second Stage speech the Minister said that even when full liberalisation has been achieved, &ldquo;it will still be necessary to have enabling legislation to allow the re-introduction of controls in an emergency situation, for example in a severe balance of payments crisis&rdquo;.  So where is there an elimination of the obligation on the Government or the Central Bank to continue to monitor exchange control?  I do not understand what the Senators' argument is at all.  The whole question of the liberalisation of exchange controls, notwithstanding the orginal motives of the Bill that it would only last for four years, centres on the fact that most of the momentum for the liberalisation of exchange controls only arose in the mid-eighties and that was within the European context and convergence.

      <P>We are not alone in attempting to ease in the exchange control regulations and attempting to liberalise our exchange controls pending 1992 and beyond.  Greece and Portugal, along with Spain, have also sought and been granted a derogation from the directive which was issued in 1987 and I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.  The Government are acting very responsibly in this whole area in terms of reducing what was a pillar of our entire financial and economic policy for the last 30 or more years and which was upheld and endorsed by successive administrations and not just by Fianna Fáil.  I do not see what the difficulty is now.  The Government are adopting a reasonably prudent and cautious attitude in an important area of our economy.  This is a spurious amendment, to introduce it in 1991, and I certainly would not be in favour of it.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this in my opening remarks.  When one is moving from a system of control to one which is unrestricted it is very advisable to do so in stages.  Anyone here would recommend that.  The issue between us is whether we should speed up the process and do it a year sooner than we had anticipated.  We have made very sizeable advances in the efforts we have been making but four packages of relaxations have been brought forward and we have made substantial progress in dismantling the controls.  We could argue here all night.  On the one hand, we can argue that we remove all the controls and get into the situation as speedily as possible and then leave ourselves in the situation where we do not have any controls and have interest crises developing.  Where do we find ourselves then?  I would expect Senator O'Toole would be arguing on my <Col N="390" /> side in this particular one.  This is why I find his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;contribution interesting because I would have expected him to say that in view of the fact that you could have unlimited outflows of capital from a country which could create enormous problem for us in a whole range of activities, including the social area, with which we are very deeply concerned.  Rather than arguing for speeding up this and leaving ourselves totally unprotected, he should be arguing in support of me to keep a system in place which would enable us to take remedial action quickly and decisively in the event of such action being needed quickly to avoid a situation which would put the economy at risk.  If we continue along the same lines as the Government has been going, the tight control of Government finances, careful and balanced development of our economy, it may be possible to speed up this process.  I do not advise that we should leave ourselves in a totally unprotected situation in the run-up to 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I disagree with the Minister.  We are, as you told us, the young Europeans.  Europe is out there waiting to be grabbed up by the young Irish, who are going to rule Europe.  Let us get in there and get in there quickly.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a couple of points. Obviously, Senator Mooney would like the controls to be limited around the time of the opening of the Ballyconnell Canal so that they would not create any local problems.  The Minister said in his speech:</P>
      <P>The Community Directive also included a safeguard clause that would allow member states to reintroduce controls on certain capital movements...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is fair enough and I thoroughly support that.  I thoroughly support the safety net.  I have always been in favour of that. We have a unique opportunity now.  We <Col N="391" /> can now experience what it is going to be like out there in the real world and we can do it a year earlier.  We can learn from our experience from 31 December 1991 right through 1992 what our needs are going to be and if there is going to be need for such legislation.  This will provide for us a unique learning experience.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to know why I feel this way I would ask him to listen closely while I read from his Second Stage speech.  I am trying to believe this.  I have to take the Minister's word that he believes this.  He said:</P>
    <P>There is also, of course, a very positive side.  An international perception of a control-free environment and the closer integration of the European market will enhance our attractiveness as an investment location.  Provided our policies are right, we can look forward to increased capital inflows, with obvious beneficial consequences for the economy.  The increase in holdings of overseas assets by Irish residents will also generate income from these assets in the years ahead.  Furthermore, our business and financial communities will be able to compete more effectively in international markets, as they secure to all the risk management techniques&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That will take place in 1992.  I accept that point.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>I cannot stress strongly enough that the most vital ingredient in our success in all of this will be the continued prudent management of the economy and of the public finances.</P>
    <P>The Minister is getting that right, with the co-operation of the social partners. Everything is in place, but the Minister is saying to us that we will not have these benefits for two more years.  What is he doing to us?  If it is going to be that good out there, let us get in there quickly.  Why is the Minister denying us all this wonder world that is there in front of us?  If it is going to be so good for the economy, let us do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> I do not understand what the delay is about.  The Minister's speech continues:</P>
    <P>It is essential that investors, both foreign and domestic, have good reason to be confident in our performance in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have the lowest inflation rate in Europe.  Now is the time to do it.  The Minister said so himself.  We have got control over the economy.  We are an attractive investment.  There is a world out there.  This is our Utopia.  Let us get in first before anybody else.  There seems to me to be no reason to delay if things are going to be so good and if our economy is now under control for the first time in years.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>In a situation of easier movement of capital, we would be punished very severely for any lapses.</P>
    <P>That is why we had better get it right. We have now an opportunity to have a year's practice so that we can make sure we get it right when everybody else joins the fray in 1992.  He said:</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, recognise that this new situation will impose new disciplines on our management of the public finances.  If we meet this challenge effectively, the potential benefits in the longer term will be very great indeed.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said to us.  It is on that basis that I say to the Minister: if it is going to be that good and if everything is there in front of us to do, let us go for it, let us take the ball and run.  It is there for us, a very short term indeed, so I would like the Minister to tell us why we need to delay all those benefits he listed out for us one after the other in his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to be frank with us this afternoon.  There is a very interesting amendment put and, in the absence of rational explanation from the Minister, we would have no option but to support it.  I feel the Minister could more rationally explain his point of view. Perhaps he is reticent, for whatever <Col N="393" /> reason.  Could it be that the reason the Minister feels we could not support an end-1991 completion of the liberalisation rather than the end-1992 he now proposes, is because he needs at least two more Finance Bills to put in place the pieces in Ireland that will to some extent protect the Exchequer from undue losses of revenue?</P>
      <P>For example, the Minister mentions in his speech that there will be changes in the Finance Bill, 1991 in relation to the DIRT tax.  How is the Minister going to retrieve retention tax from Irish depositors with money deposited in Europe?  I await his explanation.  I made that point in my Second Stage contribution.  It is laudable as an aspiration, but in reality how will it be done?  If the Minister does not do it and retention tax remains at 30 per cent, who is going to put money on deposit here when they can have it free of tax or at a much lower rate of retention tax in other European countries?  We have a figure of, I think, £650 million per annum on the losses in terms of harmonisation of VAT and excise.  What are we looking at in relation to harmonisation of DIRT or doing whatever else may be necessary in next year's Finance Bill, and perhaps the following year's Finance Bill, to minimise the losses to the Exchequer we are facing when exchange control regulations are lost in the retention tax area alone?</P>
      <P>There are other areas that do not immediately come to mind.  I am not an expert in this matter but that is one area where it is fairly plain to see we are going to have Exchequer losses.  Could the Minister explain what else he has hidden up his sleeve for the Finance Bill, 1991, and whether he also needs a stab at the 1992 Finance Bill before we can have complete liberalisation of capital and movement of capital within Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of an explanation as to why we cannot remove the last few pieces in the control regulations in this year, we will have to support the amendment.  If the Minister has a rational explanation why he needs two years &mdash; we understand the Minister needs an ordered withdrawal from the regulations that are there &mdash;<Col N="394" /> why leave it until we go to the wire, until literally 1 January 1993, when we really do not know what the overall economic climate will be within our outside this country?  We do not know what other pressures there may be by then.  We can determine to some extent what a year ahead holds, but we really do not know what two or three years down the road holds for us.  Therefore, we await rational explanations from the Minister as to why one more year would not be sufficient time to dismantle the regulations that remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, we have already moved faster than we were obliged to move.  That has been evidenced from the measures we have already taken and we are really not obliged to do it until 1992. I am running with the ball, as Senator O'Toole has advised me.  Certainly, we have taken measures which we believe are important to take but it is also vitally important that we have certain safeguards in place, otherwise we leave ourselves totally vulnerable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We do not throw the baby out with the bath water and leave ourselves in a totally helpless position without any safeguards in the events of the kind of situation I outlined in my speech this evening.

      <P>On a point of clarification &mdash; and know I am only repeating what the Minister has said &mdash; the Senator wanted one item in the exchange control area which could not be introduced by the beginning of 1991.  DIRT tax, specifically.  It is in the Minister's speech. He referred to the fact that there will be changes in the Finance Act, 1991, in relation to DIRT tax and the collection thereof once the liberalisation regime is in place which will allow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The whole thrust of this legislation is towards an easing of exchange controls regulations moving towards 1992.  I fail to understand the Senator.  I have to support the Minister in this area.  I believe the Senator is being totally mischievous.  I see absolutely no advantage, but serious economic disadvantages for this country if this amendment is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>To counter any loss of tax revenue. ...I propose, in the 1991 Finance Bill, to extend the deposit interest retention tax to cover interests from these...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Senator to look at the date, 1991.  That is done and that is the point I am making.  Let us hear what it is <Col N="396" /> that can only be done in 1992.  I welcomed that in my speech.  I said this is the way to do it, although, as Senator Doyle quite rightly pointed out, I am not sure how effective the collection is going to be. However, I accept that it is possible, particularly within the Community, to put in place something that will ensure the collection of it.  That is precisely the point.  The Minister is doing that in the Finance Bill and he expects it to be in operation by next May.</P>
    <P>The proposal I am making, through the Chair, to Senator Mooney is to take effect from 31 December 1991 after those things have taken place.  Perhaps there is a misunderstanding.  If the Minister can indicate to me some other changes he feels can only be put into place in 1922 which could not be put into place in 1991, then I am prepared to withdraw the amendment; but there is no sign of that. The Minister has not given me any indication of what they might be.  All he has indicated to me is the great, good world that will be out there when we move in after the dismantling of the control regulations.  If it is going to be that good, let us do it now.  Let us go in there and reap the benefit; it is going to be better for everybody.  As Senator Mooney said earlier, the poor will also benefit; because the poor will only benefit through an increased economy and the creation of more wealth that can be spread around and redistributed among the poor.  If the Minister can outline for me the measures which can only be put in place in 1992 which cannot be put in place in 1991, then I will withdraw the amendment, because I am a reasonable person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could add some further information to what I have already said.  One of the most significant controls still in place is the restriction on the operation by residents of current and deposit accounts abroad and the removal of this restriction would add to the potential for short term speculation against the IR £, particularly at times of exchange rate pressures.  It would also increase the possibility of tax evasion and consequent loss of revenue on undisclosed incomes. <Col N="397" /> This is something the Senator would not like to see happening.</P>
      <P>This is a problem which is exercising the minds of many other member states as well.  We are not the only member state that has concerns about these matters. We are in the Community.  Other member states are also making changes and are also considering issues like this which would cause concerns for them. We cannot be in a vulnerable position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the people we are competing with.  These are issues for which solutions will have to be found.  We are progressing satisfactorily.  But we cannot leave ourselves totally in a vulnerable situation in the run up to 1992.  That is why I feel the 1992 date is the most appropriate one and the one we should have.  We could continue this debate all night.  It is an academic and debating exercise here.  If that is what Senators want, we can continue that for the whole night.</P>

      <P>It is far from being an academic discussion or debating point. Both Senator O'Toole and I have each put at least twice, if not three times &mdash; I have lost count &mdash; a request that we be simply informed why we need two years to remove all remaining controls in the exchange regulation area instead of getting down to it in one year, given the enormous benefits the Minister has, quite rightly pointed out that will accrue to the country when they are removed.  We want a rational explanation, which I feel is there somewhere, for an orderly withdrawal within one year rather than two years.  I suspect, and I put it to the Minister, that two Finance Bills are needed to put in place whatever compensatory measures are necessary to protect an unnecessary loss to the Exchequer in different areas, such as in the retention tax area.  There are probably other areas I am not aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again repeat my request to the Minister to explain to us why we will leave it until the 11th hour until we get right to the wire, to virtually the end of 1992, to drop all remaining controls when we do not know what the economic climate, both internally and externally, will be at that stage.  Given that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, according to the Minister &mdash; I am inclined to suport that view and other very learned Members of the House have contributed along those <Col N="399" /> lines also &mdash; why do we not withdraw from the remaining controls by the end of 1991 rather than wait until the end of 1992?  If the Minister can explain to us the reasons why it could not be done, I am reasonable and I will accept.  But we have not got any explanation yet, because the 1991 Finance Bill, according to the Minister's script, is going to take care of the retention tax difficulties.  Are there other issues that will have to wait for 1992 and that cannot be introduced in 1991? If there are, would the Minister explain them to us?  If there are not, why do we not move towards removing all remaining controls by the end of 1991?</P>

      <P>I have nothing further to add to what I have already said on a number of occasions.  Moving from a system where we have had controls, very meaningful and essential controls, to a situation where we are going to have more, we run the risk of having a very sharp and injurious shock to the whole financial and economic system and leave ourselves in a position where we cannot take any action.

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a very brief question.  If, as I gather, the Minister does have residual powers under this Bill of altering exchange controls or loosening or tightening exchange controls as he feels is necessary, why should they not be brought in earlier rather than later?  It seems to me that the loosening of exchange controls is something about which everyone in this House agrees.  Therefore, it would seem that to loosen and lift exchange controls as far as possible would be beneficial.  With the residual powers the Minister for Finance <Col N="400" /> has he can then re-impose them if there is a panic or state of emergency in the financial market.  But the basic principle should be that they ought to be lifted as soon as possible.  This is what this amendment does.</P>

      <P>Could I just put on record the fact that I have now asked the Minister three times to outline the changes which have to be put in place in 1992 and which cannot be put in place in 1991?  I have offered to withdraw the amendment if he can list those changes. The Minister's response was, &ldquo;Are we going to make this a debating matter?&rdquo;  I am just asking for information which the Minister has not given me.  It would be a fine thing if the Minister said that he did not know what they are, or that nobody knows, that nobody had given it any thought.  But the Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot tell us, on the one hand, that it will be great if we make these changes and then, when I ask him to make them immediately, say that we cannot make them yet because we must do something else.  Would he tell us what the something else is?</P>
      <P>This Bill has only to do with short term movement.  People can invest long term or medium term, but it is not affected by this Bill.  Is that not a fact?  So the only people we are talking about are people who are exploiting fluctuations in interest rates.  Is it not a fact also that if we control the interest rates there is no longer going to be any need for the short term movement out of capital?  The reality is that all we need is to tie ourselves closer to the stronger currencies of the community. We are not doing ourselves any favour by waiting for two years.  I have asked the Minister to outline this.  We now understand how we can control the outflow &mdash; simply by containing the interest rate, because that is the issue for the short term movement.  The long term investment is related to the inflation rate, the economy and so on.  We have looked at everything here.  It is in a tight focus.  The only thing there for us to deal with is to move into it quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister rightly said, there is a <Col N="401" /> recognition that certain short term capital movements of an exceptional magnitude might need to be controlled, even in a border-free Europe or in an exchange control free Europe.  There would be nothing wrong with putting those controls in place over the year 1991-92 to see how they would work.  It is an ideal opportunity if you think it is necessary to control it but at the end of the day the Minister has not given me the simple piece of information which I have sought. We are talking here about the short term movement that arises from exploitation of a serious magnitude of the interest rate through the quick movement of capital out of the system.  That is what the Minister says is the issue.  We have looked at the need for that.  We have looked at where that arises, and it certainly arises in the interest rate.  The interest rate is something with which you can deal by tieing ourselves closer to the strong economies of Europe.  The Minister is telling us that everything is going to be well in 1992, that everything is going to be well in an exchange-free Europe.  The Minister listed all the good things that are going to happen to us when we break down those controls and barriers.  Everything is going to be OK.  But what is the Minister saying?  It is like the deferred kiss in the one act dramas of old.  Now he is saying, &ldquo;hang on, let us not do it yet.&rdquo;  So while the gurus of Europe are into instant gratification, we are still playing around with the deferred kiss.</P>

If you have listened to the monitor, a Chathaoirligh, you will have gathered that I have asked the Minister three times to outline for me <Col N="402" /> those issues which he feels can only be put in place in 1992.  It is fair to say that I also said that if he would list those for me I would withdraw the amendment. That is fair play.

      <P>This will be my last intervention on this amendment.  I want to impress upon Senator O'Toole and Senator Doyle that, irrespective of the verbal jousting, I believe the Minister in what he is saying.  I believe him, as I would any Minister in Finance who comes into this House, in the context of this legislation, having outlined lucidly and analytically the reasons why this Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill is being brought before the House at this time and within the time limit specified. Irrespective of the Government &mdash; and I mean this with the greatest of respect &mdash; in the context of the amendment before us, I would believe a Minister of State at the Department of Finance, with all the expertise available to him or her, before I would, with respect, believe Senator O'Toole or Senator Doyle or even my own better judgment.  In that context I must once again refer to the Minister's <Col N="403" /> Second Stage speech which convinced me of the soundness of the reasons he put forward.  He said that the Government were &ldquo;firmly committed to completing the liberalisation process by the end of 1992 at the latest.&rdquo;  Subsequently, he went on:</P>
      <P>In line with the terms of that Directive [the 1987 EC Directive], the eight stronger member states had achieved full capital liberalisation by July of this year.  Ireland, with Greece, Spain and Portugal, has until the end of 1992 to complete the process of dismantling its controls.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In adopting a programme to liberalise exchange controls, we did not do so with our eyes closed.  We knew that we would have to face certain risks.  Even allowing for the strengthening of economic and social cohesion within the Community, there will be greatly increased potential for capital outflows &mdash; particularly in the short term as investors seek to diversify their portfolios.</P>
      <P>Taking all of those together, with the greatest of respect to the Chair and to what has been contributed here, I believe that the House should accept what the Minister has put before us and that Senator O'Toole should withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>A final contribution on this if I may.  I am not quite sure exactly what Senator Mooney was inferring.  I always listen with interest to any Minister, particularly Minister Daly, whom I happen to know well.  It should not really be necessary for me or Senator O'Toole to say that the point we are making we make with conviction.  Having seconded the amendment, I am quite happy to withdraw it also if I am in a position to get the answers.  All we want to know is: what cannot be done in 1991 that can be done in 1992 in relation to the removal of the remaining elements of exchange control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> Senator Mooney implied in his contribution that he believed the Minister over and above the two of us.  It was put rather disparagingly.  I do not mind that, but I happen to have been a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance who steered the last debate on exchange control regulations through this House and through the Dáil, and I was in exactly the same position as Minister Daly is in here today.  I do not know much about this area.  I am not an expert.  I depended on the excellent briefing I always got &mdash; and I am sure Minister Daly gets &mdash; from the Civil Service at the time, but I have been over this course before. It is not through persistence or trying to be argumentative that I support the amendment put by Senator O'Toole. Given the enormous benefits that are to accrue to our country from full capital liberalisation and the total removal of the exchange controls, it is a reasonable suggestion that we get on with it by the end of next year rather than waiting for two years.  Apart from the reasonableness of that argument and given the benefits, I genuinely feel that leaving anything until the eleventh hour, until we actually reach the wire when we have to do it rather than when we can do it, is dangerous particularly in the economic area.  We are not sure what other controls or what other aspects will impinge on the economic situation at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anything has been said that I have not dealt with already.  The position is, as I said already, we are moving steadily and progressively. We have taken a number of measures that we could not be bound or obliged to take until 1992.  We will continue to go along those lines, but we cannot leave ourselves in a position where we would find ourselves totally unable to deal with a critical situation that might arise.  It would be most inadvisable.  Looking back over Senator Doyle's earlier contribution, she was making the same point herself.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Bus Safety Standards.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say.  The need for safety in large vehicles which carry a big number of passengers is fairly self-evident.  Everybody would agree with that general idea. It is certainly obvious in the case of buses where 90 people, or approximately 90 people, are carried.  It is essential that those buses should be safe for the sake of the passengers and also, of course, for the sake of the public at large who risk being injured or, indeed, killed if something goes wrong with these buses which might lead to accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I begin by making those fairly broad points.  What triggered me into raising this matter on the Adjournment was a specific case which has come to my attention. It relates to an accident which took place on 21 August 1989.  A number of people were standing at a bus stop in south Dublin when an oncoming bus veered across the road and killed a person at the bus stop.  A number of people standing against a wall adjacent to the <Col N="407" /> bus stop narrowly escaped serious injury or, for that matter, being killed.</P>
    <P>At the time the newspapers, particularly the <i>Irish Indpendent</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i>, reported that CIE, through their spokesman, promised a full scale inquiry into the incident.  I cannot say for certain whether the report of this inquiry was published.  I imagine it was not.  I have sought the information from CIE on two occasions and, quite simply, they have not come back to me.  The appropriate person was not available and on either occasion did they get back to me with the information.</P>
    <P>I can find no evidence, after searching to a reasonable extent in newspapers, and also through communicating with the family of the unfortunate man who was killed that the report was published.  I believe it was not published.  In the last month or so the events were the subject of a court case.  During that court case it emerged that the Garda expert witness found that the service brakes were defective and were not kept in a good working order.  The judge who was dealing with the case said, and I quote, that &ldquo;the driver should not be asked to drive a bus in that condition&rdquo;.  The brakes were described as faulty when the bus went out of control.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus denies that the faulty brakes caused the accident.  I certainly am not in a position to say that the faulty brakes did or did not cause the accident. The evidence which is available to me certainly would not allow me to reach a definitive conclusion on that matter.  A spokesman for Dublin Bus said that there were various reasons for the crash, but the spokesman then went on to say and, I quote, &ldquo;I cannot say what they were&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I find it quite disturbing that Dublin Bus can state that there were various reasons for the crash, and yet are not in a position to say what they were.  Certainly Dublin Bus are not giving the public any assurance that the reason for the crash has been attended to, in other words, that the reason has been eliminated.  That does not appear in any of the newspaper reports that I have seen on the matter.</P>
    <P>Further to that, another spokesman for <Col N="408" /> Dublin Bus said that he is confident that all their buses are safe.  I find that mind boggling.  If somebody says that all the buses are safe and if it emerges in the course of a court case that brakes were faulty to the point that a judge says that buses with those type of brakes should not be on the road, I find that absolutely distrubing.  The spokesman from Dublin Bus went on to say that it is the company's policy to replace a bus when it is 16 years old.  That is routine procedure.  The bus which was involved in this accident was 17 years old.  Indeed, the spokesman for Dublin Bus who made that statement is further quoted in the same newspaper report as withdrawing the statement and he went on to talk about financial reasons why the company's buses depreciated over a period of time, etc.</P>
    <P>A journalist in the <i>Dublin Tribune</i> wrote that Dublin Bus have no plans to change their maintenance policy, despite a court finding that faulty brakes on a 17 year old bus were to blame for a fatal accident in which a student was killed.  I find that very disturbing.  The evidence has emerged clearly that there was a 17 year old bus on the road which had faulty brakes, yet a public transport company have no plans to change their maintenance policy.  Clearly, as I see it, the maintenance policy has failed.  It has failed because a faulty bus went out on the road and tragically was involved in an accident.  I am not saying that the brakes were the cause of the accident, but what I am saying is that there was a maintenance policy in use which allowed a bus with faulty brakes to be on the road.  I have to say that that is extremely disturbing.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, first, to try to see if it is possible to have the report of the inquiry which was conducted by Dublin Bus into this matter published.  I cannot say if the inquiry is completed, but I imagine that one year on from the time of the accident that the inquiry would be completed.  That is the least, as it were, that should be done.  I also think that some assurances should be provided <Col N="409" /> for the public in relation to the maintenance policy and the standards of service which are in use by Dublin Bus.</P>
    <P>I find the attitude of Dublin Bus to the maintenance and safety standards of their vehicles arrogantly disturbing and a matter for public concern.  Dublin Bus have refused to change their procedures for bus maintenance despite Garda evidence in a court case that the brakes on a 17 year old bus which was involved in a fatal accident were faulty.  At the time of the accident Dublin Bus promised a full inquiry.  The findings of that inquiry were not published as far as I can ascertain. Dublin Bus now state that there are various reasons for the accident, and yet they cannot say what they were.</P>
    <P>This will certainly do nothing to alleviate concern about safety standards in Dublin Bus, especially when the judge involved in the court case following that fatal accident remarked that the driver should not have been asked to drive such a bus.</P>
    <P>It is intolerable that Dublin Bus are continuing with a maintenance policy which clearly failed to prevent a 17 year old bus with faulty brakes being on the streets.  The public must be reassured about the safety standards of a public service company that carries thousands of people each day, when one of its vehicles was found by a Garda expert to have brakes which were defective and not kept in good working order.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that Dublin Bus publish the report of the inquiry into this accident.  I would also ask the Minister to ensure that they review their maintenance policy for old buses and let the public know what the risks are and how they are reduced to acceptable levels when old buses are being used for public transport.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to thank the Minister for coming to the House and listening to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister for State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister for State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by stressing two points.  First, bus passengers are entitled to expect that the vehicles they travel in are safe.  Secondly, <Col N="410" /> the primary obligation to ensure that buses are maintained in a roadworthy condition &mdash; at all times &mdash; rests with the operator.</P>
      <P>All operators should ensure the frequent inspection and repair of their buses.  Any operator who is detected using a defective bus by the Garda Síochána is liable to be prosecuted under the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  In addition, where a bus defect is shown to have caused or contributed to a road accident, the operator could be liable to pay compensation to injured passengers or other road users.</P>
      <P>About 30 per cent of buses used as &ldquo;Large public service vehicles&rdquo; are over ten years old &mdash; including 11 per cent over 15 years old.  A well-maintained older bus can be safer than a badly maintained new bus.  However, everyone would accept that defects are more likely to arise on older buses and these buses must, therefore, be subject to strict maintenance schedules.</P>
      <P>All buses over one year old must be tested annually.  In 1989, a total of 5,758 buses were tested; 89 per cent were passed, including 58 per cent which were passed after defects had been rectified. The 11 per cent of buses which failed must be re-tested and passed as roadworthy before being re-licensed &mdash; re-taxed &mdash; to carry passengers in a public place.</P>
      <P>Where a used bus is permanently imported into this country, the bus must be tested and passed before it is licensed to carry passengers.</P>
      <P>While the annual testing is some safeguard for bus users, it is no substitute for frequent checks and repairs by the operators.  Many defects arise from normal use &mdash; wear on tyres, brakes, etc. Garda Síochána public service vehicle inspectors can inspect any bus used on a public road at any time and the Garda are willing to investigate specific complaints from the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive new construction and equipment regulations will be made next year for one-person operated &mdash; OPO &mdash; buses.  Since the introduction of these <Col N="411" /> buses, CIE comply with special requirements laid down by my Department.</P>
    <P>An applicant for a provisional driving licence to drive a bus must undergo a medical examination, including an eyesight test. The applicant must also have a full licence to drive a class B vehicle &mdash; a car or light van &mdash; and must be at least 21 years of age.  The medical and eyesight requirements for a bus driver are more stringent than for a car driver, and persons suffering from certain complaints cannot be licensed to drive a bus.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport is responsible for legislation regulating bus drivers' hours.  Depending on the type of passenger service, the legislation requires, among other things, either the use of a tachograph or duty roster and service timetable for recording drivers' hours.  The enforcement of the legislation is shared between transport officers appointed by that Minister and the Garda Síochána.  There is provision for roadside inspection of tachographs and for inspection of records in bus operator's premises.</P>
    <P>About 70 per cent of buses used as large public service vehicles are owned and operated by CIE and its subsidiary companies &mdash; Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann.  The balance &mdash; 30 per cent &mdash; are privately owned.</P>
    <P>The licensing of private operators under the Road Transport Acts is the responsibility of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  He also has overall responsibility for legislation governing Bus Éireann and Bus Atha Cliath.  I know that the Senator would share my view that all bus operators should aim for the highest vehicle and driver safety standards, in the interest of the travelling public.  I would be anxious that that would be the position at all times.</P>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate I cannot refer to various accidents that take place <Col N="412" /> which he mentioned in his opening remarks.  In view of the legal implications &mdash; the proceedings are going to court &mdash; I regret I cannot make any comment on that.  I want to assure the Senator that I would be as anxious as him or anyone else that all public transport or other transport used in this country would be kept in a safe condition and that brakes and all equipment would be of the highest standard and 100 per cent perfect at all times.</P>
    <P>The Senator can appreciate my position in regard to the matter he raised earlier.  Again, I assure him it is our aim and a matter for all operators in this country to make sure that there are no defects in the vehicles.  That is most important.  That is the way it should be but, of course, the laws are there.  They are laid down by the Minister for Tourism and Transport in regard to this matter as well.  I am satisfied that the section that comes under my own Department, with the Garda Síochána, has adequate laws available to deal with all this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister two further questions?  Would he be prepared to consider reviewing the maintenance policy and regulations to ensure that buses with defective brakes cannot be on the road?  Secondly, would he be prepared to consider publishing or ensuring that the report of the accident in question is published in due course; if there are legal reasons why it cannot be done now, then to be published at a subsequent stage when those legal reasons will not be relevent?</P>
    </Speaker>
