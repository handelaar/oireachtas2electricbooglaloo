      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to pay primary teachers on a fortnightly basis rather than monthly or bi-monthly and thereby eliminate what is clearly a discriminatory provision in as much as teachers are the only significantly sized group in the Civil or Public Service which does not have the option of fortnightly pay.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter.</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to clarify if he proposes to continue with his policy of current compulsory stop-over of transAtlantic flights at Shannon, particularly in view of recent announcements by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that the over £500,000 which has been allocated under section 10 of the 1988 Housing Act to alleviate the plight of the homeless, and is so far unspent, is used to help the homeless before the end of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Toole, Norris, Ross, Jackman and Ryan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator O'Toole's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ross, Jackman and Ryan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The business for today is as follows: on the conclusion of the Order of Business we propose to take item No. 3 and when that is concluded it will be followed by all-Stages of item No. 4, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1990. That is to conclude not later than 5.15 p.m. and at that stage a sos until 6 p.m., followed at 6 o'clock, by agreement with Senator Brendan Ryan in particular, to start the Private Members' debate from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. or perhaps for a little longer.  We are also having a sos from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m. for lunch.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has at last unbended on the question of Committee on Foreign Affairs and has agreed that one will be set up in the near future, could the Leader <Col N="415" /> of the House ensure that one of two things happen &mdash; that either this House has its full representation on the committee, if it is to be a joint committee, or else that separate steps to be taken to establish at the same time a committee on foreign affairs from this House, which I think would be the preferred option of Members of this House.  I would ask the Leader if he would consult with the other group leaders before the recess to see what the preferred option of this House is and then ensure that it is put into effect with all speed.  We would all like to see a committee on foreign affairs in operation at the beginning of the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been pushing for such a committee for a couple of years now, the Independent benches certainly welcome the tentative moves to establish such a committee.  We would also want to establish that, despite the fact we were excluded from the Anglo-Irish Committee, we would not expect anything like that to happen this time.  I will say no more on that issue.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would indicate to us the legislative programme which he intends presenting to the House for the period after the recess.  I would also ask the Leader of the House to bring to the attention of the Government Chief Whip of the other House that he will not be in a position to initiate legislation right through the budget debate in the other House and that that gives him an absolutely open opportunity to have both Houses working compatibly with each other through the initiation of legislation in this House.</P>

      <P>I would simply like to add my voice to the request that the international affairs committee be established with all due expedience and that it be properly representative of both Houses.  We have been looking for it for a long time.  It is something that has been a major lacuna in the operation of the Oireachtas and because of it we could not discuss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the establishment of the foreign affairs committee, could I welcome that move.  I disagree with Senator Manning in that I would like to see this committee being an all-party Oireachtas committee.  I do not think it would be worthwhile having separate committees in existence in each of the Houses.  I believe that the Members of this House have just as important a contribution to make to that committee as the Members of the Dáil.  I would hope that with all speed that committee would be established on an Oireachtas basis.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the views expressed by Senator Manning, but may I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible to have an early discussion on Motion No. 82?  I think it is appropriate that the House should be able to monitor developments and problems, especially across the USSR and Eastern Europe, during this very significant era of change.  I believe that our Minister for Foreign Affairs would benefit by the views that one would expect to be expressed in the House.</P>

      <P>The Leader undertook to inquire about the money allocated by the Department of the Environment for expenditure on the homeless.  Since that money will be returned unspent to the Department of Finance in about a fort-night's time, which nobody I think would regard as satisfactory, I ask if he has made any progress on that issue?</P>
      <P>May I join with my colleagues in welcoming the apparent decision to set up a committee on international affairs and correct at least one of the morning newspapers? The current Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC is not a Dáil committee; it is an Oireachtas committee, a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and if it is to be replaced it should be replaced, as my colleagues have said, by an Oireachtas committee.  I have a funny feeling that all six Members of the Independent group want to be on it, but that is a matter for a later day.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader give me some indication &mdash; I am not trying to set a trap for him; it is simply from the point of view of organisation &mdash; when roughly does he expect the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to be taken?  I know it is ordered for the first sitting day, but that does not necessarily mean it will be taken then.  I do not want to tie a noose around his neck, but I would like a rough indication as to whether it will be on the first sitting day after the recess a few weeks later, or when.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in support of moves by the Taoiseach to establish a foreign affairs committee and to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there was a debate in the previous Seanad, a major debate, on the establishment of a foreign affairs committee. There is now on the supplementary Order Paper two motions <Col N="418" /> requiring a foreign affairs committee.  I wonder if the Leader would consider holding a debate in Government time on this issue so that the views of the House can be ascertained with regard to the precise provisions, because there is one motion in the name of the Labour Party and another in the name of myself and they are slightly different.  Such a debate would be very useful, in the light of the Taoiseach's announcement.  It might also clear up some confusion because the Leader indicated yesterday that he felt that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC was a kind of foreign affairs committee; but that displays, I have to say, a rather narrow view of geography because there is considerably more in the globe than just the European Community.  I would think it would be those other countries with which Ireland has a very strong and interesting connection, particularly in Latin America and Australia&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my question, that we would have that debate.  I would like to supplement it by a second question, which is, if the Leader would consider it appropriate during that debate to bring up the question of the Amnesty report on Iraq or, if not, if perhaps he would consider taking up the suggestion, which I think, was made by Senator Conroy yesterday, that there is such concern about developments in the Gulf that this House ought to consider the matter because the expiry of the American ultimatum will be on 15 January.  Perhaps the Leader might consider having an urgent debate on that issue so that the views of Senators could be made known.</P>
      <P>Finally, because of the time constriction of this ultimatum, would the Leader give us some indication whether or not this House will meet?  I understand we may be meeting tomorrow, but will we meet again before 15 January?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join with the other Senators and welcome the <Col N="419" /> announcement by the Taoiseach in relation to the foreign affairs committee. It is wonderful news from the Taoiseach, the 13 members of the Fianna Fáil Government and the other two.  The plain people of Ireland know who initiates such ideas, the great statesman, and how well the Taoiseach performed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to allow me to bring to the notice of the House something which may not be appropriate to the Order of Business but which I think is of serious concern for us as Members.  It is in relation to the facility for car parking in the grounds of Leinster House afforded to past members of the House.  I would like the Leader to either confirm or deny this.  I have heard that past Members have been denied the right for parking facilities in the past few weeks.</P>

      <P>What the Senator has raised is very important, but I would like to point out to him that it is a matter which should be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I appreciate his genuine concern and it is important that it be discussed.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader, as I have done on previous occasions with not much success, if the report of the special committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. T. Barrington, on the reforms of local government will be made available to this House.  It was due to be handed in last Monday.  In view of the fact that that report is now to hand, can we have some indication of when the legislation on local government reform <Col N="420" /> will be before us?  There is a pressing urgency about this because the local government elections, which were put off for one year, and due to take place in June.  I am not going to be put in the position of pressing for those elections to take place without the new legislation being put in place.  I would like also to have further information on the Environment Protection Agency Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that, since Senator Cassidy was allowed to raise the matter of car parking, I think it is outrageous that those of us who ride bicycles should be discriminated against by having the two bicycle parks at the furthest end of either park.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my gratification at the news of the impending establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  When we think also of the change of heart which was indicated last week on homosexual law reform, it proves that apparently fruitless knocking at the door by backbenchers, among others, finally does get the door to open. It is a great encouragement in that regard.  I know the Leader of the House will see that the best interests of Seanad Éireann are served in this matter and of the component groups therein.  In fact, in all modesty, I think I would be a fine person to put on that committee.  I would be very suitable, would you not agree?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I would like to say how delighted I am that the Progressive Democrats are discovering the uses of this House and I take it they will not now be proceeding with their draft motion that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to abolish Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible that we add as a special item to this <Col N="421" /> evening's Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting a discussion on the proposed international affairs committee and the role of Seanad Éireann in it? Perhaps we could step aside from normal procedure, because I understand we will not have another Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting between now and sometime at the end of January.  I would request the Cathaoirleach to consider that.</P>

      <P>I would like to retrace the points raised by Senator Cassidy with regard to past Members of the House.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning, as did many other Members, expressed a welcome for the formation of a foreign <Col N="422" /> affairs committee, as indeed I do.  It is something I have been privately trying to have taken on board and I am glad in will now become a reality.  Senator Manning also asked if it would be a joint committee and put general queries about the composition of the committee.  I have to say I am sure of that at this time.  I have noted his observations in relation to this matter and this would also be my reply to Senator Murphy, I will be doing my best to see that, irrespective of the form of committee in place, Senators will be well represented on that committee.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the foreign affairs committee and welcomed it.  He asked about the business after Christmas.  At this stage I can say with certainty that we will have the Appropriation Bill for debate and, in particular, the EPA.  We will have EPA soon after Christmas.  I would say to Members that this is very important legislation and I urge Members to examine it, analyse it, read about it, come here and do justice to that legislation and leave it in such a way that when it goes from this House it will be much better legislation, legislation that cannot even be improved in the other House.  For the short term period after the Christmas recess my plea to Members would be to study the EPA Bill, give it a thorough analysis and make sure it is a better Bill when it leaves the Seanad. Senator Costello also welcomed the foreign affairs committee and Senator Cullen referred to it on the basis of an all-party Oireachtas committee.  I honestly have to say I am not sure how it is moving at this time.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald asked about Item No. 82.  In regard to items such as that, and also the matter of the prison system, which Senator Harte, among others, asked about, I gave the Senator a guarantee that it would be taken as quickly as possible after Christmas.  That is still my plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted the concern of Senator B. Ryan about the £500,000 which was earmarked for the homeless and I have informed the Department about that. The Senator also welcomed the foreign affairs committee and he, too, asked <Col N="423" /> about the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  As I said, that will be taken soon and we will have to do justice to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris, too, welcomed the foreign affairs committee and asked for a debate.  While there was a conflicting point of view from Senator Manning, Senator Norris asked how a debate at this point might be proceeded with.  I will see how we can handle it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also referred to the Amnesty report on Iraq.  I would have to agree with Senator Norris that I find that report quite disturbing.  However, I cannot give the Senator a guarantee that it or any other item will be taken before 15 January.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy also welcomed the foreign affairs committee.  He asked about car parking for former Members.  One or two other speakers also asked about that, in particular Senator Hourigan.  This matter was brought to my attention yesterday evening.  At that point it was indicated to me that we know of at least three former Members who had been refused. Since then I have been told of one or two others who were refused.  I was a bit annoyed and disturbed because one of the people concerned had given 25 years' service to this House.  My information, having checked it, is that apparently this regulation has been there since 1982 but has not been enforced until the past month or six weeks.  What happens, I understand, is that on the Wednesday this rule operates, not on any other day. I would like to think this long-standing privilege, which is rightly there for former Members, would be available in the same way as exists for serving Members.  As the Cathaoirleach has said, this is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I can assure all Members of the House that, with the Cathaoirleach's permission, it will be debated this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman asked about the Barrington report.  I am aware it was ready for handing over last week.  I am not sure if it will be made available to this House; I would imagine perhaps not, but I will make inquiries.  The Senator <Col N="424" /> also asked about the EPA Bill and about bicycle parking, which I am sure will not be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy about the role of the backbenchers in regard to the foreign affairs committee.  I do not always agree with the backbenchers on the other side, but I agree on this.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the role of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and whether we can take on the arrangements for discussion on the foreign affairs committee.  I have no objection to that; it is a matter for the Cathaoirleach.  Senator Hourigan also asked about car parking for former Members.</P>

      <P>The Royal Hospital, Donnybrook (Charter Amendment) Order, 1990,</P>

      <P>I sincerely regret the House had to adjourn because of my absence.  I was here but as I felt the Senators were in a mood to continue their contributions I thought I would not interrupt them.  When I went back to the other House the Leader of Fine Gael did not want to go home for Christmas and, consequently, we had a vote.  I am pleased to be back in this House again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the draft order, the application to amend the charter of the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook was made by the board of management of the hospital.  Section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, gives power to the Minister for Health to make an order, on the application of the governing body of a hospital, to amend a charter or Private Act relating to that hospital, subject to consultation with the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests &mdash; who have been consulted in this case and who have approved of the proposed amendments to the hospital's charter &mdash; and also subject to a draft of an order <Col N="426" /> which it is proposed to make being laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The section stipulates that the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the amendments to the charter, and supplemental charter put forward by the hospital's board of management, the Minister agreed to make an order incorporating the amendments to their existing charter, which was granted to the hospital in 1800 and also to the supplemental charter which was adopted in 1886.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the amendments is to make new provisions for the appointment of governors and also to bring up-to-date certain other clauses that are regarded as out-moded.  The memorandum circulated with the draft order explains the various amendments.</P>
    <P>I believe the House will welcome the amendments to out-moded clauses but it is only fair to the board of The Royal Hospital to say that the out-dated clauses have not been applied in practice for many years past.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to thank the board of The Royal Hospital, and also the medical, nursing and other staff of the hospital, for the excellent work they have performed over the years in treating a great number of long-stay patients and more recently in developing rehabilitation services.  I feel sure that this good work will continue and, indeed, will be further developed to meet the changing needs of the hospital's catchment population in south Dublin.</P>
    <P>I ask the Seanad to approve of the Draft Royal Hospital, Donnybrook (Charter Amendment) Order, 1990, which has been laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset it would be appropriate to put on the record of this House the appreciation of my party of the tremendous work that the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook has done over the years.  There can be no doubt that it stands out as one of the finest institutions in the health area and for that we are <Col N="427" /> eternally grateful.  They have done marvellous pioneering work down the years. I echo the sentiments of virtually everybody with any concern in the health area.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the governing body of the hospital should have sought this. It is correct that we respond in the way that is being done.  For that reason it is my intention not to obstruct this order going through the House in any way.  It is a positive development.  It is certainly anachronistic that in this day and age, under the existing situation, people would have to pay to be a member of the board of the hospital or a governor of the hospital, that they would have to have shares and so on.  It is important to remove that anachronism and to facilitate the smooth running of the hospital.  This will take the hospital to the end of this century in the right fashion and allow them to develop in a proper way.  It is important that any outmoded clauses that might inhibit that development should be removed.  For that reason I support this order today and hope that it will pass smoothly through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this order.  This hospital was known as the Royal Hospital for Incurables.  The charter was signed on 7 January 1800.  It is good to know that down through the centuries we had people who were worried about people's health.  Many people put their hands in their pocket and paid the princely sum of 21 guineas, which was a considerable sum of money at that time.  That money was paid to help incurables.  It proves again the old addage that medical science will always be challenged.  It was a hospital for incurables then and today we still have hospitals for incurables.  There is a challenge to medical science even today and there will be while the world exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When those far-seeing people set up this hospital the situation was that for a fee of 21 guineas, £22.1s, they became governors of the hospital, life-time members.  I understand that many governors are still in existance.  In the modern day you cannot have any hospital or, <Col N="428" /> indeed, any institution governed by out-dated legislation and it is right that we should introduce this order to bring this hospital, which has done good work down the years, into the modern world and allow them to select a board of directors in the normal way.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that both the corporation and the Eastern Health Board will have an input into the new board. We cannot speak highly enough of the amount of work that health boards have done in recent years.  It is popular to be critical of health boards but if we look at the positive side they are doing a wonderful job particularly in community care, where no private hospitals are operating. For that reason I am delighted that the Eastern Health Board will be involved in this.  I am delighted that the corporation will be involved because it gives elected representatives an opportunity of being on those boards and it has given the new body an opportunity to mortgage or sell, if they so desire, some of the property and put the assets they acquire to better use for the very high motive for which the hospital was built in the first place, to help sick people.  I welcome the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must declare my interest at the outset.  I am a life governor of the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook, and between 1974 and 1979 I was on the board of management as a nominee of Dublin Corporation.  Although it is the intention to abolish the system of governors and life governors, at the moment I have nothing to fear because I understand they are going to wait until we all die out before this new system comes into operation. We are not going to be put off.  It is going to take them a very long time. There are people younger than myself who are life governors so it is probably going to take 60 or 70 years before this system dies out but that is the way they have decided to do it.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff, the board of management, the governors and to everybody associated with the Royal Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> When I went on the board in 1974 it was a very antediluvian institution.  My arrival simply happened to coincide with the changes in the hospital.  I remember when I first visited the hospital it was dark, dank and dirty.  It was a very miserable place.  It was at that time still called the Royal Hospital for Incurables and people simply went there to die.  They each had their own little closet and they were allowed to bring in all their possessions with them.  Everything except the grand piano was brought in which made the position impossible for the staff.  Quite dramatic changes took place very rapidly so that it is today a very fine hospital providing every up-to-date facility and care.  Great tribute is due to the board of management of the hospital and to all the staff.</P>
    <P>Although I am no longer a member of the board I visit the hospital fairly regularly because it is right beside me and I must say I do so because it is a most uplifting experience to go to the hospital and to see the spirit in the place and the encouragement the staff give to the patients.  It is an extremely modern hospital now.  They have 230 patients living in.  The vast majority of them are geriatric patients but there are two rehabilitation wards, short stay wards.  That is a very good thing because it gives encouragement to the nursing staff that they have something to work towards, and on occasion they can see such an improvement in a patient that the patient can actually leave the hospital.  That is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary and most unfortunate that for over six years the Royal Hospital has been endeavouring to get the changes which are before us today. It says something for the system that it should take so long.  They have been put in the position where they have to act <i>ultra vires</i> in their borrowing of money from the banks.  All that area is dealt with in sections 4 to 12.  Section 12 relates to their ability to borrow money.  That needs very much to be updated because it is antediluvian and anachronistic at present.  The new governors will be able <Col N="430" /> to invite people who have given distinguished service to the hospital to become governors, or may be able to raise extra finance for the hospital.  While the Department of Health have been very generous to the hospital they have, nevertheless, raised vast sums of money through their own endeavours.  A lot of the improvements which have been undertaken have been based on the enthusiasm and the commitment of very many voluntary workers who have raised funds for the hospital.  I welcome this order.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to pay tribute to everybody involved in the running of the hospital.  I understand that following this there will be by-laws and perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on one point.  Members of the corporation and the health boards are nominees of the corporation and are on the board of management.  Will that continue or is that a matter which will be dealt with in the by-laws?  It is out-of-date because the corporation no longer give any funds to the hospital.  What is the position on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, should declare my interest as I am on the board of management of the hospital.  I will not go over all the praise Senator Hederman has expressed but I agree with every word she spoke.  It is only six weeks since I wrote to the Minister and asked him to bring this forward.  Happily he did so.  I am sure much of the work had been done over the six year period that Senator Hederman spoke about but I thank the Minister for bringing it forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was much younger I used visit the hospital because a friend of my mother worked there.  It was a very depressing hospital.  The name was a dreadful one for anybody who was admitted to it &mdash;&ldquo;incurables&rdquo;.  Now, because of the work of volunteers, staff and management board the hospital is a very modern, bright and happy one.  It is a huge improvement on what it was.  That is really due to everybody involved in it, including all the staff and including Senator Manning's sister who is a popular <Col N="431" /> and hard-working nurse there.  Many of us have an interest in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes that have been made.  The position has caused problems for the board.  They have mentioned it time and time again over the years.  We should do anything we can do to help this board, which is composed of an extremely hard-working, efficient and dedicated group of people.  They are an excellent board.  I welcome the changes that have been made and I believe the hospital will go on to better things as a result of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan has very kindly declared my interest in this matter for me, for which I thank him.  I re-echo what Senators Hederman and Ryan have said about this hospital.  It is one of the unsung treasures of our health service and the improvements in it in recent years have been quite dramatic.  The spirit in the hospital is about the best I have come across in any hospital.  It is a pity that the hospital had to wait six years for these changes but I do not think the absence of these changes has held up the improvements which have been mentioned.</P>
      <P>I simply want to put on record my appreciation of the work done by the hospital.  It is important that people who are working in this very difficult and unglamorous area of health should from time to time know that public representatives appreciate the great work they are doing on behalf of the community.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators O'Reilly, Hederman, Ryan and Manning for their contributions and pay a special tribute to Senators Hederman and Ryan and, through Senator Manning, to all those who have been members of the board of management, governors and staff for the great work they have done. I have personal knowledge of the activities in the hospital and I know some of the board of management and governors. I know their commitment and we in the Department of Health deeply appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> In response to a few queries that were raised, we received a formal request in 1988 to amend the charter.  When the board of management discovered that they wanted to move in line with modern management techniques, thinking and attitudes, they found they had to amend the charter.</P>
    <P>Some discussions took place and a formal request was made to the Minister for Health in 1988.  Subsequent to that, there were further discussions and a submission was made to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests who cleared the amendment now being made.  After that, it was necessary to have the order drafted and put in order legally.  We have not wasted any time since the formal request was put to us to get this before the House because we see this as contributing to the evolution of a hospital that is doing an excellent job in geriatric and day care.</P>
    <P>The by-laws will provide for the cooption of five out of possibly 30 members from public bodies associated with the hospital.  These would include Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Health Board and other organisations and associations at the discretion of the board of management. The Minister for Health's only function is to lay the by-laws before each House of the Oireachtas on receipt of notification from the Royal Hospital that the new by-laws had been adopted by the governors of the hospital.  The new by-laws must be submitted to the Minister for Health at least 14 days before they are submitted for approval to the High Court.  A new set of by-laws has been prepared by the hospital and it is planned to process these following the amendment of the charter and supplemental charter.</P>
    <P>Basically, they are the technical details.  I thank the House for the very warm reception it has given to this proposal. We will now take it to the Dáil and have it ratified so that the board of management and the governors can proceed to ensure that the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook has a most modern management facility and opportunity in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the constituencies in order to bring them into line with the provision of the constitution regarding equality of representation.</P>
      <P>Under Article 16 of the Constitution a revision must be carried out at least once in every 12 years.  Over the past 30 years a revision has in fact taken place after each census of population.</P>
      <P>The census taken in 1986 showed major changes in population.  In some constituencies the number of persons represented by each Dáil Member was considerably above the national average while in others it was well below that average.  This was particularly the case in Dublin.  Taking extreme examples, the average number of persons per member in Dublin South-West was 26, 712 while in Dublin Central the average was 18, 346. These are the extreme examples but in other parts of the country the situation was far from satisfactory, for example, areas such as Kildare, Wicklow, Mayo and Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the practice begun by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977, an independent commission was set up on 4 May last to advise on the formation of constituencies. The terms of reference given to the commission were announced in the agreed &ldquo;<i>Programme for Government</i>&rdquo;<Col N="434" /> and were identical with the terms given to the commission which reported in 1983 and which recommended the scheme of constituencies now in force.  The terms were also very similar to those given to the first Dáil constituency commission which reported in 1980.</P>
    <P>Of course, the commission is an advisory body only.  The Constitution places the responsibility of revising the constituencies on the Oireachtas.  While the commission may advise, the decisions and the responsibility are matters for the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The members of the commission were Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, President of the High Court, Dr. Kenneth Whitaker, former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Thomas Troy, Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Mr. Eamon Rayel, Clerk of the Dáil and Mr. Kieran Coughlan, then Clerk of the Seanad and now Clerk of the Lower House.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to thank the members of the commission for the way in which they carried out the job given to them.  Revising the constituencies is always a thankless job.  No matter what arrangement of constituencies is recommended it is quite certain that somebody will be offended. Some sitting Deputy or intending candidate is bound to feel hard done by, that his chances of election or re-election have been made more difficulty by the new constituencies. I think the members of the commission have earned our thanks for the very fair and evenhanded way in which they did their job.</P>
    <P>The members of the commission were, of course, entirely independent in carrying out the task given to them.  They were constrained only by the Constitution and the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The commission reported at the end of July.  The report was accepted by the Government and published and copies were given to each Member of the Oireachtas.  The Bill proposes to implement in full the recommendations made in the commission's report.</P>
    <P>A detailed explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill.  A set <Col N="435" /> of maps illustrating the proposed new constituencies has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.  A set of maps to a smaller scale has been made available to each Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill fixes the total number of Members of the Dáil at 166 which is the same as at present.  The other sections are the normal provisions found in a constituency revision Bill.  The proposed new constituencies are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  These constituencies will come into force on the next dissolution of the Dáil.  Until then the present constituencies will continue in force, for example, for the purposes of by-elections.  The total number of constituencies will remain at 41.  The constituencies set out in the Schedule to the Bill are identical with those set out in the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides for 12 three-member constituencies, 15 four-member constituencies and 15 five-member constituencies. The new constituencies will involve breaching four county boundaries &mdash; those of counties Clare, Kildare, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Sixteen of the constituencies are identical in area with an existing constituency. There are two entirely new constituencies &mdash; Longford-Roscommon and Westmeath. The remaining constituencies are subject to boundary changes, to one degree or another, and, in some cases, to changes in seat allocation.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area, there are boundary changes in every constituency with the single exception of Dublin South-West. Dublin Central, Dublin South-Central and Dublin West will each lose one seat and Dublin North and Dublin South-West will gain one seat each.  The overall pattern of constituencies in Dublin will, however, remain very much as it is.</P>
    <P>A small area of County Clare, containing part of Limerick city suburbs, will be included in the Limerick East constituency. There will be boundary adjustments between four of the five constituencies in Cork.  A part of County Galway will be added to each of the two Mayo constituencies, but the part of the <Col N="436" /> county at present contained in the constituency of Roscommon will be restored. Finally, an additional seat will be added to the Wicklow constituency which will be augmented by the addition of part of County Kildare.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; again to the members of the commission for the very competent and fair way they have carried out the difficult job given to them.</P>
    <P>I hope Members will feel free to speak on the Bill.  I would like to hear a debate on it and I fully appreciate that for Members of both Houses there will be inconvenience but the only thing I would say is that an election is years down the road.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He is without doubt one of the most popular of the Ministers of State and if I were advising the Taoiseach or if he would listen to me I would say he would make a splendid Minister for Defence.  Hopefully, the Taoiseach will bear that in mind as he ponders over his list this Christmas.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the assurance he has given us.  It is not proper to draw attention to the absence of people in the House but he has assured us that this Government will last the full course and we will have an election-free 1991 and 1992.  This is something which many of us would welcome but I wonder if he has consulted with his junior partners on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will oppose this Bill for reasons which I will outline as I go along.  I agree with the Minister that the revision of boundaries is a tricky and difficult matter <Col N="437" /> even at the best of times and for most politicians there are never the best of times.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.  Somebody is always going to feel they have been unfairly treated in the drawing of boundaries.  In any political environment there is a sense of paranoia, conspiracy and a feeling that people are ganging up to produce a certain kind of result.  We all have our own views as to what the ideal boundaries should be.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, the drawing of boundaries was done by the Minister for Local Government of the day and until the sixties the system, by and large, was regarded as being fairly done by all parties. From the twenties up to the fifties, there were frequently major changes in boundaries.  Carlow-Kilkenny became Carlow-Kildare and then Carlow-Kilkenny again.  Whole counties were moved around.  There were other changes also of this sort.  There was never any feeling among politicians that the system was being manipulated in a way which would give an unfair advantage to any particular party.  As politicians we would like to see the job of drawing up the boundaries carried out by the Minister for the Environment of the day.  Unfortunately the events of the sixties and seventies have made that very difficult and it is very difficult now to accept that there will be fairness all round.</P>
    <P>The changes began in 1959 with the referendum that year where Fianna Fáil, as they were perfectly entitled to do, sought to change the electoral system because it felt we were unlikely to get strong Governments under proportional representation.  It was strange coming from Fianna Fáil because the electoral system had served that party and the country very well.  We remember at that time Fianna Fáil wanted to change to the straight vote, single seat British system of election.  The people said otherwise and a second try was made in 1968.  Perhaps that was one of the lost opportunities of Irish politics because in 1968, if the Government had been ready to listen to other groups, we might well have got what was then called the Norton amendment which would have been <Col N="438" /> single seat constituencies with a transferable vote.  Whether it would have been better than our present system we can only surmise.</P>
    <P>The sixties saw the first deliberate attempt to manipulate boundaries for party advantage.  This was one of Mr. Kevin Boland's legacies to Irish politics. It was the first deliberate attempt to change the boundaries to suit one political party and it worked to the advantage of Fianna Fáil at the time.  That was followed in the seventies, I regret to say, by a similar exercise by Mr. Jim Tully where he sought to change the boundaries to suit the Coalition parties of the day.  In the process he coined a new word, the &ldquo;Tullymander,&rdquo; which means, in effect, a gerrymander that blows up in your face. It had the effect of helping Fianna Fáil in the 1977 general election.</P>
    <P>Those two episodes &mdash; Mr. Boland's gerrymander and Mr. Tully's &ldquo;tullymander&rdquo;&mdash; persuaded most fair-minded people that the time had come to give this job to an independent commission and it was the right decision given what had gone before it.  When the Minister spoke about the personnel on this commission, I agree with him entirely on the integrity and eminence of the people involved.  Mr. Justice Hamilton is an expert on the drawing of boundaries and is obviously a man of complete integrity, as indeed are all of the other members of the commission.  I do not think we can say that the commission was other than independent.  It would be wrong to say that the commission was in any way improperly influenced in coming to the conclusions it came to.  That would not merely be unfair but untrue.  The integrity and the stature of the people involved rule anything of that sort out of the question.</P>
    <P>The problem, however, is that a number of the proposals are really quite extraordinary and fly in the face of commonsense, of traditional boundaries, provincial boundaries and so forth.  These points have been well made in the other House and it is not my intention to labour them today.  It is impossible to justify the creation of the Roscommon-Longford <Col N="439" /> constituency.  It breaches a whole series of boundaries &mdash; provincial boundaries, health board boundaries and all of the various administrative boundaries.  It creates a new artefact the purpose of which is difficult to understand.  Likewise, it is impossible to justify the continuation of two three seat constituencies in Mayo with the hacking away of large chunks of Galway to make this possible.  Again, I am not saying for one moment that the Minister for the Environment wanted this.  He probably did but he did not do anything untoward to bring it about.</P>

      <P>It is on that basis that we will oppose this Bill.  This is not the time to examine our electoral system, although in the other House a great deal of the debate was taken up with the effects of that system.  We are going through a time of constitutional change where all sorts of changes are being spoken of as being possible in the near future and, in the light of that, we should take a very hard look at our electoral system.  The only way that system will change will be on as much of an all-party basis as is possible.</P>
      <P>The defects in our present system are obvious.  The greatest one is that it creates and encourages a very strong sense of clientelism.  It creates unnecessary, unrealistic and expensive competition between Members of the Dáil in the same constituency and often in the same party. It puts undue emphasis on the constituency element of a Deputy's or Senator's work to the detriment of the participation by the Deputy or Senator in the work of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has only to look at the enormous constituency workload which any Member of the Dáil and most Members of the Seanad will carry, much of which is unnecessary and could be done through the system.  Some of it has been encouraged by Members themselves, almost going out touting for business and work because they know this is the basis on <Col N="440" /> which they will be judged when it comes to the election.  Unfortunately the more important work of attention to the detail and principles of legislation frequently takes a back seat.  Everybody is aware of that.  The possibility of single seat constituencies would diminish the amount of competition and the geographic scale of work which has to be undertaken by a Member.</P>
    <P>There are very good points in our electoral system.  Unlike the UK which has a system of disproportional representation, where the Thatcher revolution was carried out with never more than 44 per cent of the popular vote supporting it and yet that Prime Minister felt she had a mandate to bring about some of the most dramatic changes in the structure of Britain over the past ten years, we do not have a situation here where a party will have a mandate without a majority of votes.  We do not have a situation where large sections of the electorate can feel themselves disenfranchised over a long period.  For example, in Scotland at present there are ten Tory MPs out of a total of 72.  The people of Scotland have laws imposed on them which a majority of their elected representatives consistently oppose.  We do not have that sense of alienation under our system.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that people keep in touch.  Our system ensures that people are in touch, perhaps too much so and too ready to bow to the prevailing winds, but certainly they keep in touch with what is happening on the ground in the constituencies.  In many continental countries with the list system, a member can have no constituency work at all and have no contact with the constituency. He can become a bureaucrat who is out of touch with what is happening among ordinary people.  Our system ensures that people do stay in touch with what is happening.</P>
    <P>The final point is that our system has produced stable and good governments over the years.  Perhaps that seems a little bit odd in terms of the 1980s during <Col N="441" /> which all of us fought five general elections. Nonetheless if the Minister is looking at the electoral system these are some of the points I would like him to look at.</P>
    <P>If we are in the process of change we should look at the electoral system to this House.  It has changed hardly at all over the past 50 years and there are some fairly fundamental questions which we should address.  One of them is whether the vocational element of this House is properly served by the present system; whether a stronger role might be given to the various nominating bodies in the filling of seats in this House in conjunction with the present system of election by local representatives.  It is something we should look hard at.</P>
    <P>We should also look hard at the question of whether university representation is justified at this time.  We can all say that the quality of representation from the universities has been particularly high but there is a case to be made as to why the conferring of a degree from two of our universities should entitle a person to two votes or in some cases three votes in a national election.  The whole question of the elitist system of university representation is something which any thorough-going review of our electoral system should take a hard look at.</P>
    <P>Finally, because there is not really much to say on this Bill, the commission has met, the commission is an independent body; it has done its work and produced a result.  We believe it is a flawed report.  We believe it is fundamentally wrong as far as two particular constituencies are concerned.  We say this without any aspersion on the integrity of the commission but we believe that they have got it wrong.  I know that our view is certainly shared by very many of the Members on the other side of the House who may or may not feel free to express their views on this matter.  For that reason, we will be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to welcome the Minister here and to endorse the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning at the outset in wishing him well in the promotion stakes.  I would also say he is <Col N="442" /> most approachable and certainly one of the most popular junior Minister we have.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann in pursuance of Article 16.2.2º and in pursuance of clause 4º of the same Article, to revise the constituencies in respect of which members are elected to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In summarising the constitutional requirements in relation to membership of the Dáil and to constituency formation these can be set out as follows: (1) the number of Members must be fixed from time to time by law; (2) there must be at least one member for every 30,000 of the population and not more than one for 20,000; (3) the ratio between the number of Members to be elected at any time for each constituency, and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is possible, be the same throughout the country; (4) the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once every 12 years with due regard to changes in the distribution of the population and the number of Members to be returned for any constituency shall not be less than three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission recommends that the total membership of Dáil Éireann shall remain at the present figure of 166 and that the seats shall be arranged in 41 constituencies as follows: 14 with five members, 15 with four members and 12 with three members.  The proposed five-seat constituencies are Carlow-Kilkenny, Cavan-Monaghan, Cork North-Central, Cork South-Central, Dublin South, Dublin South-West, Dun Laoghaire, Galway West, Kildare, Laois-Offaly, Limerick East, Meath, Wexford and Wicklow.  the proposed four-seaters are Clare, Cork East, Dublin Central, Dublin North, Dublin North-Central, Dublin North-East, Dublin North-West, Dublin South-Central, Dublin SouthEast, Dublin West, Longford-Roscommon, Louth, Sligo-Leitrim, Tipperary South and Waterford.  The proposed three-seaters are Cork North-West, Cork <Col N="443" /> South-West, Donegal North-East, Donegal South-West, Galway East, Kerry North, Kerry South, Limerick West, Mayo East, Mayo West, Tipperary North and Westmeath.</P>
    <P>Fifteen of the proposed constituencies are identical in name, area and representation with the existing constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, Cavan-Monaghan, Cork East, Donegal North-East, Donegal South-West, Kerry North, Kerry South, Laois-Offaly, Limerick West, Louth, Sligo-Leitrim, Tipperary North and Tipperary South, Waterford and Wexford.</P>
    <P>The following county boundaries are breached: (a) part of County Clare, population 2,625, is included in the proposed constituency of Limerick East; (b) part of County Kildare, population 10,061, is included in the proposed Wicklow constituency; (c) part of County Galway is included in the Mayo East constituency, population 4,443, and in Mayo West constituency, population 3,868; (d) as at present, part of County Waterford, population 2,661, is included in the constituency of Tipperary South.</P>
    <P>A provincial boundary is breached by joining in a single constituency Counties Longford and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The national average population per Member is 21,329.  The highest number of persons per Member is the prososed constituency of Louth which is identical with the existing constituency and has a population per Member of 22,953, 7.61 per cent above the national average.  The lowest is in the proposed constituency of Tipperary North which, again, is identical with the existing constituency and has an average of 19,841 persons per Member, 6.98 per cent below the national average.</P>
    <P>The first revision of constituencies by an independant commission was carried out in 1980 at which substantial departure from mathematical equality was adopted. The greatest departure from the national average in that revision was 6.4 per cent. In the revision in 1983 the greatest departure was 7.9 per cent.  In the scheme of constituencies proposed by the present Bill the average per Member in the cases <Col N="444" /> of the individual constituencies ranges from 7 per cent below the national average to 7.6 per cent above the present.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to implement the scheme in constituencies recommended by the commission established for the purpose in May last.  The terms of reference given to the commission were in essence the same as those given to the first Dáil Constituency Commission which reported in 1980, identical with those given to the commission which reported in 1983.</P>
    <P>An interesting feature was that the commission, by way of advertisements, invited submissions and 58 submissions were received and considered by the commission.  A list of the persons and organisations who presented submissions is contained in the fourth appendix of the original report.  The commission has no constitutional or statutory standing.  It was established by the Government to advise on the formation of constituencies in accordance with the terms of reference specified by the Government.  The Government have no authority to make recommendations which would be outside or in conflict with the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The constituencies now proposed are those recommended by the commission. Their report was published in full last September.</P>
    <P>The fact that so many people on all sides of the House are dissatisfied with the Bill shows the true independence of the commission's report.  We can see where constituencies of senior Ministers have been torn apart.  This is a clear indication that no collusion whatsoever took place.  It is also quite evident that the report will create many problems for TDs on the Government side.  Contrast this with the silence from the Opposition parties who seemingly are relieved in so far as the vast majority of them will not have a problem.  Again, this lends credence to the independence of the commission. There is no doubt that the members of the commission were, of course, entirely independent in carrying out the task given to them.  They were constrained <Col N="445" /> only by the Constitution and the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill and I would like to say to the Minister that I do not feel hard done by at all as far as the Bill is concerned.  I will not be speaking from any personal viewpoint.  Each time I stood for the local elections, in 1974, 1979 and 1986 the constituency for which I stood was nearly as big as a Dáil constituency and on each occasion it was dramatically and drastically changed.  This, if I am thinking of standing for the Dáil it would be very difficult to carve it up yet again in such a way that it could inconvenience me.  I think it is important that as few changes as possible should be made in constituencies.</P>
      <P>With regard to some very uncomplimentary remarks which were made about the composition of the commission, I take the view that they are very distinguished persons in public service and I certainly would not want to show any doubt about the impartiality with which they carried out their functions. However, I believe that as few changes as possible should be made in constituencies because I know, as I am sure many other public representatives know, the difficulties which people experience with regard even to knowing who are their public representatives.  It is very often the case, particularly in a country area, that if people talk about a problem and you ask if they had been to see their local councillor, they do not know who they are.  Equally, they do not know their Deputies.  The more changes that take place, the more people are pushed around from one constituency into another, them more problems will arise for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also creates very severe problems when the time comes to vote.  Even a simple factor of changing the polling station can, in itself, cause enormous problems for people.  They get confused.  They have been going to one polling booth for a great number of years and they cannot <Col N="446" /> understand if they are told to go somewhere else.  They do not always get their voting card and they turn up at the wrong place.  There is a duty on us public representatives to do everything we can to encourage and facilitate people.  It is part of the democratic process.  The number of people voting in elections is not as high as I think we would like it to be and, for that reason, it is extremely important that we do as little as possible to confuse people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific change which has been made in the Roscommon-Longford constituency, I certainly share the remarks of other speakers.  It appears to breach boundaries in regard to European elections, in regard to provincial and health board boundaries and certainly it must be very confusing.  The fact also that part of the Galway constituency has been put into Mayo has made people in that areas very unhappy.  That will lead to considerable confusion.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the remarks made by Senator Manning with regard to the Norton amendment, the idea of having a single seat constituency with PR, the transferable vote.  I certainly support his comments with regard to the extent to which the present multi-seat constituency encourages clientelism and encourages competition between Deputies, or indeed councillors, for a particular area, It puts an enormous extra and unnecessary burden on the public servants who have to try to deal with repetitive queries.</P>
    <P>With regard to election to the Seanad I greatly regret that the vocational element has gone.  The Seanad is now very heavily party politically controlled.</P>
    <P>The remarks with regard to the university Senators appear to make sense on the surface and I support what Senator Manning said, that at the moment only two of the universities have voting rights, I would be very enthusiastic to see the new universities that have been created entitled to the same rights as the universities that elect Senators at the moment.</P>
    <P>The only Independents in this Chamber are the university Senators and it is now the situation where we have, sadly, <Col N="447" /> a Seanad which is party controlled.  The Dáil, understandably, is party controlled. The nominations for the Presidency, the highest role in the land which is supposed to be non-party political, are party controlled. Worst of all, there is the control of local authorities by parties.  This is something which I bitterly regret because it has a very damaging influence in country areas and, in fact, in the whole country.  The reason for this is very obvious, it is very important for the parties to keep a tight control on local authorities because they, in turn, vote for Senators.  This is something which is damaging and unhealthy to our democracy, and something which I would like to see ended.  I hope the Local Government Reform Bill for which I have been pressing so strenuously, will make some meaningful changes.  I will believe them when I see them.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that there have been so many upheavals, some of them unnecessary.  For that reason I will be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I welcome the Minister to the House this morning.  The Progressive Democrats have no hesitation in supporting the Electoral (Amendment) Bill and I will outline the reasons why that is the case.  Before doing that, I would like to pay tribute to the members of the Boundaries Commission for their enormous contribution to the task of producing the raw material for this Bill.  My party are glad to associate ourselves with tributes to the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we support the Bill, that is not to say that the party and I have not some reservations about it.  We are taken aback by some of its recommendations, some of which we feel are lacking in logic; in fact, some of them have been described as being utterly grotesque.  We cannot have our loaf and eat it.  We wanted an independent commission.  That is what we got and we have to put up with its findings.  The priority above all else is that the commission operates independently, that it be established independently, that it work within terms of reference which <Col N="448" /> are broad enough to allow it to do its job effectively and, having reached its conclusions, we abide by those conclusions.</P>
    <P>I believe an independent commission can only be fully independent if it is given the full resources to carry out its function. It would be preferable for it to have an independent secretariat, so that in all its deliberations it be totally divorced and separate in its working from any Government Department.  It should not be dependent on a Government Department because, obviously, within that framework it is open to certain influences.</P>
    <P>Within the draft constitution which has been prepared by the Progressive Democrats there is incorporated a suggestion that it should be Uachtarán na hÉireann who should be given responsibility for this matter.  There is much merit in that recommendation and I raise it here this morning to emphasise again the multitude of benefits that could accrue from significant and comprehensive constitutional reform.  It is just one of many aspects, some of which we have discussed in this House over recent weeks in relation to the Constitution.  It is quite clear that in this respect and in other respects in relation to Articles 2 and 3 and in relation to how the trend towards European union will put demands on us to hold referenda, that overall constitutional reform is an important question that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the main we are pleased with the recommendations which are in this Bill and its implementation will ensure the continuation in this country of a predominantly fair, proportional and politically inclusive electoral system.  It has been quite clear over the years that the people of Ireland want to maintain that tradition of proportionality which is central to our electoral system and that the rights of minorities to have their voices heard within the Oireachtas, the rights of smaller parties to be represented here, should be enshrined within our electoral system.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to anybody who looks at the British system that is very undesirable <Col N="449" /> that a party which can command quite a significant share of the popular vote can wind up with such a small proportion of seats within the Parliament.  That is not a desirable trend.  It is the foundation of our democratic process that smaller elements within the political system should be represented within the Parliament and a system that can facilitate representation within the Parliament of the widest range of political opinion, protecting in so far as is practicable the democratic rights of the minority within our community, is to be recommended. I would remind the House that the Progressive Democrats have had a strong role in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of public record that as part of the agreed Programme for Government, published in July of last year when the Government were formed, that one of the clauses agreed then and advanced by the Progressive Democrats was the prescription in terms of reference for a commission to review the Dáil constituency boundaries and that those terms of reference would retain to the greatest degree possible the present three, four and five seat constituencies and would effect minimum changes in the present layout.  The final outcome of the report has been faithful to those requirements.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended and the Bill proposes the arrangement of 41 Dáil constituencies made up of 14 five seaters, 15 four seaters and 12 three seaters. That compares with the present pattern of 15 five seaters, 13 four seaters and 13 three seaters.  There is very little difference in the overall make-up of the constituencies and that, of course, is within the terms of reference within the report.</P>
    <P>That can be contrasted with the arrangement that was arrived at by the 1988 boundary commission which took its terms of reference from a single party minority government.  The commission recommended a reduction in the number of five seat constituencies from 15 to five and there would have been 21 four seaters and 19 three seaters.  That underlines the undesirability of a single party drawing up the terms of reference under which a <Col N="450" /> commission would operate.  It is an important principle that should not be the remit of a single party to do that because any party in power or any party who feel that they are in a position to affect the outcome as to what the boundaries should be, to their own advantage, will try to copperfasten that system and to see to it that their own position will be upheld by the report.  That is not in the national interest and it is not in the interest of the Parliament.  It is clear that within Northern Ireland over many years some of the very serious difficulties there were created by the desire of a single party to copperfasten this electoral position forever.  The word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; originated from that part of the country.  For that reason, it is imperative that there should be an independent method of establishing what the boundaries should be and that they should conform to the requirements of the Constitution in relation to the number of people represented by a Deputy within the Dáil.  Happily, for healthy democracy and the survival of smaller parties the package which was recommended in 1988 was stillborn.</P>
    <P>What the Progressive Democrats secured in prescribing the terms of reference for the 1990 commission was a repeat of terms of reference used in 1979 and repeated in the early eighties and in the view of politicians and commentators generally, that served the country well and produced a pattern of Dáil constituencies which was broadly fair, proportional and accommodating of the diverse range of democratic political opinion within the country.  The key provisions, therefore, of the terms of reference guiding the 1990 boundary commission included the vital provision ordaining &ldquo;the retention of the traditional pattern of three seat, four seat, and five seat constituencies and the desirability of effecting the minimum changes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats can take a degree of pride in the fact that we have been able to influence the continuation of this broad based, fair and proportional constituency alignment across the country.  The people generally and the <Col N="451" /> various political parties will acknowledge, at least in private if not in public, the very worthwhile role we have played in this regard.</P>
    <P>Given that the task of revising the constituencies was left exclusively to the constituency commission, there is no option but to accept their findings.  However, the Progressive Democrats would be dismayed to some degree by some of the recommendations.  We find them incomprehensible, particularly the retention of the existing two three seat constituencies in Mayo when most people presumed that the logical outcome would have been the creation of a single five seat constituency in that county.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy, in a radio broadcast shortly after the publication of the commission's findings, said that he thought this all originated from one parish and he could tell us the parish.  He did not do so but the inference was that it was in Mayo and that everything spread from that parish.  That may not be a very realistic interpretation but there is widespread public disquiet about the fact that Mayo was left in two three seaters, given that geographical surgery was required to achieve this by bolstering up the two Mayo constituencies in numerical terms through the addition of parts of Galway West and Galway East.  That led to a domino effect across the country and led to the creation of this political hybrid which everybody speaks about and which I am sure the Cathaoirleach would very much like to speak about if he had access to the floor of the House, that is, the political hybrid of Roscommon-Longford which breaches not only county but provincial boundaries.  It breaches the boundaries for the European election.  There are only two points of geographical contact between the two counties, two bridges across the Shannon.  It does not seem sensible, even within the terms of reference of the report, to have carried out that type of surgery.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Kildare, people find it extraordinary that towns like Kilcullen, Castledermot and Ballymore <Col N="452" /> Eustace have now been attached to Wicklow and they are wondering how they can be represented by public representatives who come from Bray or Greystones. Equally, the people of Bray or Greystones might wonder why they might be represented by people from Kilcullen or Castledermot.  We will require an election to establish that.  It is not in anybody's interest that representatives within that area would be elected to Kildare County Council and might subsequently find themselves representing in the Dáil their constituents in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>In the terms of reference (b) says that geographical consideration should be taken into account and (c) says that other well-established characteristics in the formation of constituencies, such as clearly defined natural features, should be taken into account.  The biggest natural feature in Wicklow is the mountains.  Traditionally, the towns of Blessington, Baltinglass and Dunlavin would have related much more closely to east Kildare than they have to east Wicklow and the towns around the coast.  I can recall from the time I was employed by the County Committee of Agriculture in Kildare that the offices in Naas were shared by the advisers from west Wicklow.  This was one of the things that underlined the traditional association between west Wicklow and east Kildare.  While it would not have been to my personal advantage, it would have been a much more logical thing for Kildare to have been divided into two three-seaters with west Wicklow attached leaving Wicklow as a four-seater rather than to do what has been done, to have Wicklow advanced to a five-seater by the attachment of part of Kildare, and Kildare left as a five-seater.  It would have been much more logical to append Leixlip to part of Dublin, given that that town is very much a dormitory town of Dublin. Just as west Wicklow looks to east Kildare, Leixlip relates much more closely to urban Dublin than it does to rural Kildare.  They are local matters and matters of disquiet to me.  They may not be matters of immense national interest but they are certainly matters that <Col N="453" /> interest the people of the towns of Kilcullen, Castledermot, Ballymore Eustace, Moone and so on.  They are quite unhappy about the proposed arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am also aware there is disquiet with some of the realignments in the north Dublin area which do not seem to make a lot of sense either.  Having agreed to the establishment of such a commission, we are left with no choice but to accept its findings.  It appears that the commission's report was not unanimous.  Perhaps that indicates reservations such as those I have raised here this morning, that some of the conclusions are somewhat bizarre and illogical.  Whereas the concluding sentence of the first chapter of the 1988 commission's report stated that it represented the unanimous recommendations of all members of the commission, this conclusion is notable for its absence from this year's commission reports and it begs the question whether the commission's findings were unanimous or were merely a majority decision. We regard it as a very important principle that the commission would be independent. That was established; it was independent and on that basis we have no choice but to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to this House.  I would also like to pay tribute to the members of the commission, some of whom we know quite well and one of whom worked in this House up to recently.  Obviously they had a very difficult task.  One could say that an added term of reference was included, namely, &ldquo;Provided you leave Mayo with two three-seaters you can do what you like after that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some aspects of the report are hard to comprehend but we have to accept it as it is.  We all have our reservations and we may not like some aspects of it but we must accept the position that the report is there and we cannot amend it.  Those of us who have fought elections are always concerned when our constituencies are to be changed or boundaries redrawn.  My good friend and colleague here from Galway would probably have spent a lot <Col N="454" /> longer in the other House if part of his area had not been cut in half which virtually ensured that there would not be enough votes to elect him an a particular constituency.</P>
    <P>The Mayo position is a bit difficult to comprehend in the fact that there could have been a five-seater there and one would not then have to breach county boundaries.  Instead, there is land from parts of Galway.  One could also look at the position in Longford-Roscommon. There is nothing wrong with linking up constituencies &mdash; we have had Carlow-Kilkenny and the Minister's own constituency of Laois-Offaly and Sligo Leitrim &mdash; but in relation to Longford-Roscommon where you are breaching Euro-constituencies, provincial boundaries and where the Shannon divides the constituency, for those of us who are interested in politics as a possible bloodletting exercise, certain heavyweights of all parties will be jousting for the seats involved there.  I am glad I will not be one of the people jousting with some formidable people on the different sides. All one can do is wish all of them the best of luck.  No doubt people in Longford will be digging up roots in Roscommon and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The whole question of multi-seat constituencies has got to be looked at.  While, proportionally, it brings about a fairer and more equitable distribution in relation to what the public wants and what the elecorate decide, it does bring up other problems and I will mention a couple of them briefly.  First, in relation to multi-seat constituencies &mdash; I had the privilege of representing a five-seater constituency but on two occasions I missed out representing it by a handful of votes &mdash; five-seaters in particular bring a lot of inter-rivalary between the TDs for an area both in and outside the party. I recall somebody calling to my clinic, after he had been with another TD, and showing me the literature and efforts by the other TD to make progress in relation to this point.  Obviously it was a difficult problem because most of us will try and do our best in relation to the problem.  I thought I had done quite well in talking <Col N="455" /> to him and when he was leaving he asked me what time another TD held his clinic. I said to myself: &ldquo;We will be lucky to get one-fifth of a vote each at the end of the day.&rdquo;  It does bring certain problems. Numbers of letters can be written to a Department about one problem by TDs and Senators when one phone call could possibly have solved the problem in the first place.  That aspect has got to be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of a person on about 8 or 9 per cent getting elected in a five-seater, as happened in one or two constituencies the last time.  As happened in the eighties, it could end up with us having five elections in a short time. While it is up to the public to decide what they want, the vast majority of the electorate did not want five elections in a period such as that.  In fact, in the early eighties we had three elections within 18 months.  The problem is that one individual can literally hold the country to ransom or bring down the country. Then you have the knock-on effects in relation to a stable market and stable economy.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that there be an election every so often and that the people have a right to change their Government or put in whatever form of Government they want.  It is probable that in many elections in the eighties, particularly the last two, the public in the main decided that they wanted a Fianna Fáil Government but not a Fianna Fáil Government with an overall majority.  I know Members opposite may not have liked that but one must play by the rules and accept what the electorate decides. None of us here will always agree with what an election result throws up.  People have lost out in certain cases but until we find a better system we must abide by what we have in operation.  I do not think it right that one or two individuals can hold the country to ransom or bring down the Government or cause all the instability attendent thereon.  A few weeks ago when there were rumblings of an election the only people looking forward to it were the printers, provided they <Col N="456" /> could get paid because elections are costing more and more.  A matter to be looked at is how much is being spent on elections.  It is rumoured that in recent elections some people spent twice a TDs salary trying to get elected.  Possibly people could but their way in.  That whole area of funding of elections and funding of political parties has got to be looked at.  In days of high expenses some State funding, perhaps based on party support, has got to be considered.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole question of multi-seat constituencies, too much time can be spent carrying out a job more appropriate to a messenger rather than a legislative role which one would hope we are all primarily here to do.  While other matters have got to be looked at and problems dealt with, too much time can be spent on the phone to Departments, to local authorities and so on trying to get various problems solved and not enough time is spent in the House introducing and discussing legislation.  It is important that we look at these aspects.</P>
    <P>The commission had a difficult job because they have to stick to the terms of providing a number of three, four and five-seaters, trying as far as possible not to breach county boundaries, trying to maintain a certain proportionality.  In many areas the commission have got it right.  There are obviously areas which have been mentioned, for instance, Mayo, Longford, Roscommon, and Senator Dardis mentioned putting parts of Kildare in with Wicklow, and other counties where a few thousands votes had to be put in.  It was difficult for the commission to arrive at a conclusion that would be universally acceptable but there are certain areas in which it is difficult, logically, to indicate how they arrived at their decisions.</P>
    <P>In respect of multi-seat constituencies, it is important that there be a certain proportion of three, four and five-seat constituencies.  What emerged in the eighties where no party got an overall majority &mdash; an occurrence likely to recur in that it will be very difficult for any one party to reach the elusive 84 seats &mdash; should be examined.  The government <Col N="457" /> who had the biggest majority after the buy-out in 1977 found that majority was a major problem in that they found themselves hamstrung in their duties because so many backbenchers became worried about losing their seats.  It is important that a government should have a working majority, so that they can carry out difficult decisions, govern for a period and then be judged on their performance. That is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take into account some of the points raised.  There will come a time when we will have to look at how we do our business, how we arrive at an effective electoral system when other systems have been considered in relation to the single transferable vote. What pertains in England is not right, where a smaller party can get so many million votes but only a handful of seats while another party with less than 40 per cent support can end up with an overall majority on a first-pass-the-post system. I thank the commission for doing what was a very difficult task.  In some areas it is very difficult to explain how they arrived at a particular decision but we either accept it as a package or we do not.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief because I intend to confine my remarks to that area of the commission's report dealing with my own constituency of east Galway.  It is normal for a Member, particularly from the Government side of the House, to welcome a Bill but on this occasion I cannot welcome this Bill because, once again, Galway has been singled out for mutilation by the commission. During my whole political career I have seen my constituency of east Galway change from a five-seater to a four-seater to a three-seater.  At one stage I represented part of Roscommon and east Galway.  Then the famous &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo; took place which took away Roscommon and left us a four-seater constituency in east Galway and that was fine.  At least there was no breaching of county boundaries and we were all happy.  Then along comes the first independent commission and they decided <Col N="458" /> in their wisdom to breach our county boundaries and put about 4,500 of our voters from north-east Galway into Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I was one of the people who knew when I supported that Electoral Bill in 1978 that I was effectively signing away my Dáil seat because the commission had taken away 4,500 of my votes to create a three-seater constituency in Roscommon. This is a terrible disruption to any TD because they find when they are faced with a situation like that that the work they have been doing over the years and the support they have built up is no longer of any use to them.  Naturally it is a disruption and it is a disappointment for the electorate also because they find themselves in with a new county.  They find themselves being represented by new Members and it is not always the most satisfactory situation for them.  If that kind of treatment was handed out to any other professional person, there would be an outcry from unions and others but the TD has to sing dumb because if he criticises it he will be accused of undermining the independence of the commission.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill I was delighted to see that the part of Galway which was included with Roscommon since the last revision is now being returned to east Galway &mdash; places such as Kiltevnagh, Williamstown, Ballymoe, Glensk and Creggs.  However, I am horrified to find that the commission has once again mutilated Galway and decided to transfer 4,443 of our voters in with east Mayo. When this Bill goes through, the district electoral divisions of Adrigool, Belclare, Dunberry, Foxhall, Kilbennon, Killeen and Kilshandy and, of course, Milltown, all of which were in the former rural district of Tuam will now find themselves in with east Mayo, a constituency stretching from Killala to Tuam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to say, the public representatives from east Galway are most disappointed with this decision, but this disappointment fades into insignificance when compared with the outrange felt by the electorate of those particular district electoral divisions.  What is happening <Col N="459" /> here is far more serious than many people realise because we are not just taking our 4,343 people and lumping them into another county.  We are dismembering the town of Tuam, cutting away its props because east Mayo now extends right into the town boundary of Tuam.  This is happening when I, and other Oireachtas Members from east Galway, are doing our utmost to find industry for that town, to give it a status it is entitled to as the biggest town in our constituency.  Why, then, did the commission decide on this line of action?  I hope the Minister will give me some answers.  It is not just enough to say to me or to the people of east Galway that are affected that Mayo did not have sufficient population to retain six seats.  That is their hard luck but why should Galway have to suffer as a result?</P>
    <P>I submit that Galway could have been changed to a nine-seater and so avoid breaching the county boundaries.  I am certain that Galway is much nearer &mdash; or within the guidlines &mdash; for nine seats than Mayo was for six.  Why then was this option not pursued?  I hope the Minister will give me answers to those questions because it is not just me, but the people of Tuam and its hinterland who are affected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed census of population next year and I hope the injustice done to Galway will be redressed as a matter of urgency when the census is carried out.  I said I would confine my remarks to the area of the report which affects me and I am sure the Minister understands my feelings on this matter and the feelings of the people I represent. It is my duty to express these feelings openly and frankly today.  It is the only opportunity one has to do so and I am glad to have put my views on record.</P>

      <P>If it happens that Senator Hussey feels he will be bound in conscience having said what he said, to vote against the Bill, I will offer the Government my support because I am going to vote for the Bill on the grounds <Col N="460" /> that the report of the independent commissioners really has to be accepted.  In university situations we are sometimes faced with similar problems in regard to an assessors's board.  I take the point that this commission were not apparently, unanimous, but if a board of experts is set up to consider candidates for a post, for example, and a majority of the members of the academic staff do not like that particular decision, nonetheless they are in duty bound and in the terms of enlightened self-interest to support that decision.  Otherwise, the integrity and credentials not only of that board of assessors but of all future boards of assessors is under question.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the only logic of those who criticise this Bill is to criticise the commissioners and, by implication, to impugn either their integrity or their competence.  That is the logic of the attitude of those who oppose the Bill.  You cannot please all of the people obviously. As Senator Dardis pointed out, the changes are not all that great except of course, the shoe pinches certain people. I am sorry about that.  Senator Dardis is obviously concerned with a rather Utopian hope that he is going to make a mark in Kildare the next time round.  Senator Hussey's prospects are more realistic but are now, apparently, dashed by this development.</P>
      <P>I would query one point that Senator Hussey made.  He said that the town of Tuam is going to be taken out of his jurisdiction just at a time when there was never more need to press for industry and jobs and so on.  There are two fallacies here, one that it is TDs who get the jobs and industry for a particular area and the other is that whoever comes to cultivate that particular vineyard will work at it as assiduously as Senator Hussey has done in the past.  Tá seanfhocal ann gurb é a chúram féin a dhéanann buairt do gach eínne.  I take that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not familiar enough with the area west of the Shannon to express any opinion what seems to be a very common emphasis, the situation in Roscommon, Longford, Galway and Mayo.  I recall my own town of Macroom and I have taken <Col N="461" /> a very personal interest in elections there ever since boyhood belonged to every possible division of Cork you could possibly think of, west Cork, north-west Cork, mid-Cork and south Cork, but it did not prevent it being ably represented in Dáil Éireann throughout all that period.  I think blaming the commission is rather like shooting the messengers. In principle, I will be certainly glad to support this Bill.</P>
    <P>The other curious point is that Senators are discussing this Bill in such enthusiastic detail.  In an ideal Seanad the only interest which Senators would have in this Bill would be purely academic, namely, that they would be concerned naturally that electoral representation in the other House in as good as possible. They would not be saying, &ldquo;This destroys my changes of getting back there&rdquo;.  All too often here we have this revelation of naked self-interest on the part of Senators.  I suppose we have to credit them with honesty.  The other day when we were paying tribute to the departing Clerk of the Seanad, Senator after Senator wished him well in the other House and hoped shortly to follow him. That revelation may be honest but it is very revealing of the whole misconception of what the role of this House should be and its prostitution as an anteChamber to the other House.</P>

      <P>No, indeed, and I will now put on record that Senator Honan is an illustrious exception to the remarks I have just made because her total commitment has always been to this House.  I hope I get something in return for that glowing tribute.  Mention has been made of the so-called Norton amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been making the point that the interest of Senators in this Bill should be simply that of a concerned interest that the Electoral <Col N="462" /> (Amendment) Bill should be acceptable, that the work of the commission has accorded with its terms of reference and in general a concern that arrangements for the elections to the other House are acceptable.  However, as we know and has been only too evident in the speeches here, individual Senators have an interest above and beyond that.  I was making the point it is regrettable that, quite unashamedly and nakedly, Members of this House reveal all to often that their only concern is to use this house as a springboard to go back to the Dáil.  That is deplorable.</P>
      <P>I was referring to the so-called Norton amendment.  It is of interest that Deputy Stagg has revived this idea, because the so-called Norton amendment was named after Deputy Patrick Norton and apparently the idea has taken some root in Kildare.  There is a lot to be said for the view that there should be more radical provision of the whole representation and that the present unsatisfactory system of competing Deputies in a multiseat constituency should be replaced by one individual who is the undisputed Member for a constituency but who can also claim that he is not there simply by being first past the post, that he is really the choice of a sophisticated electorate, with PR taken into account.  There is much to be said for that system, but that is work for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the larger implications of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, the point has been made that there is no great change intended here, that there will still be maintained the relative distribution of large seat and small seat constituencies and that the effect must be &mdash; and this is a tribute to the Government who are bringing in the Bill &mdash; to preserve more or less the <i>status quo</i> in electoral terms. No longer will it be possible for any Government to manage the electoral scene to benefit themselves.  It never was possible, anyway.  Even in the most skilfully stage managed days of gerrymandering, sometimes these gerrymanders, as we know, boomeranged. There is no electoral system which <Col N="463" /> will present the popular will from expressing itself.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious now that the prospect of an overall majority for Fianna Fáil is very remote indeed.  I would say that you would get better odds now on Fianna Fáil ever again getting an overall majority than you would get on Cork winning the double again for 1991.  I hope so fervently.  Overall majorities are very much the exception in Irish electoral history.  I think I am right in saying that overall majorities have been achieved only five or six times out of 23 elections and then only when there was a really undisputed and unchallenged charismatic leader in Fianna Fáil, agus ní raibh a leithéid ann ó shin i leith.  In regard to the self-deception of Fianna Fáil at the moment, that all they need to do is to work hard and add another 3 or 4 per cent to the hypothetical 43 per cent they have, I really think they are deceiving themselves &mdash; and I think it is a good job, too.</P>
    <P>There is much about the Progressive Democrats that irritates me, not least their hypocritical presence in this House, but I am glad they are in Government.  I think Fianna Fáil need an internal corrective. Whatever other changes this Bill makes, it is not going to make it any easier to achieve what is now becoming the impossible.</P>
    <P>Overall, I repeat that I support this Bill.  The suggestion has been made that this commission has not been entirely independent.  The allegation is that one of the members was politically influenced. I must say I deplore these innuendoes, which will always be made no matter how impeccable the composition of such a commission.  The fact is that the commission has reported, its recommendations are now promoted by the Government in this Bill and I am very glad indeed to support them.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I should really welcome it even more now since I have arrived at the stage, for the first time since 1977, that Senator Murphy has been kind to me, has paid <Col N="464" /> me a tribute and, more astonishingly, he has praised the Chief.  It must be the end of the world or something.</P>

      <P>I thank him sincerely.  I would also like to thank the Minister, Deputy Connolly.  This morning Senator Manning paid tribute to him for his commitment to this House and I would like to support absolutely my colleague, Senator Manning, in that tribute to the Minister.</P>
      <P>This legislation affects Senators.  It affects us in a very major way, because every time we have a general election it decides who goes down to the other House and who arrives on our panels back up here again, for whatever period that might be.</P>
      <P>A nice thing about the Seanad is the freedom we have here as party members. Senator Hussey could stand up here this morning and say how strongly he felt about this Bill in regard to how Galway has been dealt with in this legislation. That is something you do not get in the Dáil.  Senator Hussey has strong views on it, but he felt he had the freedom here this morning to voice those views.  That is welcome.</P>
      <P>Some Senators will have more of an interest in this because of the realignment of constituencies.  I understand the Commission has been at all times completely independent, even though there have been insinuations &mdash; not meant, but just insinuations &mdash; that it may not have been completely independent.  I understand the commission was given the constitutional requirements and terms of reference. I would understand that to be Minister Flynn's role, or the government's role, I am not quite sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made here this morning to the famous Norton amendment. At that time I felt deeply about it when it was not successful.  It was my husband, Derry who was serving at the time.  I think it would have changed the whole Irish political scene.  We would have had less vying with each other in constituencies for survival, which has <Col N="465" /> happened all too often.  In many constituencies you have very good relationships, but in some constituencies you do not.  As one of my colleagues said here this morning, people come to all of us in all parties to get something done.  They will hand you a letter and say &ldquo;That is the reply such a person got from a Minister. Perhaps you could do better&rdquo;.  That is the reality of political life in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation.  I do not have any choice.  I must comment, however, on the reviews that should take place. The independence of university Senators in this House always defeats me.  They seem to think at times that we should not be here, that the plebs should not be here.  Let me tell the university Senators that we are directly elected by people who have been directly elected by the people of this nation &mdash; all 43 of us.  The university Senators should take a look at themselves and at who elects them.  We are directly elected by the people of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in his speech this morning that the commission is only an advisory body and that the Constitution places the responsibility of revising the Constituencies on the Oireachtas.  Therefore, any revision of boundaries or constituencies is our responsibility and not that of any private body.  I pay tribute to the commission because of its composition. We paid tribute to one of them in the last few weeks.  On the basis of those of them I know &mdash; certainly a former colleague of mine, Dr. T.K. Whitaker, and of course, Kieran Coughlan &mdash; indeed, looking at the names of the members of the Commission nobody could say but that they were independent.</P>
    <P>I also noted that there have been since 1923 nine revisions of constituencies and only one of those, the revision in 1959, was found to be unconstitutional. Revisions seem to go on all the time.  The Minister saw fit to take away a piece at the bottom end of Clare and give it into Limerick city.  I would hate to tell you to whose advantage that is.</P>

Is trua liom nach bhfuil an tAire Comhshaoil, an Teachta Flynn, anseo, mar ba mhaith liom go n-éisteodh sé le cuid de na rudaí atá le rá agam agus cuid de na ceisteanna a bheidh agam.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an deis agam é a fheiceáil ansin romham amach, ina chraiceann, go bhféadfainn labhairt leis go pearsanta faoi, mar eisean atá freagrach as an mBille seo a bheith os ár gcomhair anseo inniu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa chéad dul síos, caithfimid mar pháirtithe, is cuma cén taobh lena mbainimid, fáilte a chur roimh an choimisiún mar is <Col N="467" /> dream neamhspleách iad agus ceapadh daoine ar an gcoimisiún a dhéanfaidh an rud seo a scrúdú ar bhonn neamhspleách. Mura bhfuilimid sásta glacadh leis go bhfuil an obair neamhspleách ní dóigh liom go mbeidh aon bhonn nó cos le seasamh againn le rud ar bith.  Mar sin, tá orainn glacadh le saothar an choimisiúin. Mura nglacaimid leis nílimid ag glacadh leis an bprionsabal neamhspleáchais.</P>
    <P>Ar bhealach is rud acadúil é glacadh leis an toradh atá os ár gcomhair anseo inniu.  Tá sé acadúil sa mhéid go bhfuil toradh an neamhspleáchais seo curtha ar fáil agus glactha leis ag chuile pháirtí sa Dáil.  Ach é sin ráite agam, níl fáth ar bith ann nach mbeimid criticiúil faoi chuid den Bhille.  Ní hionann a rá go nglacaimid le rud de bharr go bhfuil sé neamhspleách agus nach bhféadaimid mar Sheanadóirí bheith criticiúil faoin mBille.  Ach amháin go gcreidim go láidir go bhfuil an saothar neamhspleách agus go bhfuil an coimisiún neamhspleách bheadh amhras orm faoin mBille.  An fáth go mbeadh amhras chomh mór sin orm ná; go bhfeicim an chaoi a bhfuil, Contae Mhaigh agus áiteanna mar sin ag teacht isteach sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Ach amháin go raibh an coimisiún ann, d'fhéadfaí a rá go han-simplí go raibh fábhar i gceist ag an Aire agus go raibh sé in ann an fábhar sin a chur ag obair. Ach is trí thimpiste a tharla sé go raibh jab le déanamh i gContae Mhaigh Eo, agus is trí thimpiste a tharla go raibh an tAire Comhshaoil istigh i gContae Mhaigh Eo ag an am céanna.  Mar sin, níl ann ach timpiste nó coincidence, mar a deirtear i mBéarla, gur tharla go bhfuil Aire ann go bhfuil baint mhór aige leis na hathruithe a rinne an coimisiún.  Is é an fáth go ndeirim é seo ná, mar a dúirt duine éigin sa Teach eile, ceapaim, tá anchosúlacht air seo gur tharla sé seo thiar i bparóiste éigin i gContae Mhaigh Eo agus gur socraíodh in áit éigin go ndéanfaí athruithe dá réir; gur imigh sé uaidh sin go dtí an contae, go dtí an cúige agus ansin go dtí an coimisiún agus anois tá sé os ár gcomhair anseo inniu; agus go bhféadfaí a rá faoi gur tharla athruithe <Col N="468" /> nach mbeifeá ag súil leo sa ghnáthshlí.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht go géar le óráid an Seanadóir Hussey ar maidin.  Tá an-mheas agam air, agus bhí le blianta fada anuas, agus caithfidh mé a rá nach dóigh liom go bhfuil aon chomhalta sa Teach seo ná sa Teach eile go ndearnadh an oiread sin dochair dó go pearsanta agus a rinne an coimisiún seo ó bunaíodh é. Mar a dúirt sé féin, chuaigh sé trí sheal i nGaillimh Thoir nuair a bhí cúigear Teachtaí Dála sa Dáilcheantar, sul a raibh ceathrar nó triúr ann.  Rinneadh go leor athruithe sa Dáilcheantar sin.  Ba é an t-am ba mheasa, dar ndóigh, nuair a tharla sé gur baineadh coiméal breá mór de thuaisceart na Gaillimhe agus gur cuireadh isteach é le Ros Comáin.  Bhain Sé an bonn iomlán a bhí ag Teachta Dála a bhí ina shuí anseo agus a bhí ag déanamh sárobair don cheantar sin.  D'fhéadfadh duine argóint a dhéanamh anseo go mba dhrochrud é an comisiún a cheadaigh a leithéid sin de rud.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Seanadóir go raibh sé de mhisneach aige anseo ar maidin seasamh agus a rá go raibh sé míshásta leis, nár thaitin sé leis agus go ndearna sé an dochar sin dó.  Tá an rud tarlaithe arís an turas seo, ach is measa fós an scéal.  Ní amháin go bhfuil dochar déanta do Ghaillimh Thoir ach is amhlaidh an scéal le Gaillimh Thiar.  Tá mé criticiúil faoi thoradh obair an choimisiúin go ndearnadh an t-athrú sin, mar go bhfuil sé ráite go raibh na téarmaí tagartha leagtha amach go soiléir, agus, go deimhin, tá siad.  Rinneadh cur isteach mór ansin i gcás na Gaillimhe, mar shampla, i dtéarmaí B, C agus E.  Sin trí chinn de na téarmaí a bhí ag an gCoimisiún seo i gcás na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Is dócha nach bhfuil aon neart again air, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Honan ar ball: tá an rud seo áitiúil don té a mbaineann sé leis.  Bhíomar ag éisteacht ansin roimh am lóin nuair a bhí Seanadóirí ag caint ar Chill Dara agus mar sin de ach an t-athrú is mó agus is bunúsaí dá ndearnadh, rinneadh i gContae na Gaillimhe é chun freastal ar Chontae Mhaigh Eo.  Ní thuigim é seo, agus lochtaím an Coimisiún nach raibh siad sásta glacadh leis na <Col N="469" /> téarmaí a bhí acu agus Maigh Eo a fhágáil mar a bhí sé, ó thaobh contae de, agus Gaillimh a fhágáil mar a bhí sé, ó thaobh contae de.</P>
    <P>Is é an fáth go bhfuil mé ag rá sin ná gur ndúirt an coimisiún anseo ar leathanach 11 den tuarascáil, gur thóg siad Contae na Mí, siar go Maigh Eo agus Gaillimh, mar aonad, agus b'shin drochlá oibre a leithéid a dhéanamh.  Ní dhéanfaí é sin murach go raibh sé daingnithe istigh in aigne an choimisiúin go gcaithfí sé shuíochán, nó trí cinn bheith i ngach ceann den dá thoghcheantar i nGaillimh, Thiar agus Thoir, go gcaithfeadh triúr Teachta Dála teacht as gach aon cheann den dá dháilcheantar sin.  Tá roinnt staidéir déanta agam ar na figiúirí agus, i mo thuairimse níor ghá dul, a bheag nó a mhór, go Contae na Mí.  Creidim go bhféadfaí, mar shampla, Maigh Eo agus Ros Comáin a thabhairt le chéile.  Má bhreathnaíonn tú ar na figiúirí, dá gcuirteá Ros Comáin agus Maigh Eo le chéile, agus dá dá mbeadh ceathrar i Maigh Eo agus ceathrar i Ros Comáin, ní bheadh aon ghá le dul in aice le Gaillimh, in aice le Longfort, le Contae na Mí nó na hiarmhí, agus bheifí laistigh den méid a bhí ceadaithe ó thaobh daonra de.</P>
    <P>Dá bhfágfaí Maigh Eo agus Ros Comáin ní bheadh gá ach le teorainn chontae amháin a bhriseadh.  Dheanfaí athrú istigh i gContae Mhaigh Eo, idir Thoir agus Thiar, agus chuirfí cuid de Mhaigh Eo isteach le Ros Comáin.  Ach, de bharr an rud a rinneadh, síneadh amach soir thar an tSionainn agus rinneadh go leor leor cur isteach ar na gnéithe aiceanta, na natural features.  Is é an trua gur tharla é sin mar rinne sé an-dochar do mhuintir na Gaillimhe, Mhaigh Eo, Ros Comáin, Longfort agus don Mhí.</P>
    <P>Chuir sé iontas orm go raibh an tAire Fuinnimh, an Teachta Robert Molloy, a fuair cuid mhaith vótaí i gceantar na Gaillimhe Thiar sa toghchán deireanach, sásta droim láimhe a thabhairt do na daoine sin uilig agus dul isteach sa Dáil agus iad a vótáil amach as a gcontae féin, isteach go Maigh Eo.  Cuirfidh Sé iontas orm freisin má tá éinne anseo, agus an Seanadóir Ó Cuív san áireamh, sásta cuid de mhuintir na Gaillimhe a vótáil amach <Col N="470" /> as Contae na Gaillimhe agus iad a vótáil isteach i gContae Mhaigh Eo.  Tá treoir tugtha anseo a bhí an-cheart agus andíreach agus an-éasca gan an cineál sin roinnte a dhéanamh.  Tá sé déanta agus tá sé tar éis cur isteach mór a dhéanamh ar an chothromaíocht atá anois ann.</P>
    <P>Baile mór ar nós bhaile Thuama i gContae na Gaillimhe, tá se scoite amach anois ón chuid eile den chontae, d'fhéadfá a rá.  Beidh muintir Killala agus muintir Thuama anois ag plé leis na Teachtaí Dála céanna, a bheidh ag freastal an dá thrá sin.  Níl aon chiall ag baint lena leithéid sin.  Is rud é atá déanta agus cuireann sé iontas orm, ó thaobh chomhairle contae de, go mbeidh an tAire Fuinnimh ag dul suas do áiteanna i Maigh Eo ag iarraidh vótaí le é a chur ar an chomhairle chontae.  An amhlaidh go bhfuil sé i gceist aige gan seasamh sa chéad toghchán eile agus, é sin a bheith déanta aige, go mbeidh sé sásta é a ghearradh amach ar fad agus go bhfágfar i gContae Mhaigh Eo é.  Go bunúsach, sin iad na rudaí a fheicim go háitiúil, mar baineann na rudaí seo go háitiúil linn uilig.</P>
    <P>Níor mhairth liom nach mbeadh tagairt sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil do mhuintir na Gaillimhe agus dúinn féin bheith in aghaidh a leithéid sin d'athrú, ach tá mé sásta go raibh an coimisiún ag saothrú go neamhspleách, bíodh go bhfuil a mhalairt le rá ag daoine eile faoi.</P>

Creidim gur masla dóibh siúd tabhairt le fios go raibh aon chineál socruithe ann le duine ar bith a chosaint, bíodh sé ina Aire nó ina dhuine ar bith eile.  Tá iomlán muiníne agamsa as neamhspleáchas an dreama a ceapadh ar an gCoimisiún.</P>

    <P>D'fhéadfaimis go leor ama a chaitheamh at plé cúrsaí leagan amach na dtoghcheantar. D'fhéadfaí, mar shampla, ceist a chur orm, an bhfeileann sé go bhfuil dáilcheantair le líon difriúil suíochán iontu &mdash; trí, ceathair agus cúig &mdash; agus, mar a ardaíodh ar maidin, is <Col N="471" /> dócha go bhféadfaí breathnú arís ar an gcóras vótála atá againn agus an tionchar atá aige sin ar an tír.</P>
    <P>Ag plé thuarascáil an choimisiúin seo ar na suíocháin Dála, b'fhéidir nár mhiste dúinn anois breathnú go géar ar na suíocháin don Seanad, agus go mórmhór na suíocháin ollscoile agus a chinntiú gur gearr go mbeidh ionadaíocht ag na hollscoileanna ar fad sa Seanad.  Feictear domsa, má cheaptar coimisiún agus má thugtar le tuiscint gur coimisiún neamhspleách é, tá sé fánach tosú ag casaoid ansin faoin toradh nuair nach bhfeileann sé.  Cinnte, i mo chás-sa, agus i gcás duine ar bith i nGaillimh, níl sé an-fheiliúnach go bhfuil daonra an chontae sa chaoi anois nach bhfuil dóthain ann do naonúr agus go bhfuil an iomarca ann d'ochtar. Tá mé ag súil, leis an bhfás agus leis an bhforás atá ag teacht ar dhaonra na Gaillimhe, go mórmhór cathair na Gaillimhe, gur gearr go mbeidh naoi suíochán againn i nGaillimh.</P>
    <P>Ach é sin ráite, tá fíricí áirithe ann.  Tá go leor daoine tar éis a rá go mba cheart go mbeadh toghcheantar chúig shuíochán i gContae Mhaigh Eo, agus sa chéad tuarascáil a chuir an coimisiún amach i 1988, tá sé ráite ansin, dá ndéanfaí é sin go mbeadh an líon daoine 8 faoin gcéad os cionn an mheáin agus go mbeadh sé sin taobh amuigh de théarmaí tagartha an Choimisiúin.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, chaithfinnse a rá, mar dhuine atá ina chónaí i gceann de na dáilcheantair is mó sa tír, nach bhfeileann sé ach oiread go mbeadh toghcheantair chúig shuíochan i gceantair scaipthe daonra.  Séard a chiallaíonn sé ná go mbeidh ceantar ollmhór le taisteal ag Teachtaí Dála, agus ní ceart deannad a dhéanamh, ar ndóigh, go dtoghtar duine mar Theachta Dála do thoghcheantar iomlán.</P>
    <P>As I said, the situation regarding Mayo and Galway from a Galway point of view is very unfortunate.  I particularly am very disappointed that the parts of the constituency geographically nearest to myself on the eastern side of the lake, that is the parishes of Ceahalestrane and Headford, are to be transferred to Mayo <Col N="472" /> but I would reject that there was any collusion in this.  It was the decision of an independent commission and, as far as I am concerned, if an independent commission are established to make recommendations we should recognise their independence.  We have very little choice going down that road but to accept the recommendations of such a commission.</P>
    <P>I would also like to put on the record that there were very good and cogent reasons given in the original report, that is the 1988 report, as to why County Mayo could not be a five seater constituency. A part of County Mayo would have had to be, in those circumstances, transferred to either Galway or Roscommon because it would have been over the national average and the tolerance.  I have reservations about two things: one, the frequency with which we change the constituencies and, two, the level of tolerance that we accept but, unfortunately rance should be increased to avoid the in 1968, when Fianna Fáil proposed in a referendum to the people that the tolerance should be increased to avoid the kind of problems that an Seanadóir Ó Foighil and others have spoken about, it was rejected by the people.  This has created the situation that we now have after every census, of major changes occurring in the constituencies.  I think the whole question of tolerance, of even the voting system, could be looked at again to see is there a more efficient way of doing it.  I would have to say, in the circumstances we face now, with the constitutional arrangements that are there, that it would be ridiculous to refuse to accept the report of an independent commission whose terms of reference were the same as those of the commission's that were there previously and whose independence we would be impunging by not unanimously adopting the report here today.</P>

      <P>At the time of the establishment of the Dáil constituency commission relief was felt all round that the commission was the vehicle for advising and reporting on the formation of constituencies for election of Members to Dáil Éireann.  This Bill gives effect to <Col N="473" /> the recommendations of that independent commission.  I looked through the terms of reference.  We agree that membership should be not fewer than 164, not more than 168.  It says that breaching county boundaries should be avoided if possible and that larger constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density.  It mentions other well-established characteristics in the formation of constituencies, clearly defined natural features and the retention of the traditional pattern of three seat, four seat and five seat constituencies and, finally, the desirability of affecting the minimum change.  Clearly the commission's recommendations relating to avoidance of breaching county boundaries is very much at variance with those terms of reference and it is questionable.</P>
      <P>The most controversial of all changes is the creation of the new Longford-Roscommon constituency and it is not just the breaching of county boundaries, it is also the breaching of provincial boundaries.  So the geographical consideration there is also observed in the fact that the Shannon is not just the major waterway in Ireland but it is the largest, most recognised physical feature in Western Europe.  It is a very strange decision really that Longford and Roscommon should be joined together.  Mayo seems to have been seen as a sacrosanct county in order that it should continue to retain two three seat constituencies.  It is not just Fine Gael's opinion but everybody's opinion that Mayo should have become a single five seater constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil talked quite a bit about Galway, his county, and transferring almost 4,000 of the population from Galway West to the Headford area, to balance the constituency of Mayo West for three seats.  This breaches the county boundary.  When Minister Gemma Hussey dared to introduce what I would consider a very innovative idea, the idea of local educational councils, she was criticised high up and low down.  The VECs throughout the country were loud in welcoming her efforts to try to regularise and to democratise education by <Col N="474" /> developing local education authorities. The idea of breaching the county at that stage was absolutely horrific to Fianna Fáil people in the VECs.  Debate was stifled; in regard to Minister Hussey, at the time, her area was considered absolutely in breach in all respects, according to the Fianna Fáil grassroots.  I find it extraordinary that you can have one law for something which was quite democratic and another law in relation to the county.  Whether we like it or not, the county unit and county loyalty is deeply embedded in the Irish psyche, particularly in the area of politics.  Surely this change cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I will be very positive in relation to the Limerick-Clare situation where 2,566 people in the townland of Ballyglass, which I would consider suburban Limerick were brought into Limerick city. That is a welcome change and it balances out the population problem in County Clare and Limerick city.  It was certainly an improvement because the feeling of the people in suburbia, many of them not necessarily County Clare people, was one of happiness to be included in the Limerick East constituency rather than County Clare.  That was a rational and logical decision of the commission in balancing that population.  We are not being negative for the sake of being negative. We will give credit where credit is due and that was certainly a welcome change.</P>
    <P>The biggest irritant in Irish politics is the conflict between being, on the one hand, a legislator and on the other hand having to work with the heavy burden of constituency work the ordinary TD has to carry in the constituency.  All surveys and reports done in this area have shown that the Irish electorate want their public representatives to be accessible.  Whether we have the list system or the single seat constituency, perhaps it is the nature of the small population of the country, perhaps it is because of our insular position, the Irish electorate want easy accessibility to their politicians.  I feel they probably emphasise the constituency work rather than the legislative processes which, to my mind, is the most important work of a Deputy and Senator.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> My last point relates to Seanad reform. I have been asking since coming in here almost a year and a half ago for something very basic in relation to extending the university franchise to the new independent University of Dublin City and the University of Limerick.  That is not going to go away as you have more and more graduates coming to the fore, and particularly the University of Limerick is to the fore in demanding that franchise. Before we look for what we consider a major reform of the system, I will ask again &mdash; and I hope I will have a comment from the Minister in relation to it because when he opened the debate he said he was open to questions from all &mdash; if he would consider the idea of Seanad representation for the two independent universities plus the regional technical colleges so that if we continue to have university representation in Seanad Éireann it will not be discriminatory, it will not just favour the NUI and University of Dublin but will take on board the other universities.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether the Government intend to press for that representation.</P>
    <P>I certainly could not support this Bill in relation to the breaching of county boundaries and the complete disregard of the Shannon river which should have been taken into consideration as regards Longford-Roscommon.</P>

      <P>Has the verbal jousting <Col N="476" /> been completed?  I want to draw the Minister's attention to a number of points that have been covered very well by most of the people in this debate.  I am sure the Minister has heard sufficient comments about the work of the commission to last him through to the working of the next commission, which according to one of the sections in this Bill might be sitting sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>I wonder if there is any significance in the fact that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1990 in section 7 states that &ldquo;it shall continue in force for a further two years to the 31 December, 1992&rdquo; instead of for the customary four year period?  We are to have a census of population in April 1991 and the preliminary results of this census would, if past records are anything to go on, be published in about 18 months at the very latest.  That brings us into early 1993.  One wonders if perhaps it is the thinking of the Government to introduce a further revision of constituencies in advance of the next election.  I just raise the point, not mischievously, but out of curiosity as to why the suggestion of two years, rather than the customary four years, is being proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also very pleased, coming as I do from the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, not to be addressing the House, as I know my late father if he were here would have been, complaining bitterly about the machinations engaged in order to deprive Leitrim of its adequate representation.  I am glad to say that the commission in its wisdom decided to leave the Sligo-Leitrim constituency with its present boundaries and long may that be the case. I must say, however, as my hinterland of Drumshanbo extends into north Roscommon &mdash; for the benefit of the Members of the House the county boundary with Roscommon is less than one mile from where I live &mdash; I do have a tremendous amount of sympathy with my distinguished colleague, the Cathaoirleach, and his Oireachtas colleagues in the newly proposed constituency of Roscom-mon-Longford and all I can say on that issue is that better they than me in the circumstances.  Like my colleague on the far side of the House, Senator Cosgrave, <Col N="477" /> all I can do in the circumstances is wish all of you Godspeed and may the best horse jump the ditch.  I hope the Cathaoirleach will be among the horses jumping successfully.</P>

      <P>I would like to put on record that the comment was not inserted at the behest of my distinguished colleague, the former Cathaoirleach, Senator Honan, but the message, I think, has been conveyed.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that in the overall context of electoral revisions many contributions from all sides of the House have been directed at the possibility of further reform of the proportional representation system.  This is a perennial chestnut.  Sadly, Fianna Fáil have not got a happy record in this regard, having gone to the people on two previous occasions with proposals to change the multi-seat constituencies and the people, in their wisdom, refused to take the ball. As a result, we find ourselves increasingly in a situation where the future stability of administrations in this country is cast somewhat in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish for a moment to give the impression, personally or as a representative of my party, that we are in any way against the idea of minorities being represented either in this House or in the Lower House.  As we are talking primarily about Dáil constituencies my remarks would obviously be directed towards the Dáil representation. However, I sometimes ask myself the question because it has been rejected by an increasing number of people in the country, how it is that a political system can produce a situation where you have one political party who receive no more than six per cent of the vote and yet can manage to return numbers substantially in excess of that percentage and, not only return them but, on occasions have a very strong influence on the formation of the Government and the direction of its <Col N="478" /> policy.  I am in favour of democracy, plurality and for the extension of the proportional representation system to encompass all those who wish to be represented in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I would lean in favour of a debate at the minimum and at the maximum, a change in the existing constituencies, so that we continue to operate the PR system but in single seat constituencies with the single transferable vote, the so-called Norton amendment, which sadly did not see the light of day when it was proposed in the Lower House when last there was a major debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>I say this with the greatest respect to my parliamentary colleagues in the Dáil. I know it would involve a reduction in the number of TDs in order to make it work effectively but I am very grateful to those people in the Department of the Environment who went to the trouble of giving me some information in relation to the composition of the Dáil from the foundation of the State.  I was interested in what the composition of the Dáil was numerically at the foundation of the State and at what point in our history had the numbers reduced to such an extent that it became noticeable, as distinct from the odd changes.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested to know that the first Dáil returned for Ireland in 1919 had 105 Members, the second Dáil, following the Treaty, had 138 Members and, keeping in mind that the current composition of the Lower House is 166 Members, it may be of interest to the House and to the Minister to hear that in 1935 the composition of the Dáil had gone down to 138 seats.  It seems as if the decline was effected over a period of only two or three years from 140 to this lower figure.  The reason I am quoting these figures is that in the event of there being reform and a resultant reduction in seats it would not be creating a precedent.  This country has gone through periods over the last 50 or 60 years when there were substantial reductions in the number of seats to tie in with the electoral boundaries and with the census of the time.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the population in the thirties was higher than it is now and <Col N="479" /> yet it had substantially fewer seats in the Dáil.  I am only using those figures to enforce my argument.  The point has been made on a number of occasions that these reforms would lead to better Government, better legislators, less competition, less inter-party rivalry which has been referred to from all sides of the House. Most TDs would be in favour of a situation where once elected as a Member they would not have to contend with the competitive urges of their colleagues as they do at the moment.  They would be able to concentrate fully and exclusively on furthering the interests of their constituents, which they do, but would not have the handicap of concerning themselves about what the other members of their party were doing, irrespective of what the people on the other side of the House were doing.</P>
    <P>If such a reform were to be introduced and if a debate were to be started on it the Seanad would not be excluded.  It might lead to a strengthened Seanad because with the emphasis on the legislative role of our TDs the spotlight would be put on the Seanad.  It is interesting that in 1935 when there were only 138 Members of Dáil Éireann, as far as I know the Seanad was going through its finest hour.  President de Valera was not at all happy with the independent stance that the Seanad at that time was taking in relation to a number of issues.  Whether that was a coincidence or not at a time when there was lower representation in the Dáil is something historians could answer but it is an interesting point.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the registration process. This is a matter for which the Department of the Environment are responsible and for some reason it is always a source of criticism.  I fail to understand, in this computer age, with a population of three and a quarter million, with an electorate of two and a half million, that we still manage to end up at each election with substantial numbers of the electorate disenfranchised.  I fail to understand why this is the case.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily pointing the finger <Col N="480" /> at the Department of the Environment because although I live in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, I have residence here on a temporary basis.  Although my vote is in Leitrim I am aware that there are at this time of the year several visits by members of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council to the apartment complex where I stay, seeking out numbers of people who are residents.  On the one level, there seems to be a tremendous amount of activity at ensuring that people are registered yet, on the days leading up to an election, one hears of people being disenfranchised.  I wonder if the Minister has anything to say in relation to that.  As well as that, some people are left off the register after the revision courts.  I do not know why this happens.  For the benefit of Members of the House who may not be involved in this process, such as the Independent Senators, at local level these revision courts take place as the final process before the actual registers are published.  There have been instances each year where people find themselves off the register.  I wonder if the Minister, or whoever the responsible authority is, might consider writing to those voters who were on the register in one year and who have been taken off, to establish whether they are resident or whether they have left the country.  That might go some ways towards minimising it.  I accept there is a cost factor involved but there is a cost factor involved in the initial process of registering voters.  Perhaps the Department might consider a follow through on this to minimise it.  It should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>My last comment is in relation to the question of the reform of the voting system.  I am disappointed that the newly elected Leader of Fine Gael opposed in the Dáil the proposal for a debate on single seat constituencies with a transferable vote on the basis that the time was not right.  I was disappointed because I had believed that the Leader of Fine Gael was a reforming politician.  He has published several dissertations on reform of our parliamentary system and if the Leader of the main Opposition party is not on the side of those who would like <Col N="481" /> to see that type of reform the chances of it happening in the short term would seem to be nil.  It would be interesting to note whether in their further deliberations the Fine Gael Party would have any comments to make in that area.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who have not been directly involved in any way in the changes that are being proposed in this Bill.  Thank God for that.  To those of you who have, God speed you and I hope you will achieve whatever political ambitions you have set yourselves.  I support the Bill.</P>

I speak as one of a group of people from all sides, including the Government side, whose primary and total commitment is to this Chamber.  It is rather a pity that, although we are properly interested in this Bill as Members of the Oireachtas, there is what I would call an unhealthy interest on the part of some because they appear to wish to escape from this august body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of the revision of constituencies, traditionally these are regarded as opportunities for gerrymandering.  Historically, this is the way in which they have been seen.  This appears to be considerably less of a gerrymander than previous revisions by all parties.  I am not going to tread too much into this dangerous territory because I would hate to be accused of gurrierism by the Minister, Deputy Flynn, who is a man of extremely refined sensitivity in these areas and I wish neither to insult him nor to be insulted in turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of interest in terms of language that the Minister referred so frequently <Col N="482" /> to the fairness, even-handedness and impartiality of the Members.  I will leave that on the record.  People may take from it what they will.  In other words, the Government are extremely anxious that we should be aware of how even-handed, impartial and fair were the members of the commission.  I have just looked at their names and those I recognise are quite impeccable.  They include Mr. Justice Hamilton, Dr. Whitaker and Kieran Coughlan, recently departed Clerk of the Seanad.  I do not know the other two people but I am quite happy to accept they are also persons of impeccable character.

      <P>In that case, I am happy to withdraw it.  I will leave my remarks concerning the unusual insistence by the Minister on the fairness, even-handedness and impartiality of the commission, which we all accept, on the record.</P>
      <P>The unusual feature of this is mathematically the point from which the calculations begin which produce a curious re-division of the Longford-Westmeath constituency.  I will not comment any further on it but I will point out that it is a complicated mathematical calculation which has some unusual characteristics. I am sure persons who are gifted in the analysis of these electoral systems will do some work in this area and draw their own conclusions.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave an example of distortions in constituencies.  I agree with him on this.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking extreme examples, the average number of persons for a member in Dublin South-West was 26,712 while <Col N="483" /> in Dublin Central the average was 18,346.</P>
    <P>This interests me because I am one of those 18,346 voters living in Dublin Central. Underneath that statistic is a very interesting point about which I am sure the Minister is aware, that is that the central area of our capital city has the highest rate of decline in population terms of any city in Europe, apart from Reykjavik.  I wonder if the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is happy that this population decline should continue.  I am sure he would agree that this decline is catastrophic for our city and is something the Government should reverse.  I would leave that point for the Minister to ponder.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of votes for Irish citizens living abroad.  This is a continuing matter of concern to many of our constituents, particularly in the university seats, because so many of them are abroad working and bringing honour and credit to the country.  Yet, usually among countries of the European Community, they are deprived of the right of participation in elections in Ireland. I wonder if the Minister will consider addressing that urgent problem on which I receive a steady stream of letters.</P>
    <P>The question of reform has been introduced and Senator Mooney's contribution was extremely interesting on this.  I do not think I am talking inadvisedly or out of turn but there was an event in the Dáil bar about ten days ago when the political quiz book for the year by Deputy Gay Mitchell was launched by a former Minister for the Environment, John Boland, from Fine Gael.  Mr. Boland said that he had come into Dáil Éireann as a firm advocate of the existing PR system and having worked here for over 20 years as a firm advocate of the existing PR system and having worked here for over 20 years and experienced the pressures, he has now to completely re-assess the position and would be in favour of a quite radical change for precisely the reasons that Senator Mooney indicated &mdash; the sort of pressures that <Col N="484" /> are brought within the party structure by competition and the development of clientelism where the unfortunate Deputy is forced by the exigencies of the situation to pander to the immediate domestic needs of constituents.  This is not necessarily always bad but the principal function of legislators is to legislate, not to get medical cards, dentures or glasses, however humane this may be or however rewarding in terms of votes individual Deputies may feel that this is.</P>
    <P>I found it interesting that Senator Mooney referred so discreetly to a little party that gets 6 per cent of the vote.  I imagine Senator Mooney was referring to the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was the Progressive Democrats.  It is even more interesting that Senator Mooney has kindly clarified that he was thinking of The Workers' Party, he mentioned that getting 6 per cent of the vote was having an undue influence on the composition of Government and on Government policy. I sincerely hope that The Workers' Party, now that they have been clearly identified, will read the record of Seanad Éireann because I have no doubt that they will be heartened by the kind comments of Senator Mooney and that they will redouble their efforts in this regard because this form of co-operation in Government is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> Senator Mooney complained about the fact that they got 6 per cent of the vote. It was almost as if there was a feeling that this was too small.  I would remind the House that in Germany, for example, there is the operation of the 5 per cent rule where a party must achieve 5 per cent nationally before they can take seats.  So I think 6 per cent comes within the margin of appreciation there.  I would not be too contemptuous of a party that can get 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in what Senator Mooney said about the Norton amendment, in particular the reduction in numbers. He is perfectly right because the Senator, obviously having done a lot of research on the Irish situation is also aware, as I am sure the Minister is, that we have an unusually high representation <i>per capita</i> of the population in European terms.  We have more Members of Parliament than any other country in Europe.  I would hesitate as one of them, even though a modest Senator, to suggest we were suffering from an <i>embarras de richesse</i> in this regard because I might then be carved out of the body politic of Ireland and sacrificed.  I would hate that to happen but in real terms we could do a more efficient job with fewer Members, particularly in the Lower House.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be excused for following the lead of Senator Jackman in making a few observations about the Seanad itself because it is appropriate within the broad scope of the Bill to make these comments, but I will keep them brief.  Reform of the Seanad would be welcomed almost universally.  Different reforms will be proposed by different Members and different interest groups.  Like Senator Jackman, I would welcome the inclusion of the two new universities, the University of Limerick and the University of Dublin. They should be made part of the voting structure for the university Seanad seats. Dublin City University should come in with Dublin University and Limerick University should either go with NUI or also be brought in with Dublin University, the reason being that Dublin University is much the smaller constituency although with a higher proportional vote <Col N="486" /> so the disparity is not quite as obvious or glaring as it may seem.  I would like the House to be aware of the value the universities place on this representation. Although our contribution is not always universally popular or welcome, in our own way we add something quite special to the debates in this Chamber as does every other group in this House.</P>
    <P>The way to reform the electoral system for Seanad Éireann is not by extinguishing the university seats but by taking them as a model.  I know other Members will not agree with me on this but, despite their unusual constitution, the university seats are the most democratic of all the seats because they follow the original intention of the framework of the Constitution for a vocational element in the Seanad in that the nominating body is enfranchised and the people who nominate university Senators are permitted to vote for them.  I have an electorate of 20,000 and my colleague Senator O'Toole from the NUI has an electorate of 75,000, which is considerably more than the 900 and whatever it is who elect the other Members.  I am not in any sense disparaging the quality or the contributions of those Members.  It is an extraordinary thing to regard the quality that is thrown up in this House by a system that is completely and utterly wrong.  What I would recommend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I ask that Senator Norris withdraw that last remark.  It is quite clear he did not hear the earlier contributions because I spoke about how university Senators were elected and how we were elected by the people of the nation.  The 43 Senators who are elected to this House are not thrown up by anybody.</P>

      <P>I used the phrase &ldquo;throw up&rdquo; in the neutral sense.  There was no vomitus connotation in it.  I intended it to be completely neutral.  The strength of the Seanad would be greatly enhanced if there was provision for the enfranchisement of members of the nominating bodies of all the panels.  I know the argument can be made that this is some form of deferred universal suffrage but nobody really wears that.  There has never been one Independent or one non-party person elected through the panel system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to avoid repetition I will be brief.  Before Senator Norris leaves the Chamber I want to remind him that as a Senator for the past number of years I consider myself elected by the people.  The people who elected me are those who are elected by the people.  We are the true representatives of the people.  As county councillors, Deputies and Senators are elected by the people we are definitely the true representatives of the people of Ireland in our various capacities and on our various panels.  I am not taking from the respectability or the credibility of the university Senators.  We do not try to denigrate them or be superior because we are elected by the people.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  As we all know, constituencies must be revised from time to time.  It is a Bill that was expected and had to come before us sooner rather than later.  I agree with the comments made in relation to the wisdom of looking again at the single seat constituencies. I see all the advantages of having a single seat constituency and I see all the disadvantages of continuing with our three, four or five seat constituencies. We are living in a technological age, in the age of efficiency and in the age of speed.</P>
      <P>Under the present system of three, four and five-seat constituencies I see the single seat representation being at least five times more efficient and rewarding for the area one represents.  If it were 25,000 people, one would know practically every household in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own county, I would know exactly half the houses in the county of Westmeath.  I would know personally most of the families in all of those homes. From that point of view, I would be able to give a much better service if I were representing such a Dáil constituency than if I were in a five-seat constituency where there were 100,000 people such as the one I am now in until this Bill is signed by the President.  A representative would be more efficient and better able to plan his or her work schedule.  They would not have to look behind them to see if someone was at home trying to gain <Col N="489" /> a few votes extra.  We are elected by the people principally to be legislators but, as we all know, constituency work takes up to 80 per cent of our time and there is not enough time left to devote to important legislative work.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the basic problem of the Boundaries Commission changes and to the area of the two constituencies that were affected, my neighbouring county and the county where I live, that is the proposed new constituency of Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath.  I am in the Meath constituency since 1978.  North Westmeath is in the Meath constituency since 1978.  We all know what it is like to live in a partitioned country.  It has a lot of minuses.  We all look forward to the day when this island will become a 32 county Ireland.  In north Westmeath we felt something similar.  We had 5,000 voters in north Westmeath voting in the Meath constituency.  You could drive for an hour and a half and you would not be out of your constituency.  It is a highly populated area with well over 105,000 or 108,000 people.  I got on well with most people in the Meath constituency.  As the song says, in the words of Patsy Farrell, &ldquo;Where is the man who does not love the land where he was born?&rdquo;  Well, it is the same for me in relation to the County Westmeath.  I know the Acting Chairman advocates County Leitrim and the nation knows that.  I pay tribute to the public representatives in County Meath.  They have served and worked well over the 12 year period but I live only five miles from the Longford border.  The constitutency of Longford-Westmeath was a constituency on its own for as long as I can remember.  For a time, Athlone was not included but the rest of Longford-Westmeath was together.</P>
    <P>It gives no pleasure to anyone living in Longford, or on the Longford border, to lose neighbours and see their community split in two.  Westmeath and Longford have probably the poorest land and are underprivileged parts of Leinster.  This is an area which was under-capitalised and underdeveloped until recently.  The best thing that happened in Longford-Westmeath in years was Deputy Albert <Col N="490" /> Reynolds being elected as a TD in 1977 and the Taoiseach, having a vision of his extraordinary talents and ability, appointing him Minister in 1979.  From then on, things started to happen in our part of the country.  There was the great appointment of Deputy Mary O'Rourke as Minister for Education and then things really started to happen on the double. As we all know, when everything is settled and evenly divided between all areas, there is always a small surplus at the end and, naturally enough, it comes home to roost.  If there is any little thing extra that can be done, it is always your constituency that benefits.  Deputy Reynolds has been a very fair Minister.  He is an extremely popular and dynamic man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am governed by the Whip.  I am known for my loyalty, just as Senator Manning is.  I thank the Chair for his understanding of the parochial situation in which I find myself.  I just <Col N="491" /> hope that putting Longford into a different province is only a small temporary arrangement.  Having Westmeath as a three seater is something I have waited for over the last 12 years.  Twelve years ago we in Westmeath were shocked and horrified to realise that not alone was the Coole electoral area being split in two and separated from Longford-Westmeath but in Castlepollard, the parish and the main street of the town was divided in two.  My own family, living 400 yards from my home, had to vote in a village three or four miles down the road in Coole for the candidates of Longford-Westmeath. We voted in Meath. From the point of view of Westmeath we are back together as a three seater and that is good news for us as Westmeath people.  We have the parishes of Delvin, Clonmellon, Fore and Collinstown and Castlepollard back in Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill with those reservations. I know the commission had to do a job.  It will not please everyone. Some people will be aggrieved by it.  The commission should be congratulated in relation to the job they did.  I do not see any political party gaining from this.  It is a most fair-minded proposal.  Various speakers said that it is the best job that could be done and at the end of the day I do not see any party being favoured by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the comments made about the single seat PR vote.  That is extremely important.  Rather than calling this the Norton amendment we should describe it as a proposals for a single seat transferable vote.  The Norton amendment is the same thing, but it goes back many years.  A number of speakers on both sides of the House support the views put forward which are in line with a single seat transferable vote system.  I propose that we should take this proposal emanating from this House in December 1990, on board and hopefuly have it implemented for all the valid reasons stated.  It would remove many party anomalies, discrepancies and in-fights. With the multi-seat PR system, we have <Col N="492" /> within parties a certain amount of conflict and disagreement which is not to anybody's advantage.  I formally propose to the House that we put forward this proposal from the Seanad in this session to be considered and reflected upon for future consideration.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to mention very briefly that there are a number of changes which we are all aware of in the Dublin, Limerick-Clare, Mayo and Galway areas.  Most notable &mdash; and I must relect for a few moments on this &mdash; is the change in the Longford-Westmeath area.  In the realms of reason, there is no case for having Longford-Roscommon as one constituency now replacing the old Longford-Westmeath Constituency.  If there were shortages of numbers in Roscommon that could have been made up by transfers from parts of Galway, Mayo or wherever.  There is no natural common denominator in the Longford-Roscommon constituency as proposed.  By and large, having two counties together is not necessarily a good thing, whether it be Laois-Offaly, with which the Minister is very familiar, or Longford-Westmeath up to now, or Monaghan-Cavan.  There are different ideologies, beliefs and way of life to a certain extent in counties. For that reason the county boundary is probably the most basic and correct one if we are to have a multi-seat situation.</P>
      <P>I formally propose that the Seanad today put forward the view that the whole concept of this single seat constituency with the application of PR should be considered in depth.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank Members of the House for their kind remarks and their courtesy during the debate.  I fully understand their views and their concerns because I have a good knowledge of how things work out at grassroots level.  I would hate to be the Minister for the Environment in the context of this measure because I would offend somebody or walk on somebody's toes.  I have said that, no matter what arrangement <Col N="493" /> was made in regard to constituencies, some Members of both Houses would be affected.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy referred to his area.  I can understand his views in that regard because he sees part of his area going back into Westmeath.  The Senator is on the Westmeath County Council but for the purpose of a Dáil election he would be in the constituency of Meath.  Now that is back into Westmeath.  The Senator is possibly breaking loyalty with Longford and I understand that also.  The constituency is Longford-Roscommon now.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney referred to the register of electors.  He could not have raised the issue at a better time because it is being compiled at this time.  I would advise that the draft register be examined at all the usual places such as the council or corporation offices, Garda Síochána stations, libraries and post offices throughout the country.  That is most important because some names may have been omitted which would be most annoying.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred also to the independence of the commission.  I will leave it to the House here to judge all of that.  As far as I am concerned they are excellent people.  I have know them all for many years and I would say they carried out their duties in a fair manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman referred to the Limerick and Dublin universities in regard to representation in the Seanad.  The Senator's views will be noted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the Norton amendment.  I have no hard line view on that.  Many have said in both Houses that it was an opportunity missed by the elected Members at the time. Many say it should have been taken on board but I will leave it to the Judgment of all concerned.  Of course, if we want to go about that again, any review or reform have to go to both Houses for approval.  From a personal point of view, before I would go down that road I would like to be sure of all-party agreement because there would have to be a referendum. I would like the timing to be right for that and there would have to be <Col N="494" /> a consensus.  As many know and I will not elaborate, the Irish people are very slow when it comes to a referendum to make changes or to alter the <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>I understand the position.  There has been talk about reform and about both Houses not meeting more often.  It should be made clear to the people outside and to many commentators that on Mondays Deputies and Senators have council meetings and constituency clinics to attend.  On Fridays they attend health board meetings.  It would be foolish not to realise that if you do not look after your constituency when an election comes around the result may <Col N="496" /> not be too nice.  We have to understand this.</P>

      <P>This is an opportunity to make reference to a comment I made on Second Stage and which I know is echoed by Members on all sides of the House. May I ask the Minister if perhaps in consultation with his colleagues he would take up the suggestion that was inherent in comments made by the Government Chief Whip in the other House following the debate on this Bill in the other House that he would be prepared, with all-party agreement, to re-open the debate on the question of single seat constituencies in the electoral reform?  In light of the sentiments which have been expressed, encompassing all sides of this House, will he convey the wishes of the Members of this House as elucidated in their comments? It is now some 30 years since there was a serious debate on this issue and perhaps in consultation with his colleagues the Minister might initiate a debate on it with the support, of course, of all Members of this House.</P>

      <P>In the words of the late Brendan Corish, I have a feeling that Senator Mooney is a bit previous when he talks about the agreement of all Members of the House and the sentiments which might have been expressed, or, in our case, which were not expressed.  One should not draw conclusions on the basis of silence as a man with a knowledge of the law, as Senator Manning has, will be too readily aware.</P>
      <P>In relation to alterations to the Constitution, the PR system has served this country well.  In the words of the Minister this afternoon the people have a considerable affection for PR.  It may have its limitations.  There is no perfect system but I feel that the people will go on expressing that affection for PR, whether that will be expressed in referenda or whether the message will be got through to people without the necessity of having a referendum on the matter.  It is very important that the system of electing representatives that we have here maintains and embodies proportionality.  One of the effects of the work of the various commissions which have dealt with the allocation of seats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important that whatever system we have will give us representatives in Dáil Éireann in proportion to the votes cast for the parties which contest the election and, indeed, for the people who are independent.  At present we have a very good approximation to the proportion of votes cast in terms of the proportion of membership of the House.  That arises to a fair extent because of the work of the commission in redrawing the constituencies and in the manner in which they have defined them. That is desirable.  In many ways it will give us an increasing number of coalition Governments.  I believe they are here to stay and that is a good thing.  It is highly desirable that all points of view should be represented in the forum which determines what happens in this country.  If we talk about going down the road of single member constituencies, then we will be into a high degree of dis-proportionality which would have very serious consequences.  To be honest about it, it is academic because I am absolutely certain that the people would not accept it.  It is just a spot of debating which, in many ways, is no harm.  It has happened before and it was rejected and I do not believe that it will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is an exercise that could have far-reaching and beneficial effects on the electoral system and, ultimately, the people.  Perhaps I am being a little strange here but I have to point out to the House that the reforming Leader of Fine Gael &mdash; and I mean this with the greatest respect &mdash; has at least on record, opposed a debate on this issue of the single seat constituency.  Senator Upton represents the Labour Party and says he is opposed to it and that the people reject it.

There was a constitutional case brought forward in the context of the last general election and many people were very anxious about the position in relation to the present constituencies.  It would be irresponsible if this section did not go through.  Our present constituencies are unconstitutional.  If we do not pass this section it will delay the process of reforming the constituencies for many more months.  It is reckless and irresponsible of Fine Gael to oppose it.</P>

      <P>It is an important principle that the representation in the Dáil should be as close as possible to the proportion of votes cast for the different parties.  It is difficult to understand how that could be achieved within a single seat constituency. The most important point and it has been re-affirmed by the people in several referenda, is that the proportional representation aspect of our Oireachtas be fully maintained.  For that reason this section should stand.  I thank the Minister for his interest in the Mayo constituency and point out to him that I did not say that this all began from one parish; it was a party colleague of his own, Deputy McCreevey, who said that.

      <P>I was unhappy with the reply the Minister gave Senator Mooney in relation to the registration of electors. The point was made that in the Presidential election large numbers of people found they were not on the register for no explicable reason.  Surely, in an age of computerisation and at a time when it is possible to remedy omissions, the Minister should be able to tell us more than what was contained in the false little sermon he gave about going to our post office or Garda station and checking the register.  If a person can verify that he or she is that person, his or her name should be added to the register.  While not opposing this section I want to make that point, which was also made by Senator Mooney.</P>

With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, we have checked the register and put names on it that were missed at previous elections.  At the Presidential election, and the previous general election, names were taken off the register. There must be another way other than going down the same road again.  In County Clare we have given names of supporters of other parties because people have come to us and said they were not on the register.  That has been done cross-party.</P>

I share the frustration which the previous speakers have referred to when meeting people who, for no apparent good reason, find their names off the register.  The reality is that while we should all go to the the post office or Garda station to check whether people are on the register, most people do not do that.  I am asking the Minister to look at the options and, in due course, come back with a short Bill to solve the problems.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that several Members have referred to a matter I raised on Second Stage.  In the context of the Minister's reply, and for the information of the House, I am aware that in some states of the United States registration is allowed up to the day of the election.  In some states the population would exceed that of the Twenty-six Counties.  As I pointed out in my Second Stage speech, surely it is not beyond the mental ability of the people who look after these matters in the Department of the Environment, considering the size of the electorate, to be able to eliminate this injustice in 1990.  I am not singling out the Minister.  He is here today and, as my colleague Senator Honan has said, he has conducted the debate with his usual aplomb, but I hope he will take the comments of all sides of the House as an accurate reflection of the frustration that is felt by many people.</P>

I accept that there have been irregularities.  The Minister has already given an undertaking about the effect and that will be issued very shortly.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a few points the Minister should take on board. Local authority officials check the register in August and it happened in my constituency that 200 or 300 people arrived in September.  They had no Presidential vote, which was very disappointing. They know, however, that the register check has been done in August when they were not resident in the area.  I would like the Minister to consider the 18-year olds who think they automatically have the right to vote. They are the people who are disillusioned and only a percentage of them vote.  If an 18 year old has to wait until after 15 April the following year to be put on the register and an election is called in the meantime it stands to reason that that person will be disillusioned.  Therefore, the next time around that person might not be as excited about the idea of his or her first vote.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why one has to wait until April of the following year to vote. I concur with Senator Mooney in regard to the United States.  I have heard from people who came expecting a vote, they are now resident in Ireland, and said they were in the United States the previous week and were able to vote in their own state.  I was able to vote in the hotel I was staying in because the computer found I happened to be on the absentee list.  We are away back in the middle ages as regards voting.  These are simple things that could be computerised to get the franchise for 18 year olds.  They should be allowed to vote immediately on reaching 18 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by some of the previous speakers.  I am surprised at a point made by Senator Jackman because I know in County Kerry while the enumerators start in August they do not complete their work until towards the end of September.  It has to be after 29 September.  A revision court starts in January or February and any person reaching the age of 18 between that time and up to 15 April can go on the register.  I suggest to the Minister that whatever is decided on will mean a second revision court as it would be no good having a revision court three days before an election as one would not be able to handle the applications coming in.  I would suggest that within one week of an election being called there should be a revision court to deal with late applications of people who should have been on the register.  People who had been abroad but were resident here the previous September would be entitled to be on the register.  The only solution would be to have a second revision court called within seven days of an election being declared.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator B. Ryan on 12 December 1990:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, nothing the increasing commitment to a pluralist inclusive vision of Ireland, recognising that the unemployed are the State's largest excluded minority, calls on the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the dignity and self respect of unemployed people are enhanced by the social welfare system and other services, and calls specifically for:</P>
    <P>1.  an increase in payments to unemployed people to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare;</P>
    <P>2.  a revamping of Social Employment Schemes to ensure that scheme <Col N="508" /> workers are not deprived of Christmas bonuses, Family Income Supplement, and Supplementary Welfare;</P>
    <P>3.  an end, for the long term unemployed, of the invidious requirement to sign on;</P>
    <P>4.  an end, for the long term unemployed of the cruel and degrading demand to &ldquo;actively seek employment&rdquo; in a society where no employment is available;</P>
    <P>5.  a fundamental review, for the long term unemployed, of the manner in which alleged &ldquo;non availability for work&rdquo; is used to harass unemployed people, diminish their initiative and is particularly used against unemployed women with children.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators mentioned a number of issues on Wednesday last to which I would like to respond.  Reference was made to the signing arrangements for people of no fixed abode who are mainly from the travelling community.  In my speech circulated last week I explained the conditions attached to signing on.  I also indicated that the computerisation of local offices will allow alternative paying methods and new signing arrangements.</P>
      <P>Senators Ryan and O'Toole specifically mentioned the signing arrangements for members of the travelling community.  The current arrangements for this group are not onerous.  They constitute a reasonably effective way of ensuring that claimants regularly declare their availability for work when collecting their weekly cash payments.</P>
      <P>In 1981, following a review, by one of my predecessors, it became apparent that there was need for special signing arrangements for all claimants of no fixed abode.  This review was necessary to avoid the possibility of such claimants signing on and receiving payments under different names at two or more local offices in the one week.  There were indications that this kind of abuse of the system was a significant and growing problem.  In these circumstances, it was decided to introduce special arrangements for those concerned.  I should add, also, that the exact same arrangement is operated by the authorities in Northern Ireland who have experienced similar problems especially in border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of discrimination in having all people of no fixed abode sign at the one time.  The fact of having <Col N="510" /> no fixed abode gave rise to special problems of control which needed to be addressed.  My Department would be failing in their responsibilities if they did not ensure that appropriate measures were in operation to meet this special situation.  In this connection I would like to point out that settled members of the travelling community are subject to the signing arrangements which apply to settled claimants generally.</P>
    <P>Early this year following a meeting between officials of my Department and the Monitoring Committee for Travelling People, a review of the arrangements was carried out at two Dublin exchanges.  The purpose was to identify settled travellers with permanent addresses with a view to integrating them into the normal signing arrangements.  Following the examination of approximately 500 applications at the two exchanges, 67 people were identified as being settled travellers.  They were notified of their new signing arrangements which came into operation on 3 April 1990.  In some cases the change also involved a change in the office at which they were required to attend.</P>
    <P>Senators will be interested to hear that some of the travellers deemed as settled did not wish to change their signing arrangements as they regarded the Thursday morning gathering as something of a social occasion.  Others did not want to change as they had arrangements made for the payment of bills, such as rent, to coincide with their unemployment payment day.</P>
    <P>In my speech last week I made reference to the delivery of the social welfare service.  I would now like to outline in some detail what is proposed in this whole area.  Early in the New Year I will be launching eight regional centres throughout the country.  This will be a major reorganisation in the way these services are administered.  The new regional centres will be Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dundalk, Sligo, Galway, Longford and Dublin.  This forms part of my wider plans to bring the services closer to the people who need them.  I am committed to providing a more local, personal and relevant service to social <Col N="511" /> welfare recipients and claimants.  Each region will be broken down into Social Welfare Local Office (SWLO) areas. Each SWLO will be responsible for managing all aspects of the delivery of social welfare services including the management of all local offices, branch employment offices and outdoor staff in the SWLO area.</P>
    <P>With these measures I am focusing responsibility for services at the point where they are provided.  It is my intention that the SWLO will become the operating core of the Department.  It will be responsible for receiving claims, issuing decisions, authorising payments and providing information services.  It will also be responsible for the control of claims.</P>
    <P>I do not think Senators, or indeed Deputies in the other House, realise fully the significance of the changes which are taking place at present.  I would like to emphasise them.  These are dramatic and almost revoluntionary changes in the way in which all the social services will be delivered in future and they will have a huge impact on the way in which we can provide service locally.</P>
    <P>The SWLOs will operate according to the one-stop-shop concept.  All the Department's services will eventually be delivered through these offices.  Each SWLO will be divided into four main functional areas.</P>
    <P>A new claims processing area will be responsible for taking all claims for social welfare payments, establishing eligibility and entitlements and advising clients of other services to which they may be entitled.</P>
    <P>A payments processing and claim maintenance area will be responsible for changes to peoples claims, ensuring clients receive their due payments and organising replacement payments as appropriate.</P>
    <P>A review and control area will be responsible for the review of entitlements and control of scheme payments and the administration of the PRSI system including the control of employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> An information section will be responsible for general information on social welfare services, including talks to local voluntary and interest groups.  The information section will also be responsible for feedback into the system on how clients perceive the service and how it might be improved.</P>
    <P>To support the localisation of functions, I am strengthening the regional management structure in the Department by the establishment of the regional centres.  The regional centres will be involved in monitoring regional performance, planning the devolution of additional functions to the local offices and introducing more streamlined work methods.</P>
    <P>Each regional manager will be responsible for ensuring the consistent implementation of policy and dealing with any problems arising in his or her area.  Regional centres will support the local offices through organisation, personnel and training functions; monitor performance through its mainstream management functions; control the organisation through its internal audit function; control the quality of delivery by reference to agreed standards and support service development, policy and procedural changes through its planning and research functions.</P>
    <P>The management of the regional structure will be based on the achievement of set targets.  Accordingly, procedures for measuring achievement are being established so that a uniform method of measurement will exist across the whole structure.  Targets will, for example, include claim turnaround times, provision of comprehensive information services, provision of local services and quality of service.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations play an important part in the welfare of the less well off in the community.  As part of the regionalisation programme I intend that there will be a greater degree of contact with these organisations at both regional and local level.  This will enable them to keep up to date on developments in social welfare and contribute to further developments.  Regional managers will <Col N="513" /> be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of these links.</P>
    <P>The introduction of regionalisation will involve significant change in the manner in which the Department are organised. It is important, therefore, that this huge change in the Department's structure should be introduced in a planned way and with the full co-operation of staff.</P>
    <P>The regional structure will provide the platform on which we can build a fully localised and client-oriented service.  It will be the bedrock for the service of the future.  It is important, therefore, that we get it right.  That is why we are putting such effort into our plans.  We will maintain the present service at its high level while we make progress on the new regional and local structures.</P>
    <P>Enhanced computer communications between my Department and FÁS will ensure that the best possible mix of training and employment scheme opportunities is made available to the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In providing new employment exchanges, we ensure that FÁS placement officers are accommodated at our offices.  I intend to strengthen the liaison arrangements between local offices of my Department and those of FÁS to ensure that clients have every assistance in obtaining jobs or training.</P>
    <P>The Government have over the years made a significant investment in information technology and telecommunications systems.  We are now in a position to reap the additional benefits of this investment.  These information systems are creating the environment in which the objectives of localised, client-oriented services can be achieved.  Information technology is also providing us with the opportunity to introduce a greater choice of payment methods.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments are currently paid either through the post offices, the banks or the Department's own offices.  A major development in this area in recent times has been the introduction of per-sonalised payable orders for pension and other allowances.  This system provides a more secure and reliable method of payment and introduces a significant <Col N="514" /> degree of control into the payment system.</P>
    <P>I want to provide social welfare claimants with a choice of different payment methods.  The post office network of offices forms an integral part of the administration of the social welfare system and over 70 per cent of our expenditure is distributed through this network.  That is 70 per cent of £2.9 billion. We are working with An Post to upgrade and automate their counter services. This will ensure that the most modern and sophisticated payment options will be available to social welfare clients.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of this new technology into the post offices, it will be possible for our clients to use electronic fund transfers which are already widely available.  Clients' money will be paid directly into an account which can be drawn down as required.  The use of automatic teller machines (ATMs) will also be an option.  It opens up many other possibilities which have been mentioned by Senators from time to time but these cannot even be attempted until those systems are in place.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have recently been introduced to simplify means-testing. For example, in some instances claims are being decided on the basis of claim data supported by documentary evidence or data already on file in the Department.  Home visits have been eliminated for many people claiming unemployment assistance.  Instead, their claims are dealt with by way of desk-interviews. With the introduction of regionalisation and localisation, the process of simplifying means-testing will continue. I also envisage that with the continued development of the one-stop-shop concept, our clients will have an integrated local service to speed up claim processing, give them access to up-to-date information on their entitlements and provide a better service all round.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes available to me last week I spoke about the improvement in public finances secured under this Government and how that, in turn, has ensured that we were in a position to <Col N="515" /> protect the less well off members of our society.  Social welfare increases, in real terms, over the past three years have more than kept pace with inflation and, in so far as the lowest rates of payments are concerned such as unemployment assistance, have outstripped anything that was achieved before.  The Government have been particularly conscious of the need to ensure that those dependent on social welfare benefit from the improvement in the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Despite the financial constraints, the Government continues their policy of sustained improvements in the social welfare area.  Over the past three years we have: more than maintained all payments against inflation; given special increases to those on the lowest payments; introduced many improvements in existing schemes; introduced a number of major new schemes and services including the Carers Allowance and the Lone Parents Allowance not to mention the free travel for companions with the handicapped; improved in many respects the effectiveness of the delivery of our services. The new Social Welfare Appeals Office is a major development in social welfare. This new office, with its own Director and Chief Appeals Officer, will ensure that social welfare clients have an appeals system which is clearly seen to be independent, modern, efficient, fair and easily accessible.</P>
    <P>Considerable improvements have been made in the basic rates of payment: for example, special increases for those on the lowest levels of payment, the abolition of the rural rate of unemployment assistance, the streamlining of adult dependant and child dependant rates&mdash; the child dependant rates are now down to six, they were 36 just two years ago. These have all resulted in substantial improvements.  In addition, 16 categories of social welfare recipients, including the long term unemployed, received special increases of up to 11 per cent in the 1990 budget.  The basic rate of unemployment assitance, long term, has been increased from £36.70 in July 1986 to £52 in July <Col N="516" /> 1990, an increase of 42 per cent in nominal terms and almost 26 per cent in real terms.  A family with three children has come from a rate of £89.45 up to £116, an increase of £26.55 in money terms, representing an increase of almost 30 per cent in nominal terms and 15 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>Developments in the social welfare system in recent years have taken place broadly within the framework outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare. Substantial progress has been made under each of the main headings identified by the commission namely: (1) improvement in basic payments; (2) improved child income support; (3) broadening the insurance base, and (4) improvement in the delivery of service. The Commission on Social Welfare recommended a priority rate of £45 in 1985 terms which, in current terms, would be equivalent to £53.  This rate has been achieved in the case of pension rates.  The long term unemployed rate of £52 means that the priority rate for this group has almost been achieved.</P>
    <P>I have introduced a considerable degree of flexibility into the unemployment system over the past number of years.  I might add that the total cost of the improvements over the past three years, which is the period of <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i>, was £500 million.  That is the actual extra cost of improvements given over the last three years.  That point is often missed by people when they look at the increases in individual terms; a very substantial additional amount of money has been provided.</P>
    <P>My objective in introducing the various initiatives to allow part-time working, voluntary working in the community and the pursuance of educational courses, is to give unemployed people the opportunity with a view to gaining a foothold in the jobs market again.  There is now a range of facilities available to unemployed people whereby they can avail of second chance education and equip themselves with new qualifications. Indeed, in second chance education there are no 68 long term unemployed people <Col N="517" /> who have taken up the pilot scheme and who are at third level in second chance education.</P>
    <P>The current signing arrangements for unemployed people are governed by statutory regulations which provide that claimants for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance must sign the unemployed register to indicate that they are available for and genuinely seeking work.  Traditionally, the frequency with which claimants were required to sign the register depended on the distance they lived from the nearest signing centre. Those within two miles were required to sign daily, those over two and less than four miles were required to sign twice a week and once a week for those over four and less than six miles.  Those over six miles were not required to attend at a local office but instead at their local Garda station.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare considered that, as a test of availability, the current signing arrangements were not very meaningful, that is, the signing arrangements in the year 1986.  People quote the commission as if the figures they were talking about were current 1990 figures; the figures were based on studies done in 1986.  While they accepted that the signing arrangements offer an opportunity of interviewing claimants regarding efforts to obtain employment, they questioned whether they are the most useful mechanism for doing so. They concluded that it should not be necessary to have all claimants sign so frequently.  In late 1988 the position was standardised and improved, when I made once a week signing the norm for counter claimants.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I decided to offer those on long term unemployment assistance and over 60 years of age the option of transferring to a pre-retirement allowance scheme.  Under the terms of this scheme claimants are paid by pension order books which they cash at the local post office and are only required to make a declaration regarding unemployment once a year.  To date, approximately 6,500 claimants including smallholders have availed of this option.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> The commission also recognised, however, that one of the most important aspects of the current signing arrangements is that they facilitate weekly cash payments.  Until different methods of payment could be introduced, it would not be possible to introduce the kind of signing arrangements they envisaged.</P>
    <P>There is a need for modification in the current signing arrangements.  However, payment to people who attend at the local office is in the vast majority of cases made there and then in cash.  As long as this system continues to operate, attendance at the local office on a weekly basis is necessary to enable weekly payments to be made.  The introduction of alternative paying methods requires the computerisation of local office procedures. This process is proceeding but in view of the number of offices involved it will take some years to complete.</P>
    <P>It is a statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to find, suitable employment, having regard to age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances. These conditions are a common feature of unemployment schemes worldwide.  The legislation provides also that the onus is on the individual claimant's to prove they are available for work.  It does not, however, state what form such proof should take. It is, accordingly, a question for the deciding officers and appeals officers to decide whether any claimant has shown that he or she fulfils the condition having regard to the available evidence when making a claim.</P>
    <P>All claimants are normally asked when making a claim for unemployment benefit or assistance to complete a questionnaire regarding their efforts to obtain employment.  Claimants may also be asked subsequently at any stage of their claim about this matter.  In most cases the replies given by claimants to this questionnaire will, when taken in conjunction with other evidence available regarding the claimant's employment history, be <Col N="519" /> sufficient to satisfy the deciding officer that the person concerned is available for and genuinely seeking work.  If, however, there is any element of doubt about the position, the deciding officer may seek further relevant information on such matters as the extent to which the claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming unemployed; the type of work the claimant is seeking and the reasons for any restrictions which the claimant may be placing on the type of work he or she is available to do; whether there are domestic or other commitments or circumstances which limit the claimant's ability to accept full-time employment which would normally be regarded as suitable; whether the claimant has a history of leaving employments frequently, without good cause.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of the replies given to questions such as these that the deciding officer determines whether the person is or is not available for and genuinely seeking work.  Each case has to be considered on its own merits and it is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the exact evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant.</P>
    <P>At the new claim stage detailed information is requested from the claimant on a questionnaire to be completed in respect of the claimant.  For example, the claimant is asked what type of work he or she is seeking and the hours of employment being sought.  The claimant is also asked what specific efforts have been made to obtain employment and to furnish any documentary evidence he or she may have.  Claimants are also asked have they registered for employment with FÁS.  Details of ages of any children in the household are also required as well as particulars about who will care for the children in the event of the claimant finding employment.</P>
    <P>Claims are reviewed subsequently on a regular basis to ensure that the claimant continues to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to payment.  The review consists of an updating of the previous examination, including details of recent efforts <Col N="520" /> by the claimant to obtain employment. This may be done orally at the counter in the exchange or through the use of a written request to be handed or posted to the claimant.  In carrying out these reviews claimants may be asked to furnish any documentary evidence they may have about their efforts to obtain work.</P>
    <P>As regards child care responsibilities, many married men and married women with young children are able to make child-minding arrangements which allow both spouses to take up employment.  But there are other cases where one or other spouse is not available for employment because he or she has decided to remain at home to look after children or else is not in a position to make adequate child care arrangements in the event of being offered a job.  It is by no means uncommon for a parent to give up employment for the purpose of minding a child.</P>
    <P>It will often be readily apparent from the particular circumstances of a claimant with young children that child care arrangements do not constitute a problem in relation to availability for work. An example would be where such a claimant had previously been in employment and made child care arrangements. However, where, for example, a claimant with children gives up employment, or following the birth of a child fails to resume employment even though there was a right to return to the job under employment protection legislation, the matter would have to be discussed further with the claimant.  Similarly, where claimants had previously withdrawn from the labour market for a number of years to look after children or other dependants, inquiries would have to be made of the claimant as the deciding officer would have to satisfy herself that suitable arrangements can be made for the care of the children.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that this can be a difficult and sensitive area.  It was for this reason that I arranged for the reissue of guidelines to the staff at all of the local offices of my Department spelling out that the utmost care must be taken to <Col N="521" /> ensure that any questions asked are relevant and that the purpose of the questions should be explained so that the claimants will understand why they are necessary.  The guidelines also stress that claimants, both male and female, are subject to the same line of inquiry.  For instance, a male claimant with young children would have to be queried about child care arrangements where his wife was working in exactly the same way as would be the case if it were she who was claiming instead.  These guidelines were designed to ensure that, in questioning claimants, there is no discrimination on grounds of sex, family or marital status.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of decisions are made by local deciding officers.  In most cases the decision would be to accept that the claimant is available for and genuinely seeking work.  It is in only a very small proportion of cases that the question of disallowance under this heading would arise.  Where it does all the evidence including the claimant's side of the story is available to the deciding officer for decision.</P>
    <P>Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer has the right of appeal to the new social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme (SES) is administered by the Department of Labour.  It is aimed at providing part-time employment to assist unemployed people, particularly the long term unemployed, to re-enter the labour market. Allowances under the scheme are payable at at standard rate of £69 for a single person and £98.50 for a person with an adult dependant.  The Government introduced improvements in the scheme in 1989 when a child dependant allowance of £10 weekly became payable.  As a result of these changes all SES participants now receive a payment which is in excess of the entitlements under the unemployment assistance scheme.  The £11 per child applies and the basic rates are higher than the rates for long term unemployment assistance.  For example, an SES participant with an adult dependant and three child dependants now receives a total allowance of £131.50 per <Col N="522" /> week, as against an entitlement under long term unemployment assistance of £116.00 per week.  Even a single person receives £17 a week more on the SES, that is, £69 as against £52.  Of course, it is considerably more than the short term rate.  In addition, SES participants are free to engage in other work or activities during their week off.  Such earnings have no effect on their payments from the SES.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the family income supplement scheme (FIS) on the other hand, is to maintain an incentive for full-time workers with families, who are in low paid employment, to remain at work.  Its purpose is essentially different from the SES and to extend entitlement to FIS to persons on the SES would involve fundamental changes in the FIS scheme.</P>
    <P>The clear intention at all times was that the increased payments to SES participants compensated for the loss of added benefits, such as the Christmas bonus. For example, during December a single person on the SES will earn £276, plus earnings from other work, if any.  This compares with an entitlement of £208 on long term unemployment assistance which attracts a Christmas bonus of £36.40.  The Government have used the funds available for the social employment scheme to provide opportunities for the long term unemployed on the basis of normal weekly payments.  This year over 11,000 people will participate in the scheme.  I would refer Senators to the very comprehensive statement on this subject by my colleague, the Minister for Labour, in the adjournment debate on 1 November 1990 in the other House.</P>
    <P>Persons participating in the SES do not qualify for basic SWA because their income exceeds the SWA rate.  However, they could qualify for exceptional needs payments or urgent need payments if a health board consider such payments appropriate in particular circumstances. In general, SES participants qualified for the new £5.3 million back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance which I introduced in July of this year and which was paid out at the end of August.  Payment of a rent/mortgage supplement <Col N="523" /> could also be made depending on the individual's income level.</P>
    <P>On 29 May last, the EC Social Affairs Council, at the initiative of my colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, adopted a resolution on action to assist the long term unemployed.  The resolution identifies a need to take a more integrated approach to unemployment blackspots in order to tackle the problems of high unemployment, inadequate or non-existent social, recreational and educational facilities and other social problems. The resolution also recognises that employers have an important part to play in tackling long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Despite the continuing need to control expenditure, we have made sure that special consideration is given to the most vulnerable sections of our society.  We have not only maintained the system but have also improved it significantly.  I see my Department as not just being in the business of providing money but also being involved in the welfare of people in the broadest sense.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations have a major role in this regard.  Many such organisations are working on a daily basis with social welfare clients and are aware of their needs and their difficulties.  In recent years I was glad to be able to provide assistance to many such organisations.  In particular, I have received a great deal of assistance from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in meeting the needs of the poor. The society have now over 10,000 voluntary workers in the field.  The society have been to the fore in tackling the problems associated with moneylenders, in providing job opportunities through a major innovative community-based scheme, in organising a programme of home management and personal development courses, designed to help people acquire the basic skill of budgeting and self-development.  In April 1988 I made a special grant to the society to fund the setting up of these courses on a nationwide basis.  I am pleased to be able to make a further grant of £100,000 to the society, which I am announcing today, to expand and develop these innovative and <Col N="524" /> worthwhile home management and personal development courses.  The funds for these come from savings which I have at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the agreement of the social partners on a new Programme for Economic and Social Development, we will be in a position to lay the foundations for further major improvements in social welfare in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We have announced just today the details of the Estimates for next year and Senators will be aware that those Estimates embody total expenditure on social welfare of £2.9 billion, which is £100 million above the outturn for this current year and it is a net increase in the net Estimate of £78 million, leaving a net Estimate of £1,554 million, which will cover all the current schemes that we have and we will continue them into next year at the increased rates.  We now have quite a number of new schemes.  These include the scheme for the handicapped, the scheme for the free companion pass for the handicapped &mdash; £6,500 of these passes have been issued in approximately the last six weeks &mdash; the new lone parent's scheme and the carer's allowance, for which over 3,500 claims have already come in.  Full funding for these schemes is provided into next year, together with a back-to-school payment again for next year, which is funded in today's Estimates. Further developments will fall to be considered within the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>With all these improvements which have, in many respects, been made possible through the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, we look forward to underpinning more major improvements in social welfare by continued co-operation between the national partners in a further programme for economic and social development.  I, therefore, urge Senators to support the amendment to this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would like to compliment him on his efforts over the last couple of years to try to streamline the system in <Col N="525" /> so far as it is possible to do so.  I must say I was struck by one of the last figures he gave, the figure of £2.9 billion as being the Estimate for the coming year.  That coincides almost equally with what we are in receipt of from the Structural Funds for a period of five years, 1988 to 1993, and this is supposed to be the wonderful boon that we are getting to bring us in from the periphery to be able to compete with the core of Europe.  It certainly puts in context the incredible extent of our social welfare obligations and burden.</P>
      <P>Even though that is the amount of money being spent, when we look right across the sphere of social welfare we are still talking from a low plateau in terms of the funding available to people in the various social welfare categories.  If we look at any single one of them I do not think there is a person in this country who would say that they are satisfactory or sufficient to enable anybody to live in decency and in dignity.</P>
      <P>That is the context in which this motion is being put.  It speaks rather optimistically about the increasing commitment to a pluralist, inclusive vision of Ireland.  I do not know what the inclusive vision is but it will be a pluralist Ireland is perhaps a little over-optimistic.  I would certainly like to see that being the case but we have a long way to go.  The State's largest minority, undoubtedly a discriminated against minority, are the one million or thereabouts who are living or the poverty line and many of these, of course, make up the 200,000-plus of our unemployed.  The centre of the motion is that all steps be taken to ensure that the dignity and self-respect of unemployed people is enhanced by the social welfare system and other services.  That is the problem.  We have a system.  It is an inadequate system.  It is a very poor system. It is a morass of rules and regulations and details and structures but it certainly does not enhance the dignity and self-respect of people who are in receipt of its benefits. Indeed, neither do the other ancillary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just tell a little story.  Last Friday morning I was awoken very early by a family in a block of flats next door to me <Col N="526" /> in Séan McDermott Street, St. Mary's Mansions.  The flats were flooded; two of them were absolutely swamped with water.  The mains had burst.  As I was the only one in the area with a telephone I tried to get the corporation, without success.  There is no emergency service over the weekends.  This happened to be Friday morning and there would be nothing available on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, not until Monday.  I got the Garda and the Fire Brigade and the ESB all of whom turned up, but we could not get anybody from the Dublin Corporation. We were unable to find the stop cock because some repairs had been done.  There are not that many repairs done in the area because of the totally inadequate level of funding for maintenance. That was the way of it.  We eventually had to try to get the sub-contractor. He turned up hours and hours later when water was flowing out of the premises.  Nobody came from the corporation. All the clothes were destroyed. New clothes had to be got by collecting from the neighbours.  There was nowhere for the family to go that night, or the following night, or the night after that. Eventually, a Super Ser was got to dry up the flat and another one for the other flat overhead.</P>
    <P>That is the situation at present.  Here we are on Wednesday still without an adequate service.  We must talk about the concomitant services.  In terms of the local authorities there is not an adequate maintenance service, particularly for people in public housing.  These were two families who were unemployed, in one case a family with four children.  The other case was just a couple.  As they had nowhere else to go they were taken in by neighbours.  The local authority service is totally inadequate to provide a support in an emergency and, indeed, after an emergency, for such people.  There is no service to provide compensation for the destruction of their furniture, the clothes that were required, and so on.  Indeed, that brings us back to what the Minister talked about, the voluntary organisations. The St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Simon Community went in and <Col N="527" /> helped out, but not the State services. That is the problem.  The State service was found to be inadequate in the circumstances. The voluntary organisations, I agree, have played a major role in providing back-up services.  The Simon Community in their submission to the social partners in relation to the new programme for social and economic development indicated that it receives approximately 10 per cent in grants from the Government of what it needs to carry out its work.  That means a very important voluntary organisation that deals almost exclusively in a support service for the homeless has only 10 per cent of the funding it requires from Government sources.  That surely is totally inadequate. This could not be defended.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his desire that An Post would be extended and the network of services that were available through An Post would form an integral part of the administration of the social welfare system.  He said that over 70 per cent of expenditure is distributed through this network.  We see that there are, in fact, proposals to close down many of the local post offices throughout the country. This is part of a rationalisation process. Here again part of the infrastructure for the provision of services is to be eliminated. That, of course, will not assist in enhancing the dignity and the self-respect of the unemployed and others who are in receipt of State services in relation to social welfare.</P>
    <P>There is very much a macro level in terms of the operation.  There is the whole area of the unemployed and the State's responsibility in that area.  With Spain we have the highest level of unemployment in Europe running at 17 per cent.  The unemployment level, in fact, is increasing now.  We will find that our budget this time next year &mdash; even if we were not to increase in real terms at all &mdash; will be in excess of what it is at present.  Of course there is a huge drain on our own resources for productive development; so much has to be spent on services simply to ensure that unemployed people have some form of decent living standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> That is a major area on the macro level which must not be left out of the calculations and, of course, the whole area of emigration is also something we never came to grips with.  It is increasing all the more in recent years.  With increasing mobility in Europe after 1993 our youth population and our productive population are the people who will be leaving.  We will be left more and more with those who are unable and have not the means to find employment abroad and who are going to be a drain on our own inadequate industrial and employment structures.</P>
    <P>As regards the first recommendation, increasing payments to unemployed people to levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, what the commission were talking about were simply minimum levels of payment.  They were not talking about anything that would bring the level of social welfare payments to the unemployed to a point where they could live in luxury.  We are not talking about that.  We are talking about what they consider to be the bare minimum.  I would have thought that more progress could have been made in that respect considering that &mdash; and it has been mentioned by the Government and all credit to them &mdash; over the last four years we have had a fairly extensive surplus of exports over imports, and our balance of payments has been improving at a considerable rate all the time. However, we have not invested that adequately to eliminate the level of unemployment or to raise the levels of social welfare to people who are on the unemployed list.</P>
    <P>That is something we have not addressed.  We have tinkered with the system, we have added a bit here, pushed another bit there, and tried to sort out what were perceived as fraud levels elsewhere and so on: this, of course, relates to the criticism about the signing on on the same day by the travelling community, which I would have certain reservations about.  The Minister says it is not discriminatory but I think it is, because they are the only group in the community that are singled out in such a <Col N="529" /> fashion.  I would have thought the proper approach would be as it is in other areas, to prosecute those against whom you have evidence of committing fraud, rather than discriminate against an entire category of people.  That is not satisfactory, and to say that it operates in Northern Ireland does not remove the discriminatory aspect of it.  The Minister would need to look at that again and see if a more humane method might be used.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the Commission on Social Welfare, I think a lot more could be done to give what would be the equivalent of a decent living wage.  There should be a minimum level of social welfare payment for everybody.  That would be a major advance in the social welfare area, something like the free education system at the end of the 1960s, which could be regarded as the level at which a person could live in relative decency.  We should establish criteria for housing, food, clothing, education requirements for children and so on.  We should add all these things together, make out a certain number of points, and say that people are not allowed to be paid below that level. Until we come up with an actual threshold of payment, a basic minimum wage, we are going to find ourselves without dignity in our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second point, the revamping of the social employment schemes to ensure that scheme workers are not deprived of Christmas bonuses, family income supplement and supplementary welfare, that badly needs to be addressed because SES people do not receive family income supplement, they do not get holidays, they are not protected by the new legislation in relation to part-time workers, they do not get fuel allowances, rent allowances or any form of seasonal bonuses.  They are very much discriminated against.  That total area needs to be reviewed to give them more of the rights that workers are entitled to. It is in many ways a cheap way of keeping youngsters off the live register and it very often involves dead-end jobs with very little future.</P>
    <P>I would like to add to that the question of prisoners.  They do not get Christmas <Col N="530" /> bonuses either if they are recently released, so they would lose out because they are not long term unemployed. There is no after care for prisoners which means that we have about 10,000 people going through the system every single year and these people are coming out homeless; in many cases the families do not want to see them.  There is a very glaring lacuna in the services provided there.  They are coming out without the support facilities and they become part and parcel of the unemployed section of the community on social welfare.  There is a great deal I would like to say about that but I will not have time to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, point No. 4 deals with putting an end to the long term unemployed, the cruel and degrading demand to actively seek employment where no employment is available.  That is a scandal.  In areas where there is endemic unemployment, where it is impossible to find employment, there are people going around being told they have to sign forms saying they have been actively seeking employment and they must go around here and there.  It is simply an exercise, and it is absolute hypocrisy that it should be required.  It is part of the bureaucracy which I would think greatly undermines and takes away from the dignity and self-respect of the unemployed.  While the Minister has endeavoured to improve the system in various areas, there is need for a substantial overhaul of the system rather than tinkering with various aspects of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening, we could find ourselves in the happy position that we could agree to the motion and the amendment before the House.  I do not think we should be put in the position of having to have an either/or situation. I would certainly agree with the five points in the amendment, which simply says that we welcome the progress that has been made by the Government.  Progress has undoubtedly been made in implementing the rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare for the disadvantaged.  We can welcome the flexible and innovative <Col N="531" /> approaches being taken on schemes and employment-related measures.  We can acknowledge that improvements have been made in these areas of social services. It would be very wrong of us not to accept that improvements have been made, and thank God they have been made.  There was plenty of scope and need for them.  We also can accept the bona fides of the Minister for Labour in the priority which he has attached to helping and looking at the problems of the long term unemployed.  We can certainly note the resolution that was adopted by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers.  However, I do not see that that in any way cuts across the five points which are contained in this motion.</P>
      <P>The first one is quite clear.  If I could start with the preamble, I am sure the other side of the House would like to ensure that the dignity and self-respect of unemployed people is enhanced and is not diminished by the way the system is operated, so there should not be any problem there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item seeks an increase in the payments to the unemployed to the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I have found it a little difficult, not being particularly good at figures, to establish exactly what sort of increase we would be talking about in that area.  I do not think Senators Ryan or O'Toole who spoke last week indicated where the money will come from.  I know in the corporation if we want to propose an extra payment in one area we have to say when doing our estimates where the money is to come from.  That is an intelligent way to approach it.  We all know that there is not limitless money available, and if we are going to give extra unemployment benefits to people, we must see where it is to come from.  I certainly would not like to see it coming from the health budget or the education budget as that is one area from which we get a positive return.  Sadly, one cannot say the same for the £2.9 billion the Minister mentioned for social welfare.  When money is spent on education young people acquire extra skills which help <Col N="532" /> them to get jobs and so keep off the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that in Great Britain, which has the highest unskilled labour force in the European Community, has the highest unemployment level.  The higher a person's level of education the better is his or her chance of getting a job, whether in Ireland or in the European Community.  I support those who suggest that we have higher taxes on petrol, drink and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The Government should look long and hard at the great waste in Government Departments.  As regards the heating bill for Leinster House, it is not uncommon for us to be sweltering in the House and for the windows to be open.  I was in one of the adjuncts to this building and the windows were open.  Kildare Street and Kildare Place are being heated.  That wastage is a scandal and it is an area which should be looked at to see what economies could be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to comments made last week about fraud, Senator Brendan Ryan quoted from the Craig Gardner report.  It is an area that is worth commenting on.  There are stringent rules laid down about signing on.  The public perception is that there is a large degree of fraud.  The Craig Gardner report showed that only 2 per cent of the number of unemployment payments and 1 per cent of the number of disability payments were based on claims which contained some clear element of fraud.  The number of unemployed is approximately 220,000 and if we were talking about something as small as 2 per cent that would mean 4,400 people were claiming benefit fraudulently.  I understand that the word &ldquo;clear&rdquo; is the pertinent word, that means people who are claiming when they have no right to the benefit.  It would not include cases where somebody was claiming for a wife and two dependent children when they had only one dependent child. Fraud, by its very nature, is concealed and anyone investigating that area would find it difficult.  There are a great number of people who imagine that there are huge areas of fraud.  This is not the case. <Col N="533" /> It is important that the rules and regulations should not encourage or facilitate fraud because that is counter-productive. It tends to generate the sort of opinion which people have that everybody who is unemployed is involved in some great scam.  I do not think that is the case.  I was not here for the debate last week but I read the comments of Senators Ryan and O'Toole.  I do not think that there is as much prejudice against the unemployed as they made out.  I have had the unfortunate experience as a public representative of coming across considerable prejudice towards the travelling community.  I do not believe that the same prejudice pertains with regard to the unemployed.  The reality is that we all know large numbers of people who were holding down very good jobs and who found themselves unemployed, through no fault of their own.  People imagine that there are a large number of people who do not want to work and that they should be made to do so or have their benefits curtailed.  Those of us who know people who are unemployed realise how quickly their self-confidence is undermined and this quickly leads to a position where they feel unable to face the challenge of a job.  I experienced that recently with a number of people and I was shocked and shattered at how quickly it happened to people who up to then appeared to be stable.  If there are people who appear not to be so enthusiastic about getting a job, great sympathy and understanding should be shown to them. This could happen to any of us if we found ourselves in the same position.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the excellent and worthwhile social employment scheme.  In Dublin, the corporation did not have such a happy experience with it. I was involved recently in the promotion of the Tidy Towns competition around the country and I was delighted with the extent to which the SES scheme has benefited those who are gaining employment through it.  People on the SES, working for local authorities on worthwhile projects can bring pride to a locality.  My experience has been that it not only is beneficial in those ways but it creates <Col N="534" /> close bonds between the local community and the unemployed who are now on an SES.  They are very highly thought of in the community.  The work is often something which the local community would not be able to undertake.  It is a scheme which should be supported in every way. I support the second item in this motion which seeks to ensure that people on SES are not deprived of Christmas bonuses. It would act as a disincentive to take up the scheme.</P>
    <P>The third item in the motion calls for an end to the invidious requirement of signing on.  It is counter-productive.  I notice in the Craig Gardner report they suggest the abolition of weekly signing on and suggest that selective signing on should be introduced instead.  Society cannot provide jobs and this is making paupers out of the poor.  It takes away their dignity as does the requirement to actively seek employment.  The same comments could apply there and to Item No. 5.</P>
    <P>The Government and the political parties in general have been reticent about accepting or that unemployment is something which, sadly, is here to stay.  We may well find that it is something which is on the increase.  They are afraid that if they admit unemployment is here to stay, they will be admitting failure.  If we accepted unemployment, attitudes towards the unemployed could change and young people particularly in our schools could be encouraged not to go out into life feeling they are a total failure because they are unemployed for a short or even a long period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Jackman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the various points made in the motion.  They are relevant and need to be addressed in order to overcome this very major cancer of unemployment in our society, not unemployment in itself but the affects that it has on the families directly affected by it.  There are about 500,000 to one million people in a very downgraded position in our society. Some parts of the country are more seriously affected than others, for <Col N="535" /> instance, our cities and towns.  Part of Dublin has 70 or 80 per cent unemployment. The same obtains in Cork, Limerick and parts of the West of Ireland such as Connemara where 95 per cent of the population are drawing the dole.  It is not an evenly spread problem.  It is prevalent in particular spots.  That makes it all the more serious because there is an attitude amongst those communities which is not healthy or good.  Young people who are brought up in that atmosphere do not have a work ethic.  We must leave no stone unturned to ensure that, if people have to emigrate in order to get gainful and meaningful employment, they are trained to get and hold the best jobs available to them.  This is an area in which we could do a lot more.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to moneylending and the fact that the St. Vincent de Paul Society were to the fore in tackling that problem.  Moneylending, which is very serious particularly for the more vulnerable in our society, should be tackled head-on by the State.  I do not think that the St. Vincent de Paul Society or any other voluntary organisation should be left with this problem upfront with the State coming in behind them.  It should be the other way around.  There are various organisations such as the Simon Community, St. Vincent de Paul and so on, who are doing magnificent work but the State should take the initiative and, of course, be supported by these organisations.</P>
    <P>The provision that people must make themselves available for work and prove that they are available is a lot of red tape. People should not be put through the ropes of applying regularly for jobs that are not available in order to qualify for unemployment assistance.  It would be far more practical if the State contacted people and offered them jobs.  I agree that people should be available when they are offered a job but being compelled to go out in search of jobs which do not exist is quite unreasonable.</P>
    <P>There are various forms of indignity which, unfortunately, the unemployed suffer.  Moneylending is one example of <Col N="536" /> that.  There is the lack of the very basics for living in the area of food, clothing, housing and so on.  Those who are fortunate not to experience unemployment do not fully appreciate this fact.  This applies to a great number in our community. The Government should do a great deal more to help the unemployed. They stand condemned for the present rate of remuneration to the unemployed and for their lack of success in providing gainful and meaningful employment for people.  Let us call a spade a spade.  If we did not have the outlet of emigration we would have a much more serious unemployment figure than we have at present, which is in excess of 200,000, or 17 per cent of our workforce.  Emigration is not the answer to our unemployment problem. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe.  There are many more aspects I would like to cover but because I am sharing my time with Senator Jackman I will have to gloss over them.</P>
    <P>The figure of £116 per week for a family is totally inadequate.  There is no way in which a family could live on that.  The Government stand condemned for their lack of effort on two fronts, first, for their failure to provide gainful and meaningful employment for our people and, secondly, their failure to look after those who are unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will influence the Minister for Labour.  I am disappointed that they will not get a Christmas bonus.  I support the motion. It is a pity we have so little time to debate it.  At Christmas time our minds are drawn to the plight of the less well off both at home and in Third World countries. There were many people who wished to <Col N="537" /> contribute to this debate and hopefully next year we will have an opportunity to debate this issue of poverty at length.</P>
      <P>Social welfare is an income support for approximately 700,000 people.  There are 600,000 adult and child dependants.  In 1989 the cost was £2.66 billion.  That is a tremendous amount of money but much more is needed.  The provision of this service plays a vital part in determining the financial well-being of individuals and families and in alleviating poverty.  There has been some improvements, as indicated by the Minister in his speech last week, but a lot remains to be done.</P>
      <P>I hope the bullet will be bitten in the forthcoming budget and that instead of tinkering with the system it will be reformed. The <i>ad hoc</i> increases based on the level of inflation do nothing at the end of the day to address the issue properly.  It is essential to provide an adequate income for everyone.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare made certain recommendations and four and a half year later we are still waiting for their implementation.  People say it can be done on a phased basis but at this stage we should be at phase three or four. Their basic figures were £62 for a single person and £100 for a couple.</P>
      <P>There are three levels of social welfare payments.  There are a few groups which are often quoted to show that social welfare payments are satisfactory.  Within those groups there are old age and retirement pensions, which would be considered adequate by the commission, as well as injury and disability benefit. There are a number of recipients who are still £6 or £7 below the adequate minimum recommended by the commission. These include payments for widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives, unmarried mothers, non-contributory old age pensioners, those on single women's allowance and long term unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £52 a week which the Minister mentioned in relation to the social employment scheme is still £10 below the minimum recommended.  Those at the very bottom who receive far less than the <Col N="538" /> minimum are on short term unemployment assistance and basic social welfare which is £45 a week&mdash;£15 below the minimum.  We are looking for a simple, consistent and comprehensive social welfare system.</P>
    <P>When social welfare payments were orginally introduced they were not meant to be the principal source of income but were to tide a person over until he or she got a job, recovered from illness, or whatever.  Today the position is radically different because we have permanent unemployment.  Levels of payment for the long term unemployed were originally kept low so that they would act as an incentive for people to seek employment.</P>
    <P>As regards the social employment scheme, the Minister referred to a figure of £17 which is the difference between the payment for social welfare and social employment.  In urban areas it is difficult to get people to take up the social employment scheme.  There is a greater incentive to take it up in rural areas because farm labourers are still below that level.  There are 11,000 people who come within the social employment scheme.  In the mid-west alone there are 1,200 people availing of the scheme.  It suits the Government to keep this scheme intact as it keeps people off the live register. They do not have the benefit of receiving a Christmas bonus.  They feel exploited and will continue to do so unless something is done to increase the amount of money they receive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and Senator Costello's reference to the fact that the puralist inclusive vision referred to in the text of the motion applies to this large and discriminated against minority of the unemployed.  The President's ringing invitation to come dance with her sounded rather hollow when the people on social employment schemes visited this House and said there would be no dancing for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although my name is down on this motion I do not fully support the implication of intent behind some of the words like &ldquo;harass&rdquo; and so on.  The system is <Col N="539" /> degrading and demeaning, not out of any conspiratorial intent but because poverty is degrading and demeaning.  The amendment is not very convincing.  In an effort to retrieve their former support perhaps Fianna Fáil should go back to their roots and see how they can get the working class and the workers class to support it. It has been said that there is nothing so strange as the willingness of the poor to connive at their own poverty and misery. That is a situation that may not last forever.</P>
    <P>I may have to get my head examined because I am making a habit these days of praising people but I thought Senator Ryan's speech last week was forceful, well researched and very compassionate. There is little I could say to improve on it.</P>

It is one of the reasons why I am hopeful, even if we do not agree tonight, that many of the things I aspire to may be possible.  To be fair to the Minister, he has demonstrated a willingness to think along new lines.  It is quite clear that his vision is one which many of us would subscribe to even if the vision he offers us is not much of a reality to many recipients of the service.</P>

    <P>I will compliment the Minister and have a side swipe at a colleague of his in the process.  I was interested in his announcement that £100,000 extra was being given to the St. Vincent's de Paul Society to facilitate their domestic management training schemes.  He said he managed to put this aside out of savings from other areas.  He might pass on this message to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, who has half a million pounds which he will return unspent, <Col N="540" /> within the next fortnight to the Department of Finance.  It would be a commendable exercise of imagination by his colleague if he did the same as this Minister and found some use for this money. Over Christmas would be an appropriate time to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk a little bit about expenditure on social welfare.  I have at my disposal only the Government Estimates of expenditure which do not include the contribution of the social insurance fund.  Those figures are as follows and I checked them because the Minister was waxing eloquent about huge extra expenditure: the net expenditure, that is excluding the expenditure by the social insurance fund on various insurable benefits, was £1.2 billion in 1984; £1.36 billion in 1985; £1,543 billion in 1986; £1.6 billion in 1987; £1.535 billion, a decrease, let it be said, in 1988; £1.513 billion in 1989; £1.476 billion in 1990 and an increase promised for 1991.  The sum of £1.553 billion is almost £50 million less than the expenditure by his Department in 1987, net of social insurance contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think that it is a reasonable conclusion to draw.  I know that payments to the social insurance fund are much lower because of cutbacks and the level of benefits that are available to people.  The other point that needs to be made&mdash;I have made it on radio debates subsequent to budgets&mdash;concerns the increases that have been made available to the long term unemployed. The long term unemployed according to the Minister's own booklet are people unemployed for in excess of 15 months and who have been getting an unemployment payment for at least 15 months. <Col N="541" /> Their children still receive £11 a week. Even adding on child benefit which is available to everyone and which should not be added on, £11 a week is not sufficient to support is a child.  It is one of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare that the income support for children in poor families should be sufficient to support a child but that is not sufficient.  Indeed, it is nowhere near sufficient and it is playing around with statistics to pretend that the adult payment alone is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The most shameful system and form of poverty in our society is the poverty of our children.  It is an area where we are scandalously neglectful.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's reply there are many things that need to be said about it.  I will pass over the Minister's comments on the travellers by saying I am intrigued by the insistent reference both by himself and some of his predecessors to persons of no fixed abode. When you tell the Department of Social Welfare that you have no fixed abode they will not give you anything; you have to have an address before you qualify for anything.  The no fixed abode phrase is code for the travellers.  This particular requirement to sign on applies to the travellers.  No matter what the reason, no matter what the justification, no matter what the plausible explanation, if this was done to an identifiable racial minority who were different in the colour of their skin or in their religion, there would be an outcry.  Yet, it is done to our travellers and it should not be done.  To claim, as the Minister has claimed, that many of them actually like it is, to a certain extent, reminiscent of certain of the authorities in South Africa who had us believe for years that the blacks did not mind about apartheid, that they liked many of the benefits of it.</P>

      <P>I am fully in your hands in operating the rules of the House.  The Minister made many references in his speech to other issues that deserve to be talked about.  There have been many welcome initiatives in his period as Minister and I hope he will accept that as a genuine compliment to him for his work. On the issue I wanted to discuss at length, namely, the whole question of being available for work and actively seeking employment, there are fundamental differences between us.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech said that the legislation provides also that the onus is on the individual claimant to prove that he or she is available for work.  It does not however, state what form such proof should take.  That is like something out of Kafka: you have to prove it, but we will not write it down in simple English in legislation so that you can know what to write and know what we want.  Who would tolerate that treatment of any other minority?  You must do something as a condition of having an income but we will not tell you how you must do it, we will not say in law what you must do, we will not give you a legally enforceable right to know what it is you must do to prove it.  That is straight out of Kafka.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not the author of this <Col N="543" /> legislation but it has totalitarian overtones to it.  It leaves enormous discretion in the hands of the State <i>vis-á-vis</i> a very vulnerable minority and that is wrong. The fact that the Minister is not the author of that legislation does not mean it is not his job to deal with it because the situation about the unemployed has changed quite dramatically in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about making a claim.  He then went on to talk about the people where there might be some doubts about them; the extent to which the claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming unemployed, the type of work the claimant is seeking, whether there are domestic or other commitments or circumstances which limit the claimant's ability to accept full-time employment which would normally be regarded as suitable, and whether the claimant has a history.  I know this is all said with perfect goodwill, but to somebody who has been unemployed for 12 months, living in a country where there are over 200,000 people unemployed and where the most optimistic forecast suggests that we will not get below 150,000 and perhaps not below 190,000 for ten years, that is meaningless gobbledegook.  How can you hypothesise that people have domestic or other commitments that will prevent them taking up a full-time job when they cannot find a job offer anywhere in the area in which they live?  It is meaningless gobbledegook.  That is the objection I have to the present system, to suggest that somebody after six months or nine months unemployment should still have to go through a meaningless ritual and a meaningless attempt to prove they are available for something that does not exist.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Murphy said.  I deliberately tried to word this motion so that it was not seen in conspiratorial terms.  It is simply that a large system which started when there was relatively no unemployment, is still operating within the parameters of a society <Col N="544" /> where there is scandalously high unemployment and is trying to make the same system fit an entirely different problem. That is what is wrong with the whole issue.  That is what is wrong with the whole problem of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>There must come a time in our society when, in all humanity, we say to unemployed people, enough is enough, we have tried to train you, we have tried to get you work, you have tried to get work, everybody else has tried to get you work and we have all failed.  The least we can do at the end of all that is leave people alone with what is left of their dignity when they are unemployed and not perpetually pursue this.  How, for instance, is it possible to adjudicate on the record of somebody who has been unemployed for 15 months as to whether that person has a history of leaving employment frequently without good cause?  How can anybody adjudicate on that for somebody who has been unemployed for 15 months or two years?  There is a philosophy and a thinking behind this; it is not the fault of the Minister, it is most emphatically not the fault of his officials; it is the fault of a system that we have thought up. What I have tried to say throughout this debate is that in the case of the long term unemployed, all of these phrases like &ldquo;availability for work&rdquo; are meaningless. The Minister issued guidelines in pursuit of what I would still say is a meaningless exercise.  Certain questions are to be asked in a sensitive fashion.  He talks about the guidelines that are being issued to officials which stress that all claimants, both male and female, are subject to the same line of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be snide about this but I made desperate efforts today to get my hands on those guidelines and the Minister's office did not seem to be able to put their hands on them anywhere.  It would have been very useful to have them in order to comment on them.  I sincerely hope that local offices are able to find them more rapidly than the Minister's office was.  They seem like a good idea. They seem well-intentioned and they <Col N="545" /> seem to meet the reasonable, limited perceptions. In the minute or so that I have left, I want to repeat what I have said at the beginning.  In terms of this requirement to be available for work and the requirement to be actively seeking employment, people in our society who have been unemployed for 12 months, and are most likely to remain unemployed know that the statistics and the experts all say that unemployment is going to stay around 200,000 indefinitely. <Col N="546" /> To ask them to go through a meaningless ritual of looking for work, availabilty for work, is in fact a systematic, built into the system persecution of a large minority of our society.  This is not by individuals, not by Ministers, but by us, our society and our system.  We ought to change it. We must end it.  They are a minority. They are excluded.  They suffer.  We could stop it and stop it quickly.  I appeal to the Minister to be the one to begin to end it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have the motion for the Adjournment in the name of Senator Joe O'Toole:</P>
      <P>The need to pay primary teachers on a fortnightly basis rather than a monthly or bimonthly and thereby eliminate what is clearly a discriminatory provision in as much as teachers are the only significantly sized group in the Civil or Public Service which do not have an option of fortnightly pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Well said, a Chathaoirligh, in your presentation of my case and <Col N="547" /> that is precisely my case.  If the Minister were to say yes at this point we could all go on and initiate the Christmas festivities. He does not seem to be inclined to accept so easily.  I would say Minister we are dealing here with an issue that teachers are the only group in the public service who cannot budget on a weekly basis like the vast majority of workers. The situation for teachers is that in the month where there are five weekends or in the bimonthly period when there are three weekends, it just becomes impossible to budget.  The world budgets on a weekly basis.  Workers get paid weekly or fortnightly and on that basis people run their households, do their shopping and run their home budgets.  I am aware, and the Minister will confirm that the Department of Education are now installing a new computerised system in the Department.  This computer system will facilitate changes in the methods of payment.</P>
      <P>I have raised this matter with the Department of Education on numerous occasions over the last four or five years. What I am now seeking from the Minister is a commitment that we will get the option to fortnightly payment as soon as that new computer system is put into operation or before.  The Minister will be aware that at the moment 11,500 teachers are paid bimonthly, primary teachers are paid bimonthly.  They are already being paid with an advance from the State.  In other words, rather than getting payment on the third of each month, some of them are paid in the in-between period, between the third and the third of the next month.  That is an advance.</P>
      <P>The proposal I am putting to the Minister tonight would on occasions save the Department money because in certain years it is required that teachers be paid in the last weekend of the month and over the last weekend of the year.  Sometimes payment has to be issued during the current year, thereby distorting the Estimates in the budget.  May I say at this time that I intend sharing my time with Senators Costello and Ross, with five minutes each at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> If teachers are paid bimonthly it may include a period of three weekends or if they are paid on a monthly basis it may include five weekends, which means they are not able to budget.  There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for that.  Teachers are the only group of public servants who are discriminated against in this way.  It is only fair play and is no more than teachers deserve.  They are entitled to get payment, like every other worker in the State, in a normal time period.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Department's problem in terms of their slowness to implement this.  I have certainly been reasonable in my demands on this issue in the past.  The Department have pointed out to me on a number of occcasions that the existing computer programme could not facilitate, without great difficulty to the Department, payment on a fortnightly basis.  At that time I asked the Department if I could get a commitment to implement the new arrangements for fortnightly pay when a new computer system was installed.  That is to take place in the next calendar year and all I require of the Minister is a commitment that this will be done, a commitment that teachers will be paid like other workers on a fortnightly basis. That commitment does not appear to create a problem for any other group of workers in the Civil Service or in the public service.  Teachers would then be able to budget their money and households in the normal way on a weekly basis.  Nobody can budget for this extra weekend in a month.  In reality, the only month that works in budgeting terms for teachers is February because that is a four week month and people can budget on a four-week basis.  Teachers are being discriminated against on this matter in a somewhat invidious way.  The civil and public servants who deal with the payment of teachers are all paid on a fortnightly basis.  I have never been given a reason why teachers could not be paid on a fortnightly basis apart from the mechanical and operational difficulties that <Col N="549" /> would arise in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>For that reason, let us now allow teachers to get the normal type and frequency of payment as other workers, pay them on a fortnightly basis which will allow them to budget.  It is obvious that teachers are not an overpaid group of workers.  They are fairly meagrely paid at the best of times and this is something that the Minister will confirm.  Having said that, could the Minister not make life somewhat easier for them by giving a simple and clear commitment that, with the introduction of a new computer facility, the Department of Education will guarantee that teachers will be paid on a fortnightly basis.  The point is very clear and simple.  I await the Minister's response and I defer to my two colleagues who have five minutes each before the Minister replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion that Senator O'Toole has put down for the Adjournment.  This is as big a problem in the post-primary sector as in the primary sector, no one in the public or private sector has the option of being paid on a fortnightly basis or, indeed, on a weekly basis.  Teachers are paid on a monthly basis or a bi-monthly basis.  This is an anomolous situation that exists only in relation to teachers and there is no justification for its continuation.  I do not understand why teachers are paid on the 5th of each month which means effectively that they have to wait five weeks for the original part of the salary to which they are entitled&mdash;no doubt the Department of Education benefit from the interest on that money.  A couple of years ago it was the 12th of the month and teachers had to wait six weeks for a salary to which they were entitled from the beginning of the previous month.  That is an anomalous and discriminatory situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of rights and entitlements there is no answer to our claim that we should be paid at least on a fortnightly basis.  We should certainly have the option of payment on a weekly basis.  It really is invidious to say that the people <Col N="550" /> who are in charge of paying us are, in fact, paid on a fortnightly basis, whereas we who are the recipients are not.  The origins of this, I presume, go back to the old distinction between the salaried worker and the wage earner and the salaried earner being paid on a monthly basis.  Indeed, way back they were paid on a six monthly basis.  Imagine trying to budget on that.  The wage earner was paid on a weekly basis.  That is an antiquated system.  There is no necessity for such distinctions now.  That is the Dickensian fashion in which people were paid and it is time we rationalised and streamlined our system and paid teachers according to their needs.  Their needs are to be able to handle their money in a rational, logical form.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole pointed out, everything focuses on the weekend and one's budget.  If one is getting money a month ahead of time, it is much more difficult to organise it.  If one can get it within two weeks then it is much easier to ensure one is able to deal with it properly. A bi-monthly payment is far different from a fortnightly payment.  One is dealing with it on a regular basis and not on the vagaries of the length of the month, which causes undue problems in relation to the number of weekends, from three weekends to five weekends.  That is virtually impossible to handle and is infuriating for people, especially those with large families, a mortgage and the numerous problems that arise in terms of budgeting on one's salary.</P>
    <P>New technology has just been introduced in the Department of Education and they are trying to get control of various areas.  If the Department do not address the salary side, as they have addressed their examinations branch it will be much more difficult to get it done in the future.  When new technology is introduced it will be a simple matter of adjusting the term of payment initially instead of leaving it for years later.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also address the whole question of what has been a rather outworn technicality in terms of payment to the post-primary sector, that is the sum of money that is paid by the management <Col N="551" /> of the voluntary secondary schools&mdash;the £400 that has not changed down through the years?  That is also an anomaly and is now a mere token.  That is paid at a different time.  In the voluntary secondary system one moiety is paid from management at one time and then later, another from the Department of Education.  They are both paid on a monthly basis.  The entirely should be paid by the Department of Education on a fortnightly basis.  The only response I ever got from the Department of Education is that it is too much trouble, there is too much administration involved and it creates difficulties.  Everything is a difficulty with bureaucracy.  It is up to the Department of Education to ensure they have the technical and administrative know-how which is accepted as the norm in every other sector.  There is no reason why the Department of Education should lag behind all the other Departments and, certainly, why it should lag behind the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Senator O'Toole for a very short part of his time on this Adjournment debate. The issue of teachers' payment is a symptom of the way that Governments have successively taken teachers for granted for many years.  Whereas the issue in itself may not seem important, the refusal of the Government to solve it is indicative of their attitude to the teaching profession. To a large extent they are a neglected group and have been taken for granted by successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only a small and minor plea for equal treatment for teachers in an area where other public servants are getting particular treatment.  I would like to add my voice to those of Senators O'Toole and Costello.  Will the Minister consider the position of teachers who, as Senator O'Toole rightly said, are in the same position as other public servants in that they may wish, because of their financial situation and because they are an underpaid group in society, to budget weekly as they may find it impossible to budget monthly?  They should simply have that <Col N="552" /> option which is being refused by the Department now.</P>
    <P>An ideal opportunity is being offered to the Department to change this system by the introduction of a new computer in the Department of Education.  It will not be good enough for the Minister to come back and say this would be administratively difficult.  He has to justify it on moral and ethical grounds and to say why the teachers themselves have been singled out for different treatment from anybody else.  Their lot in society is difficult enough.  They are discriminated against in that their qualifications are not recognised in some countries abroad. They have great difficulties about changing employment, about moving from job to job, and they do not have the privileges or the security of other public servants.  I ask the Minister to consider the pleas that have been made today and make this small concession which would be so good for the morale of the teaching profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to say at the outset in this season of goodwill that if I ever find myself in trouble I would love to have those three Senators help me make my case, to get me out of whatever difficulties I might be in, especially when it came to the morale and ethical bit at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of what has been said by all three Senators.  It does seem unreasonable that more than 20,000 teachers in the primary sector&mdash;and indeed as Senator Costello pointed out in the post-primary sector&mdash;are paid monthly; they should be paid fortnightly as are most other professions.  However, the system for the employment and payment of primary teachers is unique in that they cannot be directly compared with any other group in the public service. Primary teachers are employed by boards of management of national schools and the payment of salary is made by my Department on behalf of the board.  In accordance with the provisions under the rules for national schools, salaries cannot be paid to a primary teacher unless certain certified documentation is submitted <Col N="553" /> to my Department by the manager of the school.</P>
    <P>Senators will acknowledge that the primary payroll is a very large one.  There are more than 20,000 teachers on that payroll and any alteration to it has administrative and financial implications which are being studied at present.  I will certainly come back to the Senators to inform them of the progress being made. Essentially that is what I want to convey this evening.  However, it is only right that I should refer to some of the difficulties that have been mentioned by the Senators and which exist.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the provision of a new payment system on a fortnightly basis would require the allocation of scarce resources to deal with the extra administrative work that would arise.  Given the stringent cutbacks, and indeed staff restrictions, that exist in the Department of Education we have an immediate, very practical difficulty.  I take the point being made, that we should not say that administrative difficulties or an increased workload are good enough reasons not to accede to Senator O'Toole's request. Quite frankly until I went to the Department of Education I did not realise the very serious difficulties which staff in the Department have to work under because of the very low level of staffing now, in comparison to ten years ago, when many more people were employed to do much less work than is now the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty, as the Senator will appreciate, is that everybody is suffering.  New initiatives such as those he mentioned are desirable and it would certainly be the wish of the Minister and myself to have them brought into being. However, reality is that even if we were to decide in the morning that we would pay teachers fortnightly, from a practical point of view it is just not possible.  There are many things right now in my area of responsibility in the Department that I want to do, which can and should be done <Col N="554" /> but I just do not have the manpower to do it.  In fact, the civil servants who are working in that area and in several areas for which I have responsibility are working way above and beyond the call of duty to try to keep up with the level of work.  This is a real problem.  Before I went into the Department I would have been critical, in a general way, of their performance on many issues such as this one but when I saw the very serious practical difficulties and the great pressure that public servants in the Department of Education are under I appreciated that it is not quite as simple as to merely make a decision.  Having said that, I appreciate the point made and I think everybody will agree that teachers should be paid on a fortnightly basis.</P>
      <P>Senators have mentioned the question of the new technology now available which inevitably cuts down the workload. While there are some other issues such as agreement of the management authorities and, perhaps, a more efficient method of the reporting system which exists in regard to salary payment, we are anxious to see if an improvement can be made and a development brought about where teachers could be paid on a fortnightly basis.  I have asked my Department to give the work they have been doing in this respect their most urgent attention so that perhaps sooner rather than later we may be able to get over the practical difficulties and find the extra money which is always the root of all evil and go ahead with the proposal to pay on a fortnightly basis.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the considerations I have mentioned have to be carefully examined and only when the <Col N="555" /> practical difficulties are solved, will the Minister for Education be in a position to say that we can go ahead.  The Minister's wish is to bring about this development but only when we get over the very important obstacles that are there now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with what Senator Costello said in regard to post-primary teachers even though it is not the subject of the motion.  I am amazed to find the figure is still £400.  It was £400 in my time and I <Col N="556" /> am now nine years out of teaching.  Surely there must be a more efficient and direct way of paying the full salary to post-primary teachers than the present system?  I will undertake to have that examined and see if in the context of the overall evolvement of salary payments we can change that.</P>
