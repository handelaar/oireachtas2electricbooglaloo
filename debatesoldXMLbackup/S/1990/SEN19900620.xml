      <P>I have notice from Senator Tom Hussey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to consider Tuam, Country Galway, as a location for a Government Department as part of decentralisation scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to alleviate the enormous delays and the deteriorating position in the Land Registry, and to make a statement on the future efficiency of the Registry.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le fiafraí den Aire Oideachais cén fáth nár fograíodh fós cead le haghaidh deisiucháin agus méadú dó Gairm Scoil Choilm Cille, Indreabhán, Contae na <Col N="1170" /> Gaillimhe a chur i gcrích mar a gealladh agus cén uair atá an tAire sásta an obair seo a cheadú.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Tom Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>In view of the damage caused to cross-Border relations by the 48-hour restriction on travellers and in the light of the European Court of Justice findings, the need for the Minister for Finance to comply with the court's ruling by lifting this illegal restriction without delay.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to enable Dublin Corporation to continue its programme for upgrading its housing stock.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to discuss the possibility of the integration of third level colleges in the Limerick region.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Paddy McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for Seanad Éireann to take note of the report of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hussey, Neville, Ó Foighil, Raftery and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hussey's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville, Ó Foighil, Raftery and Costello may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matters raised by Senator Jackman and McGowan are not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment &mdash; Senator Jackman's as it advocates legislation and Senator McGowan's on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility and is more suitable for discussion as a substantive motion.</P>

      <P>I have a message for the House and it concerns the printing of the Control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Bill, 1990.  Before I call on the Leader of the House for the Order of Business I would like to point out that the Control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Bill, 1990, which is a Bill initiated in the Seanad, was inadvertently printed and circulated to Members on green paper as if it were a Dáil Bill.  This was due to a printers error, which is regretted.  The Bill was subsequently printed and circulated on yellow paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is item No. 1, Control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Bill, 1990.  I have to point out that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the debate on all Stages of this Bill will be brought to a conclusion not later than 6 p.m. by the question being put from the Chair.  It is then proposed to have a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take the Progressive Democrats motion on agriculture.  That motion will be concluded next week in a debate from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I wish to raise two items.  First, in view of the statement by the leader of the junior partner in the present Coalition that he would welcome a wide-ranging discussion on aspects of the Constitution, may I ask the Leader of the House if he would agree to make time available over the coming weeks on an ongoing basis for this wide-ranging discussion on the Constitution?  I believe it is something which is very appropriate to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, two weeks ago I asked the Leader of the House if he would be able to report back to us fairly soon on some of the issues arising out of the recent court cases involving this House and I <Col N="1172" /> wonder if he would have any information on that today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the matter of the colour of the paper of the Bill was sorted out because anything of an even slightly green tinge can get one into trouble on these benches here where I sit.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning; it would be wonderful to have a debate on constitutional issues because I for one &mdash; and, I am sure, Senator Manning will agree with me &mdash; would like to figure out how the Progressive Democrats discovered divorce five years after the referendum when they were invisible during it.  It would be wonderful to find out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would be able to give us some details on the arrangements for the Nelson Mandela visit, if he can update what he had said the last day to us?  Secondly, may I ask the Leader of the House if he has made any progress in relation to compositing a serious of motions so that we can have a debate on farm incomes? Thirdly, may I ask the Leader of the House if he will make time available to have a debate on poverty arising from the controversial statements which have been made on this major issue during the past week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>A fortnight ago I asked the Leader of the House if this House would be directly given a first hand information and a report on our six months of the EC Presidency.  I now ask the Leader again because, in fairness, I do not think <Col N="1173" /> the Members of this House should have to read it in a report of the Dáil.  The Taoiseach, or somebody designated in his place, could come to this House and tell us.  May I ask the Leader of the House if he has followed that up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Maurice Manning in his request for a debate on the wide-ranging issues of the Constitution in which context perhaps might be placed his subsequent remarks about recent court cases.  It appears from this remark that Senator Manning is particularly in need of the education that might ensue from this debate.  I understand he is referring to something like the question of separation of powers and I recommend him to read the judgement in that case.  If such a debate emerges I will be very happy to take a full part for the first time in those proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to cut across you but there is a procedure here and if Senator Manning had gone on I would have also pointed out to him that he can put down a motion and have it discussed in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, but I do feel it is pestilential that we have this continually raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if the Senator had been here two weeks ago when I raised the question he would know what I am talking about.  On that occasion the Leader of the House undertook to come back to us with a report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to continue by asking about item No. 32, the question of the disruption of the Belfast-Dublin rail service.  The Leader of the House gave an undertaking that this debate would be taken.  It was interrupted by other matters and I simply wish to know when this will be taken and if he could give some information on that.  Finally, may I ask the Leader of the House if there will be any response forthcoming from the Government to the recent obnoxious, irresponsible and unhelpful statements of the Mayor of New York, Mr. Dinkins, that an IRA man convicted of murder was merely a soldier who had killed another soldier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to support my colleague, Senator Upton, in asking the Leader of the House if he would make time available to discuss the implications of the report by the Combat Poverty Agency.  It is a matter that concerns a very large proportion of the inhabitants of this country and is one this House should ensure it deals with very quickly.</P>
      <P>Secondly, may I ask the Leader of the House if he can give us any information about the progress of the Derelict Sites Bill that has now been before the Dáil for a very considerable time having passed through the Seanad.  At the time it was before the Seanad we were talking about very considerable urgency in getting the matter passed into legislation so that it could be implemented, particularly in the context of the large urban areas.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to raise a matter I have raised again and again, that is that time be made available to debate the situation in Northern Ireland.  I am not the only one doing this.  This has come from all sides of the Opposition over a long period of months.  We have a situation where we have had time to debate matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised before by you, Senator, on a number of occasions on your own admission. I am not going to allow you to do it again today.  There is a procedure by which you can deal with the matter if you feel strongly about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is such an important matter that the Leader of the House would now turn his attention to making time available for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House a couple of very simple questions.  Is it intended to take item No. 3 tomorrow, that is, the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, and, if not, when is it intended to take it?  It is important to take it before the end of the session, I would have thought.  Secondly, perhaps it is through ignorance on my part, but I cannot understand why item No. 1 should be finished at 6 o'clock today.  It seems to me slightly dangerous that we should say we are going to have to close it today even if there are more speakers left.  We do not seem to be clogged down with business and if the Leader of the House is going to tell us that a Bill should be finished and the question put today he should give us a reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the delegation to Iran over the weekend.  It got very favourable publicity.  Any effort made in regard to the release of the hostages in Iran is to be welcomed and it is particularly gratifying in view of the fact that one Member of this House was a prominent member of that delegation. Any steps that are taken which would lead to the eventual release of the hostages is to be welcomed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to respond to the question put by Senator Brendan Ryan about the Progressive Democrats conversion.  Perhaps it was when they abolished God in the Constitution that they discovered divorce, but maybe we will discover that during a debate or discussion later on here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter not of major significance, but it has been puzzling me since I became a Member of this House.  Perhaps you could help unravel the puzzle for me.  I wonder why the Clerk of the Seanad reads the opening prayer in the Seanad for the Cathaoirleach while in the Dáil the Ceann Comhairle reads the prayer for him or herself. Is there a particular reason for that procedure?</P>

      <P>In the interests of good order during the Order of Business, and with due respect to the House, I did not want to enter into debate with Senator Brendan Ryan but I can assure him that if we have a debate on the Constitution &mdash; and I would welcome such a debate &mdash; I would have no fears about debating any point we have put forward.  Indeed, we have put forward a draft constitution, as he well knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Points have been raised by a number of Senators.  Senator Manning and others spoke about having a debate on the Constitution.  I have no intention <Col N="1177" /> at this time of having a debate on the Constitution, certainly not during the session, for reasons I will outline.  While I have indicated that legislation takes priority, I would remind the House that in the session left to the end of July or maybe August the following Bills will have to be passed.  There is a new Bill being published, the Enviornmental Protection Agency Bill.  A Fisheries Bill will also be published within the next few days.  We then have to take the National Treasury Management Agency Bill, the Insurance Bill, the Broadcasting Bill, the Industrial Credit Bill, the Industrial Relations Bill, Shannon Navigation Bill, we have a Bill for tomorrow, the Criminal Justice Bill, and next week we have the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill.  We have a very long programme so it will not be possible to include debates which have been requested by a number of Senators.</P>
      <P>The other point raised by Senator Manning was the question of the court decision.  I have made inquiries and have received advice, as it were, on that which I will give you.  The matter which the Senator raised is a fundamental question as to whether the courts can supervise and adjudicate upon the manner in which the House exercises its constitutional functions in relation to making its own rules, Standing Orders and regulating its procedural affairs.  Undoubtedly, there are some decisions of the Seanad which may be reviewed by the courts, the most obvious one of which is legislation that has been passed in conjunction with the Dáil, which may be reviewed on a question of it being repugnant to the Constitution. Procedural matters may be said to fall within a different category.  I refer in particular to procedural matters concerning the Seanad as a whole or any of its committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Seanad in the conduct and regulation of such affairs should act in conformity with the provisions and the principles of the Constitution, including the principles of constitutional justice. Where an issue arises as to whether the Seanad or any committee has acted in accordance with such provisions or such principles, the real question is whether it <Col N="1178" /> is for the Seanad to determine such an issue arising from the internal workings of the House in accordance with article 15, with Senators ultimately answerable to their electors, or whether they are answerable individually or collectively to the courts in relation to this class of matter.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to try to provide a definite definitive answer to this fundamental question because to embark on an extensive and wide-ranging analysis of these questions would be an empty exercise.  The reason I say this is that the answer involving, as it does, interpretations of the provisions of the Constitution, is a matter of law and ultimately for the courts to determine.  Certainly, the Seanad will be entitled to form a view that the courts have no jurisdiction to review these matters.</P>
    <P>Senators should note that the courts have taken no binding view on the question which has been raised and certainly did not do so in the recent case which has given rise to this debate.  In that case the application for the judicial review was made <i>ex parte</i>, that is, without any view or argument being expressed by any party other than the applicant.  All the court did was to give leave or permission to the applicant to apply for a judicial review. It was then open to the House or any named respondent to go into court and seek to have the judicial review proceedings struck out or dismissed on the grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction to review any decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, <i>inter alia,</i> on the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative organs of State.  This was not done and any subsequent order made by the court was made by consent, without any legal ruling or binding judgment on a question of legal principle.  Any procedural changes arising from that case arise because of an agreement reached between the parties and not because of any decision by the courts.  As I have already said, the Seanad in the conduct and regulation of its procedures should do so and I do not believe it has ever consciously sought to do otherwise in <Col N="1179" /> accordance with the provisions and principles of the Constitution.  The House may do so in the belief that it is exclusively a matter for the House, should the House take that view.</P>
    <P>If a legal controversy were to arise in the future &mdash; and we hope this will not occur &mdash; if a Senator were to make a similar application to the courts, it would be open to the Seanad or the respondents in such a case, should they wish to do so, to assert and to defend the Seanad's position on the grounds that the Constitution vests the regulation of procedural matters in the House in the Seanad exclusively and that its decisions in this regard are not reviewable by the courts.  In so far as there would then be two opposing views before the courts on this question of law, it would be a matter for the courts to resolve and to decide.</P>
    <P>There is little, if anything, to be gained by having a debate on these issues.  The House should and must continue to regulate and conduct its affairs according to its own judgment and seek to do so, as it has sought heretofore, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and principles of constitutional justice. Should an issue of the nature to which I refer come before the courts again, the House will have an opportunity, if it so wishes &mdash; and I might point out that it did not take it up on the last occasion &mdash; to have advanced on its behalf in the courts the view that such matters are exclusively a matter for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The other point raised by Senator Ryan also referred to the Constitution.  I have explained why I do not propose taking the debate on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton referred to the Mandela visit.  I indicated last week that there will be space provided in the Division Lobbies for Senators; in other words, we cannot sit in the Deputies' seats.  The Senator asked for a debate on farm income and also on poverty.  I have to say again, for the reasons I have given, that I cannot see ourselves having a debate on those issues in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the EC Presidency and this was raised by a <Col N="1180" /> number of speakers on all sides of the House.  We are working very constructively towards having that matter resolved.  When we have it finalised, hopefully, it will be agreed with the Whips.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to three items which were not relevant to the Order of Business.  Senator Costello referred to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator referred to the Constitution.  He referred to the statements in New York.  The other item possibly is relevant, but I have no intention at this point of taking it.  My apologies if I misled the Senator there.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello and Senator McKenna referred to matters which were not relevant.  Senator Doyle's point was not relevant.  Senator Keogh's point was not relevant to the Order of Business today; again, it was dealing with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the question of a debate on item No. 3 tomorrow. That will be taken tomorrow morning. He also asked why the Bill before us was finishing at 6 p.m.  I would point out that this was agreed by the Whips and I understand the same procedure, a three hour debate, is taking place on this Bill in the other House by agreement.  I am quite certain in saying that the reason for this is that the previous piece of legislation, the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, was debated for weeks and weeks in this House, and equally in the other House. I feel that what we have before us here now is simply tidying up or remedying defects that were present in that legislation which, I might point out, were referred to in the debate in this House by many speakers on both sides and now we <Col N="1181" /> find that the Act cannot continue without these amendments.  It is a short amending piece of legislation.  I stress that we had much debate on the main Bill about three years ago and hence the reason for a short debate on this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the Derelict Sites Bill.  My apologies for not referring to it when I spoke earlier.  I understand that Bill is being completed this evening in the other House.  It is an amendment from this House to the Dáil. They are taking that and it will be passed this evening.  He also asked for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I have no plans for a debate on Northern Ireland at this time.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is twofold.  First, it is to amend the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, so as to deal with difficulties which have arisen in the operation of that Act particularly in so far as it relates to the responsibilities imposed on ethics committees by the Act.  Secondly, the Bill seeks to provide certain legal immunities for the National Drugs Advisory Board in relation to the functions imposed on it under Article 4 of the National Drugs Advisory Board (Establishment) Order, 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Bill is necessary in order to overcome obstacles which have adversely affected the effective operation of the 1987 Act as a whole and which threatens to seriously limit clinical research in this country.  Because of the difficulties being experienced, I established a small working party to review the workings of the Act and in particular how the obstacles might best be overcome. The working group was representative of the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians and officials of my Department. The recommendations of the working group have been taken fully into account in the preparation of the Bill now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular difficulties have arisen for ethics committees from the obligations imposed on them by section 10 of the Act <Col N="1183" /> which obliges the committees to satisfy themselves in relation to the adequacy of the financial arrangements made to compensate those who may suffer injury or loss as a result of participating in a clinical trial.  Legal advice obtained by a number of hospital-based ethics committees have highlighted the potential open-endedness of section 10 and suggests that the burden placed on ethics committee members in assessing the adequacy of compensation arrangements leaves such members open to being sued for negligence.  Most hospital-based committees have accordingly either stepped down or are only giving consideration to trials on products which have licences and which are in current use.  Trials on new products have virtually ceased in such hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, proposing the removal of this particular obligation from ethics committees by amending section 10 of the Act as provided for in section 3 of the Bill.  The amendment will require that a person shall not either arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial nor conduct a clinical trial unless they have first established to the satisfaction of the Minister for Health the adequacy of the arrangements for security to compensate persons who may suffer injury or loss as a result of their participation in a clinical trial. The amendment while removing the difficulties experienced by ethics committees, will at the same time ensure that there will be adequate security to provide any compensation to participants that may become necessary.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the particular problems of ethics committees I have taken the opportunity to further amend the Act to deal with two other minor matters which require further definition or clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) (a) (ii) provides for an exemption from the definition of a clinical trial and thereby from the controls set out in the Act of a trial where the principal purpose is the welfare of the patient.  In the light of the operation of this subsection, it has transpired that, as worded, <Col N="1184" /> there is scope for a fairly broad interpretation of what is intended.  Clinicians involved in clinical research sought clarification on the intention of the section and so I proposed in section 2 of the new Bill to amend section 6 of the Act so as to state clearly the aim of the section and specifically to exclude trials where the intention is to prevent disease in, or to save the life, to restore the health, alleviate the condition or to relieve the suffering of the patient.  The amendment, which will set out clearly and unambiguously the intention of section 6, was prepared in full consultation with parties involved in this area of research.  It will also provide a useful tie-in and ensure consistency with the provision of section 9 (7) of the Act which provides safeguards for patients who are participants in clinical trials.</P>
    <P>I also propose by section 4 of the Bill to amend section 13 of the Act which deals with offences and provides for defences in relation thereto.  There is a need to provide appropriate defences for unincorporated bodies such as ethics committees and the purpose of the proposed amendment is to bring this about.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide certain legal immunities for those parties involved in administering the Act, in particular the ethics committees, in relation to their functions under the act.  I am also proposing an immunity for the Minister for Health in relation to the Act and am taking the opportunity to deal with the liability of the National Drugs Advisory Board, under this Act and in relation to its functions under Article 4 of the National Drugs Advisory Board (Establishment) Order, 1966 and for committees established under Article 18 of the same Order.</P>
    <P>The provision of such immunity is a well established feature of legislation and there are many precedents for it.  The members of the National Drugs Advisory Board, who are appointed by the Minister for Health, are leading specialists in the fields of medicines, pharmacology, toxicology and other related disciplines and provide their services free of charge.</P>
    <P>Over the years concern has been <Col N="1185" /> expressed by members of the board with regard to possible legal liabilities which may fall upon them as a consequence of their membership of the board and they have sought an appropriate indemnity. The matter was referred to the Attorney General for advice.  The Attorney recommended the provision of an immunity as set out in section 5 of the Bill.  Similar immunity has been granted to other State boards, including EOLAS (formerly the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards) and the National Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the continued participation of specialists to the highest standing as members of the board and its specialist committees and thereby maintain its internationally recognised status, the Government consider that it will be necessary to provide an immunity along the lines which I now propose.  The Attorney General considers the proposed Bill to be an appropriate vehicle in which to provide the immunity.</P>
    <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 was a prototype piece of technical and complex legislation.  In such circumstances initial teething problems were always a possibility.  At the same time, the Government were committed to keeping the operation of the Act under review and to deal with any difficulties that might arise.  The amendments now proposed will overcome the difficulties being experienced and thus restore Ireland's position as a favourable location for clinical research thereby ensuring the objectives of the Act, to facilitate research and to protect participants in clinical trials, are fully realised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to <Col N="1186" /> express my personal satisfaction and that of my party that this country was, as is reported in one of the national papers this morning, the first in the world to authorise the use of a new anti-viral drug for the treatment of patients in the early stages of AIDS.  I gather the name of the drug is Ribavirin and has been approved by the National Drugs Advisory Board and announced by Dr. Allen Scott in the papers this morning.  That is particularly good news for the country.  It is an interesting development as a back drop to the debate we are going to have today.  I welcome that as a major development.  It is great this country is at the forefront of this work.  People suffering from AIDS obviously cannot wait and is a great advance.</P>
      <P>The business of clinical trials and of continuous research into new drugs, their uses and the reaction of patients is very important.  As a background to this there was the tragic death of Niall Rushe in 1984 and the dreadful events surrounding the Thalidomide cases.  When we consider the tremendous, almost holocaust, proportions of the recent AIDS epidemic in the world, the variety of cancers in the western world, there can be no rational person who does not accept that there is a need to continue the process of clinical trials, to test new drugs on an ongoing basis and to reassess those drugs while in operation.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the past hundred years have seen startling developments in international health care and tremendous revolutionary developments in drugs and in the treatment of sick persons.  That process must continue. Because we were waiting on this legislation there is no doubt the process of clinical testing of drugs was held up.  I have been made aware over the past few days that individual members of ethics committees were concerned about their position and were consequently very reluctant to continue with trials in an unclear environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party are conscious of the fact that this Bill was announced at very short notice.  Normally that would concern us <Col N="1187" /> but in the light of the legislation in question and of the gravity of the matter we do not propose to make an issue of this but over these couple of days we are having consultations with the different interest groups concerned and we are having ongoing consultations with them and any amendments our party may table in the Dáil will be based on those consultations. We are also happily aware that there have been consultations at Departmental level with the interest groups as well.</P>
    <P>On balance, I believe this is welcome and important legislation and it is proper that it should come before the House and be dealt with the greatest urgency.  It is the view of my party that it be enacted with the greatest urgency because the matters concerned are of tremendous gravity in terms of bringing about cures in the short term that are necessary and improving the availability of drugs.</P>
    <P>While it is important to go ahead with research and not to completely tie the hands of pharmaceutical companies and institutions engaged in clinical trials, it is also important to ensure that relevant safeguards for the individuals concerned are provided.  It is very important that at the outset we have a very strict set of criteria for selection of participants in clinical trials.  There are risks involved; there are risks of socially deprived people, of people who are in great personal need, of people of questionable emotional health etc. becoming unwitting guinea pigs in clinical trials.  That is why it is so important that there be very strict criteria applied to the selection of the individuals for the trials.</P>
    <P>It is extremely critical that the person involved be assessed and screened by professional people to ensure that they are there for the right reasons and also that they have a full knowledge of what to expect and of the implications of the trials.  It is important that their entire state of health, and I submit their mental and physical health, be assessed at the outset and be properly monitored.  Then, it is important that the trials continue in optimum conditions in that the right <Col N="1188" /> environment is created for the person who is the subject of the trials.  It is important obviously that their health be very closely monitored and also be properly monitored at the end of the trials.  It is very important to ensure that there is not an over-utilisation of volunteers, that the same people are not being wheeled in and out of trials on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The question of the ethics committees raises very important points as well and on Committee Stage we will be seeking some clarification about the ethics committees and their role and the role of individuals there.  I believe it is important that our ethics committees are made up of medical people, paramedics and lay persons.  Those committees have a key role in determining the functioning and the role of the trials.  I am somewhat impressed by the view that we should have a national ethics committee, that we should have some sort of a national supervisory body apart from the local ethics committee dealing with specific trials and specific locations.  There might be merit in considering having a national body that would look at the situation in an overall sense and perhaps monitor individual centres of trials.  That is something that would be worth exploring on committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The critical thing is to ensure that proper research continues unabated because all civilised, thinking people would want that and to balance that consideration with the rights and welfare of the individual who is the subject of the trials.  It is the view of my party that the legislation is welcome, timely, urgent and important and for that reason we do not propose in any sense to obstruct its passage through the House.  I propose to rest the issue at that and to return to more of the minor details on Committee Stage later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would like to pay tribute to him for bringing this very important legislation to the Seanad.  We all recognise the importance of clinical trials both for medical research and for training in Ireland.  It is important <Col N="1189" /> that our research in Ireland is on a par with anywhere else in the world, and much better than in some places.  That is very important for us as a country and also for the training of people here to do this work.  We have a very good, sound university education system and many highly qualified young people coming out of our universities.  It is right that we should have a place where they can train, further their knowledge and provide a service that is necessary for the benefit and health of our people and indeed of the pharmaceutical industry here.</P>
      <P>The pharmaceutical industry is very big business and employs many people.  It is important that we should be able to provide services for it.  It is also important that Ireland is seen internationally as a favourable location for this kind of research.  We have as good a health service as anywhere in the world and it is important that we have the proper research facilities to make the service available and to ensure that we have proper research carried out on various new drugs that may come on the market.</P>
      <P>The original legislation had a twofold purpose &mdash; to facilitate research and to project participants.  To facilitate research is very important but it is more important to protect the participants.  As the Minister said, the amendment requires that a person shall not arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial unless they have first established to the satisfaction of the Minister for Health the adequacy of the arrangements to compensate persons who may suffer injury or loss as a result of their participation in the clinical trial.  The amending Bill, while removing the difficulties experienced by ethics committees, is at the same time ensuring there will be adequate security to provide any compensation to participants that may become necessary.  That is very important from the point of view of those who will be participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a new area and problems inevitably arose.  The principal problem arose for the ethics committees, and the hospital ethics committees in particular. Some of those committees felt that not alone could they be sued as a committee <Col N="1190" /> but indeed that they could be sued individually and it left them in a very vulnerable situation.  I am glad the Minister has seen to that and that the ethics committee will no longer be liable.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister who was quick to identify the problem and set up a working group to examine how these problems could be resolved.  He did not do it lightly.  He appointed a working group of very important people in the medical, pharmaceutical and therapeutical fields: Mr. Enright, Chairman and Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health; Dr. C. Barry, President of the RCPI; Professor K. O'Malley, Professor of Pharmacology, the RCSI and Chairman of the NDAB; Professor J. Feehily, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Trinity College, Dublin; Mr. N. Buckley, Director General, Federation of Irish Chemical Industries; Mr. Kieran Hickey, CAO, Eastern Health Board; Dr. V. O'Gorman, CEO, the Health Research Board and Mr. M. Lyons, Principal Officer, the Public Health Division, Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The working group are very eminent people and they had consultants assisting them from the National Drugs Advisory Board, from some of the chemical industries, from the hospitals, from legal people, etc.  The Minister did a very efficient job in appointing an excellent board and there is no doubt that the legislation before us has been throughly researched and examined.  As a result of the working group's report the Minister brought forward the revised Bill which is before us today.  The Bill is to remove the problems experienced by the ethics committees and it ties up a number of other minor matters which required further clarification.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that section 2 of this Bill has a special provision to exempt the administration of medicines where the patient requires them urgently. Where you might have sombody who was terminally ill, we could fly in a drug from another country and it could be administered in the hope of saving a life.  It is very important that we think first of the <Col N="1191" /> patient and how best the patient can be cared for.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with this legislation.  It has been well researched.  The people on the working committee were all experts in their fields.  I am glad the Opposition have said they will not in any way delay the Bill because it is important that it becomes law quickly.  I welcome it and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, very briefly to welcome this legislation.  It is part of the ongoing process which originated with the original Control of Clinical Trials Bill, which I do not think was introduced by this Minister in 1986-87.  In fact, it was so loaded against the medical profession that having been introduced in this House it was then amended in many places in order to make it more practical and as a result of much lobbying from the medical profession at that time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome in that it is an immediate response to difficulties, or almost an immediate response to difficulties. It is very welcome also in that it is a sensitive response to difficulties being encountered in the medical profession and among people on the ethics committees and elsewhere through accepting responsibilities as a result of the previous measure.  It is a very difficult Bill because the Minister has to balance the need for practical medical research in this country with protection of those who are submitting themselves to this process, which is indeed something of an ordeal for them.  While I welcome the two elements in this Bill, namely the immunity for the National Drugs Advisory Board and the fact that ethics committees will not be personally responsible for compensation &mdash; these are fairly sensible provisions to facilitate medical research; the obstruction to medical research was becoming intolerable as a result of what was happening in ethics committees resigning &mdash; I think we should also bear in mind the position of those who are submitting themselves to clinical trials of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Before the last Bill which was introduced in more controversial circumstances because of the death of Niall Rushe, I went down to the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, I asked if I could go down and see what was happening, who the people were who were submitting themselves to these tests because there was a lot of public controversy and unease, quite rightly, about what had happened.  I met many who were submitting themselves to these experiments and it was not a particularly pleasant feeling to talk to them and to realise they were definitely doing it for money. People were not submitting themselves to this sort of experiment unless they needed the money.  You did not get people in the professions or in solid permanent jobs going down there.  I cannot remember how much money it was then but it may have been £25 a day, perhaps more.  You did not get people undergoing the tests for purely idealistic, altruistic reasons, I suppose, it would be a bit naive to expect people to do that.  The fact of the matter is that those who submit their bodies for these tests and trials do it because they need the small amount of money involved.  That is something we have to confront head-on and decide whether we accept that sort of thing in our society, whether people because they are poor or poorer than others should have to submit themselves to this experience which, by any standards, is a dangerous one.</P>
    <P>I am not a medical person but I asked a lot of questions about the sort of tests people went through beforehand.  It seemed to me they were very stringent, that the ICP were extraordinarily careful and were leaving absolutely no loopholes where they could be accused of putting people through these tests who were not fit to undergo them.  They went to a great deal of trouble and probably on that particular score they were doing as much as could possibly be done at that time.  I left satisfied that these people were not being subjected to some sort of draconian procedures as we are sometimes led to believe.  Although satisfied that that was the case, I left with an uncomfortable <Col N="1193" /> feeling that really it was morally wrong that those people, who submitted themselves to these tests were only from one section of society.</P>
    <P>The following suggestion is not something that is necessarily practised in other countries but because we have this difficulty of where the guinea pigs should come from would the Minister consider that everybody should submit themselves to this sort of test?  Why should not the whole country be liable to do that sort of test as a service to the community like jury service?  Why should we not all do it rather than just those who need the money?  If the tests are safe &mdash; and on the whole the vast majority of them are safe &mdash; why should we not say that in order to promote medical research on a random basis the whole citizenry of the country are liable to submit themselves to these tests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, I welcome this Bill.  Certainly one would like to see research going ahead where there is a great need for it.  There certainly appears to be problems in a small number of cases.</P>
      <P>The need for clinical trials and clinical research is perfectly obvious.  New drugs are needed.  We can anticipate new drugs coming on the market from time to time. If we were to hold things as they are then medicine would stand still.  However, there is need, also, for constant monitoring of the drugs which are at present on the market to find if they can be used more effectively and indeed whether they are fulfilling any definite function. However, we need to bear in mind that there is another side to clinical trials. There is the financial business side to medicine and there can be no getting away from that.  Certainly, in relation to drug companies there are enormous pressures, gigantic forces working to introduce new drugs and get them on the market and whether they have any useful clinical role can, in some cases, be a secondary consideration.  There is a tremendous drive to develop new products and to put them on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I used to know a little bit about <Col N="1194" /> this kind of stuff once upon a time I took up the rather harmless pastime of counting up the number of iron preparations listed in <i>Mins</i>.  There were approximately 108 differing compounds which contained iron.  It beats my comprehension why, in the name of goodness, it would be the interest of patients to have 108 differing sources of iron preparations available.  The obvious answer is that there was a financial drive to develop those products, to get in and grab a bit of market share.  That is a big problem. It is there in the background and we should not lightly forget it.  Indeed, that whole anxiety to get in there and get a share of the action is a tremendous problem.  There have been recent cases in the scientific and medical literature where in fairly simple terms people told lies.  Subsequently they were found out which raises the question of how many people are at present telling lies and are not found out.</P>
    <P>These are realities.  There are editorials on it in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine,</i> which I read once upon a time when I used to be into that kind of stuff.  There is the question of the branded drugs against generic drugs.  Why do we need branded drugs?  People will put all sorts of reasons for it but these are all background considerations.  There is that great financial drive to grab a share of the market and to get these things out and sold. There is also the manner in which they are subsequently marketed, the incentives which are provided and all that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Bill seems to be going around immunising people.  He has immunised himself, to begin with, against damages and he has immunised ethics committees.  That leaves the question, who will be liable?  Where will the buck stop if the ethics committees are not to be liable and then what will be the role of the ethics committees?</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a middle way but one begins to wonder why it is necessary and why are ethics committees so bothered? If they have done their job properly and if they have behaved properly why are they so bothered they might be at risk <Col N="1195" /> legally?  I am not speaking as a lawyer but I wonder about those kind of considerations.</P>
    <P>There are the statements of Senator Ross who visited the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and found people from the lower income groups there trying to supplement their income.  I go back to the basic point I started out with by saying I fully accept the need for clinical trials but when you see these kind of things happening it certainly makes you start thinking.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly spoke about the desirability of monitoring the health of patients at the end of the trial.  Where is the end of the effect of the trial on a patient?  Is it a week, a month, a year, a generation or a series of generations? The answer to this, if we are to be honest, is that nobody can say with certainty.  I know that in this world you have to live with risk.</P>
    <P>The other point, which is of significance here, is that these trials are being conducted in this country. One point which does not seem to be coming out of this is that a lot of the basic research, a lot of the scientific effort which generated the products which are being put on trial through this clinical trial business in this country, did not originate here.  We are buying in this stuff that is coming in at this late stage in development.  It is misleading to suggest that these clinical trials are totally serving Irish research.  They are providing a way of taking on research which was done in other countries before these products can get on the market.  Certainly, most of the drugs which appear on the Irish market, if I have any proper understanding of it, are not developed in this country at all. Most of them are developed elsewhere and brought in.  Another consideration arising from this is if it is desirable and right that Irish people should facilitate the development of drugs that originated in another country and that they should be doing it in a disproportionate manner? I raise the question but I do not say I have definitive answers to it.  There is also the point that as more of these drugs <Col N="1196" /> are developed they are pushing away the need for preventive medicine and so on.</P>
    <P>There is one point specifically in this Bill which I cannot understand.  I refer to paragraph (b) of section 2 which says:</P>
    <P>where the substance or preparation concerned is to be administered to persons undergoing a course of training leading to a qualification which will entitle such a person to be registered as a registered medical practitioner, or a registered dentist or a registered pharmaceutical chemist.</P>
    <P>It is allowed that drugs or materials would be administered to these people as part of their training.  What is different about these people that they should be subject to exposure to drugs in a manner which would not be acceptable for the rest of the public?  Is there something special about their metabolism?  We should be told.  I find that hard to understand.  I can see no scientific basis for it and I cannot see it being of value in their training.  The days of the wet laboratories in teaching are effectively gone.  We are talking of videos and this kind of equipment.  I find it very difficult to see why that provision should be necessary.  I find it difficult to understand why the line is drawn at that point.  What is the difference between a pharmacology student who is taking a degree in science and a pharmacology student who is taking a degree in medicine, dentistry or going on to be registered as a pharmaceutical chemist?  Why should those distinctions be made?  I find it hard to understand the basis for that being included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that many of these students will be in a very difficult position if they say &ldquo;No, thank you very much&rdquo; to an over-enthusiastic or, horror of horrors, a nutty or crazy professor who decides to go one over the top in terms of what will or will not be used.  The Minister is opening up all sorts of possibilities. I would be very concerned if that remains in the Bill.  I cannot see how it is necessary for the proper teaching of these students.  If it is necessary then, obviously, there must have been some type of inadequacy in those students who <Col N="1197" /> went through the system for the last two or three years when it was not possible to do that kind of thing.  I have the greatest reservations and concern about that.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the possibility of leaving the provision out of the Bill.  As I said, I think that is a matter for considerable alarm.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I am sure Senators on all sides welcome this amending legislation.  I would like to commend the Minister and his Department for their foresight in bringing it forward.  The original Bill was introduced here in 1987 and it is appropriate that the amending legislation should also be returned to this House first.  The original Bill was introduced to facilitate research. Amending legislation that will allow our country to continue to give the lead in this field is to be welcomed.  Down through the years this country has been to the fore in the medical and clinical research and it is essential that we maintain the climate to allow us to maintain our position in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will allow research to continue without fear of litigation.  That is what the Minister has in mind in introducing it.  He and his Department saw the difficulties that had arisen since 1987 and, as a result, established a working party to review the working of the legislation and the problems that had arisen. The working party was made up of all the relevant bodies from the pharmaceutical industry, medical people and experts from the Department.  It is on the basis of their recommendations that we are presented today with this amending legislation. As the Minister stated, the amendment will require that a person shall not either arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial nor conduct a clinical trial unless they have first established to the satisfaction of the Minister the adequacy of the arrangements to compensate persons who may suffer injury or loss as a result of their participation in the clinical trial.  This amendment will remove the difficulties experienced by the ethics committees and at the same time will ensure that there <Col N="1198" /> will be adequate security to provide any compensation to the participants.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his Department for introducing this legislation to ensure that this nation can continue to be in the fore in research and clinical trials.  The Minister is to be congratulated for that.</P>

      <P>As mentioned by Senator O'Reilly we welcome the Bill. Going through the 1986 and 1987 debates I see the Act was very comprehensively discussed.  We welcome the immunities in the Bill for the National Drugs Advisory Board and the ethics committees from personal responsibility.  I will concentrate on the area of research.  I hope this Bill will give a fresh impetus to medical research in Ireland at a time when it has come to a virtual standstill.  I do not know too much about the medical line but people I have spoken to have told me that one of the optimum times for research in medicine is at the junior doctor, registrar or senior registrar level.  Over the last number of years many of our doctors who wished to engage in medical research have gone abroad.  While we welcome the number of non-EC nationals from developing countries to the Irish hospitals service, recent figures have shown that we have become dangerously dependent on them.  They are welcome to come to Ireland as a training ground but statistics show that what was once 10 per cent or 15 per cent of non-EC nationals has now risen to between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.  That poses the question what happened to our own medical doctors.  When we look at the number of students who complete their medical education in our universities we see that many young people will not go into medicine because there are no jobs in this country.  That is a fact that career guidance counsellors have pointed out over the last while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an article, The Health Board Dependency on Non-nationals, 1 October 1988 &mdash; published after the Bill which provided controversy in relation to research &mdash; I was struck by the heading to the article, &ldquo;Non-Nationals; Backbone of Health Boards&rdquo;.  It is important to put <Col N="1199" /> this on record.  I hope we have not lost forever those registrars who get involved in research.  It is surprising to find that 53 per cent of all registrars in general surgery are non-nationals, 51 per cent in paediatrics, in the North-Western Health Board, 81 per cent of registrars &mdash; an extremely high figure &mdash; and in the MidWest, my own area, the figure is 72 per cent of registrars.  Those figures pose the question where have our doctors gone? They do not see in this country &mdash; and had not seen around 1986 and 1987 &mdash; the infrastructure and resources necessary to go into research.  We are talking today about research.  I will continue the figures. In the North-Eastern Health Board area the number of non-EC nationals are 54 per cent of house doctors, 60 per cent of house doctors in general surgery, 83 per cent of house doctors in orthopaedic surgery and 50 per cent of all house doctors in general psychiatry.  They are staggering facts.  Why are there so many non-EC nationals employed here and do our doctors graduating not see in Ireland a conductive atmosphere for further research?</P>
    <P>With regard to the people who put themselves forward for clinical trials, as the Minister and Senators have said, there must be an appropriate balance between the safety of the patient who is part of the trial and the rights of a practitioner.  We are alarmed at the people who put themselves forward.  We heard over the last while, in controversial circumstances regarding an Institute of Pharmacology, radio interviews where people who were questioned &mdash; they may have been selective, they may not have been a cross-section of the population &mdash; put forward their reasons for undergoing the tests.  They were not because they had incurable diseases themselves and would have liked to have contributed from a personal viewpoint towards the curing of those diseases but just for financial reasons.  They were at the lower end of the socio-economic scale.  Senator O'Reilly referred to them as guinea pigs. Yes, they do it voluntarily but it is very sad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> I was interested in what Senator Ross had to say about all of us subjecting ourselves in the same way as for jury service. However, that goes back to the whole point that there be continuous assessment and scrutiny of all those who put themselves forward.  It is not something that one does lightly.  It is fraught with risks, as we saw with the sad death of Mr. Niall Rushe in 1984, which caused this debate to start.</P>
    <P>There is one point I would like the Minister to clarify.  It relates to payments. I feel &mdash; and it is Fine Gael policy &mdash; that the people presenting themselves for trials should not be taxed but what they get should be treated as expenses because in any medical area the whole aspect of confidentiality is most important.  I believe they should be exempt from taxation. I do not know what the moneys payable to them are but I do not think they are exceptionally high.  Having regard to what they are doing and the confidentiality aspect I ask the Minister to take heed of this.</P>
    <P>The first Bill was so controversial it was necessary to come back with this measure and the Minister as a medical man should have been more aware of the situation.  However the fact that it is being brought forward today is a positive step and I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really surprised that we have an amendment to the principal Act at this stage.  The original Bill was debated very actively in this House in 1986.  It was initiated by the then Minister for Health, Mr. Barry Desmond. It was, of course, a controversial and emotive Bill and it was brought about as a result of the death of a young man, Niall Rushe, who was participating in a clinical trial at the ICP when they were on the St. James' Hospital campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people find the whole idea of clinical trials objectionable.  They say we should not have, as it were, human guinea pigs, that it is wrong.  My answer to that would be that anyone who ever had a bad illness, anyone who ever had surgery would have to admit that but for clinical trials their lives might have been lost. <Col N="1201" /> From that point of view clinical trials are part and parcel of the world of medicine today and must continue that way.</P>
    <P>I found the Bill in 1986 amazing at the time.  It was a Bill of 14 sections.  As spokesperson in the Seanad for the Fianna Fáil group in Opposition I asked that the Bill be withdrawn.  I felt it was so wrong, that there were many flaws with regard to insurance side of it and on the ethics side of it.  We felt at one stage that we would have to have clinical trials for the food we eat.  Strange, the first speaker on the Fine Gael side, the then Senator Ulick Burke, stood up and supported me.  He felt his party wanted the Bill withdrawn.  However, it was not withdrawn; it was amended, amended and amended and finally it passed the Seanad and went to the Dáil.  Many of the points raised in this new Control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Bill were mentioned at some stage along the line and I will refer to them briefly again.</P>
    <P>The intention of the principal Act &mdash; it is no harm to spell it out again &mdash; is to provide a framework of control within which the following two objectives can be achieved; first, the protection and the safeguarding of the rights of those participating in clinical trials and, secondly, the facilitation of clinical research.  I have to say, as one who took a particular interest in that Bill, I met at that time with the present Minister for Health and various groups who had an interest in it and were worried about the volunteers who were engaged in clinical trials, particularly on the ICP premises.  I felt it was right that I should visit the ICP and Elan in Athlone and I did so and met many of the people who were engaged in clinical trials because they were, after all, the most important people in the whole debate.  It was all about the protection and safeguarding of the rights of those who participate in clinical trials.</P>
    <P>Having met them, I found that, while they were participating and helping in the whole medical research process, in reality they were there for the few pounds they were getting and they would not deny that.  They would not attend those clinics if it were a voluntary situation.  Some of <Col N="1202" /> them were unemployed, on social welfare, or on low pay, but they were there to get a few pounds together to pay an ESB bill, a television licence, insurance on the car or whatever.  They all knew what they were there for.  They were told they were there for an arthritis drug, a heart drug and so on.  They were told about the possible side-effects and were informed at all times.  They were well looked after and had agreed to the informed consent, which I think was vital and was debated at length.  They had a medical examination before they attended the clinic and they had examinations during the trial, so generally all of that was well and truly tidied up even before the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>I am very keen to stress that the important people in this whole debate, if you like, are the people who participate in the trials.  While the scheme of control made provision, with some exceptions, for the need to have the authorisation of the Minister, following consultation with the Drugs Advisory Board and the ethics committee before the trial could proceed, it is also worthwhile saying that the need to have the informed consent of those participating in a trial was a paramount and an integral component of the whole control framework.  Having got that point out of the way, it is right to spell out in the Bill who are the important people.</P>
    <P>We had many problems at the time of the initiation of the Bill.  It was certainly very wrong and flawed and we had many debates on that issue.  Section 3 of this Bill seeks to amend section 10 of the principal Act.  Section 10 of the principal Act says:</P>
    <P>A person shall not (a) conduct a clinical trial, or (b) administer any substance or preparation for the purpose of a clinical trial unless such person has established, to the satisfaction of the ethics committee, that he can provide sufficient security to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of the trial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> Those words &ldquo;adequate funds&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; were debated and we tried to find out what they really meant.  Now section 3 which seeks to amend section 10 requires that a person shall neither arrange for the conducting nor conduct a clinical trial unless he establishes, to the satisfaction of the Minister, that adequate security is available, thereby removing from the ethics committee the responsibility to be satisfied as to the adequacy of such security as required by section 10 of the principal Act.  The difficulties that section 10 created were experienced initially in certain Dublin teaching hospitals, the Mater, St. James's and St. Vincent's hospitals. It became clear as time went on that there were legal problems for individual members and for ethics committees in general, and as a result clinical trials did not proceed I am aware that for the first three months of 1989, three research proposals were presented to the research ethics committee in St. James's whereas for the corresponding period in 1988, 23 proposals were presented.</P>
    <P>The perception is that, unless the matter is resolved quickly, as the Minister is now doing, clinical research will stop and that would be very serious for this country.  The Minister has moved wisely in this whole area of doubt and now members of ethics committees need have no fears.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the question of a national ethics committee.  That matter was also raised and discussed by the former Senator Mary Robinson but was not proceeded with at that time.  It was evident that hospitals would not be willing to avail of the services of such a national committee.  I remember referring to the fact that, perhaps there would be indemnifiation of ethics committees by the people who were sponsoring the trials.  Again, that was discussed but found to be unacceptable for a number of reasons.  The question was also raised that the Minister of the day might indemnify the ethics committees but that, too, was discounted.  The legal advice given <Col N="1204" /> to us at the time was that such a move would be <i>ultra vires</i> to the Act and that it was part of a broader question of principle involving indemnification of bodies by the Minister which was not acceptable. Those aspects of the problem were discounted for the reasons I have given.  The Minister has decided that this Bill is the correct way forward and that a solution can only be found by a suitable amendment to the principal Act.  In addition, the Minister has gone a stage further; he has sought to provide certain legal immunities for the Minister, the Drugs Advisory Board and the ethics committees in relation to their functions under the principal Act.  This, too, is very welcome and the ethics committees and the Drugs Advisory Board in particular will greatly welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acted wisely and well. This legislation is necessary if clinical trials and research are to continue.  It would be an absolute shame if there was any diminution of research or clinical trials.  They are continuing in certain places but the people in health boards and in the teaching hospital are affected most.  It would be very wrong if they were denied the opportunity to continue the great work they did in the past.</P>
    <P>I fully support this Bill and congratulate the Minister for bringing it forward as quickly as possible.  I am aware, having spoken to him, that he was at all times extremely anxious to have this Bill introduced but I knew there were legal problems &mdash; which is understandable because it is a complex legal matter &mdash; with the parliamentary draftsmen.  If there were any delays they were not the fault of the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, who was anxious at all times to have this Bill passed quickly, so that medical research would continue as heretofore.  We should warmly congratulate him for introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many of the other speakers, I welcome this Bill which seeks to give immunity to the National Drugs Advisory Board and to introduce <Col N="1205" /> three amendments basically to the principal Act.  The principal Act was introduced largely in response to the untimely death of Niall Rushe.  At that time, following his tragic death, a spotlight was turned on the category of people who were largely being used as healthy volunteers. They tended mainly to be down and outs, people who were probably unemployed and socially disadvantaged. There was great concern that their rights as far as possible should be safeguarded and that their participation in drug research would be made as safe as possible and, therefore, as acceptable as possible.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Ross, I believe that participation in any drug studies carries a certain element of risk both to health and in certain instances, to life.  If everything is done according to the book, so to speak, the objective is that this risk be minimised as much as possible.  However, we should be conscious of the fact that there is a risk involved.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that the need for legislation to control clinical trials on new drugs was accepted by all, and that the legislation was introduced in 1986. Unfortunately, perhaps because it was done in such a hurried fashion, it appears to have been poorly written, somewhat cobbled together.  It evoked unprecedented criticism from all branches of the medical profession, universities and various research bodies.  There were an enormous number of amendments tabled to that Bill, many of them sponsored by the Minister.  Basically, it was a bad Bill and it remained a bad Bill even though we endeavoured during its passage through the Seanad and the Dáil to improve it.  That stemmed mainly from the fact that there had been little consultation between the Department of Health and those who were most involved in research &mdash; the universities, teaching hospitals, medical schools, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the Minister's credit, it might be said that he delayed giving effect to that Act because he delayed signing it. However, when it was signed and came into effect, what had been predicted happened. Ethics committees resigned in <Col N="1206" /> most of the big teaching hospitals, and not surprisingly, when they realised the penalties.  There were rather draconian penalties, such as three years in jail and fines of up to £10,000.  When ethics committees and, indeed, researchers realised their liability in the event of, perhaps, the failure of an ethics committee to provide adequate security for compensation for every possible eventuality, they saw the difficulties they could be faced with.</P>
    <P>The Act provides volunteers with the protection that we all like to see.  Basically, the Clinical Trials Act made research safe by stopping it.  The heading of an article I read stated that research had virtually come to a halt, and this is a most unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a need for urgent amendments so that medical research can resume or continue.  Ireland has a considerable reputation for research and has undertaken research for organisations such as the World Health Organisation and others.  However, those organisations tend to run away from countries which make research excessively difficult.  I am glad the amendments are now being tabled.  I hope they will allow research to get under way and make Ireland once again a favourable location for such research.</P>
    <P>A number of bodies are of the opinion that, basically, what is required is to start with a completely new Act.  Of course, the current legislation would remain in existence until that happened and it would obviously be a long and tortuous process.  Already over a year and a half or more of research has ground to a halt and we do not want that situation to continue.  Although the Act is fundamentally flawed, it is probably better that the amendments should go though and I welcome them.  The Bill will give immunity to the National Drugs Advisory Board and also, certain immunity to ethics committees and at the same time it will provide the necessary protection for volunteers.  I hope that as a result of this Bill there will be an adequate balance and that the Bill will have a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a short, comparatively simple measure that is very timely.  As the Minister is probably aware, I have been asking regularly for the past six months on the Order of Business for an indication that this Bill would be introduced for the reason that the application of drugs in the treatment of patients, particularly with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has been held up due to the inadequacies of the original Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on one or two things I heard during the debate.  With the greatest respect to my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Ross, his suggestion that there should be mandatory use of the entire citizenry of the country as a kind of pool of guinea pigs is just about the most absurd thing I have heard in the three years I have spent in this House.  Senator Ross asked why this could not be done.  There are several clear reasons and I am sure the Minister is aware of them but there is no harm putting them on the record.  The principal reason is that it violates the Irish Constitution; it violates the European Convention on Human Rights; it violates virtually every international instrument to which this country is a signatory. Almost all these instruments guarantee and underwrite the right to bodily integrity on the part of the citizens.  One cannot conduct trials on an involuntary or even a random basis throughout the country.  One cannot go around sticking needles into people without their consent. As I said, it is a completely absurd idea and I wonder if the Senator actually believed in it himself.</P>
      <P>There was much discussion of the original Bill which addressed the principles of the original Bill rather than the reasons for this amendment.  There was a good deal of talk about the need to protect volunteers and so on.  This Bill was introduced as a response to the tragic death of Niall Rushe in circumstances that illustrated that there was a loophole in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lacuna in this legislative area because there was no Bill. I stand corrected by Senator Ryan who is, as always, minutely particular and exact in what he says.</P>
      <P>I read some of the debates which took place in the Seanad in October 1986.  I do not always agree with Senator Fallon but on that occasion he made a particularly fine speech.  He pointed out that the Bill being introduced at that stage was defective, and I quote:</P>
      <P>We have a Bill...which has been prepared without real consultation during the drafting stage, with concerned professional representative bodies.  The major weakness of the Bill lies in its title on which I will comment later.  The general opinion is that it goes too far and it is almost certain to impede medical research progress here.</P>
      <P>The Bill then fell between two stools because there was an election and it was reintroduced without the kind of substantial amendments it needed at that stage.  Some of those amendments at least are contained in this new legislation.</P>
      <P>My reason for welcoming this Bill is not so much just that medical research is being impeded but that one of the principal effects of this legislation was to hold up the availability of drugs which were on offer from pharmaceutical companies, particularly to patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The specific instance I gave was the question of DDI.  I gather that as a result of the operation of this Bill, this drug will be made available.  There are about ten to 15 patients who have an adverse response to AZT and for whom this different drug will be available as a suitable prescribed treatment.  For that reason I very much welcome the Minister's initiative in introducing this legislation.</P>
      <P>I note also that the former Minister, Mr. Desmond, on 27 May 1986 addressed the objectives of the Bill as it was originally initiated.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate objective of the process is to ensure the availability of a safe and <Col N="1209" /> effective drug for treating a particular illness or condition and which at the same time conforms with safety, quality and efficacy criteria laid down by national regulatory bodies for the marketing of such drugs.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that it did not succeed in this objective.  The Bill, as amended, may go quite a long way towards making these drugs available for the treatment of patients and, therefore, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to speak at length because the intention of the Minister is to get this Bill as speedily as possible on to the Statute Book so that those who are ill may have immediate access to treatment and we must bear this in mind.  To me, this is the most important aspect of this legislation, not so much the research, although I heard part of what my distinguished colleague, Senator Hederman, had to say.  Like her I am aware of studies initiated under the World Health Organisation; I am aware of one study in particular which eventually was carried out in Belgium because, although we had the expertise and the professional equipment here, we simply could not get the go ahead to conduct it here.  For that reason also I welcome the Bill.  It may not be perfect but then in this life there are very few things that actually attain perfection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in the Bill is a very practical one; its passage will release drugs for the treatment of people with serious illness. Those of us who are moderately healthy need to bear in mind the anxiety of people who are ill.  It must be particularly galling to find that there are drugs available which would ameliorate their condition but, for a technical reason and because of a lack of urgency with which this matter is treated in a legislative form, they are <Col N="1210" /> denied the positive beneficial effects of research.  I very much welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about medical research.  The impression we got from a number of speakers is that medical research ground to a halt because of restrictions of drug testing.  I would have thought as we reached the end of the 20th century, that we were beginning to have a broader definition of medicine than the administration of substances.  There is a huge volume of work to be done with existing approved medications or with alternatives to drug therapy which would usefully and constuctively be done by the medical profession.  For instance, a vast range of already approved drugs are useful in dealing with pain and the dying as the medical establishment now realise that there is more to medicine than making people well.  There is the huge area of caring for the chronically and terminally ill.  It took the hospice movement to get this issue across to a rather less than sensitive medical establishment. That area of research does not need an enormous amount of extra drugs; it needs an enormous amount of education and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The support of seriously ill people and their families has nothing to do with drugs but has an enormous amount to do with the proper practice of medicine and the efficient use of human resources and equipment.  All of that is a more than worthy area of medical research.  It is a little breathtaking to have the magic bullet image of medicine still with us as we begin, often with the less than wholeheated enthusiasm of sections of the medical establishment, to appreciate that the proper form of medicine is, indeed, directed towards the well being of the whole person and does not treat the human organism as a sort of a biochemical machine which can be improved or disimproved simply by the administration of a variety of drugs.  Drug therapy is an important part of medicine but it is neither the central or the only part of medicine.  I am not in any way disputing the merits or the importance of the <Col N="1211" /> Bill, but to suggest that medical research is exclusively about which drug works under what circumstances, is to do a great disservice to medicine.</P>
    <P>I have no problems with the Bill.  I welcome it and I appreciate in specific terms the reasons Senator Norris has given for his welcome but, in general, it is a most welcome Bill.  I would not like to even give the impression that I was unhappy with the old Act.  I laboured long in this House with one of the Minister's predecessors, Mr. Barry Desmond, on the minutiae of that Bill and have rarely been so well advised by various groups about what was wrong with it in a variety of directions, ranging from the medical profession through to families of people who had unfortunate experiences with drug trials.  The Bill was worthwhile; the Act is worthwhile.  It is extremely important that we have legislation like that.  I do not believe that at the end of the 20th century, there is the remotest reason for the average lay person to adhere to the &ldquo;trust me, I know what I am doing&rdquo; school of professional responsibility.  We trusted engineers, of which I am one, scientists, technologists and other experts with our environment and they damn nearly destroyed it.  There is no reason the laity should ever believe that there is such a thing as a superior professional mind that knows better than the average lay person who is good for the world, themselves or anybody else.  Therefore it is extremely important that all areas which involve the interaction between human being and various substances which are more or less safe should be properly regulated in the interests of the people who, perhaps, for a variety of reasons undergo those trials.  I am very wary of all professional establishments and I say that as a member of a profession. I am not at all sure that any profession can be relied upon to keep the priorities it should have to the forefront at all times.  I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that clinical trials do involve risk.  All science, all <Col N="1212" /> studies of the interaction between substances and either a human or animal organism involve risk because science is essentially and experimental subject.  It is not based on some sort of wonderful theory which can apply in all cases.  It is based on the painstaking building up of models of interaction and behaviour based on experimental evidence.  Things can go wrong.  There are well documented cases of substances which are harmless to animals being quite lethal to humans.  There are well documented cases of substances, which are extremely helpful to humans, being harmful to animals.  There is the rather hair raising story, to which no blame should be attributed but which is nevertheless true, about the research in the thirties into the use of PVC monomer as a possible anasethetic in medicine.  It was, fortunately, discarded and then in the last 20 years it has been discovered that PVC monomer is a carcinogenic substance.  It was not because it was identified as a possible carcinogen that it was discarded, but it could have been.</P>
    <P>Science is by definition fallible.  I am a scientist or a technologist, depending on how one wants to describe me, or, perhaps, both or maybe something less. Before Senator Conroy reacts I might as well cover all options.  As I said, science is, by definition, fallible.  The methodology of science is to learn from the limitations of experimental evidence, from the anomalous experimental results and to build on experimental evidence. Science is not an abstract.  All areas of science are experimental and they are only as good as the experimental data. There is no way a person who is undergoing a clinical trial of a new drug can be given any categorical assurance that the drug is safe.  The nature of science is that it cannot ever give absolute guarantees of safety.  All that can be done is to make a reasonable asessment of the risk involved relative to the possible benefits to be derived.  The question that arises in all clinical trials is who will benefit.  Is it for the benefit of sick people or for the benefit of a large multinational?  It is extremely important, therefore, that <Col N="1213" /> there should be careful and detailed regulation of how such trials are conducted because there is a clear need to assess a risk <i>vis-á-vis</i> a benefit for any test which involves the interaction between a human being an a new drug.</P>
    <P>It is important, without wearing an ideological hat, to remember that multinationals are far from benevolent organisations. They have an unfortunate record, for instance, of moving drugs that are, perhaps, less acceptable in the Western world to be prescribed and sold in Third World countries.  A famous multinational, which allegedly devotes itself to the well being of young babies, have used enormous resources to persuade women in Third World countries to use artificial baby food instead of their own breast milk, and in the process guaranteed the ill-health of thousands, if not millions of babies, who become ill by contaminated water supplies.  That is not the benevolent image that we see in the advertisements but it is the reality of the experience of poor people in relation to multinationals. People deserve, and need, to be protected and the Act will do that when it is amended.</P>
    <P>It is also true that most healthy people who are involved in those trials are the wretched of the earth.  They are poor and deprived.  I do not know &mdash; and I do not know if anybody else in this House knows &mdash; anybody in the general income bracket of Senators or TDs who has a reasonable amount of leisure time, who has ever freely undergone a clinical trial for any reason.  Why not?  Is it because we do not like the company?  Is it because our time is too precious?  Is it because we know there is a risk involved?  Why is it that the overwhelming majority, if not the unanimous, view of those of us who have a reasonable amount of income is to avoid under every possible circumstance the possibility of having to do what we all believe is apparently necessary, provided somebody else does it for us?</P>
    <P>We cannot duck the difficult issue of how people should be persuaded to undergo or to participate in clinical trials by talking about freedom.  I am not talking about the objective of this Bill but of <Col N="1214" /> the Act in general.  The truth is that almost everybody has the freedom not to need the relatively small sums of money that people who take part in clinical trials get paid.  Those of us who have that freedom do not have to worry about whether we get £200 out of a clinical trial.  Therefore, it has a reasonable conclusion that those who do, who are not much different from the rest of us, do it for the money. If the risk is so great that we will not do it, why is the risk not so great for those who will do it?  That is where I think Senator Ross, through I do not always agree with him particularly in recent times, had a point.  To leave it to those whose economic freedom or lack of it dictates that they have an enormous incentive to participate in these trials is in fact to discriminate quite unfairly against those people.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the whole idea of commercial clinical testing, of large scale institutions set up specifically to deal with drug trials.  There is a slight stench of people making vast fortunes on the backs of the poor in such an operation.  I am not talking about the legitimate work of ordinary medical practitioners in the pursuit of ordinary medical practice.  I am talking about dedicated research institutions. I do not like it.</P>
    <P>I have a very simple solution to how it would deal with the question of clinical trials, because ultimately clinical trials are being done because products are often produced by companies who hope to make money out of them.  All of those companies have shareholders and it would be very interesting to suggest a condition of ownership of shares of a pharmaceutical company would be that the shareholders would actually become the guinea pigs for the clinical trials by those companies.  That would relate the risk to the major beneficiary.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the share price of every major pharmaceutical company in the world would go through the floor tomorrow if all of the shareholders felt that they had an obligation to actually participate in the trials that were being conducted, allegedly with minimal risk, on their behalf to sell extra drugs to the <Col N="1215" /> world.  It would be very interesting that a condition of benefiting from the share-holding be participation in the risk that creates.  That is good capitalist economics, in my view, that those who take the risks get the rewards.  In this case those who take the risk get miniscule rewards and those who just put in their money get the biggest rewards.  I would like to turn it around a bit.  It will not be done, but it would actually work and it would produce a very healthy discrimination between those drugs and trials which were necessary and those which were not.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, quite a lot of things in this Bill that are most worthwhile. I accept that it was defective to leave the National Drugs Advisory Board membership with a serious risk of litigation for doing a job which is thankless and which I know, as anybody in this country knows, is done with a considerable degree of conscientiousness. Therefore, I am glad that the NDAB are going to be given a degree of immunity from legal action.</P>
    <P>I am also more or less happy that ethics committees are going to have a similar immunity but I would like the Minister to think a bit more carefully about the basis on which ethics committees are set up.  I would have to say that I cannot see what particular expertise some of the people I have seen as named members of ethics committees &mdash; and I am not going to get involved in anything that would even hint at who I am talking about, largely because I am remembering three years ago &mdash; had to contribute on an ethics committee in assessing the ethics or otherwise of a particular test.  The consequences for members of having to accept full legal liability is perhaps too harsh but there could well be some need and the need for the Minister to be very careful in assessing the value of having certain individuals as members of ethics committees.</P>
    <P>I am not so happy at all about the Minister &mdash; as Senator Upton said, with his magnificently creative English &mdash; immunising himself.  There is a slight hint <Col N="1216" />&mdash; if I dare mention it without bringing back awful unhappy memories &mdash; of a certain disaster for haemophiliacs of recent memory in the immunising of the Minister from legal action.</P>
    <P>There are a few other things specifically on the Bill that I would like to talk about.  The Minister says that the recommendations of the working group were taken into consideration.  Has the report of that working group been published and, if not, would the Minister like to publish it?  We have an extraordinary record of secretiveness in this country, of non-disclosure of reports, and if there is an authoritative scientifically based report then we ought to be able to adjudicate on the extent to which the report of that working group has actually been, in the Minister's phrase, &ldquo;taken fully into consideration&rdquo;.  He did not say he had accepted the recommendations; he said he took them into consideration.  That is a great phrase.  I can take anything into consideration and then dismiss it.  It would be interesting to have a look at it.</P>
    <P>I have another dilemma and I am not sure if it is a serious one.  In three different places &mdash; once in the Act, once in the Bill and once in the Minister's script &mdash; three different words are used, I think to mean the same thing.  In the Minister's script in relation to the amendments to section 6, he specifically says he wants to exclude trials &ldquo;where the intention is to prevent disease.&rdquo;  The Bill says that the principal purpose is &ldquo;to prevent disease&rdquo; and the Act in section 9 refer to &ldquo;the principal objective&rdquo;.  So, we have intention, purpose and objective all thrown together in three different places &mdash; once in the Minister's script, which is not of any legal significance; I do not understand why in section 2 of the Bill we have a reference to &ldquo;the principal purpose of the administration&rdquo; whereas in section 9 of the Act we have a reference to &ldquo;the objective of the administration.&rdquo;  What is the difference between an objective and a purpose? I dug out the large and enormous version of the Oxford Dictionary in the Oireachtas Library and I cannot find a difference between an objective and a purpose.  There are different meanings <Col N="1217" /> for the words, but there are meanings which overlap for the words &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;&mdash; I did not check &ldquo;intention&rdquo; because I did not have the Minister's script.  As one who takes a considerable interest in the Committee Stage of legislation, I would like to know did the parliamentary draftsman suggest the word &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;objective&rdquo;, or was it just the different parliamentary draftsmen, because I know the parliamentary draftsman is kind of a collective noun for a whole lot of individuals who claim to be the one person?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we could do with a reasonable simplicity of language and a reasonable consistency of language in this matter.  I would suggest to the Minister that if &ldquo;objective&rdquo; was good enough in the Act, then &ldquo;objective&rdquo; should be good enough in the amendment to the Act. Section 9 (7) of the Act &mdash; and I will want to come back to it because it is rather a problem for me &mdash; refers to &ldquo;where it is proposed to conduct a clinical trial of any person suffering from an illness the remedy for or alleviation of which constitutes an objective of the trial.&rdquo;  That is where it is an objective.  When it comes to the Bill we deal with &ldquo;the principal purpose... is to prevent disease... or to save the life, restore the health, alleviate the condition...&rdquo; I do not understand the difference between an objective and a purpose and I do think it makes legislation that is complicated enough even more complicated to use different words to mean the same thing.</P>
    <P>On a more serious note &mdash; and I would like a specific indication of this in the Minister's reply &mdash; how does the amendment proposed in section 2 of the Bill fit together with section 9 (7) of the Act, because in section 9 (7) of the Act there is a clear reference to a clinical trial on any person where the remedy for or alleviation of which constitutes an objective of the trial.  That is called a clinical trial in the Act.  What seems to me to be the same thing is now being called not a clinical trial in the amendment to the Act and it appears to me that section 9 (7) ought to have been deleted or ought to be <Col N="1218" /> deleted from the Act in order to maintain consistency.  Otherwise, there is ambiguity in the amended legislation between the amendment to section 6, which is a redefinition of a clinical trial, and the reference in section 9 of the Act to a clinical trial, which seems to me to be almost identical with the excluded definition in section 6.  I think there is an anomaly there which could well be &mdash; and I am not playing games &mdash; be the sort of thing which would produce more of the problems that have made this Act such a problem for some people in some areas of medical care.</P>
    <P>There is another little problem with the wording of the amendment.</P>
    <P>... the principal purpose of that administration is to prevent the disease in or to save the life, restore the health, alleviate the condition or relieve the suffering of, the patient.</P>
    <P>I presume psychiatric patients are covered by the amendment.  It could be argued and some people with a slightly more radical outlook on the world than I would perhaps wonder about some of the medical jargon used about many forms of mental illness, which perhaps are more environmental and stress-related and emotional than physical.  It would be no harm to have it clarified.</P>
    <P>Finally, given the redefinition, which I support in principle, that where drugs are being administered to achieve the objectives listed, the purposes listed or the intentions listed depending on which word you choose to use, that where drugs are being used like that they should not be subject to the extraordinarily complex procedures, and justifiably so, of the commercial clinical trials.  It is also important that quite clearly the only reason drugs would be administered under those circumstances would be for the principle purpose to prevent disease or to save the life, etc.  Therefore, it is extremely important that there should be no element of reward involved for the medical practitioner, or indeed dental practitioner, who administers such a substance.  It should not be a response to any incentive offered by a drug company. <Col N="1219" /> It should be done exclusively on the basis of the merits perceived by the medical practitioner of that particular substance to possible alleviation of the condition of the individual.  No question of financial award should arise.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it should be equally clear that in the case of a drug being administered to somebody who is sick there should be no question of financial reward to the individual who is unwell.  To suggest that we would offer rewards to people who are sick to take medicine that will make them better would be somewhat unacceptable, at least to me.  As well as that, I would be worried that if doctors could be paid by multinationals to use drugs in the fashion described in section 2 of the Bill, then it could likely lead to many people getting around many of the provisions of the Clinical Trials Act and testing their drugs on a commercial basis on sick patients, the commercial arrangement being between the doctor and the multinational.  We should make a very clear distinction between commercial drug testing and medical drug testing or medical trials of drugs.  Medical trials should be carried out by a doctor because he or she believes this possible drug might be useful to a particular group of patients. There should be no financial incentive or reward.</P>
    <P>There is a slightly less than savoury odour about the relationship between drug companies and some aspects of the medical profession.  My wife is a doctor which most of the world knows, because my wife's alleged salary, which is usually minuscule, is often quoted in some sort of way apparently to put me in my place. I am never too sure why, but it is used from time to time.  My wife is a doctor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Far too kind, gentle and upright for that sort of thing.  There are in the medical profession what are described as &ldquo;drug do's&rdquo;, a most unhappy operation which involves drug companies entertaining in grand style large sections of the medical profession to meals in the finest restaurants simply to make them appreciate the clinical merits of a particular substance.  I do not know the connection between persuading people about the medical worth of a particular substance and wining and dining them in the best restaurants in Cork or Dublin. I can never understand the clinical or scientific connection between one or the other.  It should not happen.  Medical decisions on what is good for patients and what is good for people should be done on the basis of the medical evidence provided in a clinical atmosphere without any of the trappings of a sort of an incentive. The sponsorship of various conferences just miraculously happens to involve the possible encouragement of people to use drugs that are provided or manufactured by the company which sponsors the conferences, or the sponsorship of people to travel to conferences where they learn about drugs that perhaps the sponsoring company has an interest in selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of that is not the way, in my view, to convince ordinary people that the simple objective decisions are based on the merits of the case.  Therefore, I am proposing on Committee Stage to introduce a couple of amendments to deal with that so as to ensure that there is no commercial involvement in the decision to prescribe substances to people who are ill. We can leave the commercial drug testing to the commercial sector and we can ensure that any trials or any administration that is carried out for sick people will be on the basis of nothing more than the merits of the case.  No rewards of any kind should be offered, either direct in cash or implied in any way, to try out a <Col N="1221" /> particular drug on patients and no reward should be offered to patients who agree to accept particular drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  In the debate on the control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Bill in 1986, which subsequently became the Control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Act, 1987, most of us welcomed the Bill.  It emerged, however, that there was a need on Committee Stage for a very detailed and elaborate debate and right throughout the other Stages so as to satisfy ourselves about all the implications of such a serious business as clinical trials, particularly with regard to some of the observations that emerged concerning the death of a person around that time.  We felt that at the end of it all sufficient scope had been given to ensure that there would be a tremendous amount of vigilance and that the risk to people would not outweigh the objectives of the trials.</P>
      <P>In that debate in 1987 the majority of us felt happy that the ethics committee was given adequate security.  However, we now see that one of the purposes of this amending legislation is to remove from the ethics committee the responsibility to be satisfied as to the adequacy of such security, as required by section 10 of the principal Act.  It then goes on to seek certain legal immunities for the Minister, the National Drugs Advisory Board and the ethics committee in relation to their functions under the principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister gave some explanations in his Second Reading speech.  But as somebody who expressed a lot of concern in the earlier debate, I am wondering if anything went wrong that we did not hear about.  Was it that because of the rate of pace of change new circumstances emerged that were not foreseen at the time of the other Bill and have brought about this measure?  My contribution could be by way of question if we had a Dáil system of questions here. We do not have that, so this is merely a brief expression of concern as to whether all the reasons it is necessary to safeguard the ethics committees are known.  Have <Col N="1222" /> there been many claims against them, or what exactly is the situation?  Is it just that the circumstances of the time have changed because of the pace of change throughout the world or what is behind it?</P>
    <P>I was satisfied on that occasion and indeed fell out with a few friends by supporting the Bill.  Therefore, I would like to know all the reasons we are amending it.  I trust the Minister will deal with that when he is replying.  Will the Minister, the National Drugs Advisory Board, the ethics committee or anyone have comprehensive control, or what is the story relating to it?  It would be a good idea to monitor these matters and look at them from time to time.  I would like more information than was available in the Second Stage speech.  The Minister might tell us if there is anything other than the reasons given in the Bill, which are broad generalities.  These are necessary in many Bills but in a Bill like this it should be stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up where the previous speaker left off in regard to what monitoring has gone on and what goes on in relation to the Department or the functioning of the ethics committee in relation to trials and experiments.  As the previous speaker indicated, all of these clinical trials and experiments which are very necessary, have gone on for many years without too many hiccups, but one came to light some years ago when an unfortunate person died.  He happened to be a constituent of the Dún Laoghaire area.  A lot of things came to light at the time in relation to down-and-outs being brought in, of people who were not very healthy being paid small sums of money.  Some of the criticism at the time may have been unfair and may not have been deserved, but it brought home to people some of the experiments and trials that were going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What monitoring has been done since that time and since the introduction of the Act?  We bring in a lot of legislation but there is no monitoring of it, how it is being administered and policed?  I would <Col N="1223" /> ask the Minister, when replying, to indicate whether circumstances have improved.  I do not know how extensive the trials are or how many people are treated and given drugs.  It is very important, particularly where the lives of people can be at risk, that there are safeguards. Doctors and others performing within certain guidelines have to have some backup and have to be covered, as provided for in the Act.  Have there been many cases, have many claims been submitted or have many things gone wrong? As progress is made &mdash; and greater progress is going to be made in the future as there are now some highly specialised drugs &mdash; it is important with drugs of this nature to have an element of security.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to indicate what monitoring has gone on since and if he is satisfied with it.  Is he satisfied that there has not been this taking in of down-and-outs which went on at the time, paying them a few pounds for possible experiments, and have there been many claims?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my gratitude to the Seanad for their very careful consideration of this Bill and in particular to the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I know that the Minister for Health will be taking careful note of the contributions that have been made here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In his introductory speech, the Minister for Health stated it was a prototype piece of complex legislation and in such circumstances teething problems such as those we are now dealing with were a real possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say to Senator Harte that there is no hidden agenda.  There is nothing happening which is not well known to the public at large.  This Bill has been introduced in order to deal with some of the problems that have emerged, particularly in relation to the ethics committee. The Bill will deal effectively with those problems which have arisen in the operation of the Act and in particular the <Col N="1224" /> difficulties caused for ethics committees. It will enable the committees to fulfil their roles effectively and with confidence.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures contained in the Bill and supported here by Senators on all sides, will restore confidence in Ireland's position as a favourable location for clinical research and ensure that the original twofold objectives of the Act, namely, to facilitate clinical research while, at the same time, affording protection to participants in clinical trials, are fully realised and implemented.  At the same time the working of the Act, as amended, will continue to be closely monitored and kept under review.  The Minister is prepared, should the need arise at some future date, to further amend the Act in the light of ongoing experience of its operation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the role of ethics committees and the assessment of participants.  This is provided for in section 8 (4) of the original Act, and the House should know that the Department of Health have published guidelines which are available to ethics committees.</P>
    <P>Senators Ross, Jackman and Ryan also expressed concern regarding the participants. They are volunteers and we owe a great debt of gratitude to the participants, without whom research in this vital area could not take place.  Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill set out to protect the interests of the participants.  Reference was made to compulsory testing.  This will not be acceptable and it is also very likely to prove, should it be contemplated, to be unconstitutional.  We have plenty of examples of the success story of voluntary efforts in this regard.  One could mention the Blood Transfusion Board, which is totally on a voluntary basis but operates very effectively; and one could not imagine any change which would make services like that go into the domain of compulsion.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that payments be treated as expenses.  The Minister for Health has many responsibilities and he may wish at times to have absolute control over the financial matters of the State.  But I am sorry to say that these <Col N="1225" /> matters reside in the Department of Finance and, much though the Minister for Health might like to control everything in this regard &mdash; it might make life a lot easier for him if he could &mdash; it is unlikely for the time being at least while he remains in his present portfolio that he will have a say as to how payments are treated.  They are clearly a matter for the Department of Finance.  The original Act was initiated by the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Barry Desmond.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton referred to section 6 (2) (b) of the Act as the new provision of the Bill.  In fact, this provision is part of the original Act.  It provides for no compulsion but clearly acts on a voluntary basis. Medical students may wish, as part of their training, to experience the effect of medicines so as to understand the effects which these medicines are likely to have on their patients.  That seems to be a completely different area and the provision merely allows them to be exempted in circumstances like that from the control of this Act, I believe that is perfectly acceptable.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred to section 9 of the Act, which deals with licensed clinical trials which may include persons who may be patients.  Section 6 of the Act, as amended by section 2 of the Bill, provides exemptions.  In particular, it provides that medicines may be administered to a patient in certain circumstances without having first to obtain a licence.  This may be necessary where the life of a patient is at risk and may not permit time for obtaining a licence.  I should say also that clearly here we are talking about the relationship between the patient and the doctor which has to obtain all the time.</P>
    <P>In case Senator Ryan considers that this would be a way of general by-pass of the control of the regulations and the controls which are enshrined in this Bill, I would say to him that the normal requirement would be to obtain a licence through the procedures laid down in this Act.  There is no sidestepping of that, there is no way that can be avoided and the use of the suggestions which he has <Col N="1226" /> made would not really prove successful or could not circumvent the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked what improvements are taking place in the policing of trials.  Trials are first assessed by the NDAB before being approved.  Ethics committees must also be satisfied of the need for the trial and the provisions for participants as provided in section 8 of the Act.  The Minister for Health is satisfied with the level of monitoring what is taking place.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank all the Senators who have contributed and the House for giving a speedy passage to Second Stage of this important Bill.  I hope we can make further progress later this evening on the remaining Stages.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay either the House or the Minister unnecessarily, but in pursuit of a long standing campaign of mine for intelligible legislation &mdash; among the more difficult of the campaigns a man could undertake as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas &mdash; I do expect a reason for changing words.  Section 9 of the Act, referring to the conduct of a <Col N="1227" /> clinical trial on any person suffering from an illness, says:</P>
    <P>Where it is proposed to conduct a clinical trial on any person suffering from an illness the remedy for or alleviation of which constitutes an objective of the trial</P>
    <P>The Bill says that section 6 (2) of the Act is to be amended by the substitution of &ldquo;the principal purpose of that administration is to prevent disease&rdquo;.  I am not playing silly semantic games but, as I said on Second Stage, and as it was not replied to by the Minister I have to raise it again, I cannot find a dictionary distinction between &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;objective&rdquo;.  It makes legislation more complicated and it creates potential areas of argument for lawyers &mdash; and they can find them where the rest of us would not dream any existed &mdash; if there is an alleged difference between &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;. There are definitions of &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; and definitions of &ldquo;objective&rdquo; which are different, but there are also definitions which are so similar as to be identical.  If the Minister can explain what the difference between the &ldquo;objective&rdquo; of a trial and the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; of a trial is, I will happily withdraw the amendment but if there is not a reason for putting in a different word, then let us leave the same word in the amendment that is in the original Act.</P>

      <P>I take the point the Senator is making about the use of the different words &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;objective&rdquo; which can have the same meaning.  However, in the original Act the word &ldquo;objective&rdquo; is used, for example, in section 9 of the Bill, page 10, line 5, and the Senator has referred to it, but in section 9 (7) it states:</P>
      <P>provided that a clinical trial to which this subsection relates may be conducted only if the substance or preparation under trial is to be administered for the purpose of saving the life of such a person, restoring his health, alleviating his condition or relieving his suffering.</P>

      <Col N="1228" /> I presume it is in keeping with that particular section that the parliamentary draftsman used the word &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; in the section referred to by the Senator, section 2 (2) (a) (ii), so it is used in both section 9 and section 2 in the original Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 20, to delete &ldquo;patient,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;patient, and&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 simply adds a word to enable amendment No. 3 to be introduced. I am concerned &mdash; this is a serious issue &mdash; because from the time when the Act was introduced as a Bill in 1986 I had a considerable involvement.  Committee Stage in this House was long, detailed and, let it be said, unreported in which a considerable amount of constructive work was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely important that the distinction should be clearly in our legislation between using drugs to alleviate suffering and trying out drugs for any sort of commercial purpose, not suggesting even simply for the doctor's commercial purposes, but for the commercial purposes of some company who, in turn, provide incentives to the doctors to try out their drugs.  It appears to me that as it stands, having read the Act and re-read it to remind myself, and looking at the amendment it would be perfectly reasonable for a doctor to be offered incentives <Col N="1229" /> by a company.  I am not talking about unethical behaviour.  If a doctor uses a drug that he or she knows to be unsafe on a person who is sick, then that doctor is guilty of unethical behaviour and will be dealt with by the ethical procedures of the Medical Council, and indeed will probably end up in court as well.  I am talking about the fact that as well as being ethical, these practices must be seen to be ethical.  They must be seen to be above suspicion.</P>
    <P>Having a brother a doctor and being married to a doctor, I have no choice but to have a high opinion of the medical profession but I am still unhappy about multinationals and their consistent campaign &mdash; the drug &ldquo;do's&rdquo;, the sponsored meetings, the sponsored travel, the golf outings, the apparently limitless amount of sponsorship funds that are available to various activities connected with medicine from drug companies.  In the famous phrase about advertising, half of that money may well be poorly spent but nobody knows which half.  Similarly about the involvement of drug companies in persuading, by various methods, doctors to use various drugs, they must believe it is worthwhile because they are hard-headed business organisations which are dedicated to making money.  I am not here wearing any sort of hat about the profit motive or anything like that but that is their objective.  They are there to make money to reward their shareholders. I discussed earlier what the shareholders could perhaps do to share the risk.</P>
    <P>Let us remember in spite of what was said by the Minister, Deputy Smith, in his reply on Second Stage, there is nothing in the legislation which suggests that the amendment will only be used in limited cases.  What the amendment says is that conducting a clinical trial means something but does not include what is defined as a clinical trial under a number of circumstances, one of which is the additional one, which states that &ldquo;where the principal purpose of that administration is to prevent disease in...&rdquo;.  There is nothing in the amendment that says it must be done quickly or that there is <Col N="1230" /> any urgency about it.  It simply says that where: &ldquo;the principle purpose of the administration is to prevent disease in or to save the life, restore the health, alleviate the condition or alleviate the suffering of, the patient,&rdquo;.  These are all most admirable objectives to which we all subscribe, but there is no word in it about urgency.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to listen very carefully on this but it seems to me that we are saying that wherever drugs are to be tested on people and where the principal objective is to do all those admirable things, then they are excluded under the provisions of the Clinical Trials Act, because they are not clinical trials.  It does not say anything about where urgency dictates, where the suffering of human beings suggests that we should take a shorter route or any of those things.  It does not say anything like that.  It simply says where certain objectives are to be met.  It appears to me that as it stands, that means that any administration of substance &mdash; and I am not arguing about unethical behaviour &mdash; where it can legitimately be said that the principal purpose is to help a sick person, then all the provisions of the Clinical Trials Act are excluded.  That means we could be involved in commercial clinical trials involving sick people where the doctor could well be paid for doing those things. I do not think that is very healthy, I do not think it is a good idea.  I think we should specifically write into our legislation that the doctor should not be paid.</P>
    <P>My amendment states: &ldquo;provided that no rewards whether in cash or otherwise are offered to the registered medical practitioner, or the registered dentist for the administration of the substance or substances...&rdquo;.  That is the first part of my amendment.  Since we are again clearly not talking about clinical trials, we are talking about sick people and something that could make them better, it seems to me perfectly reasonable to exclude all the nuances of clinical trials and therefore, the second part of the amendment states: &ldquo;and provided that no material incentive is offered to the <Col N="1231" /> persons to whom the substance or substances are to be administered.&rdquo;.  In other words, if the people are sick there should be a sufficient incentive in the possibility of alleviation of their suffering or getting better without any cash being offered.</P>
    <P>Since we have not written in any condition of urgency, any condition of haste, but simply a blanket exclusion of a certain kind of administration of substances, the least we can do is to ensure that nobody can be in it for money or can be seen to be in it for money.  That is why I moved the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Ryan with regard to amendment No. 3 because I think the introduction of a cash reward element is a dangerous and inappropriate practice.  The reason I am so happy to support Senator Ryan in this is because I took the trouble to read the debates on the main Bill when it was introduced in 1986-87 and I was extremely impressed by the care that was taken at that time to allow the fullest possible discussion.  I was struck particularly by the fact that by agreement of the House, my former colleague, John Robb, who is a distinguished medical expert, was allowed extra time to place on the record of the House his particular view on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the limited time available to him &mdash; he had to go to a meeting and so on but they very kindly extended the debate over the period of a sos and he spoke for about 20 minutes &mdash; he spent a very considerable part of that time in addressing precisely this issue.  He did it, as he sometimes did, with a certain flair for the theatre and for gesture and he waved in the House a cheque for £10 sterling which, he said, was uncashed but which he had received from an international drug company &mdash; accompanied by a phial of drugs and ten report cards to be filled up by the doctor with regard to the patients' medical history profiles, the date on which the drug was administered, the result and so on.  He was told that the £10 was a registration fee and that he <Col N="1232" /> would receive further remuneration subsequently if he continued to administer this drug.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that makes the amendment a very practical and relevant one because it is not just a theoretical matter, it is one where a distinguished medical practitioner has had direct personal experience of an attempt by a drug company to introduce the motive of personal financial gain, reward, profit, whatever you like to call it, into the medical treatment of that doctor's patients.  I really think we would be foolish not to bear in mind the wisdom of a previous debate in this matter.  It was a point that was extremely well made by Dr. Robb.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister is anxious to get his Bill through this evening and I am quite happy to facilitate him.  I do not feel that there should be any immense difficulty because I do not see anything in this amendment that contradicts the spirt of the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister would consider in the light, not just of the evidence introduced in the argument, the theoretical position advanced by Senator Ryan, in addition, of course to his family connections with medicine, but also in the light of the very detailed debate and the hard solid evidence that was introduced in this House by one of the Taoiseach's nominees, a man whom we all respect and who has a very high standing in the medical profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, I have a certain sympathy with the motives behind this amendment, and particularly the motives as suggested by Senator Norris and indeed quoting a previous very distinguished Member of this Chamber. However, the fact that one might sympathise with the motives does not necessarily mean that one would agree with the amendments themselves.  In practice, the situation is that in respect of an actual reward, whether it be cash or otherwise, offered to a registered medical practitioner or registered dentist, I would doubt if it is a significant factor.  I doubt if it is a factor at all in any cases, with any clinical trials that are conducted in this country or in any other country where <Col N="1233" /> one has, as Senator Ryan has rightly said, a reputable medical profession.  The sum of money mentioned by Senator Ross, quoting the former Senator Robb, would be, to many practitioners, I would think, a matter of irritation rather than anything else.  It would not represent an adequate fee.  The intention is perhaps to make some contribution towards the inevitably considerable extra time and trouble involved in participation in a clinical trial. Such trials can be very demanding in time, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>I would also be slightly concerned about this amendment from two other points of view.  With great respect to Senator Ross he is constantly bringing in this totally irrelevant reference to multinational drug companies.  The amendment, of course, would apply in all circumstances and not just to multinational drug companies.  The multinational drug companies are a very easy target.  I do not doubt that from time to time they do make errors, and probably grave errors but at least with the multinational drug companies we have had many new advances in medicine whereas I cannot think of one pharmaceutical preparation that has come from the sort of State sponsored organisations or countries that Senator Ryan at times seems to suggest we should follow.</P>
      <P>There are certain circumstances where it could be argued legally that any remuneration or reward paid to somebody, such as a research registrar, involved in clinical trials related to the fact that he is involved in the administration of some substance which is being tested.  It would be an unfortunate amendment.  I sympathise with Senator Ross's intentions in relation to this amendment, and indeed some of Senator Ryan's intentions but I do not really think it would be helpful or that it would serve in practice any useful purpose; it could even be detrimental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also sympathise with the motives Senator Ryan outlined in proposing his amendment.  Certainly none of us would want to see the type of <Col N="1234" /> commercial approach he described.  He did suggest that perhaps by accepting the section as it now stands it was opening the way for all trials because urgency is not included in that particular subsection. If we look at the definition of a &ldquo;clinical trial&rdquo; in the Bill, which is very specific, it says:</P>
      <P>the conducting of a systematic investigation or series of investigations for the purpose of ascertaining the effects (including the kinetic effects) of the administration of one or more substances or preparations on persons where such administration may have a pharmacological or harmful effect, but does not include the conducting of such a systematic investigation or series of investigations as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>That would mean that what Senator Ryan wants in the amendment certainly could not be considered a clinical trial; so it would preclude any practitioner from using this particular section of the Bill in order to avoid having to go through the necessary procedure.  As the Bill stands it is quite clear what is intended.  When taken in conjunction with the definition of a clinical trial in the Bill there can be no doubt that this section could not be used for the purpose of avoiding having to work within the legislation to carry out a clinical trial.</P>
      <P>As worded, the amendment could be open to the interpretation that any practitioner who was in receipt of a salary, for example, might well be found to be in breach of this section of the Act.  That, of course, would defeat the very purpose of having this section in the Act to allow, in bona fide cases where there is the question of a life saving drug, a practitioner to be exempt from the control of the clinical trials legislation.  It could defeat the very purpose of that section of the Act if we were to accept the amendment as worded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see in the fullness of time.  The Minister has at his disposal <Col N="1235" /> this formidable entity known as the parliamentary draftsman.  Therefore, there are two issues here.  Does the Minister not accept that we should make it clear that there should not be rewards, financial or otherwise, offered to doctors to use particular drugs?  In other words, how should a doctor distinguish between a number of different alternative clinical choices if there are a number of substances available which could do what is intended by this amendment?  Would the Minister not agree that we should make it clear that whatever choice is made should not in any way be influenced by material incentives?  Secondly, is it not true that we should make it clear that the patient should not be offered a material incentive? One fine way of clarifying that the matter had to be fairly urgent is if the patient had to be willing to accept the prescription of this substance because he or she was convinced it was in his or her own interest without any financial incentive of any kind.</P>
      <P>I do not want to launch into a tit-for-tat with Senator Conroy about multinationals and his apparent immutable obsession with my apparent attachment to State companies, but he should read my speeches sometime instead of reading his own versions of them.  I do think, incidentally, that penicillin was not discovered by a multinational.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure who was funding the laboratories.  The multinationals have a far from savoury record in most of the areas they are involved in. They need to be carefully regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two parts to my amendment. One is to do with making sure that doctors are not affected by incentive.  The second is to ensure that no financial incentives are offered to patients.  We can discuss the principles of the amendment and then, if there are inadequacies in the way I have drafted the amendment, we can either have a redraft for Report Stage or the Minister can ask his draftsmen, <Col N="1236" /> these people of apparent infallibility, to redraft it and he can introduce the amendment in the other House.  There are plenty of procedural steps still available to us.  This is not the Final Stage of a Bill late in July or early in August.  This is the first detailed discussion of a piece of legislation which, like every piece of legislation, is capable of improvement. There is no reason alleged inadequacies of wording should be used to avoid a discussion on the principles of the amendment, which is that the doctors would never be paid by companies to do these sort of trials and secondly, the patients should never be paid to accept or to undergo these sort of trials.  The simplest way to ensure they will only be done when they are urgent is simply by having to rely on the goodwill of the patients to undergo them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I take the Minister's point about the paid practitioners, the paid medical personnel, but I urge the Minister to take on board the principle of trying to avoid direct payments from pharmaceutical companies to medical personnel.  If the Minister would agree to the last suggestion of Senator Ryan to have it looked at again by the draftsman it would avoid a situation where paid medical personnel or research personnel are affected.  I commend to the Minister the suggestion that we avoid a situation where any commercial interest could impinge on medical personnel in hospitals or in any clinics.  I believe, on balance, arising from what Senator Conroy said, that most proper medical personnel &mdash; I know we are not talking about unethical behaviour here, we are just talking about normal commercial incentives &mdash; and most outstanding practitioners would avoid this kind of thing. It might be worth while.  I urge the Minister to amend the Bill to avoid the situation where that would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of the amendment has survived the criticisms of Senator Conroy although I have to say that, like Senator Conroy, I was also <Col N="1237" /> rather surprised at the size of the inducements apparently offered to Dr. Robb in the past.  I do not think this surprise should lessen indignation at the violation of an important principle by offering these kind of inducements precisely because it could lead to the use of one drug rather than another.  I do not really quite share the admiration that Senator Conroy &mdash; perhaps I am misinterpreting him &mdash; appears to have for multinational corporations.  The reason they are an easy target is because they are an obvious and very appropriate target.  I would welcome a more appropriate occasion to ventilate my views on multinational drug companies and the price which patients in this country have to pay for the unscrupulous practices of those pharmaceutical companies. This does not come necessarily from an ideological position on the left, although I would not be ashamed of being included on the left of the spectrum.</P>
      <P>The principle remains.  I do not think this will be pushed to a vote.  Obviously it would be rather futile.  Maybe it will; I do not know.  I shall wait and see, as I have been cautioned by Senator Ryan.  If it is pushed to a vote it is unlikely it will successfully pass into the main section of the Bill.  It may be just a demonstration of seriousness by the Senator if he wishes to push it to a vote in due course, as is his right.  It seems to me that in everything said the principle remains sustained by the debate rather than impugned by it, that the introduction of a profit motive in these circumstances is quite inappropriate.</P>

      <P>I was present in this House for the long debate on the 1986 Act and 1987 Act and also present for the entire contribution of the former Senator John Robb.  We are on dangerous ground by putting too much emphasis on it because I was in the Chair the evening of that address by Senator Robb and he would not agree with us this evening that such emphasis should have been put on what he said.  He was merely making a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan tells us about his association with the medical world, <Col N="1238" /> about his brother and his wife, and then he goes on and says he does not trust them, that they would take a kind of backhand or they would be paid money that perhaps they should not take.  I do not think if somebody was ill you would have to pay them to accept something that would cure them.  As the Minister has just said it sounds fine as Senator Ryan made his case, and this amendment it appears should immediately be accepted by the Minister but if you understand the Bill and all that has gone before it and realise it only is amending a massive piece of legislation that needed amendment, I do not think it is necessary. Again, I have to defend the former Senator Robb because I do not think he intended the emphasis Senator Norris has just put on his contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody except Senator Honan mentioned the patients.  We have heard very little about them.  One of the problems about the amendment as it stands is that it is not just talking about people who are suffering from AIDS, for instance.  It is a general amendment to the Clinical Trials Act which exempts all systems where a substance is administered and the principal purpose of that administration is to prevent disease, etc. All administration of substance where that applies are exempt from all the provisions of the Clinical Trials Act.  It is not a clinical trial as defined by the Act.  That means that you do not have to give the same amount of information to somebody that you would have under the Clinical Trials Act.  You do not have to go through all the rigorous procedures to establish consent that you would have to do under the Clinical Trials Act.  All of that is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem with legitimate medical practitioners, in the pursuit of the welfare of their patients where they believe on their clinical judgment that the use of an otherwise untested drug would have the possibility of doing some good.  That clinical judgment should be taken clearly and simply on the basis of the merits of the case and how it would <Col N="1239" /> be of benefit to the patient without any extraneous influences.</P>
    <P>I am a little bit confused by Senator Honan's reference to my family connections. I attempted to introduce a Bill into this House which would have us register all of our interests in public and it was the Members opposite who would not even let me print it.  I have a habit of trying to do, as far as I can, what I believe everybody else should do, which is to state an interest where an interest may well exist so there cannot be any apparent conflict of interest.  I have no problem about stating my connections but I will not allow them to influence my judgment.</P>
    <P>I do not think that most doctors most of the time will do things that are wrong. All of us in our various professions &mdash; I include myself in both my profession as a politician and in my profession as an engineer &mdash; are often lacking in perspective about the closeness of the relationship between ourselves and commercial interests who want us to do a particular thing, to buy a particular product or to use a particular product.  It needs the scrutiny of the public at large. That is why we, in our profession as politicians, are perpetually subject to public scrutiny to make sure that we keep a proper perspective in the way we are influenced by various groups.  If we are to be subject to that scrutiny it is equally true that members of the medical profession should also be subject to that scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I have no problem about having a vote on my amendment because if by any chance it is inserted the Minister will have at least four opportunities to amend the wording of my amendment if he is unhappy with it.  He can do it on Report Stage this evening if he wants, he can do it on Committee Stage in the other House, he can do it on Report Stage in the other House.  He has plenty of time. If he wants to, he can recommit it because they do that from time to time in both Houses.  There is no problem about the wording.  The problem and the issue is the principle of the amendment, that we <Col N="1240" /> should make it publicly clear that no clinical decision about the administration of a substance to a sick person could ever be affected by rewards or incentives offered to the doctor or by rewards or incentives offered to the patient.  That is the principle.  The details of my wording are a secondary issue.</P>

      <P>Could I just re-enter the list very briefly, particularly because I was challenged to a certain extent, and certainly chastened by Senator Honan because of my unavoidable absence in the debate which took place before I was elected to the Seanad.  I have taken the trouble to check what Senator Robb said. I would like to tell the House that Senator Robb made quite a short speech but he devoted two out of seven paragraphs to precisely this issue, in other words, about 30 per cent.  They are not very long and I would like to read them in to the record of the House so that we may have the benefit of this.  It is clear from reading the record of this debate to show how relevant they are.  Being an academic, I am sure Senator Conroy understands the importance of context being academic.

      <P>I would like, first, to preface it by saying that whereas I was surprised at the measly amount of £10, I <Col N="1241" /> think the principle survives.  Senator Robb makes it clear that this inducement was offered to him in 1977 when £10 sterling was worth a good deal more than it is today.  This is what he says:</P>
      <P>I should like to start by holding up for the attention of the House a £10 cheque which I was sent in 1977 and unlike those from Seanad Éireann it has not been cashed.  That £10 cheque was sent to me with an accompanying letter from a drug company saying that as promised, they had despatched to me free of charge 4 × 10 one ml. ampoules of a particular drug, together with a supply of coded patient record cards; that these had been sent to the hospital pharmacy marked &ldquo;For your attention&rdquo; and that they had asked the pharmacist to let me know when they arrived.  They went on what they had pleasure in enclosing a cheque for £10 in payment for my registration fee, and confirmed that for every ten completed patient cards received by them between then and 31 March, a further payment of £15 would be made to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is volume 114, column 57 of 1 October 1986.  That is important because it actually addresses the principle that Senator Conroy raised that there are certain circumstances where there are administrative burdens placed on the physician and that this is a legitimate compensation for them.  This is clearly an argument that could be sustained from that first paragraph.  It is particularly important to look at the second paragraph where Senator Robb makes it clear that he does not accept that this is justifiable.  He continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is inducement of the worst sort. No matter how well disciplined, no matter how professional we try to be, that is temptation handed to one on a plate.  I was not subjected to any ethical <Col N="1242" /> committee, nor was there any suggestion that there should be an ethical committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is precisely the situation we are dealing with here.  There is not intervention. This is an attempt, I think quite properly, to allow a short cut so that patients can receive the best possible treatment.  Ethical committees have been established in the main part of the Bill. They were discovered to hold up the process of making certain treatments available and so, quite appropriately, the Minister is introducing a short cut but it does cut out the ethical committees.  Here is the nub of the point Professor Robb was addressing.  I continue now with the quotation:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;had I chosen to accept the cheque and get on with receiving the £10 notes in rapid order.  The irony is that that drug has now turned out to be a very successful drug and is in wide use. Here, is the dilemma.  How does one obtain the research in order to ensure that drugs are safe, and while one is doing this research, how can one ensure that the motives of the researcher and of those that are promoting the research are such as to ensure that the target of their research is going to have the research done on him safely?  That is what we are discussing here.</P>
    <P>That, I think with the greatest respect, addresses the situation quite centrally.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Senator Conroy, for whose intellectual elegance I have learnt to have great respect, is capable of producing yet another argument in defence.  Since the Government side are claiming the virtues of academic wisdom, let me retreat to the plain people of Ireland and the university of life and say that, even if Professor Conroy does produce an opposite view, let us remember that when doctors differ, patients die.</P>

When I heard him mention the £10 earlier in the debate I thought perhaps we might have a case to <Col N="1243" /> answer but, having listened to him quote liberally from Senator Robb, I do not think that is the case.  In fact, what happened with Senator Robb was that it was counterproductive for the pharmaceutical firm to approach the doctor in that way and it created a dilemma for him, as it would cause a dilemma for all doctors in practice.  What Senator Robb was referring to was a clinical trial.  In what Senator Norris quoted from he was referring to research and to a clinical trial; he was not referring to what we are referring to here, which is using a drug for a life saving purpose on an individual patient.  It is the fundamental relationship between a doctor and his patient.  I do not think it is necessary to write into legislation a protection to ensure that the doctor would not be motivated to use a drug that would not be in the interest of his patient because he got a financial inducement.  If that were to happen there is plenty of protection already in law, through the Medical Practitioners Act. In my view it would be a very serious offence and a very serious breach of a doctor's responsibility if he were to use a drug that was not in the interest of the patient because there was a financial inducement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the fact that there might be several drugs and that the doctor might be influenced to select one of them.  Again, the case we are thinking of in this part of the legislation is the patient who perhaps is terminally ill, and this is a drug that has been introduced as a lifesaving drug.  If there were a number of drugs that would have the same effect then, in my view, there would be an obligation on the doctor to select a licensed drug, and if there were several drugs on the market, presumably some of them would be licensed.  We are talking about a drug where there would not be an licensed equivalent and a doctor would be using it expressly as a lifesaving drug for the patient.  The fact that it is in the course of normal medical treatment makes it highly unlikely that there would be an inducement to the doctor to use the drug for that particular patient.  While <Col N="1244" /> we all agree with the principle, the doctor should not be influenced by an incentive to use a particular drug.  Under this registration the deciding factor should be whether the drug is in the interest of the patient.  I do not see any necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <P>Not yet; we will not have much time left with it anyway.  If the Minister thinks there is no problem then, given what I believe to be a reasonable degree of public concern the simple thing to do is to accept the amendment.  It will not inhibit anybody, it will not cause any problems.  Senator Robb made the point that people were offered incentives.  The public &mdash; this is a point I made on Second Stage &mdash; are increasingly sceptical of all professions because they have watched the profession of engineering, of which I am a member, the general area of science, devastate the environment of half the world and been assured, as it was happening, that it was not happening. It was only when the evidence virtually stood up and hit the scientific community between their eyes that they discovered that the world had a thing called the environment which was under serious threat from the actions of science and technology and runaway consumption by western society.</P>
      <P>The public are entitled to be reassured that all of the provisions are there to protect their well being.  Every clinical trial, whether under the old Act or the Act as amended, must be conducted by a registered medical practitioner.  It does not make sense to me to use this argument about the magnificent ethical commitment of every doctor if, on the one hand we produce a complex Control of Clinical Trials Act to regulate the conduct of clinical trials and of registered medical practitioners, and then say, of course, when they are operating under section 6 (2) as amended they will all behave with impeccable judgment and there will be no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could rely so absolutely on the <Col N="1245" /> judgment of the medical profession, collectively and individually, we would not need the Clinical Trials Act at all other than to say they must all be conducted by a registered medical practitioner.  They can all be relied upon apparently, according to Senator Conroy and the Minister, to do everything perfectly well.  The truth is they cannot, which is why we have a Clinical Trials Act.  If they cannot then we should carry the logic through and we should ensure that in this case where they are not conducting a clinical trial none of the trappings of the clinical trial, i.e., material incentives for the doctor or patient should be involved.  It is not a clinical trial and we regulate them even if they are doctors because we know that everybody is human.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me there is no conflict between this amendment and the Bill, its intention and purpose so it would be possible to take it on without doing any damage.  I do not think anybody's conscience would be violated by so doing. I would like to make one further point, that is, I noted there was an attempt to bring former Senator Robb's argument into support of the Government's reluctance to accept this amendment by saying that he was actually illustrating the Government's point.  Far from it.  It is perfectly clear and he was quite unambiguous about it.  He said: &ldquo;That is temptation handed to one on a plate.  This is inducement of the worst sort.&rdquo;  There are two quite unambiguous statements: inducement of the worst sort, temptation handed to one on a plate.  You may disagree with the former Senator.  You may be surprised that even in 1977 a sum of £10 would represent any inducement to temptation at all but there is no question of ambiguity in what he was saying.  He was saying that it was wrong in principle and it was something that he was very concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give at least some indication that he will consider this. It should cause no difficulty philosophically. It does not attack or undermine the principle of the Bill at all. Senator Ryan's point is very well taken <Col N="1246" /> that legislation of this kind does not deal with the 95 per cent of doctors who are perfectly all right.  It seeks to close out the option for that small minority who may be liable to corruption.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how Senator Norris can say that what he has quoted from former Senator Robb does not in some way support the Government's case.  After all, this afternoon we have just one case before us where a pharmaceutical company offered a doctor an incentive to use a drug for cash and that was resisted.  We have no case where a doctor used a drug that was not in the interests of the patient, and, in fact, we have no case presented to us here this afternoon where a doctor was offered an incentive cheque and cashed the cheque or accepted cash in any other form.  The only illustrated case we have here before us this evening is from former Senator Robb quoted in the Seanad.  That case was one which in my view represents what is likely to happen, that it is likely to be counterproductive for the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
      <P>I am interested that this amendment is being introduced as an addendum to the amended section 6 of the Bill.  In section 2 of this Bill we are just clarifying what is already in the original Bill.  Section 6 (2) (a) (ii) of the original Bill stated: &ldquo;The principal purpose of that administration is the welfare of the patient.&rdquo;  The new subsection is just to clarify what we mean by the welfare of the patient.  When the legislation was going through this House in 1986 and 1987 no such amendment was included in it.  When it was implemented in 1987 and the early part of 1988, there did not appear to be any need for such an amendment.  I still believe there is no need for such an amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann rejects the negotiating position adopted by the <Col N="1248" /> United States of America in the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and noting the adverse effect that agreement to the US proposals would have on the Irish economy and on our agriculture, calls on the European Community to defend the Common Agricultural Policy and the family farm.</P>
    <P>In proposing the motion I would like to welcome to the House the Minister, Deputy Kirk.  He is a very good attender here and we are glad to see him once again.  I know he will convey our views to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    <P>In relation to this motion I have been very much encouraged in recent weeks and months to see that the Government are taking a very active and positive role in relation to the GATT talks.  Certainly, there was a good deal of worry in farming <Col N="1249" /> circles in general that the problem, which is a very serious one, was not getting the attention it might have deserved but I note that in recent weeks both Deputy O'Kennedy, and our own party leader, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, have been active in this area.  I was also glad to note that the Taoiseach last week said that he would wish to defend the Common Agricultural Policy.  I urge them to redouble their efforts in the coming weeks and months to see to it that the position of the Irish farmer and of farmers in the European Community and that of the Common Agricultural Policy itself are defended.</P>
    <P>I believe this matter is the most important one that has confronted Irish agriculture, and indeed in some ways the Irish economy, since we joined the Community in 1973.  It is arguably one of the most serious matters that has confronted us since the time of the Economic War, and the older people among us can remember the devastation that caused.  I believe there was a general lack of awareness in the country as to the implications of what the United States were telling the European Community through the Uruguay round of talks under GATT.  I think that lack of awareness was very much evident in the Oireachtas and not just in the country as a whole.  I realise there were members of the Cabinet and Ministers, like Deputy Kirk, who were very well aware of the situation but in general there was a marked lack of awareness of the situation, even to the point that last week, when a gentleman from RTE contacted me about the matter, I was surprised that for someone who was a well experienced journalist he did not seem to know what GATT was. I believe that is probably characteristic of the country as a whole.  But the farmers certainly know what it is, because about 4,000 or 5,000 of them turned up outside the American Embassy to let the American Government know of their concern about the matter.</P>
    <P>We need to let the US Government and the European Community know the opinion of this Parliament, this <Col N="1250" /> Oireachtas.  We are talking about a vital national interest that is at stake and I see nothing wrong at all with defending our national interest in the Community. Other countries seem to do it almost all the time.  Mrs. Thatcher seems to be extremely good at defending the British interest in the Community; in fact, the US itself is very good at protecting its own interests.  I believe we must have enough self-confidence in our own sovereignty and in our own independent status to do the same thing when the need arises.  My message to the House, to the Oireachtas as a whole and to all who are interested in the welfare of the Irish economy and of the people of Ireland is that the next five months are likely to be the most critical period for our agricultural industry and for the economy for the past 20 years.  I hope the efforts which are being made by the Government, and indeed by certain members of the European Commission, will be fruitful and that the proposals as outlined by the United States will be rejected.</P>
    <P>By the end of the year the 96 countries which are participating in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are scheduled to agree on the measures to liberalise world trade in agricultural produce and in the process the United States, along with the big agricultural exporters of Australia, New Zealand, several of the countries of South America, Canada, the so-called CAIRNS group, want to get rid of our system of support for farm prices.  Basically, that is what they are about.  They might argue otherwise, but that is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>We in the Progressive Democrats reject the US efforts to get rid of the Common Agricultural Policy and, with it, many Irish and European farmers.  I think liberalisation is a perfectly acceptable and laudable thing to work towards but destitution &mdash; and that is what it would amount to &mdash; is not.  There is enough poverty in rural Ireland without making it worse.  From the beginning my party have defended, and it will continue to defend, the fundamental role of the family farm as the basic unit of agricultural production and as the mainstay <Col N="1251" /> of rural society.  I am glad the stated objective of the agreed Programme for Government drafted between ourselves and Fianna Fáil is to promote the viability of the maximum number of Irish farms in a clean environment.  The objective of my party's agricultural policy is, and always has been, to maintain the family farm as the central element of the rural community and as the agent of growth within agriculture.  Allowing as many people as possible to make a decent living from the land through efficient farming is the best guarantee we have of being able to keep a viable rural community in place and of keeping people off the dole queues and the emigrant boats and planes.  That must be an objective which, I am sure, is shared by every Member of this House.  It has been a guiding principle behind our agricultural policy and it will continue to be so.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we take such a serious view of the proposals for world trade in agricultural policy being put forward by the Americans in the Uruguay round of talks under GATT.  As I said, the talks will have profound implications, not just for Irish farmers but for the whole Irish economy.  They are the most significant events since we joined the Common Market, as it was then, now the European Community.  It is no exaggeration to say that if the Americans were to get their way there would be no future for many thousands of Irish farmers. Already we have a situation where there are large numbers of people leaving the land.  I think that would become a tide and we would have absolute devastation. Many people are only now beginning to waken up to what agreeing to the US proposals would mean.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the confusion in many quarters about what GATT is and what it attempts to do.  I think it is necessary for the benefit of Members of the House who are not <i>au fait</i> with GATT to explain what it is about.  It began in 1948 after the War to try to rebuild the world economy with the idea of liberalising world trade and there are now more than <Col N="1252" /> 90 countries involved, the so-called contracting parties.  We are only now in the process of getting into the agricultural dimension of GATT and that began in 1986 with the Uruguay round; it was named the Uruguay round because that is where the talks took place.  The target for completion of those talks is the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In April 1989 there was a declaration made which had very worrying implications for this country when it said that the Community agreed to substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection sustained over an agreed period of time resulting in correcting and preventing restrictions and distortions in world agricultural trade.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy can, of course, be criticised for the way it has produced surpluses, but I think it is very important to remember it was instituted at a time when there was a very urgent need for food within the Community.  We should always remember there is a very thin line between surplus and deficit. Those of us who live in the modern industrial society are, by and large, fortunate enough to be reasonably well fed.  But there are people &mdash; I am sure in this country and certainly in parts of Europe &mdash; who can remember a time when they were not at all well fed, and that has been one of the dramatic successes of the Common Agricultural Policy.  As I said, it can be criticised for the way it has produced surpluses, for the way it has dealt with those surpluses and for the way it has concentrated productive power in the hands of fewer and larger farmers.</P>
    <P>However, it has also brought immense benefits to this country, because during the past 17 years it has kept many more farmers in business and many more workers in processing our agricultural produce than would have otherwise been the case.  It results in a benefit to this country annually of about £1.4 billion. That is what our take is from the Community, and the guarantee fund brings in about a billion of that figure.  I would reject the suggestion that the policy has led to dear food.  Certainly, food prices <Col N="1253" /> have gone up; but I think food is relatively cheaper now than it was for very many years.  It is of better quality, it is more wholesome and I think the price of food can be defended.  I think supply management within the Community has shown a way in which surpluses can be handled without the devastation of seeing the bottom fall out of markets.</P>
    <P>We need to remind ourselves of what would happen to rural towns and villages if, as is suggested, on the dismantling of the CAP farm incomes were to fall by 50 per cent.  Farmers are consumers.  People in the rural towns are consumers.  People involved in services &mdash; the solicitor, the banker, the parish priest in the rural town &mdash; are consumers; and in many ways much of those people's welfare is related to the welfare of the farmers in the community around them.  The rural towns will die if the Americans get their way. They want us to get rid of the price supports and inevitably to scrap the Common Agricultural Policy.  If they succeed, Irish farm incomes will be more than halved.</P>
    <P>I think we need to remind the country as a whole that in this country, 19 per cent of the workforce is employed in agriculture and in the food and drinks processing sector and that the agri-food sector contributes more than 42 per cent of Ireland's net receipts of foreign exchange from exporting.  Textiles are a very important dimension of GATT, and if we take textiles into account and add that to agriculture, nearly 30 per cent of the workforce is connected with those activities.</P>
    <P>There are immense economic consequences and it is very easy to see them. They are immense for the country as a whole.  We need to remind ourselves constantly of that; they are immense for the country as a whole, not just for farming.  There seems to be an attitude in the country that if farmers are doing well other people are doing badly; but if farmers do badly it is certain that the country will do badly.  From the figures I have shown, it is very easy to see that to allow the US to get its way would have a much more serious effect on our economy than on any other country within <Col N="1254" /> the Community.  That is why it is in our national interest to make a noise about it and to let our American friends and others within the European Community know the depth of feeling there is in this country, within the rural community and among farmers about this matter.  It is because the Progressive Democrats view the outcome of the GATT talks so seriously that we have put down this special motion here today calling on the Seanad to reject the negotiating position. I am confident that we will get widespread support.</P>
    <P>Another thing that needs to be said is that there is a perception abroad that American farming is not supported at all and that European farming is very heavily supported.  The fact of the matter is that each American farmer gets more than twice as much money, as an individual, from the US Government as the European farmer gets from the EC.  The reason, of course, is that there are not as many farmers in the US as there are in the Community.  There are only about 2.4 million farms in the US and there are nine million farms in the Community. The average size of the farms in the Community &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash; is about 13 hectares and the average size of the farms in America is 175 hectares. There is a heck of a difference and that explains something about the American philosophy of competitive advantage.  Obviously, at that sort of level those farms are in a much better position to survive in a competitive free-for-all. US spending accounts for 25 per cent to 27 per cent of gross agricultural revenue within the states, so America does support its farming.  The figure in the Community is about 38 per cent, so the Community does support it more. But it is wrong to say that the United States does not support its farming.</P>
    <P>One of the things I was glad to see was that when the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, went to America to attend the GATT talks there he came back and reported he had taken the opportunity to stress the importance of respecting the European farming tradition of maintaining a strong rural society not only in Ireland but in <Col N="1255" /> Europe generally.  I was glad he said that. I know that those things have been repeated by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, and others.  I hope they will continue to say those things and that they will not be deflected in their course in terms of protecting and articulating the needs of the farming community both in Ireland and the Community.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy O'Malley said that the negotiations must allow the EC to continue to support agriculture so that a strong rural society can be maintained not only here but in Europe generally.  I congratulate him on that stand and I hope that other Ministers who are involved in the EC Commission will support him, and I am sure they will.  We must remember that it is the Commission who is the body responsible for negotiating this treaty.  They are the people who will negotiate the treaty and I am sure our Ministers will continue to defend Irish farming and the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Council is due to discuss this matter next week and I know that the chairman of the agricultural negotiating group is to draw up proposals, I think early in July, and then Mr. MacSharry will be meeting people in Dromoland Castle later in July.  I know that Deputy O'Kennedy has also been keeping a close eye on this matter.  In all of that I think the thrust must continue to be one of holding the line.  Quite plainly, America must be told that what it is proposing is just not on, as plainly as that.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House and many of us in the country readily acknowledge the debt that we owe to the United States.  It must also be recognised that our people have helped to make that country the great country it is.  I am sure it will continue to support and understand its friends when they are critical of it.  It is certain that a stand off is not going to be of any use whatsoever.  It is important to reach a settlement within the context of defending the family farm.  I think that can be done.  There have been suggestions to that effect from the US trade representative, Ms. Hills, who said they can accommodate the CAP within the <Col N="1256" /> programme of which they are speaking. She even accepted the fact that in the United States protection existed.  I am glad she and the other people involved have taken on board the suggestion made by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, that there should be regular contact between the United States and the Community and that talks at official level between the Commission and the US will take place at regular intervals to help bridge the gap between the two sides.  Certainly, the Community's negotiators need to be given political direction in relation to how they are progressing.</P>
    <P>One of the areas which is of major personal concern to me is the whole question of tillage farming, because I happen to be a tillage farmer.  This is one of the most serious dimensions of the GATT proposals from an Irish point of view. It is clear that the income from tillage farming in Ireland is one of the poorest in farming.  One of the big reasons for this is that the Community every year imports 18 million tonnes of corn gluten. That is a low cost subsidised product of the Ethanol industry.  It needs to be said quite clearly that it is a subsidised product, a by-product of that industry. The price could fall through the floor and it would still find a market.  We have to compete with that.  It is all very well to talk about fair and equal competition, but that is not fair and equal competition. Irish grain growers are naturally very resentful of what they see as dumping. They also know that without those imports the EC cereals market would be almost in balance and that Irish grass based livestock production would have a competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>We admit that there would certainly be problems for the poultry and pig industry. When we joined the Community it was widely suggested that the big advantage we had was that our grass based production would have a major competitive advantage over its competitors on the European mainland.  The fact is that because people in Holland, near the port of Rotterdam, have cheap cereal substitutes they can compete very effectively <Col N="1257" /> with grass based production.  Those substitutes were part of an original GATT agreement.  I understand the reason that agreement is there, but it must be part of the whole renegotiation and negotiation process.  That problem of cereal substitutes needs to be tackled within the GATT.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks some Members of the House have had a right go at farmers. One Member suggested that they were &ldquo;unpatriotic and ruthless&rdquo;.  That is my recollection of the words used.  Those are grossly offensive words to people who have an average income of about £5,000 a year.  There are very many people living in rural Ireland who are living in poverty. They are not as vocal and as demonstrative as some other groups within the community.  They live in quiet, rural, dignified, silent poverty; and it is just as grinding as poverty anywhere else.  A report from Teagasc suggested that the average income in Offaly was £5,900; the average income in cattle farming in the west of Ireland is £2,400.  Of course, there are people who become wealthy from large scale dairying operations and so on. We hear a lot about them but we should hear about the other people as well.  I do not know how people live on those sort of incomes.</P>
    <P>I apologise for taking a detailed technical look at some of the matters which are proposed under the GATT talks but I think our relation to them needs to be clarified.  One of the things being suggested by the US is the matter of tariffication, that there should be a fixed border duty, that goods coming into the Community would cross that fixed tariff barrier and that those tariff barriers would be eliminated over a ten year period.  My objection to the fixed tariff barriers is that they do not take into account currency fluctuations.  If the currency goes up or down there can be huge distortions of trade as a result.  For that reason, from a community point of view, tariffication is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The other thing which is being proposed by the Community &mdash; and I think it is a reasonable question, one I referred to earlier that is, this question of corn <Col N="1258" /> gluten, of cereal substitutes and the matter of rebalancing &mdash; is that corn gluten should be restricted in return for lower domestic protection on EC cereals. That seems to be a reasonable proposition. When there was one of these interactive sessions in the US Embassy, where we could all talk to one another from the various cities around Europe and Washington, that matter was more or less rejected out of hand by the American representative.  When he was asked what would he say to the one or two million farmers in the Community who would have to leave the land, his attitude was that if they were auto workers in Detroit and the Japanese could send in cars cheaper, they should find job somewhere else.  That is all very well if there are jobs to be found somewhere else but we all know that within the Community, and within Ireland in particular, the job market is already saturated.  I do not know how the economies of the Community can afford to see people taken out of farming, albeit subsidised at a certain level, and put on to the unemployment exchanges where the Exchequer is going to have to give them some form of income to support them.  That is a very serious problem for the Community and not just a problem for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The other matter of which the US have said they are in favour is of direct income support, in other words, they have no objection to prices being reduced and in return giving a direct income support to the farmers.  There are two aspects to this.  One is that from an Irish domestic point of view it will certainly be required of us to find money from our own Exchequer to finance part of that.  We all know the constraints on the Exchequer and that it is not going to be easy for us to find money to give direct income support.  I think there is an even more serious aspect to it and an even more negative aspect, that is, I do not think it is helpful in any way to generate a dole mentality within farming and within the rural community.</P>
    <P>The other matter the community have been arguing about is that they should be given credits for the reductions in support <Col N="1259" /> prices which have been taking place since 1986.  That would go quite a way to actually meeting some of the objections which are being put in place by the Americans. I think that is a reasonable proposition. Certainly, in real terms prices have been cut.  There is the whole question of aggregating measures of support.  How do we know what the Americans are giving? How do we know what the Community is giving?  There needs to be some standard measurement of how each community is supporting its farmers.</P>
    <P>There are other things I would like to say, and I am sure I can come to them at the conclusion of the debate.  There is this whole question of the doctrine of comparative advantage, which is a very attractive doctrine.  It is a good doctrine in relation to how business would operate within the country.  Looking at the whole EC scene, it is even accepted that that doctrine is not a good doctrine because it has already been acknowledged that because of 1992 this country as a peripheral region should be entitled to special concessions.  I have difficulties about this doctrine of comparative advantage.  The US have that doctrine in place for purely selfish reasons because they know they can complete more successfully than anybody else on the world market.  That is not to argue for protectionism or that market forces should not operate within the country.  Market forces work perfectly well within the Community as we very well know in this country in relation to our beef and dairy products.  The Common Agricultural Policy has defects but it cannot be dismantled without absolutely catastrophic effects on Ireland, not just on farming but on Ireland and the Irish economy.  If a farmer wants to know what it would be like under the regime as proposed by the Americans it would be like the price of potatoes which fluctuates dramatically from year to year.  People get into the potato business and people go out of that business and that is exactly what it would be like.  I do not think that is desirable from anybody's point of view.</P>
    <P>What is good for farmers is good for <Col N="1260" /> the economy, certainly in Ireland's case. There is no doubt about that.  Farming and the agricultural industry do not operate in isolation from the rest of the economy although that impression is frequently given.  Their welfare is totally bound up with the overall economy. Reasonable interest rates, a tax regime which provides an incentive to work and which rewards effort, a growing economy and general confidence are just as important to the agricultural business as to any other business.  I have pleasure in proposing this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion as proposed by Senator Dardis.  I can agree with the motion in relation both to the rejection of the United States approach to the GATT negotiations and the call on the European Community to defend the Common Agricultural Policy.  The United States approach which wants the elimination of all supports and protection over a period goes further than the aims of the Uruguay round of negotiations and the further refinement of those objectives which was agreed by all parties to the negotiations including the United States just over a year ago at the mid-term review of the negotiations.  At the same time as they are proposing the elimination of support and protection in Geneva, in Washington the United States Farm Bill is proposing to increase support for United States agriculture and especially its support of exports.  This type of contradictory stance makes it difficult for the Community negotiations to find a solid basis from which to negotiate with the United States.  Are they serious about the elimination of all supports?  Will their Congress agree to follow such a line especially when one considers the strength of the farm lobby in that country?  The United States in terms of number of farmers and size of farm bears no comparison with European agriculture. Many of the huge farms in the United States are run by companies. They do not have the tradition of the family farm that is prevalent in Europe, and particularly in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to dwell <Col N="1261" /> for a few minutes on the Labour Party amendment to the motion.  The amendment shows the lack of Labour interest in farmers and indeed their complete lack of knowledge of farming and related industries.  Can the Labour Party gurantee that if the support mechanism of the Common Agricultural Policy were eliminated food would be cheaper to any great extent?  I can guarantee that if the Labour wish was granted it would have unprecedented effects on employment in our agriculture-based industries.  The Labour amendment is a receipt for unemployment and the emigrant boat.  Do the Labour Senators realise that nearly 20 per cent of employment in this country is dependent on the agriculture and food and drinks industries?  I would like to ask what should these industries do when their raw materials dry up?  Because of the lack of import content in agricultural exports they are among the most beneficial for the country.  There is not much profits repatriation in these industries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited greatly from the Common Agricultural Policy and indeed not just large wealthy farmers.  I am told that over £800 million has been received under the CAP since our entry into the European Community.  Would we have got so much through direct income supports? What Labour are talking about is putting farmers on the dole.  They would have no incentive to produce anything. Who would pay for the direct income supports?  I would like to ask, do Labour expect the EC to come up with the goods again or will it fall on the Irish Exchequer?  Can the Irish Exchequer bear the cost of direct income supports on top of the additional dole payments it would have to make to workers thrown out of employment in the agri-based business?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear the Labour amendment is ill-founded and ill-thought out.  They are looking with tunnel vision so they can obviously only see one aspect of a complex mass of issues involved in the Uruguay round.  According to Labour it would seem that the Agricultural Ministers, Trade Ministers and Foreign Minister in all the member states were wrong <Col N="1262" /> when they unanimously agreed in their separate councils over a period of months to support the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>This country would be a poor place without the Common Agricultural Policy and it is clear to me at any rate that the Labour amendment would have far more serious adverse effects on the less well-off sections than any possible small gains they might make by way of cheaper prices in the short-term.  Really what we are talking about here is the law of supply and demand.  Once the small farmers, both Irish and European, are eliminated, driven off their farms, prices would quickly come back to their current levels. It would create a monopoly-type situation for bigger, more industrialised farms.  I cannot see these being interested in the price to the consumer except to get the highest price they can.  The Common Agricultural Policy helps to provide a worldwide balance between the large and smaller farmers and I fully support it.</P>
    <P>To move back to the GATT negotiations themselves, my understanding is that these cover a far wider area than just agriculture.  There seems to be a number of other issues which would be of greater interest than agriculture to some of the more industrialised member states.  What this country has to guard against is other member states sacrificing agriculture to achieve policy aims in other areas.  I note, however, that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, is keeping a sharp eye on these negotiations.  He has already had the Uruguay round discussed at ministerial level in the Agricultural Ministers Council and I understand that negotiations will again be discussed at the Council next week.  The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Industry and Commerce have also done their bit in their respective Councils.</P>
    <P>While the Common Agricultural Policy may not be perfect, considerable reforms have been carried out over the past few years.  It is vitally important that in the GATT negotiations the Community get full credit for these reforms which are clearly a reduction in support <Col N="1263" /> levels.  The Community cannot be expected to start at a point well down the road of support reductions when other countries have made no efforts to reform their support systems.  Other participants in the negotiations are accusing the EC of intransigence in the negotiations but it is clear that the Community has gone further than any of the other participants in reducing support.</P>
    <P>I honestly hope that there is a successful result to the Uruguay round because increased trading increases standards of living and everybody benefits. However, any such success cannot be achieved if the other participants insist on the dismantlement of the Common Agricultural Policy as a precondition. While there will undoubtedly have to be some reduction in support and protection by the Community there should be as little as possible interference in the operation of the CAP mechanisms, and in particular with the variable levy and export fund systems on which Irish agriculture and its related industries are so dependent.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy must be kept in place if our farmers are to be afforded any chance of survival.  Even with the support systems in place under the Common Agricultural Policy, thousands of farmers have left the land since we joined the European Community. The family farm is the central element of the rural community and should be kept in place even if that has to be done by support mechanisms under such schemes as the headage payments, suckler cow schemes, ewe premium schemes, etc.  We should let the Americans know in no uncertain manner that we will not support the dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Indeed I was pleased to see the thousands of farmers who marched to the American Embassy recently to protest against the American position at the GATT negotiations.  Indeed, they have every reason to be worried because if the United States gets its way, then many of those farmers will not be able to survive and the predictions Mansholt made many years ago will be realised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> Senator Dardis mentioned that the average income from cattle farming in the West of Ireland was £2,400 per annum and I just shudder to think what that income would be if all the support mechanisms that we have there at present, such as intervention, headage payments, etc., were eliminated.  Thousands of those farmers would be out of their farms because there is no way they could survive in a situation like that.  The dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy would be catastrophic for the Irish economy and we in this country have every right to demand that that policy be maintained because the Irish economy could not stand the dismantling of the CAP.</P>
    <P>It is not just agriculture we are talking about here.  It is the many other industries that are depending so much on agriculture and, as I said, we have seen too many of our farmers over the past number of years leave the land.  This is not just happening in Ireland, it is happening all over Europe.  Therefore we have to oppose the stand being taken by the Americans at the GATT talks at the present time.  We have to oppose it as strongly as we can, and I can assure the Minister that he has the full support of the farming community in this country in the negotiations he is now involved in. That is why I am supporting this motion tonight and I hope it will be accepted unanimously by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday two weeks I had the honour &mdash; though I will not say the pleasure &mdash; of having a long talk in Washington with Ambassador Katz.  Ambassador Katz has responsibility for negotiations on agricultural trade in the GATT and I am afraid what he had to say was not very uplifting. However, more of that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current round of talks was launched in September 1986 in Uruguay and this is a sequence of events following the Kennedy round and the Tokyo round in these GATT negotiations.  We all know that GATT and the success of GATT has been largely responsible for the prosperity the world has enjoyed since the <Col N="1265" /> Second World War.  If the talks fail, the effect on world trade could be disastrous but unfortunately, if the talks succeed the effects on Ireland could be disastrous too. Failure would mean an immediate loss of confidence on the international stock markets.  This, of course, would undermine the whole basis on which our prosperity was built, the prosperity which depended on free trade.  We would revert I fear to a world of trade blocs, bilateral deals and economic stagnation.</P>
    <P>Already the United States has created the legal instrument which could destroy the international trading system.  Frightened by its huge trade deficit it enacted the 1988 Trade and Competitiveness Act and section 301 of that Act allows the United States to (1) determine unilaterally what is an unfair trade practice and (2) set targets for US exports to individual countries and then penalise those who fail to take the target amount. Part of the Act reads:</P>
    <P>in cases of alleged trade agreement violation, or cases where a foreign nation's policy or practice is &ldquo;unjustifiable&rdquo; or cases where a foreign nation's policy or practice is &ldquo;unjustifiable&rdquo; and burdens or restricts US commerce, the Act makes retaliation mandatory rather than discretionary.</P>
    <P>This type of legislation, of course, strikes at the very heart of multilateral world trade systems.  Allowing individual countries to determine what is fair or unfair and setting targets for bilateral trade balance are inherently contrary to the multilateral principles on which world trade grew so successfully since 1945. These principles required that disputes be referred to an international body, the GATT, not settled by individual countries as the United States seems intent on doing.</P>
    <P>So far fortunately the US has made little use of the new powers conferred by section 301 of the 1988 Act.  The danger is, of course, that if the talks fail in December the President will be pressured to use the powers of section 301 on a wide scale.  That would automatically mean other trade blocs retaliating.  We <Col N="1266" /> would then find ourselves back into a system of escalating trade barriers of the kind that plunged the world into the depression in 1931.  This I believe must be avoided.  International agreement must be reached in the trade talks on a number of key issues and the principal issues in the present round are agriculture, textiles, services and protecting intellectual property.  What the US, the CAIRNS group and some Third World countries want is complete free trade in agricultural products; in other words, world prices for commodities.</P>
    <P>I would have to say that world prices are not realistic prices.  Most countries just export the commodities of which they happen to have a tiny surplus.  If I may take milk as an example, only about 7 per cent of total world milk production is traded internationally and countries are prepared to dump that on the world market at whatever price is available. Senator Dardis has already given the example of potatoes which is a very good example.  I have often used potatoes as the example.  You get prices and production going up and down like a yoyo and that is not good either for the producer or the consumer.</P>
    <P>We have to resist it for other reasons, too.  Food is strategicaly important and we would be very foolish in the Community to make ourselves over-dependent on other trade blocs because of all the dangers that can exist with droughts or whatever else might cause scarcities.  I am old enough to remember when we were heavily dependent on the US soya bean for stock feeding in the Community. Under President Nixon the US overnight slapped a ban on exports of soya bean just because the US felt it did not have enough for its own home market.  That might happen with human food as well. There are many other reasons for it which I will go into later if I have time.</P>
    <P>On the question of textiles, some Third World countries, particularly those in the Far East, are looking for changes in the multifibres agreement which we have. They want it dismantled.  They talk of free trade.  Free trade is all very well provided it is fair trade.  When you are <Col N="1267" /> dealing with some of these countries in the Far East, as we know only too well from experience with the Japanese, free trade is not always fair trade.  It is quite clear that some of these countries have targeted markets and they are prepared to sell their products at below what they are prepared to sell on their own home market for the purpose of gaining access and undermining our markets in the Community.</P>
    <P>With regard to services, the Community would be looking, for instance, for access in banking to the US market and that is fair enough.  Perhaps the US will not be as anxious for free trade in that situation.  With regard to intellectual property, I think both the Community and the US and perhaps other groups would like to prevent the scale of piracy of other people's innovations which is taking place at an alarming rate.  These are the main areas in which we must try to find compromises and agreement.</P>
    <P>The aim of the talks will be to get a series of trade-offs on these issues.  For example, the United States wants to free agricultural trade but in turn it may be forced to accept banking, the European banks entering into the American market.  Countries like India and others in the Pacific rim want greater access for their textiles to European and American markets.  In return they may be forced to give greater protection to the intellectual property rights of multinational companies. This is where the real problem arises for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland wants to keep an open international trading system.  We are a very open economy.  We export about 60 per cent of what we produce.  We live by trade; in fact, few countries in Europe depend as much on exporting as we do. On the other hand, we have the protection of the Common Agricultural Policy for our agriculture.  We also have a greater dependence on agriculture than any other country in the Community, and indeed most countries on this globe. Sixteen per cent of our population live on farms and over 40 per cent of net exports come from our agriculture.  As <Col N="1268" /> against that, only about 8 per cent of the Community citizens live on farms and less than 3 per cent in the US.  In relation to what Senator Dardis said already about support for agriculture, the US has roughly four times as much land as we have in the Community.  It has roughly a quarter of the number of farmers that we have in the Community and the support for their farmers is more or less the same as Community support.  The US, with all its talk, is supporting individual farmers by about four times the amount the Community is supporting each individual farmer.</P>
    <P>If European markets were open to imports and export subsidies were abolished, Irish farm incomes would be at least cut in half.  Most European &mdash; I would have to say from my experience &mdash; do not want this.  The European Community, fortunately, has adopted a negotiating position which will protect the Common Agricultural Policy.  We have to wait and see if this is just lip service. What will happen when the crunch comes?  If the European Commission is faced with the choice between the collapse of the talks and a major scaling-down of agricultural protection, which will it choose?  Given that agriculture contributes roughly 2.5 per cent of GDP in the Community, one has to ask will the Commission and the larger powers in the Community risk the 97.5 per cent for the sake of the 2.5 per cent?  I am not sure. I hope they will take a strong stand on behalf of the 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is where hard economics will come into the picture.  No other country in the Community, as I have already said, needs the Common Agricultural Policy as much as Ireland does.  Let us take for example the other end of the scale &mdash; Germany. Germany is the principal financier of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It has also surprisingly, been one of its strongest supporters but, objectively, Germany is a big loser from the Common Agricultural Policy.  A recent IMF study claimed that if the Common Agricultural Policy was abolished consumer prices would fall by <Col N="1269" /> almost 2 per cent in Germany, employment would rise by 5.5 per cent and domestic product would grow by 3.5 per cent. All this would happen despite the fact that there would be a fall in employment in German agriculture of 11 per cent. The benefits in lower prices and lower taxation it would seem would far outweigh the loss among the farmers in Germany. The same study showed that Ireland and Denmark are the only countries which gain significantly from the CAP, after the benefit to farmers is subtracted from the cost in extra taxes and higher prices.</P>
    <P>If these figures are valid, one can see how the European Community's strong support for the CAP could wilt under pressure and the consequences for all Irish farmers, but especially for the small family farm, would be disastrous.  The drop in the value of agricultural exports would turn our trade surplus into a trade deficit and the economy of rural areas would be decimated with the decline in farmers' purchasing power.  This is where the IMF figures are inadequate.  They do not quantify some of the benefits of a healthy agriculture, the efficient use of rural infrastructure for instance and a healthy rural environment, nor do they quantify the value of security of food supplies in emergencies.  There is an economic cost to the extra urbanisation necessitating new homes and schools and infrastructure in urban areas while rural areas would be depopulated by such a dramatic cut in farm income.</P>
    <P>Farming is not the only sector that has cause for alarm about this round of GATT negotiations.  The Irish clothing and textile industry employs about 22,000 people, some 12 per cent of our total manufacturing employment.  If the multi-fibre agreement were abolished most of them, I fear, would be out of jobs.  The textile industry is the largest single industry in the Community with 5.5 million people employed and as such is likely to get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. In no period during the past 15 years has there been such a sudden drop in the fortunes of the agricultural community. The future looks very bleak.  There is a major problem ensuing for the smaller farmers and the exodus from the land <Col N="1271" /> will escalate.  In that context the GATT negotiations and the proposals made by the US and the CAIRNS group is frightening.  We should bear in mind that, if the US and the CAIRNS group are successful we will see milk down to 60 pence per gallon, beef cattle at 55 pence per pound and lamb will drop £20 per head.  An example of this is that New Zealand lamb on the Irish shelves and on European shelves is 20 per cent less than Irish lamb.</P>
      <P>Under the Common Agricultural Policy farmers are guaranteed a reasonable income and customers get top quality food at reasonable cost even in times of great scarcity.  The CAP regulates the supply of food to the market.  This is why I second this motion &mdash; that the cycles of over-supply and scarcity will be corrected by the approach of the Common Agricultural Policy thereby protecting the consumer.  If this is withdrawn it will create enormous difficulties for the customer. We will have food shortages and high prices as a result of market forces we experienced pre-EC membership.  I was involved in the meat business at that time and this trend was very pronounced. We have to realise that food shortages can occur for reasons other than the effects of demand and supply.  They are often created by natural disasters, weather or other difficulties in the farming area.  Not alone do the laws of demand and supply, the market forces, affect the supply of food but natural disasters also do.  For that reason the consumer must realise that the Common Agricultural Policy has a protective mechanism for them as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early seventies, all farmers voted for, and the farming organisations supported strongly, our membership of the EC on the basis of the benefits that would accrue from the Common Agricultural Policy, but even with the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy the number of small farmers throughout Europe has declined dramatically.  Farming activity and farming life are very uncertain and circumstances other than market forces <Col N="1272" /> affect their incomes.  For example, disease is a big factor in family farms.  A disease can wipe out a farmer's income for a year.  Price fluctuations can also create great difficulties.  The EC must ensure that two million farmers in the United States do not dictate the future of nine million farmers in Europe.  We must have a firm resolve to ensure that this does not happen.  If it does, it will be worse than the economic war in the thirties or the disastrous situation in 1974 when farmers could not sell their products. I can quote what happened in my town.  A farmer took a calf to the market, could not sell it, left it in the trailer went in for a jar and found two calves when he came out.  Somebody put another calf in the trailer because he could not get rid of it either.  The farmer had to take the two of them home.  That is the way it was. We will go back into that situation if the present proposals are accepted.  We must look at the reasons for the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of our amendment.  During the war many people throughout Europe starved because of the Nazi policy and at the end of the war the Germans were starving. The Common Agricultural Policy dominated the objectives of the Treaty of Rome to ensure that such a scarcity and such a situation would never happen again.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government and the European Commission must challenge vigorously the policy of the United States and the CAIRNS group and put forward an alternative policy to the GATT proposals which will protect the Common Agricultural Policy while also restoring balance to the agricultural markets.  The EC must formulate its agricultural policy to fulfil its objectives and ideals and not satisfy the US or the CAIRNS group. The Government and the EC must ensure that long-term agricultural policy within the EC must continue to recognise the fundamental role of the family farm as the mainstay of our rural community throughout Europe.  EC price policy for farm products must take full account of the cost structure of the efficient, smaller family farm.  Farmers deserve incomes in <Col N="1273" /> line with the non-agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has provided a stable environment for food producers, and security and stable prices for customers.  We must recognise the difficulties with milk production and the effects the quota has on many family units throughout Ireland.  The proposals under GATT will make the quota problem seem like a very minor issue indeed.  Our present milk quota system has reduced the quota volume to a level that has achieved stability in the EC.  Producers with small quotas should be granted priority access to quotas becoming available. This has been said over and over again and bears repeating.  The smaller farmer must have access to quotas becoming available to ensure he has a viable income from his land.</P>
    <P>In the case of beef, the EC Commission projections up to 1996 indicate a good balance between producers and demand in the EC.  The most effective way of avoiding surpluses of beef in the EC market is the maintenance, or preferably the improvement, of consumption and no other way.  The EC beef premium must be increased to help to provide more effective and direct support for the beef producers' income without increasing beef prices and thus aid beef consumption in the EC markets.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to predict the outcome for agriculture of the present GATT negotiations.  It is not possible to predict even if an agreement will be reached.  The current indications are that the negotiations will probably continue to the end of the year.  For an agreement to be reached there will have to be a major meeting of minds between the US, the CAIRNS group and the EC.  The long-term objective to provide for substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection sustained over an agreed period of time resulting in correcting and preventing restrictions and distortions in the world agricultural markets clearly implies that any country or region such as the EC would no longer be in a position to implement an independent agricultural <Col N="1274" /> policy in the future.  It was for this reason that the Irish people decided so overwhelmingly to join the EC.</P>
    <P>The recently announced demand by the US to go further than the Geneva agreement and to reintroduce their demand for total elimination of protection and support for agricultural production or trade raises a new question mark over the possibility of an agreement in the first place.  If the GATT negotiations fail and if there is no agreement, the consequences are even more unpredictable. The most likely outcome of no GATT agreement would be a trade war on world markets which would depress world market prices and exacerbate the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy. It would also mean that no progress would be made on the EC objective of rebalancing import protection.  On balance, the EC Governments may find stronger arguments favouring an agreement in GATT than the contrary.  The reasons the EC Governments would tend to favour an agreement on the GATT are that they will not wish to run the risks of the trade war, as I already mentioned, in particular, a risk to their industrial exports which the GATT has concentrated on up to 1990.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of GATT, the EC is implementing its own restrictive policy on agriculture through quotas, as I already mentioned, and budgetary stabilisers. The EC would hope to gain substantial credits in GATT for these actions and use it as a negotiating lever.  For the wealthier, more independent economies of the EC, the provision of direct income compensation to producers would not be a major problem so this may be a way around the situation.</P>
    <P>The Community is committed to achieving a rebalancing of protection and this can only be sought within a negotiating framework rather than through unilateral action.  The objective of our amendment is to highlight to the consumer, the benefits he and she gets under the Common Agricultural Policy.  I ask the House to reaffirm this view by accepting <Col N="1275" /> the Fine Gael amendment to the worthwhile, acceptable and very welcome proposal by the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Byrne.  I welcome this opportunity to support the motion by the Progressive Democrats in connection with the support of the Common Agricultural Policy in Ireland.  I strongly feel it would not be good for Ireland if the GATT was to succeed in this country, as the policy of the United States of America is that any support from the EC which affects agricultural trade would be phased out over a ten-year period.  This would effectively mean that any grants or subsidies from the EC would not be available to the farming community in Ireland and of course, this would have a detrimental effect on the agricultural industry and on the lives of many small farmers in Ireland.</P>
      <P>At present the United States of America is dumping large amounts of commodities on the European market, for example, corn gluten, which is depressing the price of cereals such as barley and corn in this country.  The reason the Americans can sell much cheaper is that their Government subsidise farmers in that country, something that Ireland would be unable to do.  This is what subscribing to the GATT policy would bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another provision in the GATT treaty is the prohibition of restrictions on imports, which would seriously damage competition on the home market, although at the moment agriculture is exempt from this ban.  The GATT treaty would also seek interference with the regional trade agreement, such as is in existence in the EC at the moment.  I firmly believe that this country should call on the European Community to defend the Common Agricultural Policy. That policy is essential for the survival of the agricultural industry in Ireland.  It has served this country well since its introduction in 1973.  It has protected family farm incomes, on which the rural community in Ireland depend.  This would be <Col N="1276" /> seriously damaged if the proposal of the GATT were to be subscribed by the Government.  I firmly support the motion put down by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem at all in supporting this motion.  I would like to compliment Senator Dardis and the Progressive Democrats for putting down this motion because it gives me and this House the opportunity to discuss issues that are very relevant to the House and the country.  I often find in this House that we discuss motions and issues that have very little relevance.  I firmly support the motion.</P>
      <P>A few things that happened here tonight have saddened me.  The first is that we have failed to attract any of the media.  I saw one of them here at one stage tonight.  This motion is about issues that, if the US are successful, will have devastating effects on the rural economy, the social fabric or rural Ireland, and will send farmers and their families into towns to compete for scarce resources such as housing, jobs and social welfare.  I find it difficult to understand why the media could not find time to come in here and let the people know what exactly is at stake.  However, of far greater sadness to me is the fact that there are still people in this country &mdash; and, worse still, people in this House &mdash; who would oppose a motion like this, who would oppose the farmers getting a reasonable living.  As Senator Dardis said, all of us here would agree, there seems to be a theory that every farmer irrespective of size, is a semi-millionaire.</P>
      <P>Wexford is regarded as a very wealthy county and fairly recently the county executive of IFA carried out a study of 250 farmers in the county with farms ranging from 15 to 75 acres.  The average level of indebtedness of those farmers was £9,365 per farm with loans from £3,517 on the smaller farms to £12,000 on the larger farms.  This has caused tremendous problems for farmers, particularly in the recent past, when as anyone in rural areas knows &mdash; especially bank managers and the ACC &mdash; they found great difficulty in making repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> The Labour amendment before us tonight suggest that these people should go further into the mire.  Can they not understand that if these people are taken off the land they will be competing with the supporters of this great socialist party &mdash; many of them in this House are about as socialist as I am, and I am no socialist. The proportion of farms in Wexford which reported having any difficulties in meeting loan repayments varied from 22 per cent on the larger farms to over 60 per cent on the medium sized farms.  In only 8 per cent of cases were the debts written off.  Others still have that millstone around their necks and are facing day to day, week to week, letters from bank managers calling them in and causing all sorts of problems that we will not discuss here.</P>
    <P>It was found that dairying in Wexford was concentrated on the larger farms, with two thirds of dairy farms in the 50 to 75 acre group and in virtually none of the 15 to 30 acre group.  Income for dairy farmers, for obvious reasons, was much greater than for dry stock farmers being over double the number on the 50 to 75 acre groups; in fact, there was only one dairy farm in the 15 to 30 acre size group. All of us who know anything at all about farming will know what the farmer's income was.  This brings me on to farmers' incomes.  It was found that one third of the farmers had an income level of £2,500 per labour unit while a further 26 per cent were in the £2,500 to the £5,000 category.  Only 17 per cent of the farmers surveyed had an income from farming per labour unit of £10,000 or more.  It can be clearly seen from that there here are people living in poverty even with the support they get from the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>If the Labour amendment were accepted &mdash; I know it will not &mdash; how many more people would we see move from the land?  How many more people would we see hurt?  How many more people would we see competing for, as I said earlier on, scarce resources?  As Senator Dardis has said, and all of us from rural communities have said on many occasions, attacks are made on <Col N="1278" /> farmers, right, left and centre at every forum possible, as if it were wrong to make money or to attempt to make a living.  I know, as I am sure does every other public representative in a rural area, that the farming community are a proud community who, under no circumstances, would ask for support, but those same people are now coming to us in the dead of night asking us for support to literally put bread on the table.  This is a fact of life, I have met many farmers who find it difficult to admit that they are having difficulties, that they cannot succeed or that they cannot provide for their families.</P>
    <P>This urban/rural divide only widens in this context.  I appeal to the Labour Party and to anybody else who engages constantly in farmer bashing, to cut it out, because only by pulling together can this Nation succeed.  As has been rightly said by people on both sides of the House, it is only by working together, it is only by urban people depending on those in the rural area and <i>vice versa</i> that we can succeed.  I appeal to the Labour Party to cut out this nonsense which is just another step in their campaign to farmer bash. Their amendment has absolutely no substance and was certainly ill thought out.</P>
    <P>The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was set up in 1948 and is now subscribed to by 96 or 97 Governments &mdash; I am not sure which as different publications give different figures &mdash; including the 12 EC countries which together account for almost 90 per cent of world trade.  Its basic aims are to liberalise world trade and to establish rules for the conduct of world trade.  There have been already eight rounds in GATT negotiations, the most recent one in Uruguay in 1986.</P>

      <P>First, I want to thank the Minister for coming here tonight to listen to my side of the story as it affects the town of Tuam.  Since the closure of the sugar factory in Tuam I have been highlighting the need to establish some major industry in the town to absorb the surplus labour available because of that closure. So far my efforts have met with little success.  The increasing dole queues, and the huge number of young people emigrating from the town and the parishes surrounding the town, is worrying and something drastic must be done to correct this.  That is why I requested permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment to ask the Government to consider Tuam as a location under their decentralisation programme.</P>
      <P>We would be happy to accommodate any Department of State in Tuam and their location there would give new hope to the community.  We have the infrastructure. A new water and sewerage scheme is proposed and is hoped to be got under way this year.  We have a good telephone service, good schools, easy access to University College, Galway which is 22 miles away and sites are also available.  Therefore, there is no difficulty. All we need is a commitment from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already put on the record of the House the disastrous employment position in Tuam and I will not go over that again.  Suffice it to say that since the sugar factory closed Homecare have closed and the engineering factory run by the sugar company have been asked to pare down their workforce, adding further to the gloom and depression in the town.  Since the Government launched their decentralisation programme a <Col N="1280" /> number of Government Departments have been located outside Dublin.  We have seen the prosperity that those Departments of State brought to the areas in question.  Ballina got a branch of the Department of the Environment with 265 jobs; Cavan got a branch of the Department of Agriculture and Food with 150 jobs; Galway got a branch of the Department of Defence with 200 jobs; Sligo got a branch of the Department of Social Welfare with 310 jobs; Athlone got a branch of the Department of Education with 180 jobs; Killarney got a branch of the Department of Justice with 140 jobs.  Letterkenny got a branch of the Department of Social Welfare with 190 jobs; a branch of Revenue transferred to Ennis providing 190 jobs, Limerick got 580 jobs and Nenagh, County Tipperary got 200 jobs.  Dundalk, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork city, Tullamore, Longford and Wexford are also to be included in that programme.  Some 300 personnel are to be transferred to Dundalk and 400 to Waterford.  Therefore, one can understand the encouragement and hope the transfer of a Department of State, providing that sort of employment, would give to a town like Tuam, particularly as it has suffered so much recently because of the closure of some of the factories in the town.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible for the Government to include Tuam in their decentralisation programme.  There would be a huge spin-off from the transfer of 200 or 300 jobs to a town like Tuam and it would certainly give a great fillip to the area.  I am pleading with the Minister now to do that.  All the services are available there, including a good site.  I hope we will be included in the Government's decentralisation programme in the near future.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir Hussey as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken about rural development many times in the Seanad, particularly in connection with the consequences of the closing of the Tuam Sugar Factory and its effect on the population, not only of <Col N="1281" /> the town itself, but of areas within a 20 mile radius of Tuam.  The closure of a central industry which was established by a Fianna Fáil Government to provide not only economic development but economic development with a social face was very serious.  Because of changing circumstances it became obvious that the long-term viability of a sugar plant in Tuam was no longer an option.  With the changes in circumstances we now have to look to new ways of fulfilling the same type of role we fulfilled in earlier times through the placing of companies such as Bord na Móna and the sugar company in various locations around the country.</P>
    <P>There is a great opportunity now, with the development of modern communications technology, to spread the benefits of service industries throughout the country.  With computer link-up the work being done, for example in places like Tuam, Galway, Ballina and Sligo can be immediately available to people on screen in Dublin, Cork and so on and there is no reason why much of the work being carried out by the State cannot be decentralised.  There is a strong case for the Tuam area because it has suffered large unemployment due to the closure of the sugar factory and other factors.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has worked for a long time in rural development, I am aware that it is generally overlooked that for every job created in direct employment, whether it is in the service industry or in manufacturing, the spin-off tends to be two to three jobs in other sectors. Therefore, it is a fair estimation to say that if one creates 200 jobs through decentralisation in a town like Tuam the gross effect could be a net gain of up to 600 people gaining employment by providing services to that enterprise.  We must now look on the type of work that is being done by the State sector as an industry in itself.  It is a service industry and a particular type of service industry that is suited to decentralisation.  As well as looking at Civil Service decentralisation, such as has happened in the towns mentioned by Senator Hussey, we should consider decentralising the head <Col N="1282" /> offices of semi-State companies, particularly those that already have a rural involvement.</P>
    <P>Finally, some people would argue that the provision of this type of decentralised employment in Galway would answer the problem for Tuam.  However, our experience is that employment of this type tends to have a radius of about 15 to 20 miles at maximum and its effect is not felt over the huge area that most people would suppose, particularly in relation to the smaller of two centres.  For example, the creation of employment in Tuam would probably help Galway but the creation of more decentralised employment in Galway would not have the same benefit for Tuam.  Therefore, I support Senator Hussey's comments on this motion.  Tá súil agam go mbreathnóidh an tAire go báúil air seo agus go bhféachfear leis an bhfadhb iontach mór atá thart ar cheantar Thuaime maidir le dífhostaíocht a réiteach go gairid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank both Senators for their very constructive comments in relation to Tuam.  I am well aware of the situation in Tuam, I had occasion to be in Tuam on a number of occasions and I am aware of its attractions. I agree with the Senator about the infrastructure in Tuam, the amount of work that has been done and the quality of educational facilities and standards, and so on there.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put on record the success to date of the Government's decentralisation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present programme is, as Senators may be aware, based on the original list of centres selected in 1980 when decentralisation of Government Departments to provincial centres was first proposed. These centres are at Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Dundalk, Ennis, Galway, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Nenagh, Sligo and Waterford.  The decision to confine the revised programme to the centres selected in 1980 was guided by the ready availability of sites in many of these locations, and the degree of preliminary planning which had been carried out <Col N="1283" /> regarding both the accommodation required and the staff to be transferred.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 of the programme, involving Galway, Sligo, Ballina and Cavan, has been successfully completed, and while there is some time to run before the completion of the three tranches that make up Phase 2 of the programme involving the remaining eight centres, the Government's confidence and continuing commitment to the overall concept of decentralisation was recently highlighted by the announcement of the Minister for Finance of an extension to the scheme covering five additional centres countrywide &mdash; Tullamore, Wexford, Kilkenny, Longford and Cork city.  The selection of these five additional centres to benefit from this extended decentralisation programme was not an easy choice and approximately 40 locations were considered. It is unfortunate that many of the communities and towns which were considered, including Tuam, had to be disappointed on this occasion.  However, I am pleased to say, that County Galway has already benefited from the programme of decentralisation with the relocation of almost 200 staff from the Department of Defence to purpose built premises at Renmore.  As I am sure the Members of this House will appreciate, the decentralisation programme is an ambitious one.  However the Government are determined to ensure its successful implementation which will secure economic benefits to the various local communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the decentralisation programme embarked upon in 1980 is proceeding vigorously now.  The Galway, Ballina, Cavan, Sligo, Phase 1, has been successfully completed.  Construction in Athlone, Killarney and Letterkenny is well under way and is well advanced in Thurles.  We have recently tied up contracts for the Nenagh and Ennis schemes, the proposal to renovate Sarsfield House <Col N="1284" /> and to provide new accommodation at Arran Quay in Limerick is well advanced and work should be getting under way on all these schemes very soon.  Let me remind Senators that I initiated the case for decentralisation to Ennis in the early seventies.  At that time a strong case was made with back-up documentation demonstrating the facilities of Adare, organised by the Adare County Development Team.  The scheme of decentralisation was cancelled by the Coalition Government, which put back developments by five years; we are nevertheless, back on target now.</P>
    <P>The only word of encouragement I can give is that when we were disappointed in Ennis on several occasions over the past ten or 15 years we did not let that distract us from our ambition to promote Ennis and to continue to put forward the case for decentralisation to Ennis.  It is a long haul to get a development like this under way the view of the Minister is to speed up the scheme of decentralisation to the locations I have indentified.  If we can do that successfully and speedily, I have no doubt that a further scheme will be put in place at some later stage.  My only word of advice to the Senators involved is that they made a very good case; Tuam is a beautiful town, and its attractions are self-evident to anyone who has an opportunity to visit.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that Tuam has gone through a difficult time as regards the loss of employment in strategic industries but there are other agencies that must also help.  I have taken a careful note of the points made in this useful debate.  I will keep them in mind if the opportunity should ever arise for other towns to be adjudicated on for further decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 June 1990.</P>
