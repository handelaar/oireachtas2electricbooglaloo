      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The death of a young woman on Tuesday in the Women's Prison, Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The discontinuation of grants for smokeless heating conversions by virtue of the Government's refusal to make any further special central area orders with particular reference to the Crumlin, Drimnagh and Bluebell areas of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that all the necessary preparations are put in order to prepare for the policing implications of open borders post-1992, and if he will make a statement on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter: <Col N="502" /> The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately outline the future employment prospects for all our Customs officers in the light of the free trade position in the EC from 1 January 1993, and in regard to his recent announcement concerning the introduction of automatic entry processing and direct trades input, on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello, Upton, Neville, Doyle and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Costello and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Upton, Neville, Doyle and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that we take item No. 1 until 1.30 p.m. and that we take the motion on storm damage from 1.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.  I suggest that since so many people are interested in contributing to that debate that we should have a time limit of ten minutes for each speaker in order to enable as many as possible to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested to me that I might have inadvertently misled the House yesterday when I was talking on the Order of Business about the time for the Marine Institute Bill.  There was agreement by the Whips that that Bill should be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  The extension of time mentioned was within the limit of 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  I do not want to get into formulae of words, but there was agreement between the Whips. If I inadvertently misled the House by <Col N="503" /> suggesting that there should be an extension of time, I apologise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the point raised by the Leader of the House.  He misunderstands the point I made yesterday evening.  What I said on the Order of Business was that it was almost certain from the information I had that the Marine Institute Bill would not last the time allocated to it.  I then said that in view of the grave public disquiet over the incident in Mountjoy Prison it would be appropriate for this House to devote the remaining time to discuss that issue, that the Seanad had to be in a position to respond speedily to matters of grave public importance.  As it turned out, there was an hour and a half available. I was right in my prediction as to what would happen on the Marine Institute Bill.</P>
      <P>What the Leader of the House said in justification of his decision not to grant that time was for &mdash; I quote: &ldquo;It was the Opposition Whips who asked for an extension of time on this item&rdquo;.  My information is that this is not correct and that we did not ask for an extension of time on this matter.  We accepted what was proposed by the Government.  I am making the point &mdash; and I do not want to get into a wrangle over who said what because I am certain the Leader of the House acted in good faith in this matter &mdash; that we should be sufficiently flexible in our procedures, and if there is time available that we should use that time to respond to a matter of major public importance.  That is what I asked yesterday. The fact that the Dáil was able to have a full debate on this, while we were not, even though we had an hour and a half free, makes the point I was making yesterday.  I will leave the matter there. I was not imputing any bad faith to the Leader of the House.  I do not accept it was on the insistence of the Opposition that the time was extended and I have checked on this with the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise a second point on the Order of Business.  I &mdash; and I am sure many other Members of this House &mdash;<Col N="504" /> were gravely disturbed to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning a statement by the British Minister for the Environment, Mr. Patten, that on the three occasions when our Minister for the Environment has met him not once has he raised the issue of Sellafield.  We are being told here that the Government are making every effort to clear up this matter, but not once has the issue been raised.  I will be asking before the day is over for an explanation as to whether this is true, and if it is true, why?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that in view of the fact that today is International Women's Day it would be appropriate, while very good things are happening around the country organised by the various women's organisations, that perhaps the six women who are here representing one tenth of this Chamber would have a meaningful debate on an issue which is of grave consequence to women, that is the issue of the recent tragic death of a young woman in Mountjoy Prison.  I would ask the Leader of the House to consider, as a special concession, that this House make some genuine and meaningful contribution to women's day by allowing a debate on that subject in line with what Senator Maurice Manning has said.</P>

      <P>At the outset, may I thank you and compliment you on your choice of topic for the debate on the Adjournment this afternoon?  While certainly a fullscale debate would be more desirable, I have to say that I am very pleased that you have taken that initiative and made the selection you did, that is, Senator Costello's motion.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House in relation to the proposed debate on Northern Ireland if he would clarify for us whether this will be a full debate covering all aspects of Northern Ireland, or whether it is proposed to confine it to a discussion on the rail link?  May I strongly urge the Leader of the House to allow a fullscale debate on Northern Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question raised <Col N="505" /> by Senator Hederman, I would have thought that since she is one of the lady Members she might have had a motion appropriate to today on the Order Paper. If what she is suggesting had been proposed here I do not think anybody would have objected to it.  It is very late in the day to be coming in here on International Women's Day asking for a debate about women's affairs.  The subject should have been on the Order Paper.  If there is a matter the Senator wishes to raise and which is appropriate to the day that is in it, I would suggest that she get in touch with the Cathaoirleach.  She can discuss it under section 29 (4) of Standing Orders. Having said that, since she has not brought up anything except a very broad query on the day and highlighted the day &mdash; which I thank her for &mdash; it is inappropriate to be coming in here on the Order of Business asking for something like that.</P>
      <P>On the question of Northern Ireland, I said yesterday morning that the Whips will be meeting at 11 o'clock to discuss business for next week.  That is the appropriate place to consider what is to be the form of the debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and may be discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;In this section `derelict site' means any land other than agricultural land (in this section referred to as `the land in question') which in the opinion of the local authority detracts or is likely to detract to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land, buildings or a dwelling or dwellings in the neighbourhood in question because of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the existence on the land in question of a structure or structures which are in a dilapidated, ruinous or derelict condition, or</P>
      <P>(b) the neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of the land, buildings or dwellings or any other structure or structures on the land in question, or</P>
      <P>(c) the presence, deposit or collection on the land in question of any litter, rubbish, debris or waste, except where the presence, deposit or collection of such litter, rubbish, debris or waste results from the exercise of a right conferred by statute or by common law.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear about or quite satisfied with the definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo;.  In section 2 land includes any structure and any land covered with water.  It is that aspect of the Bill which I would like to have clarified, so that no misunderstanding will develop at a later stage.  I would certainly like to have included there that &ldquo;derelict site&ldquo; means any land other than agricultural land clearly specified in the Bill. For example, one could envisage a situation where tourists may be visiting some parts of rural Ireland, parts which have, for one reason or another, perhaps because of emigration, become denuded of their population.  We could have a farm which, because of emigration, has lain idle for a particular length of time.  Perhaps somebody visiting Roscommon or Offaly could come along and look at that farm, which perhaps has gone into rushes and scrub and what not, and say that that is a derelict site.  Again, I think it is important to decide and to have clearly specified who is going to deem it a derelict <Col N="509" /> site.  I think it is important to include there &ldquo;in the opinion of the local authority&rdquo;. That is the section I have difficulty with.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of taking this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my support to the point made by Senator Naughten.  In my mind at least, there is a considerable doubt if the framers of this legislation, the people who prepared and drafted it and who thought about it, ever intended to include what we describe as agricultural land within the terms of this legislation.  I want to suggest to the Minister that there are a number of types of land which possibly it was the intention to include.  These would be what is described as urban land.  That is clear enough and I have no quarrel with that. I have no quarrel with land that would be described as industrial land, or perhaps even having the potential to be industrial land or development land.</P>
      <P>In each of these three categories the problems that have been confronted in cities, towns and villages, and even in what are designated as industrial sites throughout the country, are very apparent. I accept the need to deal with the problems that have been created there and the problems that arise when these areas are being assembled or when these pieces of land are being put together for either housing or industrial or development purposes.  These are three categories of land, where I accept that there is a need for this legislation, but what I am not satisfied with is that it should apply &mdash; and this is what I want confirmation of &mdash; or has it been the intention from the start that it should apply to agricultural land?  What I describe as agricultural land &mdash; and I want to make myself quite clear on this point &mdash; are the open fields of the Irish countryside.  I will wait until I got clarification on that distinction between different lands from the Minister before I raise other points, because the points I have to raise may not be necessary depending on the Minister's reply to the queries raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The common purpose of amendments Nos. 4 and 5 is to make it clear that the reference to &ldquo;structure&rdquo; comprehends the singular as well as the plural.  I am advised that the Interpretation Act, 1937, already takes care of this.  That Act provides that &ldquo;every word importing the plural shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the singular&rdquo;. Another purpose of amendment No. 4 is to add the words &ldquo;buildings and dwellings&rdquo; to &ldquo;land&rdquo;, apparently in an attempt to amplify the meaning of &ldquo;land&rdquo;.  But, under section 2, &ldquo;land&rdquo; is already defined to include &ldquo;any structure&rdquo; and &ldquo;structure&rdquo; is defined comprehensively to include every conceivable building and, without any doubt, to include dwellings also.  I do not, therefore, see how this drafting change can be necessary.  In fact, it might only serve to cast a doubt on the generality of the existing definitions of land and structure.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 would also exclude agricultural land from the definition of a derelict site while in practice the main application of this Bill will be to urban areas.  I would not be entirely happy with this proposed exclusion.  Dumping of litter on agricultural land could obviously in some circumstances detract from the amenity of the neighbouring lands.  That is very important.  I would consider it proper that the Bill should apply to this kind of case.</P>
      <P>Finally, amendment No. 4 would give absolute status to the opinion of the local authority in deciding whether land detracted from the amenity, character or appearance of other land.  Land would stand judged as a derelict site simply because the local authority were of the opinion that it was á derelict site.  This aspect of amendment No. 4 places too much weight on the opinion of the local authority.  It would result, in my opinion, in arbitrary and unjust consequences, leading to successful challenge to the Bill in the courts.  That is the situation in regard to it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not exactly happy with the Minister's reply.  The Minister, referring to agricultural land, stated that he would not be happy with this exclusion.  I referred to the position in many parts of rural Ireland.  Again, it is the definition of &ldquo;derelict&rdquo; with regard to land that causes me a major problem.  I know from the comments expressed by the Minister for the Environment when introducing the Bill here that certainly the impression was given that agricultural land would not be included under the terms of this Bill.  What I want to ensure is that that is the situation &mdash; that they are excluded.  The Minister has gone on to say that he would not be happy with this exclusion, and that concerns me.  I appeal to him to re-examine that with a view to taking this amendment on board. He also stated that it would place too much weight on the local authorities to have the local authority make the final decision.  We may have difficulties with the local authorities on many different aspects, but I would be happier with the local authority making the decision than anybody else.  That is the reason I put down this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much for your help.  I understand that.  I have to say that, by and large, the Minister's contribution impressed me.  It is an important part of the Bill that the despoliation of agricultural land by litter and rubbish of all kinds, including sometimes the use of fields for car graveyards, does cause a serious problem, and I think his point is well made.  However, I also have an amendment to this section and I am most grateful to you for your kindness in drawing my attention to it.  It is simply a technical point.  I hope it will not be considered too nit-picking.  It is:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 33, to delete &ldquo;structures&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;structure or structures&rdquo; as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> I believe that this is possibly a flaw in drafting.  I am concerned that merely having the plural could mean that, unless there was a multiplicity of buildings involved or some kind of architectural complex, a single individual building could not come under this category.  I suggest, with the greatest respect and deference to the talents of the parliamentary draftsman, that what is intended is &ldquo;structure or structures&rdquo; rather than simply the plural &ldquo;structures&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the Minister again.  I am quite prepared to accept that he made a reasonable effort to respond to the points I raised earlier. I am still concerned and I am still seeking a yes or a no response, or as near as possible to either of those, to this simple question.  Can a field in its natural state &mdash; excluding dumping or anything else &mdash; through neglect by its owner &mdash; neglect by way of the growing of rushes or undergrowth, or anything else, without buildings, structures or dumping on it, have the capacity to become a derelict site within the meaning of this legislation? As I have said, I am talking about a field in the countryside without buildings, without structures or without dumping. Through the progression, as it were, of natural forces, can it become a derelict site within the meaning of this legislation? That is the bone of contention I have and it is a matter I want clarified.  Either it can or it cannot be so classified.  If it cannot, then I have no further argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Senator is saying on that.  I have a great knowledge of rural areas because I am from a rural area myself.  In the rural areas all over the country we build or the local authorities build rural houses, some would call them isolated cottages.  Say, for instance, on that part of the land there was dumping on the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, no problem there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that has to be cleared up.  I want to be fair about that. <Col N="513" /> Dumping can take place anywhere on any land in rural areas.  Agricultural land could be used as dumping ground if it suited.  I am sorry to say that in parts of the country that is a fact of life.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Norris's query about singular and plural, the definition of the wording the Senator is concerned about, our draftsmen, or personnel, are of the opinion that the drafting that has been done on this is correct.  I am quoting from the Interpretation Act, 1937.  It says: &ldquo;Every word importing the singular shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the plural; and every word importing the plural shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the singular&rdquo;.  I want to put you at ease here, Senator.  I know what you are at.  You want to make sure that what we are saying is correct.  I have looked at that, even over the weekend, and sought a legal interpretation of it.  I am satisfied that the wording we have is correct.  I am glad the Senator brought it to our attention.  I want to say that we are happy with the legal interpretation, that of the draftsmen and the other legal advice we have got on that.  I am happy that the wording there is correct.</P>
      <P>To get back to the question of dumping on agricultural land, this could happen anywhere.  You could have a group of houses.  You could have cars or other goods brought in, crashed or otherwise, and placed in an agricultural field in front or close to houses.  That has to be attended to.  The main purpose of this Bill now is to clean up our act.  Everyone in this House, including Senator Howard, would like to see this being done.  I want to make it clear that I am not agreeing to the amendments put down by Senators Howard and Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always happy to deal in a reasonable and positive way with any legislation that comes before the House.  I believe that our function is to examine legislation in depth and avoid pitfalls, if we see pitfalls, and to endeavour to improve it.  I want to say, with the greatest respect to the Minister, that I <Col N="514" /> asked a question about a field in the countryside, a field without dumping of cars or anything else.  The question I asked was if that particular land has the capacity to become a derelict site in its own way without the presence of any other material on it.  That is what I am not getting the answer to.  In the absence of getting an assurance that that will not be case, I must come to the conclusion that the fears I hold have a certain justification.</P>
      <P>I want to put a further point to the Minister.  I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity here in dealing with the queries raised.  The Minister is interested in ensuring that we are all happy about the legislation that will emerge from here. But I think I would be forgiven if I was to say that there appears to be some movement in the background of all this to mislead us and to mislead the country in relation to it.  Take Minister Flynn's speech here and the explanatory memorandum that was circulated with this Bill, it talks about dereliction, that this legislation is to deal with it in our cities, towns and villages; but it ignores the fact that there is the possibility there, intentional or otherwise, that the open fields of this countryside can be included within it.  That is my problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the problem caused by dumping.  I accept that.  I would suggest to the Minister that that is taken care of in section 3 (c) &mdash;&ldquo;the presence, deposit or collection on the land in question of any litter, rubbish, debris or waste ...&rdquo; That is acceptable.  But I am still seeking clarification on the point I raised. The problem could arise under paragraph (b) &mdash;&ldquo;the neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of land...&rdquo; That is as far as I am concerned to go.  I am quite happy about the remainder of that line, &ldquo;or any structures on the land in question&rdquo;. I am quite prepared to accept that structures should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation I am trying to safeguard against is this.  The Minister is from rural Ireland, I accept that.  I am from further west in rural Ireland.  Perhaps my countryside has been affected more by the ravages of emigration and so on than <Col N="515" /> the Minister's area.  I know of pieces of small holdings of land which are owned by people who are now scattered in the cities of the United Kingdom, the USA or even further afield, people who are putting together the means of returning and perhaps even bringing up their families in the homestead.  That land I am referring to, particularly on the hillsides of the west, unless it is farmed properly day in, day out, or year in, year out, has the capacity to become neglected and unsightly for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>I am asking a simple question.  In the absence of that landowner, forced through social and economic circumstances to leave it behind but determined to return, can that land in the opinion of the appropriate officer at local authority level come to be described as a derelict site?  If it can, then we are into the situation where sections 14 and 20 will apply to it, where the land can actually be compulsorily acquired.  I think that is an unreasonable hardship to impose on the unfortunate people who have been forced to leave it.  I am not talking about dumping cars or leaving rubbish on the land. I am asking whether land which in the absence of its owner can take on a neglected appearance, is open to being subjected to the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his very clear and lucid explication of the point.  When I saw him rising to speak a horrid thought assailed me.  With my recollection of the Interpretation Act and the fact that I have a Bill amending it with regard to sexist language and the fact that the male pronoun is assumed also to include the female, I thought that this might in fact be his explanation.  I am, as always, illuminated by the Minister's response and I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, however, to say that I take a somewhat different view from Senator Howard on the question of whether or not a field can be derelict because I do not think that it is essential that dereliction should consist exclusively of industrial or domestic refuse.  The Minister, I am sure, <Col N="516" /> as somebody who, as he has indicated to the House, is intimately connected with rural life, will know that wilderness can also contain prescribed plants.  I think in particular of things like buachaláin. Suppose I was a farmer or somebody with a small house, perhaps a nice local authority cottage.  Suppose I was one of the persons, about whom Senator Howard spoke so appropriately and so movingly, who was saving up the money in England and assembling a site at home but had made no proper provision for its care while out of the country, leading to a situation where proscribed plants of various kinds did proliferate.  There would be a nuisance caused to the neighbouring property.  Therefore, I actually hope that a field can in certain circumstances be a derelict site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, if I might say so, has put the picture exactly as I feared.  I would like to quote an example. Suppose Senator Norris was to transport himself from his natural surroundings in Mountjoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>North Great George's Street.  If he was suddenly to decide that a vacation or a term in County Leitrim, for example, would do him good in various ways, he has just to transport himself down there.  I can easily visualise him emerging some morning, expanding his chest and saying: &ldquo;That field out there is horrible&rdquo;.  He would, perhaps, they try to seek to have that included in the register of derelict sites.  If the appropriate officer in, for example, Leitrim County Council, was of similar mind in relation to this, then we go straight into the process of compulsory acquisition, disposal of property and so on.  That is exactly the scene I fear.  Senator Norris put it <Col N="517" /> perfectly clearly.  I believe that that is the attitude that can cause problems.</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by raising another point.  The Minister may not feel like responding to it on this particular part of the Bill.  In relation to the rural fields and the countryside, I notice that there is only one Land Act referred to in regard to this legislation, that is, the 1845 Act.  Many other Land Acts came into being during the remainder of that century and in the earlier part of this one.  I believe that not alone will we find ourselves in conflict with a number of these in relation to rural land but we may also find ourselves with a constitutional problem. I believe we will face that later. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to discuss it under sections 14 and 20.</P>
      <P>I have made the point, and Senator Norris has helped me to make it.  Unless the Minister can say to me in regard to a rural field, as I have described it and as Senator Norris also understands it to be, that it is not intended that that should be included within the terms of this legislation, then I can only say that I would be unhappy with section 3 remaining as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, if I may, to be a little bit more helpful to Senator Howard, because I like to be helpful. He has interpreted what I was thinking absolutely.  I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that a derelict field is a derelict field.  I would like to say why. This can happen in fact not only to derelict land; it can occur not only in the countryside but also in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard very graciously referred to the fact that I live in the north inner city.  One of the houses beside me is a defelict site and is in danger of pulling my house down.  It also contains a derelict plot of land and from that experience I can tell the Minister that land with no structure whatever upon it is quite capable of inflicting damage to the neighbouring property, not only through the proliferation of noxious plants as I have already mentioned, some of which are proscribed, but also because, as has happened in my house, building adjoining <Col N="518" /> the land can be undermined by the development of sycamore trees, which have a strong root system and which can fall on buildings.</P>
    <P>We are going to have a debate, I understand, this afternoon about the recent storms.  One of the things that occurs during storms is that trees are blown down onto adjoining property.  You can also have a situation where plant life, either in the form of creepers or of stronger trees, can actually interfere with, for example, essential elements like roofs and gutters.</P>
    <P>I maintain that in the country, for example, if somebody has the kind of house that the Minister has been talking about and the site next door to that property is allowed to go derelict then it could quite easily happen that damage would be caused to that property by the neglect of the absent owner.  I do not wish to be facetious but it strikes me as somewhat strange that the rights of absentee landlords should be upheld in this House of the Oireachtas.  I am sure the Minister agrees with me that the rights of the people who are actually continuing to live on the land and to struggle with those circumstances are far more important.  I hope he can confirm that both Senator Howard and I are right.  I will be pleased, even if Senator Howard is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way that could arise is if it took the amenity from an estate or took from the character of the area.  I am fully convinced that the landowners and the property owners will take account of this, even if people are in England or America.  I had a very interesting case in my own area where there was a derelict building and the owners could not be found for years.  The local authority had to take emergency action but they were not in an hour when the owners were ringing me.  They came to light very <Col N="519" /> quickly.  The Senator is underestimating the intelligence of people.</P>
      <P>I do not see a problem with agricultural land in the normal state.  The problem is where there is dumping deliberately done.  If it is overgrown with lamb's quarter, robin-run-the-hedge as they call it down in the country, that comes under the Noxious Weeds Act and the necessary action can be taken there. When this Bill comes into law, I expect all of them to highlight what is at stake. We need goodwill here and I am sure it will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Minister has come a long way to meet the situation there.  I am pleased that, when he dealt with the question of land in its natural state, it was his opinion that it could not very easily be described as a derelict site. I expressed my fears as strongly as I could.  I believe he has accepted the sincerity behind the points I have seen making.  Could I suggest to the Minister that perhaps between now and the Report Stage he might look at the fears I have been expressing and see if it is possible to include a safeguard of some kind in relation to agricultural land in its natural state.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get involved in the nitty gritty of this debate. The two Senators here beside me have done that very adequately.  The Minister says a great deal of goodwill is required and I accept that.  I always believe that the approach of the carrot is much better and more effective than the stick but, unfortunately, it does not always deal with the recalcitrant landowner who simply does not care.  Sadly, we have to admit there are some of these about.  We would not need this Bill at all if it were not for the fact that there are landowners <Col N="520" /> who simply do not care about creating dereliction and unsightly areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister says we need a great deal of goodwill; he says he is depending on landowners to see that all is right.  That is correct for the vast majority of them but legislation such as this is a waste of time unless we are certain we can pinpoint the really bad offenders who simply do not care and who will not spend a farthing to improve their property unless they are simply forced to do it.  In my opinion, that is what the Bill is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues were raised there.  The question of buachaláin was raised by Senator Norris and the Minister quite rightly said we have an Act regulating noxious weeds.  The question of indiscriminate dumping was raised. We would want to refer to our planning Act and to see that in each local authority we have an enforcement section to ensure that indiscriminate dumping does not take place.  An action can be taken against the landowner in this instance.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised an important point.  I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on the point made about trees and the danger from trees.  What about the instance of trees overhanging onto public roadways?  In the recent past there have been three deaths in the Cork area where trees have fallen on cars and killed people.  I understand from the local authorities they can write to these landowners and indicate to them that these trees are unsafe.  Does the Minister think that where there are trees in an unsafe condition that site could be termed a derelict site?  The difficulty that now arises with the local authority is that while they can write to a landowner to remove dangerous trees, if the landowner refuses a situation then arises as to how can you prove in a court of law that trees are in a dangerous condition.  I would like to ask the Minister if he envisages that something like this could be covered under derelict sites.</P>

In regard to trees, which the Senator mentioned, especially now with the high gales, They are a matter of grave concern to all the people in the country.  We had bad accidents with fallen trees.  The local authorities have powers under the Road Traffic Act to take the necessary action there.  If I was allowed to go on I could elaborate on that.  I fully sympathise with the Senators in their concern over agricultural land.  I am fully satisfied that what we are doing here is adequate to cover all that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important point and I am very glad that a Member on the Government benches, Senator O'Keeffe, was kind enough to see the point I was making and to support it.  The Minister has introduced the question of the Road Traffic Act.  Although it may not be directly germane to this Bill I believe it is very relevant.  The Minister or his advisers may be able to put us in possession of the information.  Does this, in fact, cover a situation where the trees do not directly threaten a road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can have a situation, for example, at the back of a house where the proliferation and growth of trees can occur. The reason I say this is not all frivolous or tendentious, because in a previous incarnation I possessed property on which there was a very large old tree which the telephone people wanted me to cut down and being a difficult, obstinate sort of person I absolutely refused. I had it attended to by a tree surgeon. They invoked all kinds of powers which <Col N="522" /> it subsequently turned out they did not have.  I could thumb my nose at them. I am not completely satisfied that the various items in legislation mentioned by the Government completely close off the loopholes.  I quite accept we have the Noxious Weeds Act on the one hand to get rid of buachaláin, robin-run-the-hedge and all these kinds of things.  We have the Road Traffic Act which, I presume, only affects trees within a certain distance of a road.  I am not sure, I could be quite incorrect on that.  I would like the Derelict Sites Act to continue to operate in this matter.  It is appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would much prefer that we proceeded with a good deal of caution in relation to section 6.  That deals with the serving of notices.  I am not aware of any other legislation that enables notices served that could have so serious an impact on a person and his property, to be served with the force of law in such a loose fashion.  There has always to be the presumption, even though the owner is unknown.  I am at a certain disadvantage here because of the experience the Minister had with the owner of a certain building in his constituency.  I am afraid I will be continually confronted with that example as I deal with this issue on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section prescribes the various ways that the notice can be served.  It can be served by delivering it to the person. That is simple.  It is delivered to him and that is it.  We know who he is and he has got it.  It is his responsibility from there on.  It can also be served by leaving it at <Col N="524" /> the address at which he ordinarily resides. In a case where an address for service has been furnished we are fairly safe down that road but there is always the possibility that during the period of service required, if the person was not to be present there would be always doubt that the person had emigrated, gone on holidays, or gone camping.  There would be always the danger that he might not have received it within the appropriate period to enable him to take defensive action.  Nonetheless, it is reasonable and I would not have any great quarrel with it.</P>
    <P>You can send it by registered letter to the address at which he ordinarily resides or to an address for service which has been furnished.  Then we arrive at paragraph (d) which states &ldquo;where the address at which he ordinarily resides cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, by delivering it to some person over 16 years of age, resident in or employed on the land to which the notice relates&rdquo;.  That is acceptable.  There is not a clue in the first one, &ldquo;cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry where the person resides&rdquo;. The paragraph then states &ldquo;or by affixing it in a conspicuous position on or near such lands&rdquo;.  This goes back to the point that I raised earlier.  Take the owner who is out of the country, forced by economic circumstances to go.  Suppose he is on an oil rig in some remote part of an ocean, suppose he is in the outback in Canada, suppose, to the horror of Senator Norris, he is cutting down a forest in the Amazon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not justice and fair play.  We have to provide for these types of situations.  Here the Minister is not doing it.  In the cases I have mentioned it would be unreasonable to assume, whether he is in the Amazon, the outack, or on an oil rig, that there is a hope that that person will be aware that the notice has been posted in a conspicuous position on or near the land in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> We move on to subsection (2) which states:</P>
    <P>Where the name of the owner or of the occupier (as the case may be) cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, a notice may be addressed to &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; or &ldquo;the occupier&rdquo; (as the case may be without naming him.</P>
    <P>That is taking a flier at the whole situation. I would say that to expect that that type of service would stand up in a court of law is stretching credibility to the limit. Let us read it again:</P>
    <P>Where the name of the owner or of the occupier (as the case may be) cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, a notice may be addressed to &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; or &ldquo;the occupier&rdquo; (as the case may be) without naming him.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure us that that will stand up in a court of law?  With regard to that system of serving notice on a person who is absent, are we satisfied that it would be adequate in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of the courts?  Are we satisfied that we are acting with reason, justice and fair play to all concerned?  We are serving notice to the owner without naming him.  We do not know who he is. That is stretching credibility to the limit. Perhaps there may be another building in the Minister's constituency that would provide the answer to it.  I believe we are over-reaching ourselves on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree strongly with Senator Howard on this and support as vigorously as possible what the Minister is doing here.  It is about time that we had this kind of legislation.  I congratulate him on introducing it.  The provisions are absolutely correct.  I say, as a property owner, that property not only has its rights, which are guaranteed under the Constitution, it also has its very largely unenumerated responsibilities.  I am very glad that this legislation is beginning, for the first time, to specify what some of those responsibilities and obligations, both moral and legal, are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it the Minister is addressing here the difficulty of serving <Col N="526" /> notice.  I am astonished at this concern for absentee landlords in view of the history of this country.  The Minister is addressing the frequent, deliberate evasion of the service of notices on the one hand.  This is true not only with regard to traffic violations, parking fines all this kind of thing.  It is certainly equally true in the situation of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>One simply has to ask if this colleague of Senator Howard is off cutting down the Amazon or sheep farming in Australia, why precisely should that give him a right to interfere with the decent people who have the guts and &ldquo;stickability&rdquo; to weather it out on this damp, moist little island of ours where they will get rheumatism? I nearly said I have damn all sympathy but that might not be quite parliamentary &mdash; I have microscopic sympathy for these people.  The Minister in this legislation is actually giving some teeth to it, I hope he actually sharpens his fangs.  My problem, with this legislation is not that it is too strict but that it has not a lot of teeth in the right place.  I sincerely hope that he retains these provisions. They seem to be absolutely appropriate.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister and the House generally to address a rhetorical question? If there is no identifiable owner and if the local authority and the local people have not the slightest notion who the owner is, if the people responsible in that area do not know who it is, if the neighbours do not know who it is, if the local gardaí do not know who it is, if the local parish priest does not know who it is, is that not a very tenuous connection with the property upon which to try to establish rights?</P>
    <P>Is it not appropriate that that person should be served with a notice in whatever way is possible?  It may well flush that person out of the woodwork.  It if does, so much for the better.  The rights which in my opinion take precedence absolutely are the rights of the unfortunate people who have to put up with this dereliction.  I am very glad the Minister has this section.  I certainly will not be opposing it, I will be encouraging him to maintain it.  Senator Howard did a very good job in reading onto the record, not <Col N="527" /> once, but twice, several of the paragraphs but he omitted the final two subsections (3) and (4).  I am very happy that they should continue as well because the Minister, in subsection (3) for example, is dealing not only with the question of defaulting individuals, he is also dealing with the use of companies &mdash; in my opinion there are fraudulent companies &mdash; as a barrier to prosecution; I am very glad that he gets not only at individuals but at companies and then, finally, tries to make it fair by suggesting that in those instances, where notice is served by the affixing of a notice in a prominent visable position, it is an offence for anybody to tamper with it.  This is another of the cute little tricks.  If a notice is pasted, posted up or pinned on a property then the owner may well come in the middle of the night, pull it down and say: &ldquo;I never saw that&rdquo;.  The Minister is perfectly right. I hope he absolutely slams the head of these amendments.  He will have my full support if he does.</P>

      <P>To follow on Senator Norris's point, one of the great weaknesses up to now has been the fact that we have been unable to track down absentee landlords and unable to get our teeth or fangs into them.  This section now gives power to the local authority to tackle this problem.  I have more sympathy for those people who are living next to dereliction than anybody who is absenting himself from it.  Is not the service of notice here totally in compliance with the serving of notice under the Planning Act, and, indeed, under the Air Pollution Act?</P>

      <P>This was highlighted in my mind, perhaps I misinterpreted it in some way, by Senator Norris referring to the history of absentee landlords in this country.  What I am concerned about are the people who are victims, or whose forefathers were victims of that system. People who, through economic circumstances, were forced to leave rural Ireland, do not deserve to be lumped with the absentee landlords of a previous age.  To do so, is doing an injustice to them.  I accept there is the problem in urban areas.  Indeed, I would go quite a distance down the road with the methods proposed in the Bill of notifying the owners, because I believe where valuable property is concerned the owners are not too far away.  Certainly, they are within distance of being able to establish what may be intended for their derelict sites. I know they have caused derelication but I am still concerned about serving a notice on somebody who, through economic circumstances, has been forced to leave some part of this country and who, for reasons which are quite unfortunate, may be so far away and so out of contact that he may not hear of the service of notice before the implications of sections 14 and 20 of this legislation are in place.  I have no quarrel with the scene in the urban areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While that view is being expressed, we are arguing about two totally different scenes.  If Senator O'Keeffe <Col N="529" /> and Senator Norris were from the counties that both I and the Leas-Cathaoirleach come from they would have a completely different understanding of the situation that can prevail.  If Senator O'Keeffe was more familiar with the western and the north-western sides of his own county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I totally accept, in fact I support the reaction against those who are allowing valuable property to become derelict for the purpose of making it more valuable, but I am talking about a different situation.  I am asking the Minister, who I believe knows what I am talking about, to look at the particular problems that can arise.</P>
      <P>The other point I raised earlier which was lost sight of because the rural-urban misunderstanding come on the scene, was the whole question of the constitutionality and the legality of service of notice should be looked at.  All I want is to be satisfied on the constitutional requirements, and the likelihood that this type of service of notice in relation to what may eventually become the confiscation of property.  Let us not avoid facing up to that fact that under section 14 and 20 there is actual confiscation of property.</P>

      <P>Again, we will argue that when we come to the section.  These are the points that I want to make.  I believe there is an urban-rural misunderstanding and we seem to be at cross-purposes.  We are not, because I accept that problems exist in the urban areas while the urban people do not accept the problems that exist in the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly about the provisions of the Bill.  These are standard provisions in the Planning Act and in the Air Pollution Act.  I understand urban life well and I understand rural life very well.  This section deals with a person or persons who own property. Would anyone here like to have a derelict site beside his property?  If he wished to sell it, it would gravely devalue the property.  It would also look very bad to see a derelict building in an urban, or even in a rural, area.  I understand that Senator Howard does not want that to happen.</P>
      <P>If a person is on a ship, and is known to be on the ship, he will get the letter on the ship.  We have great communications at present.  I am a long time in public life and I have a good knowledge of grassroots communications.  There is no site that I have ever seen where there is not an owner.  He comes out overnight. I can assure the House that if you put up a notice on a property let the owner be in Australia or wherever, he will surface very quickly.  The next minute he will be coming back and asking: &ldquo;What is it worth?&rdquo; Under the provisions of the Bill we will not acquire it unless it does not comply with the Act.  But if the owners, wherever they are, clean up that area, then the local authority will not put a compulsory purchase order on it unless it is required for other purposes, such as road widening.  Even if the person cannot be found, that money has to be paid into the court, the CPO has to go on it.  If the person is known to the local authority, he has great options: he can go to arbitration on the CPO, or to the courts.  We have great law, thank God for that, under our Constitution.  I know from putting Bills through both Houses that we have a right to go to the Supreme Court to get a ruling on any of the sections.  We are bringing the provisions of the Bill into line to comply with the Planning Act and the Air Pollution Act.  The same standard arrangements are being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some reservations about the assertion that the owner cannot be traced.  Generally, when a person leaves an area they always have a fellow down <Col N="531" /> the road who keeps an eye on things-&ldquo;There is my forwarding address, but don't tell anyone&rdquo;.  If a local authority or any individual goes to trespass on the property the owner will be around very quickly.  The law provides for all of that. In cases where a person cannot be found, the notice goes on the site for a statutory period.  It complies with the same provisions in the Planning Act and the Air Pollution Act.  It is very simple.</P>
    <P>The main kinds of dereliction that take place are mostly caused by abandonment and dis-occupation of buildings, coupled with problems of title than can also exacerbate the problem.  It is, therefore, essential that we make provision in a Derelict Sites Bill to deal with situations where persons cannot be traced.  The provisions involved in any event are standard, based on the Planning Acts and the Air Pollution Act and local government environmental regulations.  I am not going to stand up any more to reply to any of this because &mdash; do not take me out of context &mdash; I am sticking to the provisions of the Bill.  I have very strong views on this.  The Bill is being brought forward to do a job.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard may not have meant to go so far, when he said we were trying to bring in draconian laws going back to landlordism.  It is nothing like that.  I am going to clean up those derelict sites in rural and urban areas.  There is going to be no tomfoolery; dereliction will be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say how very glad I am to hear the Minister's vigorous assertion of the principles that underlie this and his illustration that rather than doing something completely novel he is simply implementing provisions that exist in parallel and analogous legislation. That is an absolutely convincing argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I address myself to the situation that exists, of some difference between Senator Howard and myself?  I take an interest in the totality of the experience of persons in this country.  I am very glad to say that, like most citizens of Dublin <Col N="532" /> or Cork, my rural roots go down a very good way and I am glad to say I am still in contact with relatives in the country.</P>
    <P>I think I understand what Senator Howard is getting at, and it may affect the western seaboard more than most of the other sections of the country, but it certainly exists there as well.  What the Senator is talking about is sentiment. What he is addressing is people who may have been pushed out because of economic conditions and hardships and, of course, one feels sympathy for them. They wish to keep some sentimental family attachment to the homestead, a tumbledown cottage or whatever it is and while they are serving their cocktails in Manhattan or the Bronx or whatever, they dream every evening of the little thatched cottage by the Shannon or the Lee or underneath the Twelve Pins &mdash; one understands that &mdash; but why should the people who remain have to suffer because it is a sentimental connection and not a real one.  The Minister is absolutely right to put this section to the House, he will have my support in so doing.</P>

      <P>I have moved the amendment in the name of Senator Naughten. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure, not alone the presence of the register in the office of the local authorities but to ensure that it is available and open to the public for inspection. That is normal and standard practice. The fact that provision has not been included in the section to guarantee the availability of such a register may have been an oversight.  It is for that purpose we have put down the amendment.  I am sure the Minister will have little difficulty in disposing of my fears in relation to the availability of the register to members of the general public at the office of the relevant local authority during office hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important amendments I have put down. It reads:</P>
      <P>Sites shall be entered on the derelict sites register upon any application made by any citizen or representative body which satisfies the criteria laid down in this Act.</P>
      <P>One of the things that causes me most disquiet in the Bill is that I am not aware of machinery by which a private individual or a concerned and appropriate group could have recourse to this legislation without relying on the umbrella of the good intentions of the local authority.  As the Minister has illustrated with his very charming and very appropriate and relevant story, local authorities may be a little anonymous, but when a notice is put on a building this will very rapidly bring out the local person and local knowledge may be very important.  If we are talking about a county council or a corporation, such a body in a large city may not have the same minute knowledge or the same motivating energy as the individual who lives next door to a site or a building that is going derelict. For that reason it is extremely important that the individual citizen should have the right of direct recourse to whatever machinery is contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would have to say &mdash; although it is not actually directly covered by this amendment but it is related to it &mdash; I think it a pity that in the framework of this Bill it was not found possible to establish an independent authority to deal entirely with this area &mdash; a kind of derelict sites authority or a court of appeal to which a citizen might make recourse. However, in the absence of this &mdash; and I accept that it would be unfair for me to dwell at any great length on something that is not contained either in the Bill or in an amendment &mdash; I think it is absolutely vital that the ordinary citizen can go directly to whatever machinery exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the area of the city in which I live has been mentioned, I am very happy to extend an invitation to the Minister to come with me to North Great Georges' Street and to see the house next door to <Col N="535" /> me, a List One house, which has been allowed to go derelict.  The back windows are out, there is a brothel in the basement, the back wall is held up by a raking shore but the owner has done absolutely nothing.  It could pull my house down with it if it collapses.  I have somebody in the background who is prepared, at the moment, to pay a market price for that house and use the skills he has to restore it completely.  This is one of Senator Howard's absentees who is a decent Dubliner, who is an authority on the restoration of 18th century buildings and has written two major works on it.  He is prepared to realise his property in London, come back, pay above the odds for this house and restore it, and still the owners will not release it onto the market.  It is one of about three hundred properties they own.  The Minister and the Cathaoirleach, I am sure, will both excuse me for speaking with some passion on this.  I want something done about it and today I cordially extend an invitation to the Minister to come with me and see that house.  I could show him a great deal more around the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I, as an individual, have appealed to the corporation, to the dangerous buildings section under the Factories Act.  I have done everything I can and yet nothing whatever has been done about it.  This is a shame and it is a scandal.  As a citizen, as a resident of the north inner city of Dublin if, as an individual citizen, I had had recourse to this kind of legislation, I would have walloped the Dublin Vocational Education Committee right into the dock over what they have done to No. 20, North Great Georges' Street and to Nos. 18 and 19, Parnell Square.  I look for a real assurance from the Minister that the individual citizen be catered for and not just the local authority.  I do not want to be attacking local authorities; I know the very valuable work they often do but they are an enormous operation and they do not have anything like the passion or the motivation of the person who is actually living next door to the disaster area.</P>

      <P>I would like to support both these amendments we are discussing now.  Amendment No. 7 in the name of Senator Liam Naughten is quite straightforward.  It is simply saying that the register should be available for public inspection.  I think that is very important. I know in relation to the register which local authorities are supposed to keep under the Housing Act, registering houses which are in two or more flats, that sometimes the local authorities &mdash; being very over-worked, under-paid, under-staffed and everything else &mdash; find it difficulty to keep all these registers up to date.  It is imperative that the public have access to these registers to see what properties are registered, whether it is under the Housing Act or here under this measure.  I support the amendment.</P>
      <P>The other amendment which we are discussing, which is in the names of Senators Norris, Costello and myself is that: &ldquo;Sites shall be entered on the derelict sites register upon any application made by any citizen or representative body which satisfies the criteria laid down...&rdquo;  This is extremely important and valuable.  I remember last week when we were discussing this, the Minister with some passion, and indeed supported by Senator Howard and some others, disagreed on that occasion with Senator Norris and myself.  He was all on for giving power to the lowest possible level, power to the local authorities, and power to the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was involved last year in the promotion of the Tidy Towns Competition. I became aware that Dublin is not the only place that has problems with dereliction, although I would say our problems are greater than others.  Every other big city &mdash; Limerick, Galway, Cork &mdash; has the problem but also quite small villages are trying to bring pride to their <Col N="537" /> locality and trying to get the whole community to work together.  As the Minister said, goodwill is needed, and he is right. They find themselves with dreadful eyesores which are as much a blot of their lovely village as all the dereliction we have in Dublin is on our environment. It is an excellent idea.  I am all for the promotion of involvement of local people and bringing them into the system rather than excluding them from it which, sadly, our present system of government does to a large extent.  I believe this amendment which would allow the citizens the right to have a site which clearly met the criteria entered on the register is an extremely good move.  I cannot see any reason why it should not be encouraged.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Norris's invitation to the Minister to go to North Great George's Street to see the example to which he is referring, I would like to tell him I got in first.  I want to remind him that on the occasion the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, was here on the presentation of this Bill to the House I invited him to come with me on a tour on the topless bus.  I told him if he had 35 or 40 minutes, which would be quite adequate, I would take him, not only to North Great George's Street but I would give him a quick tour around to see the dereliction in this city caused by the inner tangent road and by other massive road proposals.  I would like to say to Senator Norris and to whatever Minister is coming, I hope it will be first of all to see the terrible overall situation in this city, and we can end up in North Great George's Street and have a look at that house.  That is a serious offer I know from Senator Norris, and it is a serious offer from me.  I really believe the Minister is committed.  I can see from the intensity, the passion and the sentiment with which he is reponding to this discussion, that he is genuinely interested and I can think of no better way that he could spend 30 minutes.  It would be most illuminating for him although I do not for one moment suggest the Minister is not very familiar with Dublin.  I have to tell him that unless he actually starts at a particular spot with <Col N="538" /> somebody who can bring him around and say: &ldquo;These are where the road proposals have been for the last 35 or 40 years&rdquo; that he can suddenly realise the full impact of what these lines on th map have done to the city.  I have lived in Dublin all my life, I have been on the city council 16 years and I am ashamed to say, it is only within the last few years that the full impact of it struck me.  I know the Minister is concerned about this matter and I urge him to allow Senator Norris and myself an opportunity to take him on a tour of Dublin.  He will not regret it.</P>

      <P>I am appalled at the vista being opened up, of the Minister being whisked by Senator Hederman on top of a topless bus.  It sounds like the most extreme depravity.  I hesitate to get involved but I have to say it is a splendid idea to take the Minister round and I would very happily engage with Senator Hederman in the competition as to who asked whom first.  I might point out, that I issued a similar invitation during the last Seanad.  It is such a good idea that a number of people have it simultaneously and I very much hope the Minister will graciously accede.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to create a greater public involvement in the procedures by which land will be entered on the derelict sites register. Amendment No. 7 would open to the public all representations by landowners against their land being entered on the derelict sites register.  Amendment No. 8a would require a local authority to enter a site on the register where an application to this effect was made by any other person, representative, organisation or body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind Senators that the establishment of a derelict sites register, for which section 8 provides, is in itself a commitment to open government in the administration of this Bill.  A local authority will be obliged to maintain a register of all land in their area which, in their opinion, is derelict.  They will have to enter details of this land on the register, including particulars of action taken <Col N="539" /> by them.  The entire register will be made available for public inspection at the offices of the local authority at all times during office hours.</P>
    <P>This public register of derelict sites will serve a number of purposes.  In the case of urban land, liability for the derelict sites levy will automatically follow from entry in the derelict sites register.  The register will also inform prospective new property owners that land is formally classified as a derelict site, with all of the liabilities and obligations which this will entail.  Most importantly, the derelict sites register will stand as a public indication and reminder of the extent of the dereliction in a local authority area.  If any interested member of the public, any representative or any member of a local authority wishes to make representations that the register does not adequately list all the derelict sites, then it will be fully open to them to do this.  However, as the Bill stands, it is the judgment of the local authority which will decide whether, having regard to all the arguments put forward, a property should be entered in the derelict sites register.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 would change this position and require sites to be entered on the register on the application of third parties, provided that the application satisfied the criteria laid down by the Act.  I should point out, first, that the amendment is technically defective because it does not spell out what these criteria should be.  More importantly, the amendment would contravene natural justice in that it makes no provision for hearing the landowner's side of the case. I do not think anyone would like that to be the case.</P>
    <P>The real intention behind both amendments is that the policing of the derelict sites control should, in some formal way, involve the public at large and not just the local authority.  I have some difficulties with this idea.  Section 9 of the Bill places a duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to keep their land from becoming derelict.  By contrast, section 10 places a much wider duty on local authorities to <Col N="540" /> take all reasonable steps to keep all land in their areas from becoming derelict.  In other words, the primary responsibility of individual landowners is for their own land, but local authorities are clearly required to concern themselves with the state of all properties in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes local authorities in a special way as guardians and protectors of the public interest in relation to dereliction. I do not think it would be practical for them to share this responsibility formally with private persons or representatives' organisations.  As I have said, there will be nothing to prevent persons or bodies making representations to the local authorities and nothing to prevent them making representations on any aspect of the administration of this Bill, including the derelict sites and the register.  I would expect the existence of the register to encourage this process.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated, I would not be prepared to give shared powers to the public in relation to entry on the register.  If I may now elaborate, what we are doing here is giving powers to the local authority and to the members, as Senator Howard said last week on this debate.  The local authority, or corporation, will be responsible and compelled under this Bill to keep a register of all of these.  If I am going to buy a site, I or my legal representative should check with the register in that local authority area that the site is not in the register.  I want to put this on record.  I am not a legal man but I understand a good bit about it.  If you go to buy a site you would want to make sure that there is not a liability on it under the register.  It is very important.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record now that when this Bill comes into law a certificate will be required, in my opinion, from the local authority of the functional area because if you buy a site, pay your money and then find out it is in the register, you could be liable to a compulsory order. You would want to see the register to ascertain the position.  If it is a cleaningup operation that is different.  You can communicate with the local authority and <Col N="541" /> they will decide and give you the clearance. That is why I want to spell that out. Do not take me out of context.  Ordinary people might not realise this.  They might say afterwards to public representatives that it was not explained, that &ldquo;We did not know&rdquo;.  I am explaining it now in the simplest way I can, without any legal garbage.  I am explaining in very simple language what has to be done.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the register, the local authority will keep a register in their area. It is open to any person to write in, or to communicate with elected representatives, if they so wish, to point out an area, a location or site, whatever the case may be.  They can inform the local authority.  But I have no doubt now.  I think you may be underestimating the local authority a little.</P>
    <P>In the Midlands they are very competent. Their area engineers and area officials who work for the local authorities know the areas quite well.  I do not see a problem here.  The local authority members will be involved also.  People have the right to let the local authority know about this.  The local authority will be involved in the compiling of the register. I do not want to get too many fingers in the pie because that does not work out, as you know.  That is why I am satisfied with this wording of the Bill and satisfied that it will operate.</P>
    <P>I understand the sentiments of the Senators also.  I have to be fair.  I do not think you need to worry now in regard to this.  We are giving teeth now to the local authority.  For the first time they are getting a wonderful opportunity here.  In this Bill I am giving power to the members of the local authorities.  They were crying out for it so long, saying that power was all in the Custom House, or in O'Connell Bridge House, whatever way you like to put it.  Now we are bringing it back down to the corporations and the local authorities. I have explained this in as much as I possibly can.  I appreciate the Members' views also.  I am satisfied with what we have in the Bill.  I have given a lot of thought in the last week to all the sections we will be coming to.  I know where I am going in this.  Do not take me out of <Col N="542" /> context but I am satisfied with the wording of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is as always, interesting but I think his response in this instance is disappointing, and I regret that.  He says, for example, that individuals can make representations.  Of course they can.  It only costs the price of an envelope, writing instrument and stamp. It does not guarantee that the local authorities will take the slightest, blind bit of notice, and that is the problem.  That is what worries me.</P>
      <P>I have paid some tributes to some local authorities, or even to the general principle of local authority and local democracy here this morning, but I also have long and wide ranging experience of local authorities.  I am sure the Minister is quite right when he says that this gives them some teeth which they may have been asking for, but the Minister will also, I have no doubt, in view of his own long career in politics, at both local and national level, recognise the truth of what I say when I state that very frequently the corporations and local authorities have neglected to use powers which they have had in the past.  They could quite easily have saved a certain amount of dereliction in this city if they only used the powers that existed, limited though they were.  My problem is that there is the possibility of powers lying dormant, not being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that local authorities are compelled to enter on a register. What happens when a citizen believes that local authorities are themselves in dereliction of their duty and when he becomes aware of buildings that are derelict for one reason or another &mdash; whether because of negligence, officials being too busy, or they could not be bothered, or because they do not have sufficient liquidity to do anything about it in terms of employing people?  Of course, there will be a temporary shortfall economically if they do get stuck in to these derelict site situations.  The authorities could be involved in some cost, I suppose.  What guarantee is there that they will enter <Col N="543" /> every single derelict site?  Could the Minister who did a very competent job in elucidating some of the areas &mdash; particularly, I may say, in regard to the marginal areas of my concern in this &mdash; address one very simple idea that I have explained?  I would like him to comment on it, if he will.  Does he not recognise the fact, as I have very clearly stated, that a local authority is a large anonymous, amorphous body, with functionaries, bureaucrats and public servants &mdash; and I use all those in a neutral and not in a condemnatory sense &mdash; and that there is a substantial difference between the kind of motivation that may exist inside this kind of body on the one hand and the motivation of the individual who will have personal and direct knowledge of the situation on the other?  If somebody goes to the trouble of trying to register a building as derelict, should he not be facilitated in every possible way?</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about country councils. If in their opinion a site is derelict, what are the criteria?  I presume there will be a further spelling out of what the criteria are in some of the regulations that may yet come.  I would certainly welcome this.  The Minister is nodding.  I am very grateful.  It no longer rests at the question of the matter of opinion, because there will be certain criteria to be fulfilled.  This also affects one of the Minister's comments on our amendment, where he suggested that the amendment was defective because it was not specific enough.  It did not specify the conditions. It did not take into account the rights of landlords, and so on.  I would say that once the criteria are spelled out in the Bill, those criteria will be perfectly clear. It will be manifest under what sections the landowner has transgressed and that the rest of the Bill will apply.  I do not accept at all that there is a question of natural justice intervening.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is completed by the addition of the regulations prescribed by the Minister everybody will know what the criteria are.  Those that transgress these criteria ought to be on the register. If they are not, individuals should have <Col N="544" /> the right to place them on it as the rest of the machinery of the Bill comes into play.  I must insist that the individual should have this right.  I will be pressing this.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to explain if he actually imputes omniscience to local authorities?  Are they all-seeing, all-powerful and ever wise?  Is it ever possible that there could be a gap in their perceptions or that they could err, whether through malevolence, political chicanery or simply humanity?  Because of the fact that, like the rest of us, they are fallible, is it not possible that there could be a gap and that that gap could be made up by the co-operation of the citizen?  I will certainly wish to press this amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would give an undertaking that he will take my amendment away and look at it very carefully and amend the defects as he sees them while, at the same time, enshrining the principles, then and only then would I be prepared to withdraw it.  Then and only then will I be tempted not to push it to a vote.</P>

      <P>Could I respectfully suggest to the Senator that he is somewhat mistaken in relation to his comments about local authorities and more specifically in relation to local authority public representatives?  As he rightly says, the individual would have the right to make his own representations to the local authority.  He would also have access to the public representative in the area.  It is one of the main functions of a local public representative to represent the views of the people.  Any individuals who may not be doing that do not deserve to be there in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness, this is the first opportunity that local authorities have had to get the power and obligation to implement these regulations.  We could talk <i>ad nauseam</i> about hypothetical situations, as to what may or may not happen but we cannot legislate for all sorts of hypothetical situations. I am sure the Senator appreciates that difficulty.  What I would suggest to him respectfully is that he should give an opportunity to the local authorities to <Col N="545" /> implement these regulations and see how they work.  I am very confident that the Bill is the best possible under the circumstances. The Senator will be pleasantly surprised at the implementation of the regulation when enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill goes a lot further than Senators may think.  When it becomes law the local authority or corporation in its functional area will have to complete a register within one year and I am sticking to that &mdash; within one year.  The problem with amendment No. 8 is that, for example, it could result in one set of citizens becoming subject to taxation at the instigation of another set of citizens.  There has to be an authority with overall control.  Senator Norris made a remark that possibly there should be an independent authority.  We have enough authorities, in my opinion.</P>
      <P>We have a local authority or corporation for the first time getting rights to look after all this.  I accept that Senators want to make the Bill as practical and as good as possible.  From a legislation point of view, it is well drafted and when it comes into law it will stand up.  That is the aim, I have no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>I have a great knowledge of local authority affairs.  I am confident the local authorities will respond to this in conjunction with the members of those authorities with whom I have always had a great relationship.  It is the right of any person to go to a member of a local authority or corporation and say that they should be included.  In each electoral or divisional area you have the very competent staff of the local authorities to deal with all this.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris and Senator Hederman mentioned places in their own areas in Dublin.  It was very kind of them to issue an invitation to me but I have been asked all over the country as well and I have not got the time.  It was very kind of them to issue that invitation.</P>

      <P>I have been asked to go around the Twenty-six Counties.  I will <Col N="546" /> not be responsible personally when this Bill goes through because I am giving the authority to the corporations and local authorities.  They have to get their act together on this.  I am giving them the Bill with your support and approval and when this Bill comes into law the register of derelict buildings in the areas under their authority has to be compiled within a year.  Some say I am asking too much but I do not think I am.  I am satisfied with this.</P>
      <P>To be fair to Senator Norris, I want to say there has to be an authority with overall charge and I am sticking with the local authority.  I am not going to set up any more independent bodies.  I have and always had great faith in the local authorities. Whatever anyone may think of them &mdash; they get a lot of abuse at times, and very little thanks &mdash; they do an enormous amount of work for the people.  I cannot let this occasion go by without expressing my thanks to them all over the country for the work they do.  They have to make very difficult decisions sometimes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the drafting of this Bill.  I am satisfied that in law it gives all the necessary powers to the authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I do not think it is a vital part of this Bill.  There are other areas which are much more serious.  Senator Norris's problem &mdash; and I have great sympathy for it &mdash; is that although he is a man of wide experience in this particular instance he only has the experience of the Dublin Corporation.  I, therefore, greatly sympathise with his most depressed opinion of their ability to do this.  Perhaps I might help him by saying that as a member of that local authority &mdash; I hope I will be a member of it when this Bill comes in &mdash; I will undertake to do my best personally if this particular problem which he has is not being attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator McKenna that the members of local authorities are, by and large, genuinely concerned about dereliction. They want to see it cleared up. If an individual comes to members of a local authority and brings such a matter <Col N="547" /> to their attention they will find them very helpful and co-operative.  Local authorities in general want to see dereliction cleared up provided, of course, that they do not own the property themselves, when, I am sorry to say, they take a rather different attitude.  Senator Norris's grave fears in this matter are probably exaggerated.  He has a base for them, but perhaps they are exaggerated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope that with the Minister in the Department of the Environment there is going to be a genuine effort to introduce some local democracy.  I welcome the Minister's repeated statements that that is what he favours.  I would like to remind him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that he should go a step further.  He spoke about giving power to local authorities.  I do not think there is any harm in encouraging local authorities to involve the people; democracy should start at the very lowest level. I think it is called subsidiarity &mdash; that any function which can be given down to a lower authority is given.  That is why I will be supporting the amendment.  It seeks not to undermine the local authorities in any way but to get them to go a step further and to involve the people as this amendment, which Senator Norris and I have down, purports to do, that is, to allow then to bring to the attention of a local authority such a site and to have it entered on the register as has been outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister says it would not be a nice situation that one lot of citizens could make another citizen liable to tax.  I think that would be a splendid thing if the other defaulting citizen was perpetrating what I consider to be a social crime on his fellow-citizens by leaving sites derelict; and, if he is doing that, what is wrong with other citizens having some say in rectifying this matter? <Col N="548" /> I do not think that is so hideous.  It rather appeals to me that citizens should have that right.  It will once again further what I believe in.  We do not have to let all the power be with the local authorities.  Let us farm it out.  Let us say to people, &ldquo;If you find that another citizen, through continuing dereliction, is causing a problem in an area and you bring that up, that is a good thing&rdquo;.  That is probably a rather forward looking view but it is one, I am sure, that in the fullness of time will come to light with the Minister in the Department. He seems to be interested in local democracy.</P>
    <P>By and large, it is fair, as the Minister has said in this instance, that local authorities up to this have had no power to deal with an owner of a property, even if it was a List One property.  We have the sad case of 29, Clare Street, around the corner, where the local authority wanted to get the owner of that List One property to maintain it, but the local authority had no power.  That is the reality.  I hope that this Bill will give the local authorities that power.  The difficulty is that we are going to exclude developers if they say to us the dereliction is there because they are assembling a site.  That is why we appealed on our knees to the Minister &mdash; we will be doing that again in section 25 &mdash; that he would reconsider that, so that they would not slip out of the net.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment. I personally do not wish to press it, because I do not think it is the worst problem with the Act, but I certainly support Senator Norris's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think consideration has been given to details of this.  I would like the Senator to address himself to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am going to address myself quite specifically to the amendment. In so doing I would like to take up some of the things that have been said by the Minister and by every other person who has spoken, that is, with regard to the question of local representatives and their competence in this matter.  Let us be quite honest.  Local representatives <Col N="549" /> are human beings and, like everybody else, they are a mixed bunch, full stop, end of story.  We all know.  I am not going to try to paint them as devils and I am sure the Minister and the other Senators here are not going to try to paint them as saints, because neither would be realistic.</P>
      <P>In that light, I would like to place the following on the record.  As a citizen, I appreciate that elected local representatives do and I also very much appreciate the fact that they play an unpaid role on behalf of society.  I do not want it to be suggested that in moving this amendment I am in some way impugning the honour the reputation or the competence of local representatives.  I am not.  I am not, however, saying that all of them are either as effective or as informed or as competent as each other.  There simply is not a level of uniformity.  You can be lucky; you can be unlucky.</P>
      <P>The other things I would like to say is this.  I would like to know from the Minister, since we are all apparently going to rely entirely on the goodwill of the local representatives &mdash; and I have no doubt that in certain circumstances this exists &mdash; what rights do those local representatives have if they want to exercise them?  Can one local representative representing me as an individual compel the local authority to enter upon the register a site that he or she knows is derelict because I have told them?  I do not believe that one individual local representative has that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It if falls within the Act, he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if that really falls within the Act?  What is the machinery of compulsion for one local representative to bring this Act into force where it apparently has failed to come into force already?  I think that is an important consideration. What is the mechanism of compulsion?  I have experience of the local authority in Dublin and we have some excellent representatives on it.  I have one sitting here beside me, Alderman Carmencita Hederman, and there are excellent representatives from all <Col N="550" /> sides of the House, from various political parties, including the Government party, and those of no party.  My experience has been that when I have briefed my local representatives, it is not unheard of for some of the other ones, who are totally ill-informed, biased and contentious to &mdash; for their own utterly unscrupulous reasons &mdash; to get a headline by attacking personally and by name people like myself who have sought to do this.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask a very specific question. What rights does an individual have?  Senator Hederman has volunteered to raise the matter of derelict sites, and I will certainly be happy with that &mdash; she has done this kind of thing excellently and ably in the past.  I will certainly ask her, after the passage of this Bill, to do something for me in regard to a series of derelict sites with which I am familiar.  Can the Minister guarantee me absolutely that, should Senator Hederman or A.N.  Other raise on my behalf this matter, that will mean they will if they meet the criteria go onto the register? Can I ask also who monitors the register?  Where does the responsibility lie to monitor the register?</P>
      <P>I completely accept what the Minister says, that there is going to be a register. It is going to be done in a year.  What makes the Minister think it is going to be complete?  If it is not complete; what are the consequences?  It is a very serious point.  Suppose we get a register inside a year and it is, for example, to my knowledge grossly defective &mdash; and this is possible &mdash; is it not the case that that will confirm and consolidate the neglecting owners in their position and that they will laugh at people like myself because they will recognise that the situation has been pre-empted by the existence of a derelict site register?  They will say:  &ldquo;My house could not be derelict.  My property could not be derelict.  If it was derelict it would be on the register.  It is not on the register; therefore, it is not derelict&rdquo;.  This is the problem that I am drawing respectfully, but very firmly, to the Minister's attention and I hope he will be able to explain it to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say again that, listening to Senator Norris here, we are back to the old situation that has raised its head from time to time.  There is a problem in this city; but it is not fair to say if there are deficiencies here in the personnel of the local authority, that every other local authority throughout the country should be condemned in the same breath.  I object to that.  The elected members of the local authority &mdash; I certainly say this in relation to my own local authority &mdash; will act with common sense where these matters are concerned.  It is important that they would.</P>
      <P>I would certainly have strong reservations about a guarantee being given &mdash; I think it is impossible to give a guarantee &mdash; that one individual member of a local authority can ensure the inclusion on the register of derelict sites of a particular building or property.  To attempt to do anything like that is standing local democracy on its head.  We have to allow for the situation that when this legislation comes into effect there are going to be crackpots around the country coming up with the opinion that this, that and the other site is derelict.  It is derelict if it falls within the regulations as set out.  It is derelict if that is the opinion of the majority of the elected members of the local authority, acting and behaving as sensible members and applying commonsense. You cannot have any individual &mdash; I used the term &ldquo;crackpots&rdquo;; perhaps I should not have used that term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There will be a rash of these coming along wanting this, that and the other site to be described as a derelict property.  There has to be commonsense in the application of this.  I am satisfied that that measure of commonsense certainly exists in my local authority and, I hope, in a number of other areas. Whether it exists here in Dublin or not, I do not know.  I can only speak for my own area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I want to take up.  It is important to say that the local authorities basically act as the guardians of the public.  In reply to Senators Norris and Hederman, I think it is also important to point out that there is the function of the public representative, who has to look after the interests of the people.  There is also another function and that is an executive function, the managerial function.  I see the managerial function as being an extremely important one relative to this Bill, the same as it is important under the Planning Acts.  I agree with Senator Howard when he says that if there is a problem in Dublin Corporation then that problem does not really manifest itself in many other local authorities.  In regard to the Dublin scene, I might point to the fact that Dublin County Council already have a derelict sites section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made about the rights of the individual to make a case <i>vis-à-vis</i> dereliction.  Obviously, that right is there. It is there under the enforcement section with regard to planning and it will be there under this Derelict Sites Bill as well.  The obvious choice is there for the public representative to make representations on behalf of his constituents; but at the end of the day it is going to be a managerial function to decide whether this particular site comes within the terms of the Derelict Sites Act.  That is an executive function that is reserved to management at the end of the day to take <Col N="553" /> a decision within the guidelines of the Act.  It is very important that that would be seen for what it is.</P>
    <P>We also mentioned the fact that it will take 12 months.  As the Minister says, it is going to be a mammoth task for some local authorities to compile a complete register of derelict sites within that period.  I would refer both Senators to section 11 of the Act, which empowers the local authority in the intervening period to take whatever action is necessary. That is a point that should not be overlooked when dealing with this amendment.  I propose at this stage, since we have pretty well exhausted the section, that the question should be put.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

I do not believe that is necessarily the case.  May I point out also that there are criteria to be met, so that crackpots can only do a very limited amount of damage.  I would like to address once more this question of the criteria <Col N="554" /> involved.  I would like to ask the Minister are these objective criteria or are they subjective criteria, because I am increasingly concerned when I am told that these criteria &mdash; it seems to be something coming from all sides of the House &mdash; are going to be decided upon by the opinions of local representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct, because the criteria laid down in the Bill and management structure within local authorities have to act within the ambit of the Bill or the Act as before them.  It is not going to be a subjective thing; it has always to be an objective one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very relieved to hear that.  It is most important &mdash; and I hope that the Minister will have a look at this &mdash; that the criteria are objective and will be objectively applied and not subjectively applied.  Since we are in a mood to produce little bouquets for Dublin County Council, let me place on the record of this House that at the moment there is a section 4 planning motion down for Dublin county.  If this is the kind of behaviour that we can expect &mdash; and it is not unique to Dublin county or urban area; section 4 happens all over the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I might put the Senator's mind at ease in the matter.  He mentioned the reference in section 8(1) to the opinion of the local authority. Clearly, the opinion of the local authority will have to relate to whether a property is a derelict site within the meaning of section 3 of the Bill.  If any further question of law arises it would have to be determined by the courts.  That is very clear.  I am trying to be as helpful as I possibly can as quickly as I can.  We have had a long debate on this amendment and I have been very patient.  I have explained this.  I like to be as helpful as I possibly <Col N="555" /> can, but I am not getting up on my feet again in regard to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just make a very brief comment?  I want to apologise to Senator Howard for interrupting him earlier on.  I think the problem is &mdash; and I am afraid Senator Norris has to accept it &mdash; that if we want to have local democracy, which I desperately want, we have to accept that we do elect saints to local authorities but, sadly, we may also elect a few sinners as well.  That is local democracy. If there was proper local democracy we might get fewer of the sinners and more of the saints, because people would be more involved and they would know what was happening.  I am prepared to stick by the system we have of electing people to local authorities and of working within that ambit.</P>
      <P>My reason for supporting this amendment is not that I have anything against the local authorities, who, I believe, will do their damnedest to implement this Bill.  But, even on this amendment which Senator Norris and I have down, it will still be up to the manager to decide whether the criteria are being met in the situation where an individual comes in. We will still be in the hands of the manager. The reason I am supporting the amendment is not because I have not confidence in local authorities but because I think it would be a good thing for the local authorities to go even one step further and to involve the people in the decision.  That is why I am supporting the amendment.  I am not in any way denigrating local authorities.  As I said, I personally do not consider it the most important of the amendments and I will not be pressing for a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one further point I would like to make.  It is an important point and it emerges from what the Minister has said.  I would like some clarification, if this is possible.  I completely accept that the Minister has been extremely patient and helpful and has clarified some material for us today.  I think that is a very important function of <Col N="556" /> the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly of the Upper House.  The Minister will appreciate that, when I felt that two of my amendments were unhelpful and could not be sustained logically, I withdrew both of them.  Was the Minister saying in his final remarks &mdash; I felt he was almost saying it &mdash; that the individual can apply to the courts if he or she feels that the register is incomplete by virtue of its non-inclusion of a particular site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a matter for the courts.  Of course, they can.  That is open at all times.  I want to clarify another point.  I am a great believer in local democracy.  I stand by that, and that is it. There is no point in anyone saying to me that this person or that person is right or wrong, or whatever the case may be. They were duly elected by the people, by the ballot box, and I accept that.  I am satisfied with it.</P>

      <P>This is a vitally important thing, and I will leave it at this.  I want it absolutely on the record of this House.  I will intend acting upon this, Minister, because I am a man of my word and I have a very specific interest in this.  If this Bill goes through in its present form and if certain specific sites in the north inner city of which I am aware and about which I intend to complain are not contained on the register, it is my entitlement as the law will then stand to apply directly as a citizen to compel those, should they meet the criteria, to be included on that register. If the Minister can &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to everything I have said there, I will not press a vote but, if he cannot satisfy me on every single line of that, then I am putting it to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to inform the Seanad of the Government's response to the problems caused by severe storms over the past few months.  Let me remind the Seanad that, over the weekend of 27-28 October 1989, the west and the northwest of the country was affected by prolonged heavy rain.  On the weekend of 16-17 December 1989 a combination of high tides with swells and wind direction gave rise to problems in coastal areas from Cork to Louth.  Damage to public property during the December storms related mainly to coastal defences, including piers, slipways and so on.  There was, in addition, significant consequential damage to public roads in the immediate vicinity of the coast.</P>
      <P>The Government responded positively to the claims by a number of local authorities for special grants to cover the cost of remedial works to roads and coastal erosion.  The Minister for the Environment set aside £1 million from available funds and provided assistance towards the cost of remedial works to public roads.  This £1 million was notified on 7 February to the counties mainly affected during the October and December storms.  During his budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced a special grant of £0.95 million towards the cost of coastal protection at Arklow on foot of the storm damage.  In addition, the Minister for the Marine announced a 50 per cent grant to Wexford County Council for the pier at Kilmore Quay and £100,000 for boat repairs at the same location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the month of February, very <Col N="559" /> heavy rainfall over a wide area on a number of days caused most of our problems. The number of days with gales has also been in excess of the February average and in some locations the highest on record.  On 13 February, the Taoiseach announced the establishment of a special Cabinet sub-committee comprising the Ministers for Finance, Environment, Marine and Agriculture.  In so far as Minister Flynn's own area of direct responsibility is concerned, all local authorities were requested to submit detailed reports on the damage and estimates of costs of remedial works.  At the same time the Ministers for the Marine and Agriculture and Food were having similar assessments carried out in their areas of responsibility.  Final reports on marine, agriculture and environment-related issues have been considered by the special sub-committee and the sub-committee report has been submitted to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>For the record, I must say that there are limits to the area of responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and to the funds at his disposal to give assistance. For example, there are no funds available to compensate for any damage to private properties caused by the adverse weather.  Householders would normally be expected to have their property and the contents insured against those losses from flooding.  In needy cases it is open to the health boards to provide assistance to elderly householders under the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly.  Money has been paid through that agency on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>It is a long established practice that the Exchequer cannot meet the losses incurred by businesses as a result of their being uninsured.  That, may I add, is not a personal view or indeed the view of the Government.  It is the policy which has existed throughout the history of the State and it has never been broken. Indeed, following Hurricane Charlie, in August 1986 the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition endorsed this policy.</P>
    <P>Turning again to public roads it is <Col N="560" /> important to note that the significantly increased discretionary grants for regional and county roads which have been notified to local authorities in 1990 may be used in appropriate cases to undertake the remedial works arising from the bad weather.  The grants to county councils under this heading amount to over £63 million in 1990 compared with £47.4 million under the equivalent heading in 1989 and £33.4 million in 1987.  There has been a very big increase in the amount of money that has been allocated by way of discretionary grants and I am again advising the local authorities accordingly that they can use the money to deal with the roads problem.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make a few remarks about the EC Disaster Fund.  Let me tell what the fund does not do.  The fund does not cover damage to public structures, it does not compensate for damage to property and it is not for infrastructural projects or remedial schemes.  The principal objective of the funds is to provide urgent aid to Community residents who are the victims of natural catastrophes that are recognised as being of exceptional scale and gravity.  The fund is largely symbolic in that it represents a testimony of a solidarity of the other peoples of the Community to those members who find themselves in a situation of profound material and moral distress. The budgetary resources of the fund are tiny, amounting in 1990 to some four million ECU &mdash; £3.1 million approximately &mdash; in respect of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>In deciding to intervene in any case, the factors that are taken into account by the EC Commission are the extent of loss of life, the numbers made homeless and the degree of hardship suffered by those affected.  The fund does not purport to offer strict compensation for the damage suffered by victims.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday night in the Dáil the Minister for Finance announced that the EC had granted a total of £153,000 in disaster relief following the recent storms.  These moneys will be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society on strict criteria laid <Col N="561" /> down, not by the Government but by the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my deep appreciation to the local authorities and the emergency services for their marvellous response to the problem which the bad weather presented.  Throughout the past few months they have been doing an admirable job, the Garda, the Defence Forces, the fire brigades, the civil defence, all local authority employees throughout the country and all those involved in the emergency services, deserve our thanks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. It is appropriate that this House should discuss this matter, somewhat belatedly. At this time we have an opportunity to see the real damage that has been done over the past two months.  The homes and property of a very large number of people have been seriously affected by the storm and flood damage.  The most vulnerable people should be compensated so that they can, at least, make their homes habitable.  I am referring to people who cannot afford insurance to meet natural disasters.  Farmers who have been seriously affected, particularly those in the the disadvantaged areas whose lands have been extensively flooded, should be provided with fodder for their stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three precedents were set by the previous Governments, I do not for the life of me understand why the Government have stood idly by and allowed this situation to develop, particularly where homes were flooded and people were marooned. The Government failed to respond to the needs of those people.  I am extremely alarmed that the Government ignored the fact that a serious problem existed for over two months.  The first acknowledgement of the problem was when they set up a Dáil Cabinet Subcommittee <Col N="562" /> some weeks ago, two months after the devastating storms on the night of the 16-17 December.  I go as far as to say that somebody will have to be lost before the Government take positive action to alleviate the major problems that exist in some of our rural areas.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to three previous occasions when major aid was provided as a result of flooding.  In 1954 the then Minister for Agriculture, James Dillon, made special aid available to the victims of the Shannon Valley floods.  At that time farmers whose homes and lands were flooded, got the opportunity of transferring to Leinster and getting new farms there, or, alternatively, new homes were provided for them.  Let me put it on the record here this evening that homes that were not flooded in 1954 &mdash; Senator Fallon will be well aware of this &mdash; are flooded today.  I am now calling on the Minister to recognise the exceptional circumstances that exist in many of our areas, but particularly in the Shannon and Suck valleys, where farmers are facing impossible conditions, many families are marooned and many farmers are facing unbelievable problems.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the then Minister for Agriculture, Mark Clinton, made special allowances for the Shannon Valley/Suck area, and later Deputy Austin Deasy, then Minister for Agriculture, also recognised the exceptional problem which existed there.  By careful negotiation in Brussels he got special aid through the headage mechanism to alleviate the major problems some farmers faced at that time.  I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government have not gone to Brussels and sought aid to alleviate the major problems facing our farmers today.</P>
    <P>I want to put it clearly on the record that the response of the Government has been totally inadequate and out of touch with reality.  The response of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, during last week's Dail Debate on flood damage to farming and other sectors and the Government's response to the heavy cost <Col N="563" /> to farmers as a result of flooding and storm damage, is cause for deep concern.</P>
    <P>The present losses in livestock, structural damage and damage to land as a result of flooding will be in excess of £10 million.  Large tracts of prime agricultural land, not normally prone to flooding, are now under water.  The major problem facing many of those farmers is not the damage caused by flood waters, but the damage it will cause down the road because of late grass growth, and the fact that in some cases, stock has to be moved. When the Minister was speaking in the Dáil he said that nowadays a high percentage of livestock were housed.  Unfortunately, in the West of Ireland, that is not the case.  While grants are made available farmers have to come up with the balance of the money.  Very often, many west of Ireland farmers are unable to do that particularly as their incomes have slumped over the last two years in the dry stock industry and the sheep industry.  Now it looks as if the milk industry is a major problem.</P>
    <P>The vast amount of this land will have to be reseeded costing vast sums of money plus the difficulty of late growth and the increase of up to 100 per cent of the cost of purchasing silage and hay. Throughout the country there are silage pits, haysheds and also farm dwellings flooded.  The Government have sat idly by and allowed this to develop without coming to the assistance of those farmers.</P>
    <P>I extend a special invitation to the Government to visit parts of the midlands and the west to see at first hand the widespread flooding to farm lands and the vacant houses.  In some cases families have had to leave their houses while others are marooned in their homes.  As recently as last week a lady in my area had to be rescued by the Army from her home.  This is not acceptable in the nineties.  In parts of this area the problem now is far greater and far more extensive than it was before.  It is very difficult to understand why positive action has not been taken.  In a recent report issued by the Roscommon County Engineer he estimated that it would take £1.5 million <Col N="564" /> to raise the roads in South Roscommon above flood level and that in the whole county it would take in excess of £3 million. That is the type of money we need to alleviate the major flooding problems in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some areas adjacent to me and point out what is happening there.  Some new houses are now flooded. Other houses which were not flooded in 1954 &mdash; the highest flooding on record prior to now &mdash; are also under water. When things were bad in this country and when the mode of transport was the horse and trap, Governments made vast financial sums available to alleviate hardship. I am now calling on the Minister to do likewise, to make moneys available for rehousing, where that is necessary, and to provide financial assistance for the purchase of feedstuff to keep livestock alive.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that a number of silage pits are flooded and that a vast amount of hay has been lost as a result of flooding.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficult situation in parts of his own constituency but in Roscommon county it is estimated that 17,000 acres are under water.  I now call on the Government to declare this present disadvantaged area an extremely severely handicapped area.  This would allow the Government to take the one positive step of paying a maximum headage grant of £100 per head without any negotiation or delay.  I also call on the Government to have the disadvantaged areas, which are not classified as severely handicapped, so classified to allow the payment of headage grants in those areas.</P>
    <P>Additional headage payments were made in 1985 and 1986 so the precedent is there.  It was acknowledged by Brussels then that there was an exceptional problem in many of those areas.  I do not see why the Minister cannot take immediate steps to have aid made available to those people in the Shannon Valley, in the Suck Valley and in many other areas which have suffered extensively from flooding. There is also an opportunity for the Minister to declare part of the Shannon and Suck Valley an environmentally sensitive <Col N="565" /> area, thereby creating additional financial assistance for the farming community.</P>
    <P>We had a token acknowledgement of the problem by our EC Commissioner. The allocation of £120,000 at this time is derisory I cannot understand how any Irish Commissioner, particularly a former Agriculture Minister and a former rural Deputy, could offer such a small amount at this time to an Irish Government. It defies explanation.  In 1986 the then Taoiseach set up a departmental committee with a view to setting up a Shannon Valley authority, I am calling on the Government to set up a Shannon Valley authority without delay to control and manage the Shannon and the Suck Valley in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Naughten, I will be parochial.  I come from the town of Athlone on the banks of the Shannon and it is appropriate that I should speak on this important motion.  It is a fact of life that flooding of the Shannon is synonymous with the town of Athlone. When we hear of the Shannon flooding we think of Athlone.  The parts I know best are the parts in south Westmeath and south Roscommon as I live on the Clonown Road close to the area that is flooded.  People who live in areas in south Roscommon like Duogue, Kilnamanagh, Carricknaughton up to Clonown and Carrick O'Brien, Clonbonny and Golden Island know what it is like when there is flooding from the Shannon.  They have come to live with the situation and can manage in mild or normal winter flooding. That has been the way for generations. It has been part and parcel of life for my relatives on both sides of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When there is high flooding as there was this year and as we had in 1954, there is a huge problem which needs to be looked at.  While many people say it is not an emergency, and it may not be an emergency in the strict literal sense that people will not be drowned or killed in the same way as we talk about a major plane crash or a major train crash, for <Col N="566" /> the people living there I have no doubt that it represents an emergency situation.</P>
    <P>The floods in Athlone, in South Roscommon and south Westmeath over the last few months have caused great inconvenience.  Many people had to leave their homes and had to move their cattle to higher ground.  That presented problems for farming generally.  They require help.  In the areas I speak of where there is low land and when there is very heavy rain and high winds it is almost certain that there will be floods of an exceptional nature.  Heavy rain and high winds in low lands is the criterion for excessive river Shannon flooding.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten spoke about a long-term solution.  That is to be found in nothing less than the drainage of the Shannon but I do not know when that will happen.  I do not think it will happen in my lifetime.  It would cost millions of pounds so we have to consider what can be done immediately.  I have to pay tribute to the staff of Westmeath and Roscommon County Councils who rallied to the cause as did groupings like the Civil Defence, the Garda and the Army who were very helpful in what was a critical time for many people.  We should consider having a local government policy to enable the local authority to make an immediate response to the problem as they see it.  The only effective agency handling the crisis in the south Athlone area over the past few months was the county council.  The Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke was present and helped enormously.  Senator Liam Naughten was equally helpful.  The county council have the expertise and the knowledge.  We opened an emergency office in Athlone and that was a help.  I would like to see powers being given to the local authorities to put into play a plan for such an eventuality, and that there be the clear understanding that a full recoupment would be made to the county manager on production of appropriate accounts for the measures necessary to alleviate the immediate problem as he and the staff see it.  For example, it was Westmeath County Council who initiated the move to get <Col N="567" /> sleepers from the Department of Agriculture, but it took four days before the council were given clearance to buy them.  Sleepers were necessary to raise cattle in their sheds out of the flood.  The same applied to waders.  I think if the county council had the power to ring the Department of Defence or who ever necessary to put all this into play, things would all move swiftly.  However, it is important that their expenses would be fully recouped.</P>
    <P>Many of the areas along the Shannon Valley are in the less severely disadvantaged areas.  I feel at this point there is a very strong case for designating the entire River Shannon basin as a severely disadvantaged area.  In that way we could avail of all the advantages under the disadvantaged areas scheme &mdash; the headage grants and high rates for dwellings, which generally help at a time of crisis.  While I make the point that this year is a crisis year for them, if you live near the Shannon basin, you accept it as a fact of life that every year there is winter flooding.  I believe there is a very real strong case to have the whole Shannon Valley designated as a severely disadvantaged area.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to the cost of raising all the roads above the high water mark.  Every local authority should be asked to examine areas of roads &mdash; not every road but certainly the vital ones which are well covered in a high winter flood &mdash; so that they may be raised above the flood level.  We can make a comparison between 1954 and this year.  I believe the flooding in 1954 was not as bad as this year.  Then we had people living in the castle in Athlone, and others in local authority and private houses.</P>
    <P>The situation has improved from that point of view.  We have tractors and jeeps which are a help.  Nonetheless, we should seriously consider designating these areas as severely handicapped.  The allocation from EC Disaster Fund &mdash; £153,000 &mdash; is a miserly figure and I hope the Government will look for a greater allocation in the future.  At the same time I welcome <Col N="568" /> the fact that the Minister for the Environment set aside £1 million from available funds which provided for remedial works on public roads in some parts of the country.  The area in question always has mild or normal winter flooding which in itself causes great inconvenience, but with the flooding we have had over the past number of months, it requires more than ordinary treatment.  Therefore, the suggestions I have made would be a practical help in aiding the people who unfortunately find themselves in critical circumstances because of the floods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for allowing the debate on the storm damage and its effect on all parts of Ireland.  In the Minister's opening address he referred to the west, the north-west and many other areas.  One would think that Tipperary was like Noah's Ark, sitting on top of the mountain, and that we had not suffered.  We, in the north Tipperary area are surrounded by three rivers.  Like Senator Fallon, I have listened to promises to drain the Shannon over the last 30 years; I have listened to proposals draining the Mulcair River for the last 25 years, and I have listened to plans for the draining of the Suir for the last 15 years, but because of the condition of these rivers and their tributaries, north Tipperary &mdash; as the song says has been &ldquo;surrounded by water&rdquo; since the storm damage broke in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have witnessed cases where people could not get to work in towns.  I have seen some of the finest farm land in north Tipperary which will not be dried out for at least another six weeks.  Any rural Senator, who appreciates this time of the year knows now is the time farmers need to be out and doing what they should to prepare for another good summer, we hope.  I have seen houses that will never be the same again, and as other speakers have indicated, the only response we got was from North Tipperary County Council. I must compliment the staff on the manner in which they went about their business.  We were asked in North Tipperary County Council for an assessment <Col N="569" /> of the damage before 16 February, and like the good council that we are, the submission was made on time and a figure of £570,000 was submitted as representing the amount of damage that has been caused to towns and rural areas in North Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I have also been told by the county engineer that there will be a supplementary costing which will bring the approximate cost of total damage to £1 million.  As a member of North Tipperary County Council, I realise the extent of the problem and what is being done, and then we hear of a derisory figure of £120,000 in aid from Brussels and that the Government are setting up committee.  I am sick of committees.  In my opinion if we are to wait for any committee to resolve this problem, it will be next Christmas before we hear anything about money being made available.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect as far as I am concerned is the county roads system. For years now the county road system has been under-financed.  This year alone North Tipperary County Council had a shortfall of £250,000.  How do any Government or any Minister expect a local authority to tackle the severe hardship and the crisis created by the flooding of February and, at the same time, carry a shortfall of £250,000 which we need to contain a road structure which is slowly but surely disintegrating under our feet? Someone mentioned Hurricane Charlie. That is a very appropriate expression because I can remember 1954 and the year that Hurricane Charlie hit the country, but I do not think anyone can stand up here and say that 1990 was not the worst year ever.  I have seen areas flooded that never flooded before.  It was unbelievable.  I saw a road outside Nenagh adjacent to the lakeshore collapse and we need £30,000 for its renewal.</P>
    <P>In the hilly areas the same thing has occurred and, as I said already, the very fact that people were not able to get to work in town will indicate very clearly the massive damage and the severe flooding which has occurred in the last couple of weeks.  At our county council meeting <Col N="570" /> two weeks ago we met a deputation consisting of two industrialists, two farmers and a representative of the housing estate.  In the two industrial developments, which employ about 250 workers, certain facilities which are very necessary for the staff for daily use were unavailable because of the flooding.  The two farmers told how they cannot put cattle out on their land.  We were told it required two days work by a fire brigade to clear the flooding of the road and around the houses in the estate.  That area is within half a mile of Nenagh.  It is an urban problem.</P>
    <P>When you go and see what has happened in the country areas I cannot understand a Government with so many rural Ministers in Cabinet which cannot see the severe hardship and the emergency measures that must be taken.  We are depending at the moment solely and principally on an under-financed local authority system.  As has been said here already, there has been much talk over the years about draining the Shannon and other rivers but that is not what the people want to hear.  The message I want to take back to North Tipperary County Council and to the people of north Tipperary is that the Government are concerned to resolve this serious problem. The Government and the Ministers concerned are clearly giving priority to additional urgent finance that is needed by the local authorities.  As a member of the county council in North Tipperary I am only too well aware of the serious financial difficulties and I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach, a Kerry man, will agree that local authorities are seriously under-financed with regard to county roads work.  These are the roads that are affected and unless steps are taken to offset this terrible disaster which has hit rural Ireland, I believe that in five years time the county road system will be back to the Mass tracks of the 1850s because the core of the roads is being destroyed and this recent disaster has caused further deterioration.</P>
    <P>I am not at all happy with the way this problem has been taken on board by the Government.  We may not get the report <Col N="571" /> from the Cabinet sub-committee until the balmy days of July and in the meantime the people in rural Ireland, both town and country, will suffer.  In addition to that the local authorities who are doing their damnedest to resolve the problems will be bankrupted by trying to stem the flow of flooding, which I am sure is the same in Kerry as well.  We still have flooding in north Tipperary, despite the weather of the last couple of days.  It will not go away unless the Government are concerned and are prepared to put their hands in their pocket and give the money that is urgently needed by the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody else here this afternoon I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  Like my colleague who has just spoken.  I regret the Minister's opening remarks that it seems to be the west and the north-west that are badly effected.  I do not know where the Department of the Environment got the information, be it in October or whenever, that they were the only areas in the country affected.  However, I will try to deal with the matter in hand.</P>
      <P>I believe there is an air of unreality about the discussion here this afternoon, that if we talk about it the problem will be solved, that if the weather improves it will all go away.  I do not believe that is the case.  In fact, I think we could now slot this debate into the agenda on an annual basis because the problem is going to get substantially worse in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>We have two problems to deal with at present; there is the obvious need to react to the floods and the severe damage that occurred over recent weeks, but that in itself does not deal with the far more important and fundamental problem of the changes that are occurring and the defenceless nature of our coastline in many areas.  Not alone our coastline but indeed many midland counties are affected severely by flooding as well because of the situation of many of the rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do not understand about this <Col N="572" /> debate is that the Minister, when he spoke, did not refer to the long-term effects of what we have witnessed this winter.  I must admit at this stage that I have no in-depth knowledge of the changes in climate that may or may not be occurring throughout the world, but we in Ireland are being affected by it.  I think there is enough weight of opinion to suggest that we should be concerned and we should at least be making certain preparatory efforts and taking some certain measures, even if they are only precautionary at this stage, to put in train some sort of schedule of planning over the next number of years to deal with the major problem of coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>My belief is that it will get substantially worse.  I think the climatic changes we are witnessing at present are set to continue &mdash; many experts have said so; I am not saying they are right, there is a difference of opinion &mdash; and if this is to be the case, and it probably is, then the problem we face this year will be worse next year and progressively worse over the next decade.  Whatever the costs now of trying to implement some kind of long-term planning in this whole area, if we do nothing, the one sure thing we can all bet on is that as the years go by it will get substantially and progressively more expensive and indeed will be beyond us to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I expect that the cost of tackling the problem at the moment probably runs to many millions of pounds.  I am not suggesting for one minute that the Government have the all-embracing responsibility to find this money overnight, I think it should be a combination of Government, EC and indeed local authorities, and perhaps greater involvement by private interests, who have suffered hugely and dramatically as a result of storm damage, not least the agricultural sector and indeed many other sectors.  Tourism has also been very severely affected.  There is a combined force out there to set in train a major approach to solving this problem.</P>
    <P>The damage that has occurred in my own constituency in Waterford has been <Col N="573" /> extremely severe.  I do not want to prolong the debate by being too parochial.  I must refer to the uprooting of roads and some have literally disappeared.  In Tramore the end of the prom is gone and the repair cost I believe is quite substantial because that road was raised to quite a high level above the beach area, and the underneath structure that supports it has literally disappeared.  By coincidence, I happened to be in Cork, Kerry, Donegal, Tipperary, Sligo, Galway, Mayo, Waterford, Wexford, within those two weeks and I had an enormous problem in travelling because of the flooding.  It is an extensive problem throughout the country and not peculiar to any county. The vast majority of the country was affected and that is why I am trying to approach it as more of a national problem. It needs national attention rather than the fire brigade measures to patch up the damage.  I am not saying that it is not necessary in some cases to patch up the very severe damage that has been caused at present, but it is far more important that a long term solution be found to these problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that some people should have had their properties insured but I am sure is aware that people who are subject to potential flooding, or indeed to the sea breaking sea walls, cannot get insurance even if they want it.  This is true in the case of one farm of 220 acres located near Waterford airport, owned by a man named James O'Sullivan.  His property has literally been destroyed, but he could not get insurance.  Ten or 15 years of preparatory work and development to turn a wet area into prime agricultural land has literally been destroyed because the whole sea wall has gone.  Not alone is his land and many other acres of land in danger, but there are now other severe identifiable weaknesses along the coastal walls which as of now have not been broken, but with the possibility of a repeat of the type of storms that we have had they will be severely broken.  Costs stand at the moment in terms of hundreds of thousands of pounds for that area alone but could run to millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The question I would like to pose to the Government this afternoon &mdash; I do not think it is just to the Department of the Environment, but the Departments of Agriculture and Food the Marine and possibly Tourism and Transport, and the sub-committees that liaise between various Departments &mdash; is that some effort should be made for each of them to look at this problem.  I do not think it would be fair to lump it all into the one area but you have to start somewhere.</P>
    <P>The other point this problem has highlighted, of course, is the inability of local Government with the best will in the world to be able to react to this problem. Local government has no funds, it has no way in many areas of raising funds. Without money the local representatives are powerless.  They might as well be sitting out in the park most of the time. I say that with no disrespect for local government because I have enormous time for that system and I am totally fed up with the way local government are treated.  The flooding problem has highlighted the hopelessness of their situation in terms of being able to respond to a major problem because they have no way of raising money or of responding to the needs in this instance.  Indeed there is not even planning in the long term for the development of their own areas.  The attitude of the EC has been nothing but derisory.  It was insulting, especially during the time of our Presidency of the EC, to respond to the problem the way it did.  I do not understand what is so much different about Portugal that they could get in excess, as I understand it, of £1 million to cope with their problems while we are given the paltry sum of £120,000 which probably would not cover the damage that needs to be repaired on even one farmer's land.  If the case was not put properly to the EC in the first instance, it should be approached again for more funding.  I am very disappointed at the reaction that has come from Europe in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is easy for anybody to stand up and say what we are not responsible for.  That has been a lot of the problem with Irish politics in general over the last 20 years. <Col N="575" /> We are all capable of pointing out what we are not responsible for but when it comes to doing something about a matter we seem to find reasons for not acting instead of thinking about what we should do.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely concerned about the problems the storm damage has highlighted as much as about the damage that has been done.  As an island nation surrounded by water with many rivers and tributaries criss-crossing the country we have to consider the long-term effects and the possibilities.  I think they are very severe.  Many people have referred to 1954.  I was born in 1954 so obviously I do not remember the damage that occurred at that time.</P>
    <P>With all the moneys that have been spent over the years, with all the shoring that probably has been done and with the technology of today, something is seriously wrong when such damage as we are talking of can occur.</P>
    <P>I would like to end with the message that I hope a long-term strategy can be evolved.  I obviously want to see immediate relief for individuals who have been severely hurt, possibly irretrievably by the storm damage.  Efforts have to be made in that regard, but if we are merely going to take fire brigade action and patch up what has happened I guarantee this House that we will be back here with the same debate next year and the year after. We must take long term action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address what has been a major problem in most parts of our country since early December last.  I tabled a motion in my name and in the names of my colleagues in early January, and it is still on the Order Paper.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the extensive damage caused to public and private property in coastal areas of the South and South East of the country resulting from the storms of the 16th and 17th December, 1989; and aware of the inability of the relevant local authorities to finance the <Col N="576" /> works needed to protect the communities involved against further damage and coastal erosion, calls on the Government to accept responsibility for the financing of the necessary sea defence works.</P>
    <P>Little did I think tabling that motion way back in January that we would have at least a couple of months of extensive bad weather and depressions across our country.  While in my own county, coastal defence is the main difficulty we have in the wake of the three months bad weather &mdash; we do have flooding to property and farm land as well &mdash; the real crisis is with our coastal defence systems throughout the country nationally.  There have been major problems both to public and private property, to harbours, to piers, to roads and to the fishing fleet. The fishermen are down £20 million on catches alone and have to suffer the added loss of damage to their boats.  The agricultural community reckon they are at least £10 million down, that is without proper assessment of fodder losses or the extra fodder that will be needed to feed cattle and stock generally this winter.  It is with amazement that we all heard a Government Minister state that there were no real losses to the agricultural sector.  I do not intend to develop that here today but would just remind the House that we are now addressing this motion to a Government who apparently have no idea of what the people have suffered over the last three months because of bad weather and storm damage generally.</P>
    <P>It was disingenuous of the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, in his address to us today to refer to the discretionary grants which have been increased this year.  They were increased in the Estimates for this year, Estimates which were published prior to the major storms we have just had, Estimates that were increased for work on our county and regional roads, acknowledging the appalling condition they were in before any extra damage had occurred.  To throw that in as if in some way it was a recognition and finance to help in respect of the storm <Col N="577" /> damage is nothing short of disingenuous and I do not think it is worthy of the Department to trot that type of material out to us here in the Seanad today.  It is perhaps to be expected, as they clamour for some sort of defence of the indefensible in view of their position and their response to the country generally in the wake of the damage.  The sum of £153,000 we would spend on one street, on one pier, on one farmer's land, as other Senators said, in County Wexford.  There would be some squabble if we had to divide it up equitably among the counties that have been ravaged by storms in our country.  It would be better if they had said that they had no money to give than to come up with £153,000.  Should they draw lots to find out which area or which amenity will actually receive this money?</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a point that has been raised which I feel very strongly about, that is, that all coastal defence works, all coastal protection charges, should be a national charge and not a charge on local government.  The maritime counties and the maritime county councils do not own the beaches and the harbours of the areas that happen to bound their counties.  In Wexford we do not stop the Kilkenny and the Carlow people using our lovely beaches at Curracloe and Rosslare and all down along the south.  Those beaches are national amenities, national assets and we welcome people coming to the county to use them.  We cannot expect the few commercial ratepayers left in County Wexford &mdash; Wexford County Council are no longer a financially autonomous body &mdash; to fund the enormous costs that have evolved in relation to the coastal defence works in County Wexford alone.  Other coastal maritime counties can make the same case.  The General Council of County Councils have been beseeching Ministers to look seriously at that issue.  We need a national coastal survey, we need national funding for the national asset that is our coastline, particularly on the east coast where we have a sand dune coastline with no rock outcrop protecting the land from the ravages of the sea.</P>
    <P>That point having been made, I would <Col N="578" /> also like to castigate the Government for not including coastal defence works or a request for coastal defence money in the national plan that was submitted to Brussels this time last year for drawing down the Structural Funds money.  When will this country ever get the opportunity again of being offered the doubling of the Structural Funds they will get over the last four years?  When can we ever expect such money again through the Regional Fund?  Yet the Government &mdash; I will not say in their wisdom, I do not consider it wise at all &mdash; decided to delete any request for coastal erosion or coastal protection moneys from the submission in the national plan that went to Brussels.  I still await an honest explanation from the Minister concerned as to how this could have happened.</P>
    <P>The tragedy on our coastline this winter highlights the foolishness of that move, if it needed to be highlighted at all.  Nationally, they are the two big issues.  The national Exchequer should fund coastal defence works and the Government stand indicted as having failed coastal communities by not including coastal defence moneys and structural defence works on our coastlines in the national plan.</P>
    <P>In Wexford the greatest disaster this winter in terms of storm damage occurred on the nights of 16 and 17 December. May I start, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, by reference to my own county, with a word of thanks and sincere appreciation to the emergency services in County Wexford? The response of our county council, civil defence, ambulance, fire brigade services, lifeboats and of the whole local community, particularly in Kilmore Quay, which is an area that the whole country learned about, was something that I, personally, am extremely proud of.  But for their immediate and quick reaction we would not only be talking about the loss of three trawlers, damage to 14 or 15 other trawlers, the enormous breach in the pier wall of Kilmore Quay and the devastation to that local maritime community, but we would also be talking in terms of loss of life.  Thankfully, the effort and the quick reaction of the <Col N="579" /> defence and emergency services in our county prevented that from happening.</P>
    <P>We have had major problems, mainly stemming from 16 and 17 December, but also in recent weeks in the Courtown area of County Wexford.  The weather of the last couple of months has resulted in the breakdown in the defences of the Ballyteigue drainage works which resulted in considerable flooding of the land at the back of this area.  This is a polder area.  It fronts, or defends from the sea, 7,000 to 8,000 acres of farmland. I do not have to point out here that a breach of the defence works in this area would have had major implications for life, livestock and the livelihood of the people in this area.  Damage occurred in the sea wall at Lough and there was a large breach near Lacken Lane.  Immediate repair works are needed there to prevent further disintegration and to prevent flooding of the whole area.</P>
    <P>In the Blackstone area there was a breach of the sea defence works which has since been repaired by the Office of Public Works.  Major work and a major survey of this area and of the defence wall in this area is needed.  A serious breach would cause major disasters. There were 100 acres flooded in this area. There is a major possibility of loss of life in the event of a more serious breach of the wall in this area.</P>
    <P>Going eastwards from the Cull area towards Kilmore there are a number of other places that need immediate examination and assessment by the Office of Public Works.  There was overtopping of the crest of the dune system here in a number of locations by the sea.  We must have repair works and maintenance done in this area.  Again, should the dunes in this section fail to protect the area there is real potential for the loss of life.</P>
    <P>Going further up the coast, Duncannon pier stood up to the major ravages of the storm, but in this area there was damage to boats also.  Ironically, the boat that was most damaged was actually in dry dock at the time.  It was caught by the winds coming from a particular direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> Kilmore Quay has been well documented. The loss of the livelihood of the fishermen in this area and the loss of trawlers has been documented.  We await the major capital scheme.  We are six years waiting for a capital scheme under the Coast Protection Act to protect the ravaging of Rosslare Strand.  Ballyconnigar lost its pier.  There was enormous flooding of tourist and caravan areas.  Cahore pier was seriously undermined. The sub-structure there needs immediate attention.  Courtown has the coast to the sea within three feet of the borough road.  Emergency rock arming by the county council is insufficient.  Wexford County Council and its ratepayers are not in the position to fund the much needed work along our coastline.  Wexford town is at major risk of flooding, particularly if there is a breach through the burrow at Rosslare Strand.</P>
    <P>The catalogue continues.  The derisory response of this Government to the flooding problems and to the storm damage problems both inland and on our coast over the last three months deserve a proper response, both nationally and locally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking in this debate.  Storm damage has created serious problems for the country.  Local authorities have found that they are not in a position to deal financially with the situation.  Many business people and small farmers throughout the country are finding it impossible to correct the effects of the storm damage, especially with regard to flooding.  Like previous speakers, I am going to be parochial. I am satisfied that we, in Kerry, have suffered more than most over the past three months.  We have had very heavy rainfall and storm damage.  The Maharees peninsula once again suffered in a very big way.  This peninsula is a major tourist area and its future is seriously threatened by continued coastal erosion.  That has been added to by the recent storms.  Over the past 20 years this problem has been highlighted, but nothing has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now at a crisis stage.  A deputation <Col N="581" /> of concerned residents recently appeared before Kerry County Council, once again highlighting their situation and seeking immediate funding.  However, under the Coastal Protection Act, 1963, local authorities are requested to put up 50 per cent of the cost of coastal protection work. Kerry County Council, like other local authorities, are not in a position to contribute this type of funding.  I would hope to see this Act amended, thus reducing the subvention of local authorities from 50 per cent to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Other areas seriously affected in Kerry include Ballyheigue and Ballybunion, where again coastal erosion is an ongoing problem and the recent storms have not helped.  Over the past number of years Kerry County Council have spent in excess of £100,000 on coastal work.  A recent estimate presented by the county engineer to the members of Kerry County Council indicated that he would need in excess of £1 million to carry out remedial work as a result of the storms. Here I hope assistance would be forthcoming from the Government.</P>
    <P>Twenty five years ago Kerry County Council submitted a list of priority works to the Office of Public Works, but to date not one of these schemes has got under way.  It is now accepted in Kerry that unless immediate action is taken the Maharees peninsula will become an island.  I am stressing the position of the Maharees because we have got several commitments over the years to help solve this problem, but as I said already, nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transfer of the responsibility for coastal protection from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  I look forward to a coastal protection programme being drawn up for the whole country.  The recent storm damage has also added to the problems at Fenit Harbour.  This is a major harbour servicing the commercial life of Kerry and the surrounding counties. There are 34 people employed on a casual basis on the docks.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to highlight the position of Fenit Pier.  Commercial ships cannot berth until two hours before high <Col N="582" /> water and two hours after high water. The same applies to fishing craft.  The shippers using the port are refusing to send their boats to Fenit Harbour, fearing damage.  The dockers and their families are worried about their future employment, as this is locally regarded now as a dead-end.  A recent submission has been made by the workers through their trade unions to the Minister for his personal attention.  I would appreciate very much if he would consider acceding to the request for a special grant, thus guaranteeing the future of this port.</P>
    <P>Ballyheigue and Ballybunion have also been seriously damaged as a result of the storm.  Both are major tourist resorts. Here again remedial work is urgently needed until such time as a comprehensive programme can be formulated with a view to averting further damage to the two particular areas.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by many small farmers that they are not now and have not been for some time, in a position to get insurance for farm buildings, hay sheds and other outhouses, although they could get comprehensive insurance for their houses and garages.  It was impossible for them to get insurance cover other than insurance against fire and lighting on farm buildings.  Storm and flooding was excluded by all the major insurance brokers.  I would appreciate if the Minister would have this aspect of insurance cover investigated.  As a result, a small number of these people had buildings damaged which were not covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent statement by the Minister that a report was being put together by Teagasc and the other farm development services on the actual losses.  I hope that when these surveys are being considered by the Cabinet sub-committee, before being presented to the Government, we can look forward to action.</P>
    <P>I understand that our MEPs are discussing the serious effects of flooding and storm damage.  In view of the fact that the likelihood of so many people has been affected, every effort should be made to get direct funding from the EC.  The areas <Col N="583" /> that have been affected in this country are now areas of disaster.  I hope that these areas which are not already designated as severely handicapped will be so designated and that the farmers in the area will benefit.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the recent statement of the Minister for Finance that the EC have granted a total of £153,000 for disaster relief but this is a very small amount.  I hope that as a result of present discussion taking place in Europe the amount will be substantially increased. The moneys already allocated will be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society on the strict criteria laid down by the EC Commission.  I would also like to be associated with compliments to the local authorities and in my case, Kerry County Council, for the manner in which they responded to the problems created by recent storm damage and flooding.  The Garda, the Civil Defence and the local defence forces all played a major part and deserve our sincere thanks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to approach this very serious matter from the point of view of its national implications, which are very great.  I accept the various parochial matters that have been highlighted.  They are important.  I will be referring to a few of them, time permitting.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with the farming organisations and various other bodies who have been doing an indepth study of the whole loss situation they have put together a picture of the position as it seems at this point.  The minimum &mdash; and I underline the minimum &mdash; loss in the agricultural sector would be of the order of £10 million and could be as high as £20 million.  These figures are rather alarming and very far removed, unfortunately, from what I believe to be the acceptance by Government of the losses sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the Government, through the Minister, I will give some breakdown of figures of structural damage.  These are factual figures as recent as of yesterday.  Two thousand <Col N="584" /> claims were reported to insurance companies. One of these claims will be in excess of six figures.  The total estimated cost of these claims will be something like £2.75 million.  That, as a starting out point, is enormous.  Added to that, 50 per cent of the farmers of this country are not insured.  These farmers regrettably are located in the west and in the north-west. We have a very serious situation there.  In the context of structural damages one could be talking about a further £2 million or £4.75 million in all.</P>
    <P>As far as land damage is concerned, there has been a minimum of 300,000 acres flooded for at least a two week period, and perhaps nearer to three weeks.  With a conservative estimate based on absolute facts, the loss in production during the current year, 1990, will be about £4.5 million.  Water remains on the lands and the necessity for crops to be replaced and some of the grasses reseeded will be expensive.</P>
    <P>Approximately 1.5 million sheep have lambed, with nearly 300 million sheep to lamb over the next two months or thereabouts.  Throughout the country a considerable number of young lambs and sheep have been lost.  There has been a massive increase in what is known as the twin lamb disease.  The losses on the sheep side would reach around £1.66 million. Many cattle have been killed by roofs blowing off sheds.  The estimated loss under this heading will be about £500,000.</P>
    <P>The question of feed was referred to earlier.  It is no harm to remind ourselves that there are approximately seven million cattle in Ireland.  If we estimated that approximately 40 per cent of these animals have to be fed an extra 1 kg per day in order to maintain their normal live weight gain and that 50 per cent of the sheep in the country have to be fed an extra 0.25 kg per day to maintain their weight for a period of one month the total cost would be about £1.2 million.  Of course, the biggest expenditure that will be confronting farmers will be the increased cost for hay and silage.  Yards containing silage and hay sheds have been flooded.  There have been massive losses <Col N="585" /> in this area.  On a conservative estimate, taking into account that fodder costs will be increased by as much as 150 per cent, farmers will incur a total bill for fodder of about £11 million.  If we take all these figures into account one would reach about £20 million.  As I said at the beginning, the absolute minimum would be £10 million.  Nobody could say definitely that it is going to be £20 million.  Some of the losses have not yet surfaced.  Many houses have had their structures undermined. The real extent of the damage has not been shown.  Many trees are barely standing.  Apart from the hundreds of acres that still remain flooded, land generally is not passable.  As the Minister will know as a practical farmer, flooded land cannot be travelled.  Hopefully, if we get a few more days like today things will change but land cannot be travelled for the application of fertilisers or for the routine matters that should be attended to at this time of year.</P>
    <P>The flooding of homes, be it in Limerick, Tipperary, Wexford or Dublin is a very serious matter.  Quite frankly, I do not think one can put a figure on the compensation that those persons should get in order to relieve them of the misery and the mess they have suffered.  The roads have been seriously undermined. This is a long-term matter.  The roads have been so damaged it may be next year or the year after before the erosion caused by this flooding will have become obvious and major problems will have arisen.  Many houses have been severely battered and they could well be quite unsafe while appearing to be absolutely normal.  I would submit that the Government should make a very strong case to Europe so that we will get something meaningful by way of compensation.  It is a gross insult that our country is offered £153,000 to meet all these costs.</P>
    <P>In my own part of the country, the River Mulcair broke its banks in a number of places.  Several hundred acres were flooded for long periods.  The river was supposed to have been drained year after year for the past 25 years to 30 years.  I have a clear recollection of that.</P>
    <P>The country, in the context of tourism, <Col N="586" /> agriculture and industry has again been severely affected.  I appeal to our Government to go to Europe, and to make the kind of case that needs to be made to get meaningful compensation for the very severe losses we have sustained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the opportunity to raise the issue of the storm damage caused as a result of gale force winds and torrential rain.  This storm has caused serious inconvenience both to farms and private dwellings.  Many cattle sheds had their roofs blown off, silage pit roofs were also blown off, pig houses were badly damaged and mushroom houses were torn apart by the strong winds.  Poultry units were also damaged, and indeed poultry perished as a result of the ESB power failures.  The gale force winds blew down many trees.  Some of them fell on sheds and some on dwelling houses and caused considerable damage to property, telephone lines and ESB lines.  On the domestic scene a number of dwelling houses have been badly damaged with slates blown off and windows blown in.  Also, TV aerials were blown down by the gale force winds.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to the problems caused by flooding following the torrential rain.  Monaghan and Cavan were very badly affected.  I wish to draw particular attention to the Dromore River that flows between Ballybay and Cootehill.  This river never flooded as badly as it has flooded in the past two to five years.  There is a problem on this river to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  There is a permanent weir erected at Cootehill and this weir should be lowered in the winter and raised in the summer to keep the levels of the water at a particular level.  The waters are blocked up in the winter months.  The water is rising upstream towards Ballybay, flooding a lot of land, roadways and laneways, and leaving individual dwellings and farmyards impassable.  These people over the past two or three years have been grounded. They could not get to or from their farms. This is a very serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> The county roads have suffered dramatically as a result of the torrential rain. Flooding has caused a lot of damage to these roads in Monaghan and Cavan. Because of the drumlin-type soils there, there is not the same drainage in the ground as in other parts of the country. We are suffering badly.  Our roads are in a dreadful state and are getting worse. This last storm has caused complete havoc on our roads.  I would like to tell the Minister that we were glad of the allocation we got earlier this year in the Estimates.  However, I have to point out that the roads are ten times worse now than ever before.  I ask the Minister to consider the state of the roads in Cavan and Monaghan to see what he could come up with to resolve the situation.  I would also ask him to look at the possibility of making a hardship fund available to assist people to restore their buildings and property damaged as a result of the bad storms we had over the last number of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to look at County Limerick in relation to storm damage over past few weeks we would be talking about a very modest estimate of £1.2 million.  All Limerick County Council are doing with that money is to bring conditions back to what they were before the storm.  The moneys are going totally on the improvement of roads and bridges.  Let us compare that figure with the derisory sum of £120,000, which has now increased to £153,000.  It is about 0.5 per cent.  The initial estimate of £200 million nationally is now being revised as more and more detailed submissions regarding drainage flooding come in from county councils and corporations throughout the country.  To bring a county road back to a decent condition would cost £120,000, for six miles of such road; that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Limerick County Council alone we have 1,800 miles of county road.  That puts it in the context the money coming from the disaster relief fund.  The Minister for the Environment, from what I read of his Dáil response, considers that <Col N="588" /> the reaction of the Government over the past number of years related to storm damage was quite adequate.  He talked about £1 million since the 1987 storms by way of assistance towards the cost of remedial works to public roads being quite adequate.</P>
    <P>Let us talk very briefly about potholes nationally.  What is going to happen?  First and foremost, pothole filling is a waste of good money.  Already within an hour of pothole filling, with the storms, the winds, the rains, etc. we have, the fillings are just blown out.  So it is just a complete waste of time, as far as I am concerned, to even bother trying to bring those roads back up and even to fill those potholes. The most interesting comment that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, made was when he talked about the fund being symbolic. The roads of Ireland, too, are symbolic. They are a symbolism of a country that is not categorised as Third World but really is Third World in regard to its infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There is no compensation, according again to Minister Flynn, for agricultural damage.  He says that the relief disaster fund is not for infrastructural projects or remedial schemes.  He says, rightly, that the primary objective is to bring urgent aid to community residents who are the victims of natural catastrophes recognised as being of exceptional scale and gravity.  That is fine, but it does not address the issue of the millions being quantified now as money necessary to redress the problems.</P>
    <P>The insurance situation has been dealt with by Senator Hourigan and I will not go into it.  What is the brief of the working committee of Government Departments in their joint effort to address this issue?. There is also a reference in one of the reports that INVIRIC has been mentioned as a possible source of funding.  I would refer again to the Mulcaire basin. This is a saga in the County Limerick area.  It is now within the folklore of locals &mdash; it goes back in history &mdash; in regard to promises from many Governments over the past number of years on the proposed drainage of that county.  I heard an MEP saying the other day that it was just snipe <Col N="589" /> grass and bogland.  I would invite him to walk the banks of the Mulcaire and he will not see a snipe or a bit of snipe grass or bogland.  What he will see is potential agricultural land that should be brought back into production.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council spent £100,000 per year to keep the river banks from being breached.  They have not been breached by this flood, but the ponding up of waters from subsidiary streams actually has caused 20,000 acres to be flooded.  I would consider resources to Limerick County Council on an ongoing basis of £100,000 a waste of money in the same way as pothole filling is a waste of money.  Minister Daly walked the banks of the Mulcaire the other day, I was not very far behind him.  All I can say is that, if he is talking about proposed marinas in his part of the country, County Clare, he has a natural marina as a result of the flooding the other day.  He could really leave it as such and forget about the drainage of the Mulcaire.  We would accept that at this stage.  We certainly are not going to go into the next century with the saga continuing.  My own area of Castletroy again has been flooded.  The city itself, which is not in the same category of Cork for flooding, thank God, has been affected very much by high estuarial waters.</P>
    <P>There is the danger of effluent contamination in the Limerick area where the city dump has been flooded.  What is going to happen there if dump effluent is going to be washed into the soils?  Live-stocks have been removed from the area.</P>
    <P>The plight of the farmers has been well documented by speakers over the last while.  All I can say is that they have already been hit by poor silage growth this year due to the drought.  Again, the benefits of basic annual dressing of fertilizers on land which has been subsequently flooded will for the most part be lost, because the nutrients will be washed away.  I really forecast poor times for farmers.</P>
    <P>No reference has been made to the climatic problems.  I would not be able to quantify why we have such extraordinary catastrophical climatic reactions.  We <Col N="590" /> could talk forever about the ozone layer. I heard Senator Ross say yesterday that the debate on the storm was untimely, looking out at what he considered was a calm spring day.  I cannot forecast that we are going to have calm weather between this and next year.  The greatest climatologists at the moment are not in a position to give us a global forecast for climate.</P>
    <P>What we must do now is to put pressure on what I would regard as the three people most effective as regards wielding power in this area &mdash; the Taoiseach, particularly in the light of the six month Presidency, likewise our Commissioner in Brussels; and, of course, the Minister for Agriculture.  I would hope that they would push as hard as they can to do something for us.  We are an island nation, but we are in danger of being actually blotted out if we are to be affected by continuous storms over the next while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good idea that this debate is taking place.  We are all aware of the severe damage and problems which have been caused by the storms over the last number of months. It has been a particularly ferocious time, between rain and wind and various problems. I would like to deal generally with the problems and then specifically with the situation that has arisen in the Dún Laoghaire area.  I hope that when the Minister goes back to discuss it with the officials in his Department he will be able to bring some specific points to their attention.</P>
      <P>First, I welcome the setting up of a sub-committee of the Departments mainly concerned &mdash; Marine, Agriculture, Environment and, more importantly, Finance.  At the end of the day the big problem will be that of providing the extra money to deal with the situation. Big money will be involved in order to repair the damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the country there is not a village nor a townland that has not experienced some problem.  My colleagues here, Senator Hourigan and <Col N="591" /> Senator Jackman, have outlined the difficulties in their areas, in particular in relation to the agriculture industry, problems which are probably adding to the woes of some farmers in these difficult times.  Obviously, it is important that the Cabinet sub-committee which has been set up should very quickly be able to get together to assess the problems in the various areas.  It is to be hoped that there can then be a response.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that householders cannot necessarily obtain money from his Department.  Hopefully they have sufficient insurance to cover their loss and damage.  If there is going to be a rash of claims, the fact is that we are probably all going to have to pay for it to a greater or lesser degree.  The reality is that we have no control over the elements.  Obviously, we can take preventative measures.  It is to be hoped that the local authorities in every area will have learned from their experiences, so that where bad flooding or damage is caused by a particular problem some remedial measures can be taken for the future.  It is important that we learn from the past couple of months and, if there is to be a repeat of this in the future, hopefully it will be less damaging because of steps we can take.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the various bodies who have assisted at times. Sometimes it is literally at a couple of hours' notice, or less, that people can find themselves in various predicaments. Members of the Garda, the Army, the Fire Brigade, Civil Defence and other bodies have helped out and helped people to get by.  We have seen some horrific pictures on the television of flooding and of people being stranded. Our thanks must go to all those who have assisted.</P>
    <P>In the general Dún Laoghaire area the damage is estimated by the corporation officials at about £250,000.  The damage has been caused in quite a number of areas going from Seapoint out towards Dalkey.  There has been quite a lot of damage to various piers.  Literally whole faces of rock and walls have been broken <Col N="592" /> and damaged.  Because the area is near the sea and because of the DART line quick remedial action is very difficult and also very costly.  I would ask the Minister, when he gets in the Dún Laoghaire report, to try to give it as urgent attention as possible because there have been great problems there.  To gain access to this area is sometimes quite difficult for the officials.  Some of the work would have to be done what we would probably call outdated methods &mdash; it would nearly have to be done by hand.</P>
    <P>Obviously, old walls and old piers which are split have to be totally replaced.  It is difficult and probably expensive work, but I would ask the Minister when he is considering the report from the Dún Laoghaire area to be as generous as he can.  I understand he has given about £20,000 for earlier works. The problem is that there are going to be quite a number of other claims.  I also understand that some of the sewer levels and sewers were moved and that gravel blocked some of the sewers, which is causing further problems.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister, along with the other Ministers on the Cabinet sub-committee, would endeavour to provide as much money as possible.  I welcome the announcement of the £1 million, but when one assesses the damage in the whole country obviously £1 million is going to fall very short of what is required.  I am sure there would be all-party support for finding extra funds in order to solve the difficulties involved.  It is important that we look towards the EC for whatever money can be provided.  I know there are strict guidelines laid down as to how the money can be used; but hopefully the scheme can be broadened so that the money can be provided in the various cases.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the very difficult situation throughout the country.  We all want to see as good a response as possible. I believe there will be general all-party support for the Minister, the Government and the Cabinet in responding as generously as possible and providing the extra money.  I would also hope that as a result of the lessons we have <Col N="593" /> learned from this unfortunate and costly experience, the country will ultimately benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>As one would expect in times of high wind and heavy rainfall, the west did not escape lightly in any way.  I listened with interest to what the Minister had to say and I particularly noted the fact that he said there was no help available to private individuals. However, I would like to raise a question here regarding the damage caused to property particularly in west Connemara, and, more particularly, in both the Aran Islands and the island of Inisbofin.  For two reasons these cases are hardship cases.</P>
      <P>The first is that there has not been a tradition in these areas for private insurance.  The second is that it is difficult at times in some of these areas to get private insurance for storm damage on properties.  I have letters from people who have literally lost the roof off premises and houses and who are suffering grave financial loss as a consequence. Particularly on the islands, the cost of repairing any structure of that nature would be double that on the mainland because of the cost of transporting raw materials and building materials to the islands.</P>
      <P>The second area I would like to address myself to is the damage caused by the very heavy rainfall to the infrastructure in Connemara, and particularly to the damage caused to the roads of Connemara because of the exceptionally high rainfall.  We have been suffering from an infrastructure that is continually worsening due to a deterioration in our road structure over the years.  Every time we get heavy flooding more of our roads are washed away.  There is one valley where the parents are in a position where they reckon unless immediate remedial action is taken, they will not be able to send their children to school.  I would, however, like to thank the Minister for the very generous help given last year which enabled Galway County Council to replace expeditiously a bridge that was destroyed in a flood last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> On the question of piers, I would particularly like to raise the extremely hazardous situation that has arisen in connection with the Kilmurvey Pier at Inishmore.  Tá an cé seo i ndrochaoi le fada ach tá sé fíor-chontúirteach anois, ní hamháin do mhuintir an oileáin ach do na cuairteoirí uilig a théann go dtí an oileán sin sa samhradh.  Creidim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go gcuirfear caoi ar an gcé seo ionas go bhféadfaí é a usáid arís agus ionas nach mbeidh sé ina chontúirt do chuile dhuine a thabharfaidh cuairt ar Oileán Árainn.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thagraimíd don taobh thoir den chontae, ní dóigh liom gur gá dom tagairt mhór a dhéanamh don dochar atá déanta ag tuillte sa chuid sin den chontae.</P>
    <P>The extreme hardship suffered by the people of the eastern part of the Galway West area due to flooding caused by the recent rains has now been well recorded. In south Galway schools have been closed for several weeks now because of serious flooding.  The situation of the farmers in these areas is very serious.  The problem that has to be addressed is that, whereas the total number of farmers that are affected might not be great, there are some individual farmers who have suffered great loss due to the recent flooding. It is important that something be done to save these people's livelihood as it is impossible to insure land against this type of damage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that there are certain areas and stretches of road that perennially flood and it is time we addressed ourselves to these problems. The areas of public road, particularly of main road, that flood regularly should be identified and long-term remedial action should be taken so that this problem does not recur.  In some cases this can be done by the simple expedient of raising the road slightly.  In other areas what is needed is drainage to allow the water to escape.  It would be expedient if money were allocated this year so that this problem could be addressed and we would not have to face it on an annual basis.  It is very inconvenient for people to find that main roads are cut off for three to four weeks at a time or to find that houses <Col N="595" /> are isolated by flooding.  Even though it might not be possible to treat this as an emergency once the waters recede, these problems should not be left on the long finger but they should be addressed in years to come.  If possible they should be addressed this year and a final solution found to them.</P>
    <P>Tá an-áthas orm go raibh an deis seo agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo agus ba mhaith liom an t-Aire a mholadh as chomh scioptha agus a d'éirigh leis an fhadhb seo a réiteach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his contribution on the storm damage problem.  I have to say in all honesty to the House and to the Minister that it is my view and the view of many people that the Government's response to the storm damage was, to say the least, tardy. I am convinced that the Government did not react initially with sufficient haste and seriousness until the problem was brought to their notice after some time. The most dramatic sign of Government indifference to the storm at the outset was the fact that Minister Kirk on the national airwaves and in the national media said he did not believe there was a problem, or words to that effect.  That was very unfortunate.  I would welcome the Cabinet sub-committee, but the fact that they have not reported even now is regrettable.  The matter is of extreme urgency and the message going out from this Chamber this evening should be that it can wait no longer, we need an immediate report.  We need immediate action. We need activity by Government.</P>
      <P>In previous cases, most noticably a few years ago when my own party were in power, there was an equally bad storm, if not a worse storm, and the response at that time was extremely brisk and effective. I am glad the Government are at last taking the issue seriously, but I urge the Minister and the Cabinet and, most particularly the subcommittee and the Taoiseach, to act with haste, and get the money to the people in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Storm damage on a national level cost agriculture something in the region of £10 <Col N="596" /> million.  In the west and the north-west 50 per cent of the farmers are not insured against storm.  The effects are long-term as well.  It is worth making the point that all this damage, all this disturbance and all this destruction of the livelihood of small farmers in the west and the north-west, happened at a time when many of our small farmers are in the poverty trap and living below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>The storm, as you know, pre-dominently took the form of flooding and gales.  In some cases there were landslides. In my own constituency there was a landslide into a local river which caused immense flooding.  There has been flooding of agricultural land a great deal of land is under water in large areas of the country, and there has been great damage to crops, fodder, livestock generally, farm buildings and the land itself.  We have a problem with flooding of agricultural land and with flooding in general, and the effect of the gale force winds on agricultural buildings.</P>
    <P>One of the very serious problems in my own constituency of Cavan/Monaghan is the fact that we have a crisis with our road structure.  I have drawn this matter to the House's attention on many previous occasions.  I am genuinely not being colourful or exaggerating when I say that County Cavan has a chronic problem with potholed roads, roads that would make the Tibetan passes of India look luxurious, with broken down road structures, potholes and subsidence of road structures.</P>
    <P>Where the flooding and bad weather presents a chronic problem it will make an already desperate road situation much worse.  I brought this matter to the House's attention in an emergency debate previously.  Because the professional engineering and administrative staff of the local authority and, indeed, experts from the Department of the Environment, are of the view that it would take something in the region of £7 million per year on a rolling programme for the next five years to bring the roads of County Cavan into a reasonable condition, you can appreciate the impact of the storms on them.  The storms have <Col N="597" /> made a very bad situation a lot worse. They have aggravated a very bad situation. I would like to hear the Minister's reponse to this.  I appeal to him to bring the view to Government that in the case of County Cavan &mdash; and I am not being hysterical, parochial or unreasonable about this, where an already broken down road structure is broken down to a much greater degree, something needs to be done.  In his address to the Seanad the Minister drew attention to some discretionary funds at the disposal of county councils for dealing with storm damage in the case of roads.  The position in my constituency is of great seriousness.  The issue was raised recently in tourist boards.  It has been raised in the national media.  It has been raised in all sorts of rural organisations, and in all political parties.  It is not something I decided to bring to the House's attention in a unilateral way.  It is an accepted problem. The discretionary funding granted to Cavan County Council would do nothing towards alleviating the specific difficulties of that county.  I want the Minister to note that in addressing this question.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an immediate response from the Government.  I hope we will have an immediate compensation structure put in place for the victims of storm damage and that something will then be done with the infrastructure broken down by the storm, and particularly the roads that have been adversely affected by the flooding over the last number of weeks.  I look forward to hearing the Minister address that specific area of difficulty in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  His presence here indicates the seriousness with which he and the Government take this problem.  I compliment the Government on their action in that a number of measures have been put in place.  Local government, which is an arm of Government, have been up front on the issue.  Our county and city managers &mdash; I speak in particular about my own county manager and his staff &mdash; were very much on top of the situation and they are to be commended.  I assume that action was also taken by other county managers throughout the country.  The <Col N="598" /> Government have set up a subcommittee which is welcome.  The extent of damage cannot be fully evaluated until the floods subside.  The sub-committee will then be in a position to indicate to us all their final analysis of the situation.</P>
      <P>I come from an area in south Roscommon, which is bordered on one side by the Shannon and on the other side by the Suck.  It is an area well known for flooding.  It would be unusual if we did not have a few floods each year; there have been occasions when we have had up to six floods in a year.  However, we are reliably informed that the flooding this year equals, if not surpasses, the big flood of 1954.  At that time many people had to be moved because of the severity of the flooding.  Many houses were flooded and a considerable number of people had to get temporary accommodation. The Government helped out then and families were resettled in areas on higher ground.  We had three families on this occasion, one of them in a new house which was only built in the last five years, who had to be moved.  That shows the severity of the floods in the area.  We are unfortunate as the Shannon is narrow in that area and the floods spread out over our territory and into the Minister's territory also.  He is well aware of the situation in his own county.  His constituents and mine have had to endure the problems of flooding during the years.</P>
      <P>We had the further problem this time in that we had a storm with the flooding. To give an indication of how severe that storm was, during the month of February in our county 130 trees had to be dealt with by the staff of Roscommon County Council.  That added to the work and responsibility of area engineers and of outdoor staff, supervisors and workers. Apart from that boats had to be provided to bring essential supplies and to make contact with villages and houses that were cut off.  We still have a number of villages cut off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have any record of flooding in Roscommon on the last occasion. When flooding occurs there can be broad and emotive statements made on a national basis but if people confine their observations to the areas they know and for which they have responsibility, we <Col N="599" /> will get a truer picture.  For that reason I have investigated every case in the county where people have been affected by the flooding and the storm.  We found villages in the good uplands of Dysart and Taugh-maconnell that got cut off.  The only reason for that was that there are underground rivers and when the flood got high this spread out.  Villages that would normally be considered to be in the good uplands of south Roscommon were cut off.</P>
    <P>Our county engineer and county manager have estimated that the cost of the emergency services to the county is something in the region of £35,000.  That was their initial sum.  They say that the cost of a restoration work is in the region of £200,000.  Many roads have been damaged and culverts and some drainage work done on the side of roads, to alleviate flooding in the past, have now silted up.  We have much work to do when this flood is over and there will be considerable cost involved.  I have no doubt that with co-operation and consultation between the Department, county managers and county engineers matters can be resolved.  It is important that we highlight them as there may be remedial work or there may be preventative work to be done so that this will not happen again. We have identified in each county maybe ten or 12 different locations where expenditure of a small amount of money would raise a road for 100 yards or 200 yards, and in some cases for only 30 or 40 yards, that would exclude future flooding.</P>
    <P>We have an area prone to flooding known as the Clonown area.  I am sure many Members know the area; they may have heard of it for its carrots, but we know it better for its flooding.  It has been the situation that during the years every time there was a flashflood an entire farm, except for an acre or two, has been flooded.  The owners have put up with hardship, not just this year but every year.  They have had a very severe situation this year as the amount of ground left available to them for farming has been cut to the minimum.  I know of some farmers who are down to an acre or two. Our agricultural office and our county manager estimate that there are 16,478 <Col N="600" /> acres affected by the floods in the Shannon Valley of Roscommon and in the Suck Valley.  That is a lot of land.  While in some cases the flood will go down and there may not be any great damage, in other cases reseeding may be needed.  It is at a later stage we will be able to evaluate that.</P>
    <P>I ask that the matter be taken on board. We have efficient people in local government. I found them very responsible in times of emergency when matters had to be dealt with.  We have to row in with our county engineers and our county managers. On this occasion they did a good job.  When they make their submissions I ask that they be evaluated and seriously considered so that we can set in place measures to prevent such flooding in the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Senators for their contributions to this debate.  There is no doubt that the bad weather over recent months has caused problems throughout the country.  Many aspects of day-to-day living have suffered a disruption and many people have experienced hardship. I will be drawing to the attention of the relevant Ministers and the Government the various points raised.  The two last speakers come from a rural constituency like my own.  I appreciate their problems as I appreciate the problems of those other Members who have spoken.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to road grants.  In regard to discretionary grants this year, Cavan received a 57 per cent increase on last year or a special supplementary improvement of £500,000. These are the facts.  The overall increase in road funds by my Department to Cavan County Council was 33 per cent. I had to find the money but I was glad to be able to help.  I do not want to get into too controversial a debate.  When we come into office in 1987 the money allocated to county roads by the previous Administration was only a paltry £7 million. What is it today?  These are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions from some Members of the Seanad would lead one to believe that the Government have been in some way negligent in their response to <Col N="601" /> weather induced difficulties.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  To illustrate this, let me take Senators back to the severe weather of August 1986.  Then, following severe flooding in southern and eastern areas of the country in the wake of Hurricane Charlie, the Government, following receipt of reports and estimates of damage to public roads and bridges, provided road grants totally £6,449,000 which were notified in October 1986.  In making these allocations account was taken of flood damage, which had occurred earlier in 1986, and in other areas of the country.</P>
    <P>In October 1987 Donegal County Council were given some leeway in the use of grants for county roads to help them finance remedial works arising from floods during that month.  The next bad bout of weather occurred during the latter part of 1988.  Again the Government reacted positively to the urgency of the situation and £1.5 million was allocated in 1989 for remedial works to public roads and bridges in the counties affected.</P>
    <P>May I remind the House of my earlier statement?  Following the damage caused by the storms over the October bank holiday weekend, when areas of the north west experienced extremely heavy rainfalls and storms which hit the east and south coasts on 16 and 17 December last. The Minister notified local authorities throughout the country of road grants totalling £1 million by way of assistance towards the cost of remedial works to public roads and bridges affected.</P>
    <P>In all cases the road funding involved had to be met within the provisions already available to the Department.  No special additional Exchequer funds were provided.  This is the record of a Government who are aware of the problems and are prepared to respond positively and with a sense of urgency to crisis situations. To suggest that the Government have not responded or shown any recognition of the problems caused by the recent adverse weather is just not true.</P>
    <P>I will not belabour the fact of the establishment of a special Cabinet sub-committee except to say that the speed with which the consultative and assessment <Col N="602" /> process, which I detailed earlier, was carried out, hardly reflects an uncaring attitude. Because of the comments of some of the Senators, I believe I must repeat some of my remarks about the EC disaster fund.  The fund does not cover damage to public structures.  It does not compensate for damage to property and is not for infrastructural projects or remedial schemes.</P>
    <P>The principal objective of the fund is to provide urgent aid to the Community residents who are the victims of natural catastrophes that are recognised as being of exceptional scale and gravity.  The fund is largely symbolic in that it represents a testimony of a solidarity of the other peoples of the Community to those members who find themselves in a situation of profound material and moral distress. The budgetary resources of the fund are tiny, amounting in 1990 to some £3.1 million approximately, in respect of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>In deciding to intervene in any case the factors that are taken into account by the EC Commission are the extent of loss of life, the numbers made homeless and the degree of hardship suffered by those affected.  The fund does not purport to offer strict compensation for the damage suffered by victims.  Last Tuesday night in the Dáil, the Minister for Finance announced that the EC had granted a total of £153,000 in disaster relief following the recent storms.  I can tell Senators that these moneys will be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society on strict criteria laid down, not by the Government, but by the EC Commission. May I advise the House that in 1986 the amount provided by the EC under this heading was £114,000 and that the then Government did not regard that as derisory.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, last year the Minister for the Environment gave the local authority members more say in how discretionary grants should be spent.  I am glad to say that in being able to use these funds in many of the local authorities, the members decide on the priorities. That is the way it should be.  I would like to point out also that the health boards helped out very well throughout the country in this recent bad weather, with <Col N="603" /> flooding and all of that, and provided a very good service.  That is recognised by all of us.  I fully realise that the flooding had a bad effect on roads and on bridges throughout the country.  As I said earlier, all this has been assessed.  As far as the Department of the Environment are concerned we have got all the necessary information from the local authorities. That has gone to the Government now. We will see what we can do.  Senators can take it that the Government will be making a decision on this matter very shortly.  I stated at the outset I understand the situation that Senators Finneran, O'Reilly, Foley and others mentioned.  I understand the great hardship it caused to many.  We will endeavour to see what can be done.  That will rest with the Cabinet. I expect a decision on it shortly.</P>
    <P>There was some mention about buildings being blown down and other damage caused to farm buildings especially. That, as far as I know, was always covered by insurance, householder and farm policy insurance.  That is what insurance companies are for.  As far as I know, the farming community especially are very well advised by their organisations on that.  Maybe now could be the time to have a look at that matter.  If cover of that nature is not on those buildings and property, now is the time to seek advice from the insurance companies. I am sympathetically disposed. There are a number of other Departments as I stated at the outset involved in it also.  I expect a decision very shortly on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give some time to my colleague Senator Upton and also Senator Cosgrave if he is in the House.  I <Col N="604" /> would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for giving us this opportunity of having a debate on the Adjournment on this issue and I am delighted to see the Minister for Justice here.</P>
      <P>I would like to offer my condolences to the family of Sharon Gregg, the first woman who has died in a prison in the history of the State and to remark on a very alarming increase in deaths in prison.</P>
      <P>Any of the remarks I have to make I do not want the Minister to take them too closely to heart.  He has been recently installed in his job.  I hold successive Administrations collectively responsible for the extremely serious state of the prison system at the present time and there is no section of that prison system that is more appalling than the women's prison in Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I must state categorically that I am calling for the closure of that prison today.  I spent the morning and early afternoon in the women's prison in Mountjoy and what I saw there has convinced me that there is no alternative to the closure.  I know the Minister has suggested that there are proposals for refurbishment, renovation, an updating of the prison but to my mind it is not possible to refurbish the women's prison in Mountjoy.  It is simply not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an ancient arcade, a 140-year old prison that is described by the women themselves and indeed a lot of others involved in the system, as a kip, if Senators will excuse the word.  It is overcrowded. There are 22 cells.  There are small cells where women are crowded together into a very close proximity. They are dreary.  There is inadequate ventilation.  There is a section for the women who are HIV positive, who have the virus.  In all, you have got remand prisoners, convicted prisoners, young girls from the age of 15, 17 or 18, girls who would be otherwise detained in a juvenile institution if they were of the opposite sex, along with older prisoners. There are first offenders with multiple offenders and recidivists.  I believe that we are in breach of the recently signed United Nations Convention on Civil and Political Rights in relation to the lack of segregation between remand prisoners <Col N="605" /> and convicted prisoners.  That is something the Minister should take on board. There is also a major problem of people in the prison for drug-related offences.</P>
    <P>One of the serious aspects is that quite a number of women in the prison would have been on maintenance programmes in the communty but now they are refusing to continue on those maintenance programmes.  For the relatively short time they are serving their sentences &mdash; the average sentence would be in the range of 12 months &mdash; they are in a continual state of withdrawal and are suffering from withdrawal symptoms. There is no valid reason that the doctor cannot continue the programme that was prescribed by a medical doctor outside prison.  It is just not good enough.  It can be done in the male section, but it is not done in the women's section.  This gives rise to all sorts of harassment, stress and rows and leads to punishment and to very serious incidents involved in punishment.</P>
    <P>One serious matter was described to me today by a couple of women there and I must ask the Minister to investigate it, there must be an inquiry into it, in the past month two girls were suffering from withdrawal symptoms, one of them lost her head, as she put it herself, and she was subject to punishment, one month's loss of remission and she was locked up for 20 days from 4.30 p.m. to 8 a.m. which is a period of 15½ hours.  She said also that her hands were held behind her back by two male prison officers, that she was taken up to the punishment unit, which is known as the black hole where there is no natural light, and was stripped by male officers.  This is what the girl alleged to me.  Two other girls made allegations of the same nature.  They also alleged that they had put in half sheets but had not been replied to.  I have to ask the Minister to investigate those very serious complaints.  There must be a question mark about the use of male prison officers in the female prison.  Why is there a need for them there? The female prisoners perceive them as the &ldquo;heavies&rdquo; who are there in the event of an emotional scene taking place or any bit of trouble and they are always seen as a threatening presence.  That was mentioned to me <Col N="606" /> repeatedly while I visited there.  We should think in terms of not having male prison officers there.</P>
    <P>The question of boredom seems to be the most pervasive aspect of the prison system.  Most complaints were about having nothing to do all day long.  The sewing room is an absolute disgrace. Likewise the laundry where the women were huddled together around a stove for warmth.  The prefabricated room used for education is totally inadequate.  On a wet day the rain is coming through and classes have to be abandoned.  There is always a waiting list for classes and on average a prisoner can attend for about half an hour a week.  That is an absolute disgrace and something must be done about it.</P>
    <P>Prisoners complained that they had not seen the visiting committee in months.  It is the specific statutory function of the visiting committee to visit once a month. They have indicated that one or two individual members have come but as they have not seen the visiting committee as a body, to whom can they make complaints about conditions?  One woman stated to me that she had been trying to get somebody from the Rape Crisis Centre to see her because of problems she was experiencing as a result of having been raped shortly before her conviction and that the Rape Crisis Centre had tried to get in but had been refused permission. That is another allegation that I would like to see investigated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that all of these factors and matters relating to the conditions under which the women are detained accumulate; the boredom, the drugs, the hassle, the close proximity of one person to another, the small cells, the higgledy-piggledy nature of the prison where there is no segregation and no privacy.  All of these combined lead to enormous pressures on people, and in such circumstances it is not difficult to perceive the situation where somebody does inflict self-injury and indeed would take her life.  Self-injury seems almost to be a way of life in the prison.  It is remarkable from what I have heard that there have not been more deaths because of the degree of self-injury that has been <Col N="607" /> reported.  I must ask the Minister, therefore, to close the prison rather than refurbish it.  Thousands of pounds, or millions of pounds, spent on the women's prison in Mountjoy is not going to improve what I would regard as a place that has long outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I suggest that the Minister look first at the training unit which is in the general complex and is a modern building, as a short-term, interim arrangement, because it was intended basically as a training unit.  My information is that it operates to a lesser degree as a training unit than it should and that it is also a place where people are put whom the State generally does not accept should be in prison at all, for instance, student protesters, or farmers who are protesting or somebody like myself who was protesting on behalf of the street traders.  I spent a week there in 1987 because I would not sign a bond to keep the peace and not to engage in that again.  We are talking, in other words, about the acceptable face of the prison.  This unit is a bright and modern area and that is where the women prisoners could be put in the interim.  Then in the long term we should look closely at the recommendation of the Whitaker committee that there be alternative sanctions for most of the girls and women in prison, that there would be a type of open structure or of hostel structure for most of them who have families and that there would only be one small unit for those who are a real threat to the community. The Minister should look at that first and foremost as the way of going about it rather than his proposed measure to refurbish it.  I hope he has not made that proposal with any great degree of seriousness because I do not think it is likely to be successful.</P>
    <P>When we have a death of this nature it is not good enough for the Department of Justice or indeed the Minister for Justice, to say there is going to be an internal inquiry.  We have had an internal inquiry for every single death that has taken place in recent years.  We do not know what the outcome of those inquiries has been so how can we devise a programme unless <Col N="608" /> there is a public inquiry and the information is made available?  I have asked the Minister that in future we would have a public inquiry into matters of this nature so that the public can know what happened rather than the Department of Justice paying lip service to dealing with it and then getting off the hook by saying that an inquiry is being carried out.</P>

      <P>At the outset may I join with Senator Costello in expressing my sympathy to the family of Sharon Gregg? I also want to fully support the call from Senator Costello for the closure of the women's prison in Mountjoy.  The facilities there are quite unsuitable and inadequate. The basic structure dates back to the last century, the Famine time in this country.  The facilities are quite inadequate; prisoners of differing categories are all lumped together into the one environment &mdash; remand prisoners being kept in the same areas as convicted prisoners, prisoners with differing level of conviction are all being kept together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of that you have the appalling problem for those prisoners &mdash; I should say patients &mdash; who suffer from the HIV positive virus.  Many of the women in Mountjoy Jail at present are there for petty offences &mdash; modern enlightened thought is fairly clear that most of these women do not need a custodial environment. The Whitaker report made clear that prison should be a place of last resort and the best estimates available would indicate that a secure unit is needed for prisoners who would number less than ten, perhaps as low as five.  It seems to me to be ridiculous and appalling that of the order of 43 women are at present housed in Mountjoy.  What we are seeing in the women's prison are the end products of appalling human tradgedies; young people &mdash; many of them drug addicts, many from very difficult backgrounds, many of them with grave personal problems and some of them suffering from AIDS &mdash; find themselves in this environment which is totally <Col N="609" /> unsuitable and quite inadequate to cater for their needs.  In 1985 Whitaker made that perfectly clear and called for the closure of the women's section in Mountjoy at that stage.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing in the case of Sharon Gregg is part of a pattern.  It is part of a recurring series of tragedies. That is, as it were, the ultimate stage in the development of a whole tragic process. That tragic process begins in petty crime and walks its way through the courts, courts which are and have been totally inadequate and have been shown up to be so particularly by Justice Wine over the last few weeks.  I want to thank the Minister for taking the initiative in this case, even if I have to say that I find it less than satisfactory.  However, it is a step and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion &mdash; I wish to allow Senator Cosgrave the opportunity to contribute &mdash; I support my colleague Senator Costello's call for the immediate closure of Mountjoy Jail.  There have been very few advances or changes during the past 16 years.  The whole problem, and indeed the tragedy, has gone on long enough. The time for action is long overdue; the time for action is now.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Costello and Upton for sharing their time with me.  Like them, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Sharon Gregg on their great tragedy and loss. Obviously, I hope the Minister will look at the circumstances of this case and see what lessons can be learned.</P>
      <P>There are many women in that prison, and in prison generally, who probably should not be there.  They are not what we call habitual prisoners and different circumstances should be applied to them. Obviously for subversives or other terrorists, different rules can apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to call on the Governor to answer the allegations made here today to allay public fears.  Even if only some and not all of them are true, certain action has to be taken.  In the long term we have to see the women's prison in Mountjoy closed.  We would like to see some of the recommendations in the Whitaker report implemented as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister to look at <Col N="610" /> this matter very clearly and carefully. Unfortunately a life has been lost and what we do not want to see is further loss of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, share the concern to which deaths in prison give rise.  As for the death which has led to the debate this evening, I am sure the House will agree that the death of someone so young and in such tragic circumstances, whether it occurs in prison or in the community, must be a matter of great regret.  As an inquest into the death will take place in due course and as all matters relevant to the death will be inquired into on that occasion, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment on them in detail here.  I want to emphasise that it is a public inquest.</P>
      <P>Sensitivity to the feelings of the family and friends of the deceased, particularly so soon after the death, requires a considerable degree of reticence.  I am sure no one would wish anything to be said here that would add in any way to the distress of the bereaved.</P>
      <P>A number of points were made in the contributions by Senators Costello, Upton and Cosgrave and I would like to respond to them.  The first was the simple proposal to close the prison.  In reality you are dealing here with a number of prisoners &mdash; at least two murderers, a number involved in drug trafficking, etc. It is not a question of just closing the prison.  What does society do with these prisoners is the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as meeting the Governor is concerned, I visited that prison over two months ago and have had discussions with the Governor on a number of occasions, and in a general sense with the governors of all the prisons.  I learned this afternoon at approximately 3.15 p.m. of an allegation which has been repeated in the House now by Senator Costello that male prison officers were involved in stripping a female prisoner.  I immediately checked with the Governor of Mountjoy who denies that male officers could be present during the strip searching of female prisoners. I find the mere suggestion that such a thing could happen personally unacceptable.  The Governor denies that <Col N="611" /> it could possibly happen.  However, I have immediately ordered an inquiry under the principal officer on the operations side of my Department to investigate the complaint and I can assure the House that while the Governor has denied it &mdash; and I accept his denial &mdash; I still find it so personally offensive that such a thing could even be contemplated, I have ordered this investigation and I can assure the House that if the investigation proves such a thing did happen, or anything bordering on it, I will take whatever necessary action to prevent a recurrence. I find that personally unacceptable and offensive.</P>
    <P>I was slightly disturbed by a feature of Senator Costello's contribution because it appeared to rely almost entirely on statements by prisoners this morning during his visit, which in many ways contradicted other parts of his contribution where he spoke of the secretive nature of the Department of Justice.  As Minister for Justice I arranged the first visit ever by Members of the Oireachtas, from all sides.  I am open to correction, there may have been others but to the best of my knowledge there have not been other visits &mdash; to Mountjoy and to the women's prison.  The Senator will be willing to confirm that total access to see what they liked and to speak to whom they liked was provided for them.  There was no attempt to hide any feature or any element of the prison system and that is what I instructed my officials to arrange, and the Governor accordingly.  I want to come back to this allegation in relation to a strip search.  I find it offensive and I would not in any way countenance it.  I have ordered an investigation into it which will commence immediately under the principal officer in my Department dealing with the operation side.  I will release and make public the outcome of that inquiry and will take whatever steps are necessary.  I want to emphasise that having got the message at 3.15 p.m., I checked with the Governor of Mountjoy who denied that male officers could be present during strip searching of female prisoners.</P>
    <P>Another element of the Senators comment was in relation to treatment for drug <Col N="612" /> addicts.  I want to say that the treatment appropriate to women drug addicts is entirely a matter for the doctors.  There is no question of any interference from the administration side.  We could not interfere, we would not want to.</P>
    <P>In relation to the upgrading of the women's prison I want to say that Arbour Hill was in a worse condition than the present women's prison and is now one of the best in the system following refurbishment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the physical conditions at the prison need to be improved.  I want to emphasise that.  This has been recognised for many years.  The first positive step which was taken to address this long standing problem was taken when I decided at an early stage after becoming Minister for Justice last July that priority should be given to completely refurbishing the accommodation. The Government provided the necessary funds in this year's Estimate to enable refurbishment to take place.  This work is being undertaken as part of the refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution complex, of which the women's prison forms part.  I think the House will accept that the refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution itself and the transfer of juvenile offenders to the new place of detention at Wheatfield are also welcome developments.</P>
    <P>There have been misleading suggestions recently that at some stage it is intended that female offenders would be accommodated in the new place of detention at Wheatfield.  That was never the case and those suggestions have simply no basis in reality.  When the Wheatfield site was acquired in 1979 it was announced that both the place of detention for male juveniles and a women's prison would be provided separately there.  While funds were provided to enable construction of the place of detention to go ahead, construction of the women's prison did not proceed.  It will be clear therefore that anyone who thought that the problem of accommodation for female offenders would be addressed by the provision of the new place of detention at Wheatfield was under a false impression.  While I am satisfied that the refurbishment of the women's prison at <Col N="613" /> Mountjoy represents the most effective way of improving the quality of the accommodation for women prisoners at least in the relatively short term, I have not ruled out the possibility of providing an open centre for female offenders.  I have to say, however, that there are substantial difficulties in this regard, in particular there are strong reservations that there is a sufficient number of women prisoners to make the operation of such a centre a realistic proposition.  Those familiar with the operation of the existing open centres for male offenders will know the length of sentence and nature of the offence are only two of the criterion when assessing the suitability of an offender for an open setting.  The fact that someone sent to an open centre is likely to stay there and behave well are also key considerations.</P>
    <P>There would be substantial reservations about accommodating in an open centre, a drug abuser for example who had not successfully tackled his or her addiction.  I should mention also that arrangements exist at present which enable offenders to be released conditional on their attendance at a drug treatment centre such as Coolmine.  I have no hesitation in authorising such releases where there are reasonable grounds for assuming a genuine commitment on the part of an offender to overcome his or her drug problem and where such a release would not pose an undue risk to the community.  In a nutshell what I am saying is that the availability of an open centre, which as I say has not been ruled out, would not necessarily result in the transfer of any women now in Mountjoy to open accommodation. Physical conditions are, of course, only one of the factors which determine the quality of life for prisoners. It has to be said that women prisoners have a wide array of services made available to them, including psychiatric, psychological, welfare educational and chaplaincy.  In recent times a medical officer has been appointed to deal exclusively with the needs of female offenders. While I emphasis again it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the circumstances of the death the night before last, it is only right to say, <Col N="614" /> in case it appears in public comment that no services were available to the deceased, that she had been availing of medical services at the prison on a regular basis and had the benefit of a consultation with the medical adviser at noon on the day she died.  It would be a pity if any comments were to be made which would detract from the efforts of these agencies and those of management and staff of the prison service to provide a humane regime for those in their care.  Obviously, it is not possible in the course of these few minutes to comment in detail on recommendations made in the report of the committee of inquiry into the penal system.  I can assure the House that since becoming Minister for Justice I have taken full account of the findings of the committee.  It will be appreciated, however, that the committee's findings were complex and wideranging and priorities have to be set in the light of available resources.  It has to be realised, too, that changes have taken place since the report was completed which have had to be taken into account.  An obvious instance is the need to deal with AIDs related problems which were not a significant issue when the committee were deliberating.</P>
    <P>What people tend to forget is that many of the recommendations made were in line with developments already underway as part of the ongoing prison administration process.  For example, in relation to the development of alternatives to custody, an area which was of major concern to the committee, very satisfactory progress is being made in relation to community service orders which were brought into operation shortly before the report was published. There are far more offenders on alternatives of one kind or another than in prison, a point which I feel may not be generally understood.</P>
    <P>Another major recommendation of the committee was that a new duty roster for the prison should be introduced and this has been done.  A specific recommendation of the Whitaker report was that a medical director for the prison service should be appointed.  The House will be aware that despite two competitions for the post of medical director <Col N="615" /> it did not prove possible to make an appointment to it.  I had this matter reexamined and as a result the post was readvertised two weeks ago with a substantial increase in remuneration and improvements in conditions of service in an effort to attract a suitable candidate.</P>
    <P>Deaths in custody are an unfortunate reality faced by prison administrations the world over.  That is no consolation but, for the information of the House, in Scotland last year, there were nine deaths in the prison system which deals with about 5,000 prisoners.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern about deaths in prisons I established towards the end of last year an advisory group to specifically examine the issue of deaths in prisons and to make recommendations in relation to any aspect of the matter.  The group fully appreciate the urgency which attaches to their task but given the enormously complex and sensitive issues they have to address, it is clearly vital that they have sufficient time to enable them to deal with these matters comprehensively over whatever period proves necessary.  A report on each death is carefully examined within my Department with a view to establishing whether there was any action that might have been taken and which might have helped to bring a risk to notice or that might have lessened any risk that was known in the particular case.  Riders to inquest verdicts are carefully examined by the prison authorities and implemented when considered appropriate and practical.  One rider recommended the installation of a cell call system to enable offenders to contact staff and that is part of a long planned rewiring project in Mountjoy which has been underway for the past few months.</P>
    <P>I should mention that in recent years the duties of the medical director have been undertaken by the chief medical officer of the Civil Service.  I am happy to acknowledge the contribution he has made.  I should also make it clear to the <Col N="616" /> House that in addition to the chief medical officer, there are 15 medical doctors visiting the prisons and places of detention on a regular basis with a similar number of psychiatrists available to provide their services as and when required. When specialist services or hospital treatment is required the necessary arrangements are made.  The role of the chief medical officer and the medical officer when appointed, therefore, is directional and administrative rather than clinical.</P>
    <P>In the course of my reply I have been able to deal with only some of the issues which have been raised.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on these matters this evening.  The prison system is not a personal fiefdom of the Minister for Justice, it is very much a community issue.  The prison service performs a vital and complex role on behalf of society and I welcome public discussion on how best it can deal with its responsibilities.  It is important, however, that such a debate be fully informed.  I am happy that all parties have taken up my invitation to nominate members of the Oireachtas to visit our prisons and, as you know, these visits began today.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, have regard to any suggestions which individual members of the group may make to me out of their concern to improve the operation of our prison system.  I think a fair reflection of that willingness to respond immediately is my response to the accusation made by Senator Costello in relation to strip searching.  I have immediately taken action in that regard.  I would find such conduct unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record that none of my remarks were directed at the Minister.  In many ways the Minister has been a lot better than most of his predecessors.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 14 March 1990.</P>
