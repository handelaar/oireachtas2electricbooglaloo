      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to confer official sanction on Kilfinan Education Centre, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paddy McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to review the structures of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>Le fiafraí den Aire Oideachais cén fáth nár fograíodh fós cead le haghaidh deisucháin agus méadú do Ghairm Scoil Colm Cille, Indreabhán, Contae na Gaillimhe a chur i gcrích mar a gealladh agus cén uair atá an tAire sásta an obair seo a cheadú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Jackman, McGowan and Ó Foighil as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Jackman and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators <Col N="1370" /> McGowan and Ó Foighil may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is item No. 1, which is a short item and should take no more than three or four minutes and item No. 2, the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill until 6 p.m.  That will be followed by a sos from 6 p.m. until 6.30 p.m.  At 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m. we will take item No. 12, motion 94 (resumed).  The Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, item No. 3 will be taken from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.</P>

      <P>Could the Leader of the House tell me if any progress has been made towards arranging a debate on the developments in the European Community which has been mentioned over the past number of weeks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader of the House to indicate the plans for the House for the next number of months.  It is important from the point of view of ordering business that people know when we finish.  I do not want any smart answers from the far side of the House.  We can sit through autumn as far as I am concerned as long as we decide now what we will do.  I am proposing that we sit until August, break for August and meet again in September.  This nonsense of going on from week to week not knowing if we will be here the following week or the week after is no good for anybody.  We should just have a clear operational procedure, organise our business and assess when we will finish.  I do not care <Col N="1371" /> when we complete our business but we should decide this week when that will be.  There is no need to rush Bills through before August; the Government seem to have that intention.  It makes far more sense to come back in due time in September. I propose that we decide this week what date we will finish in July or if we are going into August&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The other issue I wish to raise, which has been referred to on a number of occasions by Senator Mary Jackman and the Leader of the House, is the question of a committee to look at the extension of the franchise to third level graduates.  We would welcome that and we have been pressing for five years on this matter.  We want to extend it far beyond county councils.  We want teachers voting on the educational section, farmers voting on the agricultural section and fishermen on their section.  Just in case anybody on the other side is being smug about it, it is time we changed the operation of the House so that it becomes more representative.  This is the ideal opportunity, so let us not be afraid to change the orders.</P>

I ask that the Government would support the idea, perhaps next week, of a discussion on this matter. Members of the House have agreed to <Col N="1372" /> take it but I ask that time be made for it next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Manning in calling for a debate on developments in the European Community. Momentous events have been happening in recent months and Ireland has been fortunate to have been in the driver's seat.  I want to couple with that the views I have expressed previously here, as have many other Members, in relation to the necessity for a foreign affairs committee.  The reason I say this today is because I believe it is pertinent because given the huge amount of public activity there is in the foreign policy sector we are way behind the times in that we are apparently the only country in Europe without a foreign policy committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one pertinent point.  The Government's reason in recent months for not pursuing it was because they were so busy with the Presidency of the European Community.  That will be completed this week.  I would respectfully suggest that you convey to the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs the desirability, now that the six months is ended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator O'Toole in his request that the matter of university representation should be looked at and that this brief should be extended.  In fact, I believe an amendment has gone in to that effect. One of the items is covered by item No. 7.  I would also like to support his request that motion 32 in the names of Senators Shane Ross, Maurice Manning, Avril Doyle and myself regarding the North-South rail link should be taken as soon as possible.  I would be glad if the Leader of the House could give us an indication on that.  It is non-contentious and it could easily become an all-party motion.  It has already been passed by the Dáil on an all-party basis.  I would like to join with other Members who sent their congratulations to the Irish team and those congratulations should also go to the supporters. We are very lucky we do not have any soccer hooligans disgracing us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I support my colleagues on their request to have a debate, as Senator O'Toole put it, on cross-Border communications.  I have supported the campaign on the Northern rail link.  It is a little bit disingenuous if we do not discuss the huge number of roads that are also closed and that have caused enormous inconvenience to very many people for no apparent security reason other than to cause considerable disruption to the lives of communities who have never recognised the existence of a political Border.  We ought to consider the problems of people who live in Border areas and not just one specific case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said a few times, there are Members of this House who could usefully visit certain areas close to here and find out a little of what actually happens to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that there is a crisis and there is something happening outside the gates of this House, may I ask the Leader of the House if, as a matter of urgency, he will allow us to debate, hopefully in a nonpartisan way because it is an important issue, the question of homeless young people in this city.  This has turned into a crisis in six months and which is beginning to frighten people to an alarming extent. It is too serious to make political capital out of it.  I do not believe there is a political monopoly and wisdom on this issue.  It seems to me to be an issue on <Col N="1375" /> which this House could exercise considerable influence and I would like the Leader of the House to consider having a debate on the matter.  I know business is pressing but the welfare of young people is an extraordinarily important issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with Senator Manning in asking what is the position of Senators who wish to attend the address of Deputy President of the ANC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, in supporting Senator Manning, ask the Leader of the House to do something about a member of his own party who profoundly insulted Nelson Mandela in reports in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  He has suffered enormously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Ryan in his request to the Leader of the House for time for a debate on the issues in relation to accommodation for young people, which is the subject of the young people from Focus Point engaging in a protest outside the gates of this building over the past 24 hours and to join that into something that has happened since our last meeting here, when a 15-year old boy from Offaly was given three years imprisonment because there was no place for him in existing accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to consider giving time for a debate on those important issues.  I would like clarification, too, about the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill.  According to the notification we received from the Whip's <Col N="1376" /> office it was intended that Committee and all Stages would be dealt with today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill.  The Leader of the House indicated the debate will terminate at 6 p.m. today.  Will he clarify whether the remaining Stages will be taken together? Perhaps it would be best if we completed all Stages today.  I do not think it would take much later than 6 p.m., perhaps another half hour or another hour, and we could complete all Stages and get the matter finally dealt with, as we understood from the notification from the Whip's office.</P>
      <P>With regard to Nelson Mandela, both Houses of the United States Government have given him a joint hearing but our protocol was seemingly not able to allow that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator O'Toole said.  It is not unreasonable of us to ask the Leader of the House <Col N="1377" /> to tell us how much legislation we will have before the summer recess and when we will have a summer recess.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will sit here until October, Senator Kiely, which the Government will not do.  It seems there should be some organisation of the business here and we should know what business we are getting. It has greatly improved, certainly.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House specifically about the Companies Bill.  This Bill was introduced in the Seanad in 1987.  I believe it was published not during the life of the last Seanad but during the life of the Seanad before that.  It is now in a special committee of the Dáil.  I assume that committee will recommend perhaps 100 or 200 amendments to that very comprehensive Bill, which will then have to come back here.  Could the Leader of the House tell us when we will get it back here and when we will clear it, because that Bill has been before the two Houses for over three years now.  It is a very important Bill; it started here and we have some responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the item raised by Senator Manning, on having a debate on developments in the EC, in regard to that matter and our Presidency of the EC for the past six months, which was raised here about two weeks ago, I have made very real progress in arranging a debate in the House fairly soon.  I will pursue that actively as I have indicated. The Senator also raised the Mandela visit, which has been raised by a number of Senators over the past number of weeks, I indicated what I understood the position to be.  The Cathaoirleach has said there is a letter on its way to Members, so obviously that will take care of Seantor Manning's question and the questions of other Senators with regard to the Mandela visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked a very important question.  He would like to know the programme before the summer recess and he wanted to now a specific closing <Col N="1378" /> date.  I, too, would welcome a fixed date of when we can conclude.  Obviously it is a question that has been made over the years and it is difficult to put a precise date on the closing of the session.  It is something I will ask the Whips to take up actively.  They will be meeting very soon and I will ask them to endeavour to give us a fixed closing date for this session.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the franchise in respect of university representation, I propose to raise that at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I understand that will probably take place next week and it will be a matter which I will ask to be put on the agenda for that meeting,. The question of the cross-Border matters is something that I will ask the Whips to consider.  If we can fit it in obviously it will be done but I have no plans for it at this point.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton raised again the important question of a debate on poverty.  It is something I will consider and let him know as soon as possible.  It is obviously an important matter and I will ask the Whips to examine it.  On the question of the Broadcasting Bill, it is not for me to say when we will have the Bill. Obviously, when it concludes in the other House it will be brought to us as soon as possible but I cannot say when that will be.  Senator Dardis referred to one or two matters which were not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred to the point made by Senator Manning regarding a debate on developments in the EC. Senator Norris referred to the university representation and the North-South matters which I have mentioned already. Senator Doyle referred to the question of The Environment Protection Agency Bill.  I said last week I understood the legislation would be issued fairly soon.  I now understand that is not the case. There is a delay in publication and obviously it will not be with us in time for this session.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the cross-Border areas which I have referred to.  He also raised the question of the homeless <Col N="1379" /> young people.  I have no plans for a debate on that matter now.  He referred to the Mandela visit and I explained the situation.  Senator Costello referred to homeless young people.  My answer remains the same on that.  He asked for clarification on the Criminal Justice Bill. By arrangement with the Whips Committee Stage will commence as soon as the Order of Business is concluded and will go on until 6 p.m.  If it is not finished at 6 p.m. the Committee Stage and all Stages will come before the House again and it is my intention they will be taken next week.  He referred to another matter which is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the query by Senator Ross, gave a fairly detailed programme of legislation and I will get it for the Senator and tell him what are the proposals. Members welcomed the fact that I gave that information and they know where they are going in regard to legislation. Senator Ross asked about the Companies Bill.  The Bill as he indicated, is being dealt with by a special committee of the Dáil.  My understanding is that that Bill was concluded last night and I will make inquiries as to when it will be returned to this House.  I will let the House know when that happens.</P>

      <P>The section states that no person shall suffer death for any offence. The definition of a sanction should be dealt with in terms not just of the abolition of the death penalty but where we stand in relation to the concomitant circumstances, in human degrading treatment, torture or corporal punishment.  It is in that context I believe this section is somewhat limited and could have been improved upon.  It is important that we state categorically where we stand in the international context, in relation to human rights as stated by the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 8 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 20 to 24, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are related.  The purpose of those two <Col N="1383" /> amendments &mdash; I am not so sure about amendment No. 8 and I have no doubt Senator Ryan will have something to say on that &mdash; in the first instance is to delete paragraph (c) in relation particularly to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>First, the Offences Against the State Act was emergency legislation.  It was brought in on a temporary basis; it was not intended to be permanent.  It was introduced at a time when the Second World War was breaking out and it has been used, and I would say abused, in very many cases since then.  It is not a proper piece of legislation to be still on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>In the second instance, in relation to the furtherance of the activities of an unlawful organisation within the meaning of section 18, that is a very broad utterance in that it can cover the objectives of an organisation which could be conducted through any illegal means.  It is not specific enough, so that it could cover virtually any organisation that does its business in an illegal way.</P>
    <P>I think that in both instances, in terms of the emergency Offences Against the State Act and in terms of the scope of the term here, it is broader than subversion. It is not specifically related to the IRA or to the INLA, as it is generally intended, or people generally expect that it is.  It is a very broad definition and it could refer to any organisation that does its business by illegal means and from that point of view I feel it would be proper to have that paragraph deleted.</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (d), I think the position is even clearer &mdash; murder committed within the State for a political motive, or of the head of a foreign state or of a member of the Government or of a diplomatic officer of a foreign state.  I think we have a major anomaly here in that the paragraph covers members, representatives of foreign Governments outside the State but it does not make any reference to similar people within the State.  It seems rather illogical, to say the least, that we should specifically protect in this fashion the foreign head or a <Col N="1384" /> member of the Government or a diplomatic officer while we do not provide the same protection for our own members. If we could break it down, for example, are we talking about a diplomatic officer like Michael Smurfit who is the Consul in Monaco?  Is that the type of person we are referring to?  There is no protection, for example, for Senators or TDs or the Taoiseach.  We saw a situation where Senator Fox was killed back in the 1970s and that was dealt with not as capital murder, so we do have a major anomaly here.  I think it was better to eliminate the section entirely rather than to continue it. It is a situation that does not exist in similar legislation in neighbouring countries.  These amendments to delete both paragraphs would clarify the matter and improve the legislation as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with my colleague, Senator Costello, on this.  I think it is important, in the present position in Ireland where we have murderers and subversives for political reasons committing violent acts, both North and South, that we retain paragraph (c) in order to cover ourselves.  My party disagrees with the amendment to remove paragraph (c) from section 3.  We also disagree, for the very same reason, with the proposal to delete the reference to murder, committed within the State for political motives, of the head of a foreign State or a member of the Government of, or a diplomatic officer of, a foreign State.  We feel under present circumstances that these must be retained because of the situation prevailing with subversive organisations and with some very cowardly murders that have taken place since 1969.  We hope the day will come when we can freely remove such stipulations from our legislation.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect to my colleague, Senator Costello, I am amazed at him asking us at this time to remove a section of this very important legislation, which, as Senator Ryan mentioned a little while ago, the Senators who have not spoken should warmly welcome. That we do.  In regard to the <Col N="1385" /> amendments, I am amazed that at this time Senator Costello would ask us to remove from this legislation anything concerning the Offences Against the State Act and that he wants us to spell out the activities of an unlawful organisation. I do not think that is needed.</P>
      <P>In regard to paragraph (d), I did not think I was hearing right when he asked us to take that out of this Bill at this time. Like Senator Neville, I would hope that when things are better we could come back and amend this section, but certainly not in the atmosphere now could either of these provisions be removed from section 3 of this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we go into more detail I would like to ask the Minister, in regard to the proposal to remove paragraph (c) of section 3 (1), which is what we are talking about, whether the inclusion of section 6 of the Offences Against the State Act means that a murder carried out, say, by a vigilante organisation would be an offence under section 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will also listen with great interest to what the Minister has to say on this section, because I think Senator Brendan Ryan made a very valid point when he drew attention to the historic wording of the first section of the Bill: &ldquo;No person shall suffer death for any offence&rdquo;.  I would like to remind the House there are people constituting themselves in groups in this country who consider that it is their right to sentence people to death for what they regard as offences.  There are people here, politically motivated, who are quite happy to carry out a death sentence in the name of the Irish people regardless of the fact that they get less than 2 per cent of the vote.  To my mind, that does make it a special category of offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem remains: what do you do with it?  I do not think it is a good idea to give 40 years imprisonment, because I think people can change.  However, I wonder if the Government have ever considered, or if there is any constitutional bar to the Government considering the <Col N="1386" /> possibility of the removal of citizenship for these people?  That is something I would strongly urge the Government to consider if it is possible because it is not a physically violent method of retribution against these people.  It is also one that would strike very clearly at the heart of what they regard as their ethos, and these murders are being carried out in the name of all of us.  They assume to themselves the right to carry out a sentence of death in our name.  We have removed this capacity from the State but there are extra State elements who consider they are entitled to do this.  Perhaps that could be looked at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say at the outset I am very pleased to be here deputising for my Government colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke.  He wished to be here and was committed to being here but, as you know, the Broadcasting Bill commenced Committee Stage this morning at approximately 11 a.m. and will go on until at least 1 a.m. tonight.  Since he has not the facility of bilocation, I have no option but to replace him here, and I trust that the House can accept that as being part of the normal procedure of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to what has been said by the various contributors and in particular with regard to amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 8, which we are debating together.  They would have the effect of removing treason and murders done on furtherance of specified offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the murder of a diplomat or member of a foreign government from the category of capital murder.  I cannot agree to this.  Senator Ryan asked a question pertaining to vigilante organisations. The courts are very unlikely to hold that such an organisation comes within the scope of section 6 of the Offences Against the State Act unless it was of such proportions as to be a threat to the State, that is, a subversive organisation. It would be a matter for the courts to decide, based on the gravity of <Col N="1387" /> the situation and based on the information available to them.  We must leave that interpretation to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who said that?  Who said the courts are likely to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I believe would be the situation.  They will decide in a particular case the type of organisation, the permanency or otherwise of such an organisation, and the gravity of the offence.  That is the normal situation. When the death penalty was abolished for murder <i>per se</i> in 1964, the then Government decided that it should be retained for treason and certain murders. That is what are termed capital murders at present and are listed in section 3 of the Bill.  What these offences have in common is that they involve, in one way or another, an attack upon the institutions of the State.  The Government recognised this relationship in 1964 and provided that these offences would all be punishable by a mandatory death sentence. Nothing has since happened which would suggest that the decision taken in 1964 should now be changed.  It is logical, therefore, that the offences which up to now have attracted the death penalty should, on its abolition, continue to be the subject to a common penal sanction as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello spoke about the situation pertaining to unlawful organisations. It is true that the definition of an unlawful organisation in section 18 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, is extremely wide.  The expression even covers any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the commission of any criminal offence &mdash; section 18 (d).  It might be argued that this would even include a gang of robbers and burglars, but it is thought &mdash; and I wish to confirm again &mdash; that the courts would certainly hold that this is not the case, because the mischief at which the Act was directed was for more organised bodies than mere gangs.  This is clear from the fact that the Act contains <Col N="1388" /> detailed provisions enabling the Government to make suppression orders declaring particular organisations to be unlawful organisations and providing for the consequences of such orders, including penalties for membership and confiscation of property of an organisation. These provisions are consistent only with the interpretation that organisations of substantial dimensions and continuing character are covered.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also queried the definition of diplomat.  The definition of &ldquo;diplomatic officer&rdquo; is based on the defnition in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  This is what is covered here.</P>
    <P>In relation to treason, the effect of amendment No. 8 would be to remove it from the category of offences for which a minimum sentence of 40 years imprisonment would have to be imposed and to provide that a person convicted of treason would be sentenced to imprisonment for life.</P>
    <P>Treason is a specific offence which is defined in Article 39 of the Constitution, and provides that:</P>
    <P>Treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by this Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or to be concerned in any such attempt.</P>
    <P>As this definition shows, a person will not be convicted of treason unless they are guilty of a most grave attack on the State and its institutions.  Treason has traditionally being recognised throughout the universal world as one of the most serious offences a person can commit. This is reflected both in the fact that the offence itself is defined in the Constitution and that hitherto it has, as I said, attracted the death penalty.</P>
    <P>I regret, therefore, that I will not be able to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Col N="1389" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to express my opposition to those two amendments.  I was glad to hear the Minister clearly reiterate exactly what the position is.  While I agree that sections 1 and 2 of the Bill are perhaps long overdue, nevertheless it is important that the Government, on behalf of the citizens of the State, should be able to impose fairly stringent sanctions against people who would wilfully murder another person, more especially people such as gardaí and prison officers whose job it is to uphold the laws that are enacted for the guidance and security of the ordinary people of this State as well as people from other states who work here.</P>
      <P>There are people who say we retained capital punishment as a deterrent, but I can think of no more fearful sentence to pass on anyone than 40 years in Portlaoise. It is indeed a very stiff sentence. I think it is necessary to have that because once a person is murdered, for whatever reason, they are dead, dead forever and that is it.  This idea that the people who, for whatever reason or justification, should seek to get out in two and half or three years is a nonsense.  It belies the fact that this is a civilised and democratic society.</P>
      <P>The only country I have had the honour of visiting that did not have a strong penal code is Greenland.  They did not have a prison in 1977.  I am not suggesting that I earned the right to be put into it, but I was told that they did not have a prison system but that they dealt with offenders by &ldquo;sending them to Coventry&rdquo;, to use the old cliché.  This, of course, was almost making these people hermits and it was looked upon as a very stiff régime.  But then that particular society has fewer then 50,000 inhabitants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is only appropriate that paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 3 (1) should be maintained.  I think we are justified in ensuring that they should be retained so as to declare very clearly to all and sundry that Irish society do not take lightly the actions of persons who, for whatever reason, wish to inflict capital punishment through kangaroo courts or whatever on citizens of this State or of <Col N="1390" /> other states who are working here.  I believe we must show our determination in this fashion and I would support the Minister's view on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First I did not ask the Minister about treason and I am interested that he replied to my amendment before I had actually spoken on it.  I was trying to deal with this in a reasonably orderly fashion but it may be a problem that the Minister had to fill the breach at short notice.</P>
      <P>On the issue of section 6 of the Offences Against the State Act, he did not answer me at all.  The Minister has this wonderful faith in the courts.  Does he realise that the Supreme Court, within the past 12 months, has made it perfectly clear that the Offences Against the State Act is part of the ordinary criminal code of the State and does not apply or does not have to be used exclusively for what might be called subversive offences but can be used by the Garda as part of the criminal code.  Therefore, every section of it, where it would apply outside of subversive activities, can be used.  I do not have the report number from the Supreme Court but I am sure the Minister's Department can tell him about the particular decision.  I think Mr. Justice Walsh was the major author of that decision.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Offences Against the State Act states that:</P>
      <P>Every person who usurps or unlawfully exercises any function of Government, whether by setting up, maintaining or taking part in any way in a body of persons purporting to be a Government or Legislature but not authorised in that behalf by or under the Constitution, or by setting up, maintaining or taking part in any way in a purported court or other tribunal not lawfully established, or by forming, maintaining or being a member of an armed force or a purported police force, not so authorised, or by any other action or conduct whatsoever, shall be guilty of a felony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody committing an offence <Col N="1391" /> under that section commits murder &mdash; but not a member of the Garda, not a prison officer, not a category mentioned in the legislation as it stands &mdash; they are liable to a minimum sentence of 40 years in prison for setting themselves up as a police force, which might well be a vigilante group, which results in somebody being killed.  We are saying that, for some reason the Minister has not yet given us, they must be categorised with people who set out and are responsible for the knowing murder of a member of the Garda.  If that is what the Government want to do, then fair enough.  But what they are telling us is that it is a very limited category of an offence.  I think what happened here was that parts of previous legislation were inserted here without any thought.  The same could be said about, for instance, the offence of obstruction of the President, and any murder arising out of that offence is liable to a minimum sentence of 40 years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to talk about these extraordinarily frighteningly draconian sentences for people who are responsible for the murder of members of the Garda or prison officers, particularly if you define prison officer properly, unlike the definition that is in the Bill &mdash; and I compliment the Labour Party for noticing the breadth of that definition.</P>
    <P>There is a huge category of offences here.  We are not talking about legislation which is clearly designed and used only for dealing with subversive crime.  The Offences Against the State Act is used regularly.  Remember, the Offences Against the State Act can be used to arrest people and detain them for 48 hours for malicious damage to property, because malicious damage to property is a scheduled offence under the schedule of offences listed in the Offences Against the State Act.  It is a magnificent, sweeping catch-all way of arresting people, because virtually any crime against property can be interpreted as involving malicious damage against property and, therefore, people can be detained for 48 hours.  The courts have accepted that.  If <Col N="1392" /> the Government want to say that people can be sentenced to a minimum of 40 years imprisonment for a huge range of murders &mdash; and murder is an appalling offence &mdash; then fair enough, but let us not pretend and get involved in this thing which says that the courts will not do this, the courts will not do that and the courts will not do the other.  The Minister is no more infallible than I am.  The Minister is perhaps better advised than I am, but he is no more infallible than I am.</P>
    <P>The best thing to do would be to follow the logic of the Labour Party.  We are not exactly letting people off lightly.  We are still talking about life imprisonment.  Life imprisonment in this country means, in law, life imprisonment until somebody decides otherwise.  It does not mean seven years or ten years; it means until somebody agrees it is better to release the person.  It is not a defined term.  When the person is sentenced to life imprisonment, they are sentenced to imprisonment for the rest of their natural lives. The Government then, as a matter of general policy, with some exceptions, decide after a period of time that these people have served a sufficient sentence and are released.  But life is life.  We really are involved here, in these 40 years sentences, in a gesture of symbolism and of disapproval meant to satisfy certain lobbies in the State.</P>
    <P>On the issue of treason, I would be grateful if the Minister could give me a definition of citizenship at some stage, because treason is an offence that can be committed by a citizen.  Is a person born in Northern Ireland a citizen of this State? In the case of a person born in Northern Ireland, with the possibility of an armed conflict between a member of the UDR and a member of our armed forces, then that person is guilty of treason and is liable to 40 years in prison.</P>
    <P>Let us go through the definition of &ldquo;treason&rdquo; as defined in the Constitution and as quoted in the Treason Act, 1939.  It sounds fine and specific at the beginning.</P>
    <P>Treason shall consist only in levying war against the State or assisting any <Col N="1393" /> state or person in inciting or in conspiring with any person to levy war against the State or attempting by force, or arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of Government established by the Constitution...</P>
    <P>That does not mean killing anybody.  It simply means attempting by force of arms &mdash; an offence I do not support or an activity I do not support, none of us supports &mdash; but it does not involve killing anybody.  It simply means attempting by violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the constitution &ldquo;or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make, take part or be concerned in any such attempt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not just somebody who actually takes arms and fights against the State.  It is anybody who takes part or is concerned in or incites or conspires with any person to take part &mdash; somebody who incites somebody else to take part in any such attempt.</P>
    <P>Incitement is a particularly risky business because it is a matter of considerable flexibility of interpretation.  What we have been told in this Act is that that sort of offence, which I am not suggesting is proper activity, is of similar gravity with the deliberate, knowing murder of a member of the Garda Síochána.  That is ridiculous.  It is an offence for which I think people should be punished.  I also think &mdash; may I say, at the risk of having myself metaphorically at least hanged &mdash; that the concept of treason is one that needs to be re-examined fundamentally. It has a certain echo of another era.  The offence could be defined without this word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; associated with it.  I can see no logic in saying that because treason used to be a capital offence and was retained in 1964, it must say as a similar offence under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not know why life imprisonment without the further addition of horrendous penalties is not sufficient for somebody who is found guilty of treason, bearing in mind that it does not involve, necessarily or implicitly anybody being <Col N="1394" /> killed or indeed anybody being hurt.  It does not involve doing anything; it simply involves conspiring to doing it.  We have given lectures to a neighbouring jurisdiction about the dangers of offences which involve allegations of conspiracy. What we are saying is that somebody who is found guilty of conspiring to do what is defined in our Constitution as treason should actually serve a minimum of 40 years in prison.  That is quite daft.  It makes no logical sense.  It make no sense that I can figure out and it is entirely disproportionate and entirely unrelated in gravity to the offence of murder of a member of the Garda Síochána.  I have no idea why it was put in there other than that it was the simple way to do it, the sloppy way to do it, and it should be taken out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister of State.  I want to make a couple of brief points.  One relates to what Senator Ryan said about the definition of treason and the likelihood that somebody who incites or is involved indirectly in such a serious and grave offence against the State should be treated differently.  I cannot agree that this should be the case. I should also make the point, in relation to his reference to treason possibly being a historic dimension, that in democratic states throughout the world the crime of treason is always available.  If somebody is involved in the calculated importation, say, of a nuclear missile, and contrives this without killing anybody, that person cannot be categorised.  The problem we have had in much of this legislation is that there are too many categories.</P>
      <P>I would totally oppose the points made by other speakers in relation to making differential categories and reducing the term of 40 years to 20 years or less.  Treason is a very serious offence.  It has to be retained while the institutions of the State, or any democratic State, exist.  The amendment should be opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the points being made and some of the amendments down here are of a time-consuming nature and are frivolous and vexatious.  All parties, without <Col N="1395" /> exception, have agreed that his legislation is long overdue.  There was a question as to why the Minister, Deputy Burke, is not here.  If we were to wait until Deputy Burke could be here maybe this legislation would not get through in this session.  The Minister of State is here and the matter is being dealt with.  We must ensure that this piece of legislation is brought in as quickly as possible and that certain amendments put down, which are of a very technical nature and possibly frivolous, are not accepted.  I totally oppose the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the amendments from the Labour Party is vexatious or frivolous and neither is any of the other amendments I have dealt with.  It is our function in the Seanad to seek to improve legislation and that is the intention of these amendments.  It is quite improper to suggest that there is any ulterior motive involved.</P>
      <P>The purpose in putting down amendments Nos. 2 and 3 from the Labour Party was to point out the anomalies in the sections where the mandatory sentences apply.  Indeed, in amendment No. 8 from Senator Ryan there is a connection there because that is also pointing out an anomoly in relation to the parameters of this new legislation, that is the mandatory sentence in relation to certain offences.  It would be much cleaner and more appropriate legislation if the two areas were specified at section 3:1; (a) and (b), that is, the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána or of a prison officer.  Once one goes beyond that one is moving into areas that are illdefined and are illogical.  That is what we are trying to point out in paragraphs (c) and (d), and indeed in relation to amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember going through the old debates in 1964 when the present Taoiseach introduced the Criminal Justice Bill.  When the Bill had been debated he stated that if he had thought there would have been such goodwill in relation to the Bill he would have gone further.  It would be a shame if at this time when we have <Col N="1396" /> at last abolished the death penalty for all offences, we were not precise and clear as to what we are putting in its place. Those are the two anomolies I was pointing out.  The first is in relation to the Offences Against the State Act, an emergency piece of legislation brought in on a temporary basis and not intended to be permanent.  That means that it is illequipped to deal with this section and is the reason I consider it unsatisfactory. Indeed, the Minister has indicated that in relation to unlawful organisations there is a very broad definition and it could be seen as extending even to gangs of robbers or burglars whose crime is not an offence against the State as we understand it.</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State Act is a catch-all.  It is a type of legislation that covers a multitude and has been allowed to cover a multitude both in terms of the scheduled offences, the unscheduled offences and now the courts of the land have begun to accept it as not being emergency legislation but as ordinary law.  It is quite unsuitable in relation to this legislation.  The definitions are far too wide.</P>
    <P>In relation to my second amendment, the Minister has not replied to my major point and that is that there is an illogical situation where a specific type of protection is given to diplomats or to representatives of a Government outside the State, but there is no such protection given to representatives of our own Government within the State.  Why have this illogical situation?  I am not saying it is not a serious offence.  Of course it is, but a mandatory sentence of 40 years would not apply if a Member of this or the other House happens to be killed by a subversive organisation in the morning whereas it would be if it was a member of a foreign Government, a diplomat, a third secretary, or any person who has diplomatic ranking.  That is a major anomoly and it has not been addressed in the legislation.  The cleanest thing is either to address it specifically and add another section or else delete it and leave it out entirely, as I am proposing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> I would make one or two other points. What is the situation in the case of the murder of an illegal Head of State, someone who has taken power by illegal means?  What about the Ceausescues of this world?  What about a situation where the person is a Head of Government in violation of international law?  My prime consideration is that there is an essential anomaly there that has not been addressed in relation to giving a particular type of protection to representatives of the Government of a foreign State and the same protection is not given to representatives of the Government of this State.  The clear example we have in our history is where the British Ambassador was assassinated in 1976 and if his murderers were found they would be subject to the capital death penalty whereas the murderers of a member of Fine Gael in this House, Senator Fox, were not subjected to the same penalty because Senator Fox was a Member of our own Parliament.  If we cannot address it properly we will coming back again in the years to come so why not address it now? Get it out of the way and get it dealt with. I am not saying that these are not serious offences but we must deal with them logically and rationally.</P>

      <P>It is unhelpful for Senator O'Donovan to make allegations that these amendments are of a frivolous nature.  It is contentious and frankly absurd.  Section 1 would be quite adequate in any consequent amendments to legislation and the rest would not be necessary to be included.  It is the Government who put in the rest of these. Perhaps Senator O'Donovan does not agree with us but maybe he would concede we have some right to try to make improvements to legislation which is introduced by the Government.  It is something which I think should be resented and will be resented from these benches if a member of the Government who are putting this Bill through states he feels amendments are frivolous and time consuming.  They may be time consuming, and they probably are time consuming, <Col N="1398" /> but that should not be a major consideration in our objective in improving this Bill.  The only people who are suddenly in a terrible hurry to pass this Bill are the Government.  We have been asking the Government to put this Bill through for nearly ten years and suddenly Senator O'Donovan says they are in an awful hurry to push it through and we are wasting time.</P>

      <P>Indeed he did.  He said exactly that.  We are just trying to improve legislation which we have been pushing for ten years.</P>
      <P>I would like to support my colleagues in saying I am sorry the Minister is again not here.  This Bill has become a sort of game of &ldquo;spot which Minister&rdquo; we are going to get every week.  I do not want to reflect badly on the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, or the Minister, Deputy Smith, but we have already had three Ministers on this Bill in two days which I think is a pity.  If Deputy Burke cannot manage it, he should appoint a Minister of State, or the Government should do so, in both his Departments.  It is quite absurd that he should have two major portfolios and have to send Ministers here, there and everywhere to deal with matters not relevant to their Department. It is no reflection on the Minister present or the last one.  We are going to have this continuous problem where Deputy Burke is trying to be in two places at one time.  If he had a junior Minister, he would be able to come in here and the appropriate Minister would take this Bill, or the appropriate Minister would take the Broadcasting Bill in the other House. It is an insult to this House that we are consistently being sent Ministers to whose portfolio and brief the legislation does not apply.  Having said that, I respect greatly the Minister, Deputy Treacy.  I am sure he will take this Bill through as adequately as anybody in his position could possibly do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> I would like to ask the Minister one or two questions about treason.  Having heard Senator Ryan's definition of treason from the Constitution.  I do not quite understand why treason is on the Statute Book at all.  It is something which puzzles me.  Where is treason not covered by other crimes which are on the Statute Book.  It seems to me that the offence of treason always consists of certain specific offences which are covered by other statutes which will effectively convict people of crimes and sentence them accordingly. It seems to me that treason, like the Offences Against the State Act, is a sort of catch-all and that really we should be able to define these sort of offences far more specifically.  If we cannot, we should look for ways of doing it.  In what area is treason not covered by criminal law somewhere else?  I would also like to ask the Minister when the last treason case was heard in this State and what happened. When did we condemn anybody for treason and what were the circumstances? Thirdly, I want to know whether members of the IRA &mdash; because presumably they are permanently levying war against the State &mdash; are <i>ipso facto</i> guilty of treason by virtue of being members of the IRA.</P>

To say that such amendments &mdash; and they have been accepted as being in order &mdash; are frivolous and vexatious is very unfair.  If they are not in order we will be told so by the Chair.  If they are in order my colleagues have a right to put them down.  To describe them as frivolous and vexatious is very unfair.  I defend their right even though I may not agree with them.</P>

      <P>I will not be tedious in the matter but I think by now Senator O'Donovan has probably got the message <Col N="1400" /> that it would be very much resented if the privilege, right and duty of this House to amend legislation were in some way to be curtailed because Senator O'Donovan or anybody else on the Government benches thinks that they are frivolous or trivial, which were two of the three words used and the third is more interesting because it was &ldquo;technical&rdquo;.  I take the point made by Senator Ross that, in fact, it is one of the principal functions and justifications of this House that we refine legislation and bring whatever technical know-how we have to bear on legislation. I am sure it was just a slip in the footwork; I do not imagine it was meant maliciously. Perhaps the strength of feeling that has been voiced from this side will guard against a further slip of this kind in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to go back over something I mentioned.  There was no reply to it.  I have raised this matter on several occasions before, that is, the question of serious offences, such as treason and murder with a political motivation and so on.  I did wonder aloud, as I have wondered in the past in discussing these matters, whether there is a constitutional bar to the removal of citizenship for these offences.  It seems to me to be a useful avenue to explore.  Maybe it is not legally possible but I would like to know if it is. Rather than hanging people, torturing them, sentencing them to 40 years, which is a form of cruel and unusual punishment, in my opinion, the removal of citizenship would strike right at the very heart where these people really would feel the punishment that was being invoked upon them.  It seems to me that this idea is very close to what Senator McDonald was talking about when he instanced Greenland and sending people to Coventry.  I cannot think of any better or more effective way of sending people to Coventry then removing their citizenship, saying &ldquo;You purport to act in our name illegitimately, you are causing offence and shame to us and we deny you the right to describe yourselves as part of our community&rdquo;.  It may be, of course, that this is an absurd idea; it may be that it is quite impossible but I would like &mdash;<Col N="1401" /> and I am flying a kite to a certain extent &mdash; to know whether this is possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on now to some other matters in relation to these amendments. I think Senator Brendan Ryan has done an extremely useful job for us here in opening up a discussion on these amendments because he has demonstrated that because of the operation of the Offences Against the State Act there will be a large number of incidental cases in which this mandatory 40 year sentence will come into play and there may very well not be a clear intention on the part of the Government for that mandatory sentence to come into play.  If it is then it raises even further problems, problems that were in fact addressed by several speakers on the Second Stage of the Bill. It means that you are beginning to categorise offences of murder, you are beginning to rank them, you are beginning to say: &ldquo;This kind of murder is much worse&rdquo;.  Perhaps there is a clear difference in murder with a political motive, perhaps that argument can be raised although again you could be on sticky ground but is murder committed within the State for a political motive worse than murder committed without a political motive, with the intention of sadism for example, or just for the hell of it?  Is that worse?  I do not know.  I think that argument has to be made.</P>
    <P>The central argument of Senator Ryan &mdash; as I understood it and I am sure he will correct me if I am incorrect &mdash; is that apparently because of the operation of the Offences Against the State Act a considerable number of incidental situations will arise in which a mandatory 40 year sentence which may very well not be deemed to be appropriate will apply. For example, I remember a couple of years ago where people armed themselves with hurley sticks and iron bars and so on and set off towards the British Embassy.  They were stopped by the police and there was a baton charge.  It is possible that a guard could have been killed in that situation, and a very horrible offence that would have been but is it worse than the rape and murder of a four year old girl, the battering to death <Col N="1402" /> of an 85 year old woman?  If it is, why is it different?  Why is it worse?</P>
    <P>I would like to make one final point on this issue.  Again I would not exactly say it was flying a kite but it is putting these situations in a certain context.  I was a little bit worried as I listened to the Minister describing the ramifications of the Offences Against the State Act and what constituted in his opinion, or in the opinion of his advisers, illegal organisations, subversive groups and so on. One of the definitions he gave stuck in my mind for particular reasons, that was, people who have banded together to advocate the commission of crime or illegal activities.  I say this because, for a number of years, I have been urging that the Government should alter the 1861 and 1885 Acts which render completely illegal any form of sexual activity between consenting male adults in private. I would remind the Minister that until the 1861 Act this was itself a capital offence and remains a felony.</P>
    <P>I would also draw to the Minister's attention the fact that a complaint under the Broadcasting Act against myself and RTE was actually upheld some years ago on the basis that simply by talking about this subject I was advocating the commission of crime.  What happens there? In other words, the Offences Against the Person Act is a very wide net and, as Senator Ryan has said, has been instituted by recent decisions of the Supreme Court as part of the ordinary everyday law of the land.  That reinforces the argument that has been made that a very considerable number of incidental cases may very well be triggered by this legislation which commands a mandatory life sentence.</P>
    <P>In a way, I experience a grim amusement from the inclusion of the political motivation element in this Bill because it certainly seems to clash with some decisions of the Supreme Court where, on the one hand, in this State we seem to take the view that a political motivation exonerates and, on the other, we think it makes the crime worse.  Is there not a requirement that we should have some clarification here of our attitude?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has told us about treason is that since that is the way it was in 1964 when we abolished the death penalty, that is the way it should be now.  I do not want to get cross or anything, but that is not an argument.  I would like to know why treason must be included &mdash; treason, as it is defined, with all its implications with all the possibilities of interpretation, and these extraordinary sections of the Offences Against the State Act?  The Minister seems to have this lovely, benevolent view of the way the courts should deal with the Offences Against the State Act.  I know a man who is in jail, serving three or five years because he had the misfortune to have in his possession &mdash; he probably should not have had &mdash; a large number of posters which supported the IRA.  That was taken as evidence that he was a member of the IRA and he got five years in jail for it.  I do not have a lot of sympathy with the individual or his activities, but the courts are not inclined to take a benevolent view of the application of the Offences Against the State Act.  Quite the opposite.  They are inclined to take an excessively &mdash; in my view &mdash; serious view of how it should be implemented. Can the Minister tell me not that it was there in 1964 but the thinking of the Government why treason, in all the various ways it is defined, should be an offence as serious as that of going out and deliberately killing a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Senator O'Donovan, I have never put down a frivolous amendment in my life.  I have got an awful lot of frivolous replies from Government Ministers to amendments I have put down, may I say, ranging from the offensive to the downright ludicrous, but I have never put down a frivolous amendment.  What is delaying this Bill unnecessarily is that from section 2 on it is unnecessary.  All this Bill needed was section 1, together with a section which said that everwhere the penalty is prescribed that shall be taken to mean life imprisonment.  That would be sufficient to do the job.  The rest of this Bill is a contortion of logic in an attempt to satisfy a variety of lobbies <Col N="1404" /> about what we are doing.  Life imprisonment is life imprisonment.  It is long enough, bad enough and hard enough.</P>
    <P>I did not, nor did any of us on this side of the House, invent the rest of this Bill. It was invented not for reasons to do with the law or the enforcement of the law but for political reasons to keep certain lobbies happy.  There is no need for anything more than two sections in this Bill and if we only had two sections I for one would have tabled no amendments and we would have this Bill through in half an hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened again to the various contributions with great interest.  In response to Senator Ryan, whether a Minister's reply is frivolous is a matter of opinion.  Likewise, everybody is entitled to think that their attitude is correct.  Eventually we find a consensus and we agree what we hope is in everybody's best interests.  We are not changing the law in relation to capital offences. Capital murder is clearly defined in the Bill and nothing new is being done, other than abolishing the death penalty and replacing it with a 40 year minimum mandatory penalty.</P>
      <P>Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act is an arrest and detention provision; it is not referred to in this Bill and is not relevant to this Bill.  No organisation other than a subversive organisation has ever been proceeded against, and under the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, this is clearly the situation: it is 50 years since the Act first came into law.  The courts have been absolutely consistent on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the definition of &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; in the context of the offence of treason.  There is no difficulty with citizenship in this context because treason can be committed by anybody, whether they are a citizen or not.  Consequently, they can be prosecuted for same. Senator Ryan asked why we still include treason and I explained at the very outset &mdash; I thought very clearly &mdash; why the Government in 1964 included treason as a capital offence.  As far as this Government are concerned, these reasons are <Col N="1405" /> still valid, even though Senator Ryan may choose not to accept them.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross asked where treason is not covered by other crimes already on the Statute Book.  Treason is defined in the Constitution.  It is not merely a statutory offence; it is a constitutional offence. Consequently, it is one of the most serious offences in the State.  He asked when was the last treason case and what happened.  As far as I know, in modern times, there has been no prosecutions for treason.</P>

I do not accept that there is a threat there: it is a security within the law, it is a protection of the State and I cannot see that as a threat.  It means that anybody who accepts the law is free to do what they should within the law, but it is not a threat to say that we have laws.  There are laws in every country and we must all accept the law of the land.  I do not see it as a threat.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross also asked whether members of the IRA are liable to be prosecuted for treason.  We still have subversive organisations in our country and if the Director of Public Prosecutions decided to do so, yes, they could be prosecuted for treason.</P>
      <P>I regret if, by responding to Senator Ryan's amendment No. 8, I caused any inconvenience.  I presumed, from what the Cathaoirleach said, that we were taking amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 8 together.  When he called on me to respond I felt obliged to respond to all three together.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Government would urge this course of action in the light of what the Minister had to say because there are acts of treason being carried out against this country.  One was carried out on the night of the Irish football victory where football hooligan equivalents, in political terms, blew up a club in London and would not even allow us that unblemished moment of triumph &mdash; the spoiler's art revealed to the Irish public once again.  I am very interested that the Minister says that membership of the IRA is an act of treason.  I am very glad the record of this House will so show and I would like to know when they will prosecute them for treason.  It does not mean that they should be put in jail for 40 years.</P>
      <P>One question that was not answered &mdash; perhaps it was so frivolous, technical or trivial that it did not require an answer but I made it in good faith, in my ignorance and folly &mdash; it was whether there was any constitutional or legal bar to the removal of citizenship from people for the offence of treason, instead of shoving them into jail for 40 years.  Senator McDonald made an excellent point when he spoke about Greenland sending people to Coventry.  I would be very happy if members of the IRA were prosecuted for treason and, as a consequence, had their citizenship removed.</P>

      <P>We should get on with the legislation but we have not had satisfactory replies from the Minister.  I did <Col N="1407" /> not get any response to my argument as to why 3 (1) (d) should be not deleted because of the anomaly that it creates.  In relation to Senator Ryan's amendment the Minister's replies have been totally inadequate.  He has not given any justification for the retention of special mandatory sentences in relation to acts of treason.  The fact that no prosecutions have taken place in the history of the State is sufficient reason why this matter should not be dealt with in this legislation. We should have laws that are pragmatic and deal with real offences, not imaginary or hypothetical offences.  This legislation is not really eliminating the offence of capital punishment in relation to murder.  It is trying to retain all the baggage that was in the 1964 legislation. It has done that simply because people did not get around to thinking about it properly.  If we are talking about special mandatory sentences being imposed, it would be in the context of a life for a life. What we have thrown in are sections in relation to the institutions of the State, to treason and to emergency legislation.</P>
      <P>If we are to update this legislation properly we should do so clearly and cleanly. Special mandatory punishment should simply apply to the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána and prison officers.  In his introductory remarks, the Minister, Deputy Burke, said that this legislation was being updated because existing penalties were not being used, that there have not been any executions since 1954 and it was improper to have legislation on the Statute Book carrying a type of punishment that was not being used.  Why retain on the Statute Book the punishment for the offence of treason when it has not been used?  I ask the Minister to reply to amendment No. 3 and to consider deleting the three sections that are the subject matter of the three amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for answering several of my questions. He has opened up the possibility of several more.  His first and most interesting <Col N="1408" /> reply was that the IRA could be prosecuted for treason by virtue of membership. I have mixed feelings about it because the crime of treason should be abolished <i>per se.</i>  If members of the IRA can be prosecuted for treason by virtue of membership, why is the maximum sentence for membership of the IRA five years?  We have a situation whereby people can be prosecuted for membership of the IRA <i>per se</i> and be given up to five years in prison as a maximum sentence but they can also be prosecuted for treason and be given 40 years according to this Bill.  There is an anomaly here and perhaps the Minister can throw some light on it.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he could give us an example of where a treasonable offence was not covered by the normal criminal law and he replied by saying it was a crime according to the Constitution. That does not answer my question. I accept it is a constitutional crime but I asked for an example of where the crime of treason was not covered by the normal criminal law.  The whole concept of treason is quite ridiculous.  The third question I asked was when was the last case of treason and the answer was that there had not been one.  I knew the answer to that question before I asked it.</P>

      <P>It was important in making the case for its abolition to point out that it was redundant and that all cases of possible treason were covered by offences elsewhere.

      <P>I regret if I have not answered all the questions during the course of my reply.  Senator Costello made the point that section 3 (1) (d) should be removed in view of the fact that it does not cover members of the Government or the Oireachtas.  The reason they are not included is that it is inherent in the Bill and also because we <Col N="1409" /> have confidence in the institutions of the State and in the courts to make a judgment in relation to any offence that is committed against any person.  The very tragic death of Ambassador Ewart Biggs is proof positive of the need to have this section in the Bill.  We must clearly display the right of any Head of State, member of Government or ambassador from any part of the world to visit our country as a modern, open democracy and we must enshrine in law the necessary safeguards to protect them while they are here.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>Senators Ross and Ryan talked about treason.  Treason is a morally reprehensible offence and every State reserves the right to prosecute for such an offence.  Ordinary criminal provisions are not enough.</P>

      <P>All Members of the Oireachtas, as far as I am aware, are entitled to attend.  Senator Ross spoke about membership of the IRA and why there is a penalty of five years in jail if one is a member of the IRA.  That is not relevant in the context of this Bill.  We are taking this Bill in the context of capital offences which are there in law and we are changing the law in reference to that. Membership of illegal organisations and the penalties involved are not covered by this Bill.  That is additional to the Bill and it is something we should not be drawn on.</P>

      <P>The Minister furnished ample evidence to support the amendment in the original part of what he said. I was very interested to hear him support <Col N="1410" /> the amendment so vigorously.  The Minister was quite fulsome in his compliments to the courts and in their capacity to deal with the murder of mere mortals like myself, Senator Ross and indeed himself.  I wonder why he does not trust them to deal with the case of ambassadors and why, if the courts are capable of dealing in this way with certain kinds of murder, do they suddenly become frivolous, trivial or technical, to quote Senator O'Donovan, in dealing with the murder of ambassadors?</P>
      <P>I would like also to return to the attack because there seems to be an astonishing silence &mdash; I do not know how I could have provoked such silence &mdash; on the question of the IRA.  I found it fascinating that the Minister said they could be prosecuted for treason but we were not prosecuting them for treason.  I asked a technical question: was there a constitutional or legal bar to the removal of citizenship for persons found guilty of the treasonous offence of membership of the IRA or the committing of particularly horrible offences.  For my own satisfaction and to add a further sling to my pouch, I would be glad if the Minister would answer that question.</P>

    <P>That is the definition of an unlawful organisation &mdash; one that engages in treason. Apparently nobody has ever been charged with treason.  What we have here is that somebody threw together a shopping list of what are regarded as particularly heinous offences that people would be upset about.  Murder is awful.  It is right that anybody who commits murder <Col N="1411" /> should be sentenced to life imprisonment. It is absolutely daft to try to pick out different kinds of murder and make different provisions for them.  There is no logical, rational justification for the distinctions being inserted into this legislation. The simple thing is to say that anybody who commits murder or treason should be sentenced to life imprisonment. After that it is up to the normal procedures of judicial review or of ministerial review or proper parole, if we had one, to deal with the length of that sentence in the light of all of the considerations. This legislation with all the attempted pretence at niceties and distinctions is all nonsense.  That is what has emerged after the past hour of discussion.</P>

I am amazed that some of my colleagues do not think treason is as serious an offence as it is.  We are dealing with this Bill this afternoon and I do not mind if I am here until 4 o'clock tomorrow morning.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what we are saying.  Sections 1 and 2 are excellent. The remaining sections have been thrown together in a higgledy-piggledy fashion. They are ill-thought out and badly presented.  We are trying to improve the legislation.  We are not taking lightly the awful crime of treason but we are pointing out that this awful crime of treason has never been prosecuted in the history <Col N="1413" /> of the State.  We are saying that legislation should deal with the real world and with real issues.  The Minister said one of the reasons he was introducing this legislation to abolish the death penalty was because the punishment was not being used and that legislation which had been allowed to fall into disuse should not remain on the Statute Book.  Therefore, offences which have not been prosecuted by this State should fall into disuse in relation to the special mandatory imprisonment of 40 years.</P>
      <P>The wording of the reference in the Offences Against the State Act to the act of treason is very broad and vague in what it can actually cover.  It does not look as if the Minister will be very receptive and part of the problem is that the Minister for Justice is not here.  I do not believe the Minister present has authority to accept amendments and that is why we are being stonewalled.  The response he gave to amendment No. 3 reinforced everything I had said.  He said that it was inherent in the Bill.  It is not and the example he gave of the British Ambassador and the example I gave of the Senator from this House is proof positive that it is not inherent in the legislation.</P>
      <P>In the three amendments we point out the anomalies that are inherent in retaining these three sections and ask the Minister to delete them because they are not really part and parcel of this very desirable Bill to abolish the death penalty. That is the problem.  They are against the spirit of the Bill and in practical, legislative and technical terms they are ill-constituted and ill-presented.  Finally, we strongly urge the Minister to consider and accept the three amendments. There is the same underlying principle in each of the amendments and we ask the Minister to accept them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>Has the Minister either the capacity or the intention to accept any of these amendments because if the answer to either or both of those is no, then perhaps we will have to proceed with the Bill.

      <P>In response to Senator Norris's earlier point which I regret I did not answer, he asked if a person convicted of treason could be deprived of Irish citizenship.  This is not possible under the law.  You cannot take citizenship away from a person once it is conferred on him under Irish law.</P>
      <P>To go back to Senator Costello's point, we must understand we are talking about the serious offence of murder, the termination of somebody's life.  We have clearly clarified the situation pertaining to capital murder.  We have an onus as legislators to protect those who put themselves in the front line protecting people and property and discharging their duty on behalf of the State at a very high personal risk.  There has been a lot of talk about why a case has not been taken in regard to treason.  There is a fairly conclusive reason to leave it there.  It acts as a deterrent and it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide, under any particular Act, what is a crime and prosecute accordingly.</P>

It is the law of the land and we should accept it as such.  This is a very important Bill.  In a direct answer to Senator Norris, I have the capacity to accept amendments but I made it quite clear I will not be accepting the amendments that are being debated at the moment.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 32, after &ldquo;murder&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall be called aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to put a name on the offence.  We do not have offences without names and it would be a simple matter to call it something of this nature. How will we refer to thse two offences? A relevant and proper wording would be to call it &ldquo;aggravated murder&rdquo; or &ldquo;attempted aggravated murder&rdquo; and that would be in line with the recent Rape Bill where &ldquo;indecent assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggravated indecent assault&rdquo; was used.  I am enabling the Minister to put a name on the offence and it is appropriate that this should be done.  This should be non-controversial and there is no reason why the Minister should not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the proposers of this amendment are attempting to introduce a term which they hope would distinguish the particular type of murder dealt with in section 3 from &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; murder. However, the term &ldquo;aggravated&rdquo; is not appropriate in the context in which the Senator seeks to use it.  This term has connotations of some extra element in an action which makes the action more serious or more reprehensible such as the use of violence in aggravated burglary. What is in question in the case of section 3 murders is the status of the victim, not the manner of the murder.  The use of the term &ldquo;aggravated&rdquo; in that regard would <Col N="1416" /> not, therefore, be appropriate.  Consequently, I must oppose this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary for the Minister of State to take the exact wording here.  If he feels there is something extra included or suggested within the wording, then the Minister should come up with a form of wording.  The function of the Seanad is to improve legislation and where we have legislation that does not distinguish this particular offence from the offence of &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; murder then we are being negligent in dealing with it.  It is different.  There is no doubt about that.  Why will the Minister not follow what is normal procedure, that is, put appropriate terminology on the new offence that is being constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion that there should be a distinction between &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; murder and what was known up to now as capital murder.  Maybe this is an opportunity for the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman to look at a proper term that will distinguish it.  He could introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  It would improve the legislation. I welcome the inclusion of the concept of recklessness which the Minister for Justice fought so hard on the Larceny Bill.  It is nice now to see that he has accepted this approach in the context of this Bill.  I urge the Minister to look at the suggestion of Senator Costello.  It has a lot of merit and would improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spent a long time drawing the attention of the House to the fact that there were different kinds of murder and that there were additional elements in certain kinds of murder. There are two specific additional elements covered by section 3.  One is, as the Minister states, the status of the people who are the victims of a murder but the other is the inclusion of an additional political motive.  Both of these elements are additional ingredients in a murder and, consequently, could be said to aggravate a murder.  To aggravate means to make it more serious, make it a more weighty matter.  The Minister <Col N="1417" /> spent an hour arguing that those murders constitute a more weighty, a more serious form of murder because in addition to whatever gruesome manner the crime is carried out, there are additional factors and he listed those.  At least, he listed one that I know of.  I cannot understand why this descriptive term should not be added, which distinguishes a particular kind of murder.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent a long time arguing that it is a different kind of murder because there are additional elements which make it more serious, a more grave offence.  All are saying, and all Senator Costello is saying, as I understand him &mdash; he will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; is that we should recognise this additional gravity by calling it aggravated murder.  I do not see any difficulty in that.  I wonder if the Minister was, perhaps, being disingenuous when he said he had the capacity to accept amendments.</P>

Both himself and his excellent officials have given much time and attention to putting this Bill together.  Up to now all these offences were known collectively as capital offences.  However, treason is not murder and a new, all-inclusive term would be very difficult to find.

      <P>Amendment No. 5 states that except in times of war, every offence to which this section relates shall be tried by jury.  We are looking for a jury trial in relation to each of those offences.  There have been 11 capital murders committed here during the past two decades and I do not believe any of them have been tried by a jury.  They have all been tried in non-jury courts.  There is provision, of course, for military courts which were set up under the emergency legislation and <Col N="1419" /> the Offences Against the State Act. Therefore, all of those offences could be dealt with by non-jury courts or even by military courts.</P>
      <P>If we are, as the Minister has indicated, introducing legislation which will put us among the civilised nations of the world in the way in which we deal with offenders, then we must abide by the civilised judicial system which is in existence and accepted internationally, that is a jury trial by peers.  The citizens of the country are the people who should adjudicate, hear the case, and pronounce in relation to offences of a serious nature. This is an important and enlightened amendment and it should be introduced at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that Senator Costello raised is of extreme importance. The Minister has the slightly innocent view that the courts can be relied upon not to allow the Offences Against the State Act to be used other than in a very limited fashion but the Offences Against the State Act has been used to set up the Special Criminal Court.  It is worth while reading the section of the Act which provides for the setting up of the Special Criminal Court or the one which defines the Constitution.  Section 39 of the 1939 Act states:</P>
      <P>Every Special Criminal Court established under this Part of the Act shall consist of such an uneven number (not being less than three) of members as the Government shall from time to time determine, and different numbers of members may be so fixed in respect of different Special Criminal Courts.</P>
      <P>(3) No person shall be appointed to be a member of the Special Criminal Court unless he is a judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court, or a justice of the District Court, or a barrister of not less than seven years standing, or of a solicitor of not less than seven years standing, or</P>
      <P>and this is the one that is liable to make people extremely nervous</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> an officer of the Defence Forces not below the rank of commandant.</P>
    <P>This legislation which the Minister believes will always be benevolent and in the interest of civil liberties could be interpreted by three Army officers.  I am old enough to remember hearing on the radio news in the 1950s, when Fianna Fáil were in Government, about people being locked up virtually every day of the week for refusing to give an account of their movements.  That is hardly a treasonable offence but it is an offence under the Offences Against the State Act.  If we are proposing to lock people up for a minimum of 40 years, with the draconian extra provisions that are attached to later sections of this Bill, the least we can do is to ensure that the trial is heard in front of a jury.</P>
    <P>One of the myths of the establishment parties here is that nobody is unhappy with the Special Criminal Court.  I have heard prominent members of various large political parties say that.  There are many people profoundly unhappy with the operation of the Special Criminal Court and that degree of unhappiness will be infinitely worse if some future, or indeed the present, Government decide that one way to improve the efficiency of the Special Criminal Court is to have it established and run entirely by Army officers.  It is worth remembering that when a person is being tried they are not guilty of anything.  That distinction seems to get lost when talking about a court.  A person before a court is innocent and, therefore, one is not trying a murderer, but an innocent person who is guilty only when convicted.  Therefore, the Minister is saying that the trial of an innocent person, which could result in him or her spending 40 years in prison, less a small amount of remission, could be carried out by three Army officers.  That is not a mark of a civilised society and Senator Costello is right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>My party support the important element in our judicial system, the jury system.  We support it and <Col N="1421" /> believe it should be used as often and as far as possible in our judicial system.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, how do we determine what, in present day circumstances, are times of war?  Some people would argue that there is a war in the North of Ireland but we do not accept that.  Because of the approach of subversives to the system at present, in extreme circumstances there could be intimidation of juries.  We must protect the State and ensure that those who are guilty of criminal offences which were already mentioned and those who are guilty of what was previously called capital murder &mdash; now an offence without a name &mdash; are brought to justice where subversive organisations are in a position to take advantage of a critical situation, as has happened on some occasions in Northern Ireland.  Under those circumstances, we cannot support this amendment.  We would like to support it.  Hopefully, it can be accepted when subversives, the IRA and their ilk, come to their senses and decide that the rule of democracy, rather than the rule of the gun, should be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share Senator Neville's difficulty about the definition of when we are in a state of war.  I believe &mdash; this could be just the amateur's view &mdash; that there is a legally definable state of war and this State is at war when it so declares in a legal fashion.  I do not consider that we are in a state of war for a very good reason.  I do not believe that the so-called Irish Republican Army, which is in fact no such thing, has the legal capacity to declare war.  It may commit acts of aggression against the Irish people, and has consistently done so over the last 20 years, but it is not a state of war in legal terms.  Perhaps the Minister and his advisers will clarify this point for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the developing discussion on this Bill where the amendments sought by this side of the House have been faced down by the Government &mdash; and, of course, it is their right to do so &mdash; we are left in a situation where accused persons can now face severe penalties in relation <Col N="1422" /> to terms of imprisonment and Senator Ryan made the case that this might arise in the incidental operation of the Offences Against the State Act.  There was no answer to that and, therefore, it is clear that it could happen.  A good principle to follow is that when a citizen is threatened with increased jeopardy, there is a moral obligation to increase the safeguards.  Senator Costello is right in indicating the one prime safeguard in our legal system, the existence of juries.  The argument is very well made.  Therefore, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not attempt at this stage to say that the amendment is frivolous or vexatious.  I made the point because that was my opinion on the amendments we were dealing with and, obviously many of the people on the other side disagree with me which they are entitled to do.  I can see the rationale and reasoning behind this amendment, but I oppose it because of the point made by Senator Neville that unfortunately, whether we like it or not, certain crimes are committed which the ordinary, existing courts with judge and jury are not capable of dealing with.  Normally it is a Garda or a prison officer who is murdered; these people are the first line of defence and the prime target for attack by subversive organisations, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, would like to see the jury system available to all people.  As a practising lawyer, I believe it is a basic right.  Unfortunately recent history in this State has proved that certain crimes are carried out by very well equipped organisations &mdash; the IRA or other subversives &mdash; and in this instance the position appears to be that in the ordinary courts jurors would be reluctant to serve and would be intimidated. Unfortunately, these cases must be tried by the Special Criminal Court. In my experience and knowledge of the Special Criminal Court in the past two decades or so, nobody except a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge, a District Court judge or a well qualified lawyer, has sat in it.  That is the practical reality.  It could be argued that I as a solicitor with ten years' experience I <Col N="1423" /> could sit on such a court; it is theoreticially possible but in reality it does not arise.  I oppose this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the ordinary courts are not capable of dealing with those cases in a practical or other level. The question of intimidation of jurors is foremost in my mind.  It exists and we must accept the legisaltion proposed by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand why Senator Costello has moved this amendment. I am a fairly strong supporter of the Special Criminal Court, the reason it exists and the reasons it should continue. As Senator O'Donovan rightly said, it is everybody's ambition that all cases should be tried by jury in a perfect democracy and that everybody should stand before their peers but we are not in a position where that can happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Special Criminal Court was introduced here in 1972, but I am open to correction on that.  It has been in operation under successive Governments since that time including the Labour Party, when in Government, and every other party.  It has functioned reasonably well and reasonably fairly.  The reason it was set up was very simple, and other speakers touched on it.  It was because convictions were not being gained against subversives when the Garda and others were obviously convinced that jurors <Col N="1424" /> were being intimidated.  That is not a situation which any democracy can tolerate. We simply cannot say that the State is so generous that guilty people should go free because an organisation to which they belong can intimidate witnesses and jurors.  That is the strongest argument for the retention of the Special Criminal Court.  It is something I am reluctant to support because it offends many principles in which I believe but in practice it is inevitable that, if we are to gain convictions against subversives, the Special Criminal Court will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am doubtful whether any democracy can indulge in the privilege of giving this sort of luxury of justice to those who simply do not believe in it and do not give it out themselves.  The IRA scream &ldquo;foul&rdquo; when they are brought before the Diplock Courts in Northern Ireland and before the Special Criminal Court here.  Yet, they hold kangaroo courts; they murder people at will; they intimidate and bomb people and expect to get privileges from the State which they do not accord to others.  I am doubtful whether it would be right to give them those privileges, but it is simply because of the proved intimidation of jurors that it is wrong to dilute the powers of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks of our spokesperson, Senator Neville.  It would be highly dangerous for us to have such trials held by jury because of the serious nature of the offences we are talking about and the likelihood that a jury would be interfered with.  It is important that in this legislation we make it quite clear that when people are tried for the capital murder of a member of the Garda Síochána or a prison officer, they will not have the chance to intimidate jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, we have been very well served by the Special Criminal Court. The people who have served on this court have mainly been people of one party appointed by the other party and <i>vice versa,</i> and that is how it should be.  They have proved that merit and ability come <Col N="1425" /> to the top.  In the lower courts we sometimes do not see a uniformity of sentencing and we ask whether there should be some training for judges.  As Senator O'Donovan said, a person with ten years in practice can suddenly be on the bench dealing with law he never dealt with in practice.  Something should be done in relation to that.</P>
    <P>Where war is declared on criminals and murderers we must have the Special Criminal Court and a jury is not appropriate in that case.  We have seen all too often the cynicism of the IRA who can manipulate public opinion in various ways.  It is important that in this legislation we give a clear commitment.  While certain people have been gaining kudos over the abolition of hanging &mdash; which has not happened often over the past 34 or 36 years &mdash; our main consideration should be to give the maximum protection to the members of the Garda Síochána and prison officers.  Trial by jury has the obvious possibility of threats to jurors or their families and this is a real threat.  People charged are innocent until proven guilty but we are not talking about shoplifters and that should be remembered. I oppose this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about a number of things, particularly the last remark about not dealing with shoplifters here.  Are there now to be gradations of innocence which will presume shoplifters to be more innocent than people who are accused of murder?  The presumption of innocence is absolute until it is reversed by a decision of the court.  I am increasingly concerned at the picture that has been painted throughout the afternoon. I have heard that we are in a state of war.  I have heard a considerable amount about politically inspired murders, about people who band themselves together for the purpose of subverting the State and now various people in the House are attempting to establish &mdash; perhaps they have reason to do so &mdash; that there is widespread intimidation of juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my colleagues asked for a definition of treason.  I would suggest that if the State of Ireland is in a state of war, <Col N="1426" /> if there is a spate of politically inspired murders, if there are bands of people roaming the countryside with the intention of perpetrating such crimes, and if they subsequently conspire to pervert the institutions of this State, that is a very good definition of treason and if this is a description of the Provisional IRA so-called, then they are guilty of treason. That reinforces my question earlier, why then are they not prosecuted?  One cannot have it both ways.  If those conditions currently obtain here and if the condition of treason clearly exists throughout the countryside, why is it not being looked at in this manner?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Norris, I listened with concern.  I am not sure whether we are in a state of war or not because on reading Article 28 of the Constitution as far as I know we actually are under a state of emergency.  It states:</P>
      <P>...In this sub-section &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; includes a time when there is taking place an armed conflict in which the State is not a participant but in respect of which each of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall have resolved that, arising out of such armed conflict, a national emergency exists affecting the vital interests of the State...</P>
      <P>My understanding is that such a resolution has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and, therefore, surprising as it may seem, we are in a time of war.  That is something I learned after I had spoken.  The argument is, in fact, about the crazy definition of a time of war.  I know that whatever may be wrong with the country, I am not in a state of war and neither is the rest of the country in a state of war.  Therefore, perhaps we should redefine our terms.</P>
      <P>I will say something that is liable to get me into a lot of trouble.  There are worse organisations in the country and worse people in the country than the Provisional IRA.</P>

      <P>Maybe Senator Ross knows more about the resources available to drug pushers than I do but I have no reason to believe, on the record of international drug pushing, that drug pushers are lacking in weapons, ruthlessness or any equipment to kill people. You do not need Semtex explosives to intimidate a juror, there are a lot of ways to do it.  These people, who have shown themselves to be entirely ruthless in the way they deal with and dispose of children, are prefectly capable of using the children of jurors.  It is one of the extraordinary strengths of democracy that juries do not, by and large, give in to this intimidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the crazy things about this patronising paternalistic State of ours is that we do not actually believe our citizens are capable of ruling themselves.  As far as I am aware, the number of cases where it can be demonstrated that a trial was <Col N="1428" /> subverted, because jurors were intimidated, could be written on one hand.  It is on the basis of a Government opinion that it might happen that special criminal courts were set up.  I have far more faith in the citizens of this country than perhaps the Government, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael have.  I do not believe our citizens will be intimidated not to do their duty as jurors.  I do not believe it has happened in drug trials and I do not believe it would happen in the trials of people who are called subversives.  I believe in the strength and the capacity of our people to defend what they like about this country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in picking out the Provisional IRA or any other organisation who use murder for political purposes and saying we must have special courts for them.  There are other groups who do the same thing.  I am appalled at the idea that a committed civil libertarian like Senator Ross would be so outrageous as to interrupt me from the public gallery and would then continue along this line.</P>
    <P>We need jury trial.  It is a bedrock of democracy.  Countries like the United States of America, which have dealt with organised crime on a scale we could not dream of, and which have murder on a scale that, even at the height of the IRA activities, we would never dream of, have never suggested that they should go away from jury trials.  I do not think we should either.</P>

It is amazing to have to listen to people who do not think there is intimidation, who have never heard of knee-capping or the arbitrary kangaroo courts that seem to go on in parts of this country on a weekly basis.  This is well known.  There is no one in public life in this country who is not abreast of what is happening, what is being attempted, and the way some of these people, whether they are part of the Mafia dealing with drug pushing or on the fringe using the national question as a cover for their illegal activities, stoop to frustrate the law and the due process <Col N="1429" /> of law.  We in this House have an obligation to ensure that the legislation we pass will be adequate to meet not only the present situation but what may happen in the future because it may be another 20 years before the House has an opportunity to look at this legislation again.  It is not good enough that people come in here with this extraordinary innocence and are not aware that there are gangs in this country and there are no depths to which these people will not stoop.  It is amazing to find people, who have very impressive credentials as legislators, should turn a blind eye to half of what is going on in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a number of points in relation to what has been said. This crime with no name, is certainly proving to be very difficult to deal with in the courts.  Let me point out that the Special Criminal Court was not set up for the purpose of dealing with capital murder.  That was not envisaged as part of its establishment; that is not the function of the Special Criminal Court.  Quite a number of offences of capital murder have been dealt with that had no political connection whatsoever.  I have pointed out that every offence has been dealt with by the Special Criminal Court; every offence of capital murder to date, irrespective of whether there was a political motive has been dealt with by these non-jury courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the forties and fifties there were special military courts of three officers; we still have provision for this.  If, as Senator Ryan said, we are in a state of war &mdash; we are certainly in a state of emergency &mdash; and if that is a state of war without an actual declaration of war, as seems to be suggested by the Constitution, then I have no problem withdrawing this amendment because it says &ldquo;except in times of war&rdquo;.  All these cases have been dealt with by special non-jury courts.  I want to point out that since we talked about the whole business of intimidation of jurors in the early seventies we introduced majority decisions. You do not now need to have a unanimous decision; it can be 10:2 decision. With regard to the question of intimidation of juries, whatever the opinion people may have, steps have been taken juridically to deal with that possibility. As I said, there we have a majority decision.  I am talking in terms of democracy. This is democracy dealing with offences in normal times.  These offences, no matter how serious they are in a democratic and civilised society, should be <Col N="1431" /> dealt with by the ordinary democratic structures.  Because the record states that they have not been dealt with by the normal democratic structures hitherto it is incumbent upon us to put in a caveat, a provision, to ensure that, since we are revamping, reorganising and reforming this legislation, we deal with that situation. The purpose of this amendment is to improve this legislation so that any person who is charged under it is adjudicated on by his peers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of sections of this Bill is to have a deterrent against what was previously known as capital murder, the murder of a garda or a member of the Prison Service, the group they come under most threat from are the IRA and their ilk.  It is well known that part of the IRA's weaponry in their fight against what they call the war against this State &mdash; their ultimate aim is to bring down the institutions of this State &mdash; is intimidation.</P>
      <P>Many of us know that people have been telephoned late at night and told: &ldquo;we know where your children are going to school; we know where your sister is working; we know what time your wife leaves the house; we know you have made a certain statement about something and we would like you to change your views&rdquo;.  I know people that was happened to.  Intimidation is a part of the weaponry of the IRA.  While everybody accepts that, as far as possible, decisions should be made under the jury system, that our peers should decide, in extreme cases, there can be the type of intimidation I have outlined and it is our duty to protect the State and our citizens against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to ring the spouse of, or a member of, the Special Criminal Court and make similar threats. Where is this presumption on the establishment that ordinary citizens, apparently, are less courageous, more easily intimidated than members of the Judiciary?  On behalf of the ordinary citizenry, I resent that.  It is the people who <Col N="1432" /> build our democracy, not the establishment, whether it be the judicial, political or otherwise.  The strength of democracy is the strength of ordinary people's commitment to it.  That is the fundamental bedrock of democracy and it works.  No matter what people who feel superior think, it is the ordinary people's commitment to the freedoms that underpin democracy that keep democracy intact.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how all these people can be phoned and threatened when nobody knows, until the day of a court, who will be on the jury.  We are confusing intimidation of witnesses with intimidation of a jury.  Intimidation of witnesses can take place just as much in front of the Special Criminal Court as it can in front of a jury.  I am not aware of any particular gift that judges in the Special Criminal Court have that enables them to divine evidence that is not presented by witnesses.  The Special Criminal Court is bound by the same rules as a jury, which is to find that somebody is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. They must do that on the basis of the evidence, not on the basis that they do not like the look of somebody, he is a member of the IRA or anything like that. They must do it on the basis of the evidence, the same way that a jury would do it.  If witnesses are intimidated out of giving evidence and to not give evidence before the Special Criminal Court, the Special Criminal Court, in theory at least, is obliged to operate in the same way as a jury and find the person charged not guilty.  They do not operate on a different law of evidence or a different level of evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Members in front of me here are saying that the Special Criminal Court finds people guilty on lesser evidence than a jury, then we are even in a more serious situation than I thought because we actually have courts that are set up not to protect the citizen, but to convict him quicker on lesser evidence.  Can somebody tell me how you can intimidate all of a jury when they are not picked until the day of a trial, or how you can protect witnesses simply by having the <Col N="1433" /> trial in front of three judges instead of in front of a jury?</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Ryan, I have had a phone call from a subversive organisation and I will not be intimidated.  When that goes public we see the effect it has on the family.  They may be lesser beings than the general public &mdash; as Senator Ryan would say &mdash; but they certainly are intimidated and may put pressure on one to change one's views.  One has to be strong and, if you are a public representative, you are obliged to be strong.  If you are a member of the Judiciary, you too are obliged to be strong.  Would this ordinary citizen, like any member of our families who might be affected, have the same strong will?  In my view, it is very simple to intimidate a jury if the IRA want to do that.  Another aspect of their weaponry is knee-capping.  If they knee-cap three or four members of a jury who convicted somebody else, surely that is intimidation of the next jury, without ever knowing their names.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if, at times, Senator Ryan, who does a lot of good work on other fronts, lives in the real world when he talks about intimidation. Obviously the men of violence will not know the names of the jury until they have been selected, but if a trial is going on over a period, obviously the jury members will be known to these men of violence.  Their intelligence system is every bit as good as is necessary to enable them to intimidate people.  When there is an IRA funeral the word goes out to close shops and so on.  We have to live in the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen members of the Garda Síochána and a former Member of this House killed by members of the IRA. While there is a great deal of talk about civil liberties, it is interesting to note that the person who committed that crime recently was released; but, unfortunately, that Senator is not alive today. It annoys me when there is all this talk about democratic systems and civil liberties and we know about gardaí in <Col N="1434" /> Roscommon, Meath and Dublin who have been killed.  Looking at later amendments to the Bill, I wonder if we want to reduce even further the effect of this legislation?  We are abolishing capital punishment.  It was there for specific offences, but it appears now that we want to totally undermine the members of the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>I believe we have to live in the real world and not in some Utopia where we have marvellous jurors who are well able to stand up to any intimidation.  I understand that members of the Special Criminal Court have the protection of armed guards.  The jury system works well in other situations, but we are not dealing with a normal situation here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a wide ranging debate on this amendment, which is a direct and unwarranted contradiction of the whole system of Special Criminal Courts established by Part V of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. Section 36 (1) of that Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the trial by Special Criminal Courts of offences in relation to which the Government are satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it is the activities of subversive organisations, largely the <i>raison d'étre</i> for Special Criminal Courts, which present one of the greatest threats to the lives of gardaí as experience has shown.  It would be totally irrational, therefore, to provide, as this amendment would, that the murderer of a garda could not be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  If one accepts the rationale for having such a court, particularly the danger of jury intimidation, then this may be the very case where such a court is most needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay a special compliment to Senator Ross, who made a very warm and eloquent contribution against this amendment.  Senator Norris asked for details where intimidation has taken place.  I cannot give figures but <Col N="1435" /> there are situations where this has occurred.  There is no doubt about this and our eminent colleagues have clearly verified it.  Such cases could arise without anybody knowing that a juror has been got at &mdash; to use common parlance.  The very fact that in serious crimes like this an ordinary member of the public is put in as a juror is human intimidation in itself.  The fact that they are asked to adjudicate in a very high powered, legal structure, involving a very serious crime, must surely be human intimidation, never mind the personal intimidation, the serious situation that is created where there is subtle intimidation applied or, indeed, more serious intimidation.</P>
    <P>Could I say to Senator Ryan that members of the Judiciary have permanent police protection.  To provide this protection for jurors would be virtually impossible.  I would like to remind the House that the Offences Against the State Act is directed against those who have no concern for civil liberties.  If such people were allowed to usurp the powers of the State there would be very few civil liberties available.  We must have the necessary laws to prevent this.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the connection between amendments Nos. 6 and 7 but if that is your ruling I will accept it. I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;section 7 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection refers to the Prisons Acts, 1826 to 1980, section 7 of the Offences <Col N="1436" /> Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, section 233 of the Defence Act, 1954 and section 2 of the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956.  All of this legislation clearly deals with emergency type situations and section 7 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act refers to internment camps.  It is exclusively concerned with internment. While that section of legislation is dormant at present, it can be activated at any time.</P>
    <P>We still have not got an answer from the Minister to the question: are we in a state of war?  If we are in a state of war, all these amendments should be withdrawn and we better get cracking to see how we can save the country from all types of terrible things.  Kneecapping is very minor in the context of a state of war.  If we are not living in a state of war, or we are not in a State that considers itself in such circumstances, then we should not have provision for internment camps and we should have not have provision for internment.  This is a very reasonable amendment to delete that section which should not be there in the first place.  That should have been repealed ages ago.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is a separate matter.  I was surprised when I saw the definition of a &ldquo;prison officer.&rdquo;  We have no such definition of a Garda.  The definition of a &ldquo;prison officer&rdquo; includes any member of the staff of a prison and any person having the custody of, or having duties in relation to the custody of, a person detained in a prison.  That is an extremely wide definition of a prison officer, not a definition anybody would normally associate with a prison officer. Having duties in relation to the custody of a person detained in a prison is so wide that it can encompass everybody who has any function in relation to the administration, operation or any service provided within the prison context.  That could extend to chaplains, who are paid by the Prison Service, the Department of Justice, visiting committees, members who visit the prisons on an ongoing basis, teachers who are seconded from the VECs, the probation service, or a cook in a kitchen in the prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> I do not think that is the intention of the legislation in relation to what constituted capital murder previously.  It should not be the intention of the legislation if the principle we have at present is to abolish capital murder except in the most serious offences where people are directly concerned with the security of the institutions of the State.  That is an unnecessarily wide catch-all phrase that does not do justice to the excellent provisions in sections 1 and 2 of this legislation. The Minister should accept both amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought the appropriate way to deal with internment and any threat to people who are operating internment camps, which is what section 7 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, deals with, would have been to introduce the necessary legislation if and when the Government deem it necessary to introduce internment, which I hope will be never.  To introduce protection for people who may operate internment camps that currently do not exist seems to be giving a permanence to internment that nobody with any sort of commitment to civil liberties would accept, I have no problems about my commitment to civil liberties. I am not aware of any criminal who could be regarded as a champion of civil liberties. When people pick on one form of illegal activity and see it as a threat to civil liberties and not see the people who do appalling damage, assault and rape people, and reflect on the general level of civil liberties, there is a gut reaction which does not help rational analysis.  I agree fully with Senator Costello.  There should be no reference to internment camps in ordinary legislation.  The Offences Against the State Act is draconian enough to meet any possible threat to the State.  It is one of the most frightening pieces of legislation one could ever have the misfortune to have to go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why we cannot have language used in its ordinary form in legislation.  To me a prison officer is a <Col N="1438" /> person who is employed to run the prisons. Instead we have a definition introduced here which extends to anybody who has anything to do with the prison system &ldquo;having duties in relation to the custody of.&rdquo; That, presumably, extends to those officials of the Department of Justice who have duties in relation to the administration of prisons.  Perhaps it even extends to the Minister for Justice, who has duties &ldquo;in relation to the custody of.&rdquo; We are in the ridiculous position where, if murder is committed and the Minister for Justice is killed, that is a different offence from the murder of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The attempt to define one form of murder as being different from another is ludicrous because people have said we must put in certain people as they are special areas of need.  We are now in the ludicrous position where I think the only logical interpretation of the Bill is to say that if the Minister for Justice is murdered the person who murdered him will go to jail for 40 years and if the Taoiseach is murdered the person who murdered him will go to jail for life, which may be different.  It does not make sense.  It is not the objective on this side to make frivolous objections; it is simply to expose, in my view, the meaninglessness of trying to define different categories of murder.</P>
    <P>It is the power of every Government this State has had to keep people who are sentenced to life imprisonment in prison for the rest of their lives.  That is what life imprisonment means.  There is no judicial interpretation, there is no law which says otherwise.  If somebody is convicted of the murder of a garda at the age of 19 and he or she is sentenced to life imprisonment, that sentence could be a 51 year sentence if the person lives to be 70.  That is the law of the land, and nobody has to release them.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why a Government who are prepared to put legislation through which says people should serve 40 years somehow think some other Government will release them after ten years.  It is all a meaningless sham to impress certain people.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No.  6, this is a very complex issue &mdash; the whole area of sanctions by the courts and any type of sanctions by the State.  I and my party have called on numerous occasions for a full discussion and a different approach towards the whole area of sanctions by the court. This needs a comprehensive and detailed discussion before decisions are made.  I would ask the Minister of State to urge the Minister for Justice to ensure that the custodial service does the work it was designed to do and that a debate is initiated, perhaps in this House, on the issue.  We have proposals on the whole area which deserve consideration and, which complement &mdash; in fact, they are similar to a large extent &mdash; the Whitaker report.  I would urge the Minister to consider this.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 7 &mdash; the deletion of &ldquo;having duties in relation to the custody of&rdquo;&mdash; there are many people in our Prison Service who are not prison officers who have access to information about activities in the prison, about decisions that may have been made by the authorities in the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example of this might be a typist or secretary who would have information on plans, on decisions, that have been taken and on the situation inside the prison.  Other people who were mentioned by my colleagues already would have access to similar information.  These <Col N="1440" /> people must also be protected.  They are open to much the same pressures and they are open to blackmail to release that information as are the prison officers.  It is my view that these people should be protected in the Bill in a similar way to the prison officers.</P>

It is easy to have identify these people.  It is easy to have access to them.  I would ask the Minister if these people enjoy that kind of protection. As ordinary civil servants they serve the State, but by virtue of the fact that they are transferred into this particular section, they are in a vulnerable position.  I would like to think that they can go home at night with the maximum protection this Bill can give them.</P>

Section 7 of the Offences Against the State (Amendments) Act is referred to in that Act.  Nothing new is being introduced.</P>

      <P>I am not going to get into a debate on this issue across the floor of Seanad Éireann.  It is obvious that the Minister for Justice is a member of the Government, is a politician elected by the people, and we are talking here specifically about the staff who are delegated to do a particular job.  I also want to respond to Senator McDonald and say that it does not include the inspectorate or the administrative officers who would have to visit the prisons in the performance of their duties, in relation to their membership of the Department of Justice or in relation to the membership of any committees to which they would be appointed or in relation to any commissions or functions that would be given to any citizen in relation to prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, confers power to make regulations for the management, etc., of places of detention provided under the Act for the detention of persons whose arrest and detention is ordered by a Minister under section 4 of the Act on the grounds that they are engaged in activities prejudicial to the preservation of public peace and order or to the security of the State.  I would assume from these amendments that the Senators are not well disposed towards that provision.  Be that as it may, this amendment will not alter the position, save that it would withdraw the protection of the 40 year penalty from soldiers who might be called upon to guard prisoners in a military detention centre. This would be quite wrong.  It is one thing for the Senators to disagree with the provisions of the 1940 Act, that is their entitlement.  However, that is no reason to lessen protection against the murder of a soldier.  The deletion of the words &ldquo;or having duties in relation to the custody of&rdquo; from the definition of prison officer as proposed in amendment No. 7 would deprive soldiers guarding a place of military detention of the protection of this Bill.  Of more immediate importance than that, it would deprive soldiers who carry out duties at Portlaoise Prison or <Col N="1442" /> who escort prisoners to the Special Criminal Court, for example, of such vital protection. This would be totally unacceptable and, consequently, I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarification.  I still find the wording of the second amendment, &ldquo;having duties in relation to the custody of&rdquo;, very unclear.  If it is specifically inserted to protect soldiers who are from time to time in charge of prisons, then could we not have it specifically inserted in that context, or could it not be interpreted in the context of staff which comes before that, because &ldquo;prison officer&rdquo; includes any member of the staff of a prison?  It could be any member of the staff who could from time to time be part of the security staff of the prison.  The words &ldquo;having duties in relation to the custody of&rdquo; a person detained in a prison are extremely broad.</P>
      <P>While the Minister may state that his intention is simply to cover soldiers, that is not what the legislation states.  I would specifically refer to, say, a member of the visiting committee, who got very explicit duties in relation to discipline of prisoners and the custody of prisoners.  They have functions to put prisoners in irons, to punish them.  The visiting committee have, under instruments of the Visiting Committee Act, 1925, specific functions to place prisoners, in disciplinary terms, in irons.  They can take remission from prisoners for periods of months, that is in relation to the custody of people in prison.</P>
      <P>Looking at it as an ordinary man in the street, certainly I cannot see how this is restricted to soldiers who from time to time may be there.  It is certainly far too broadly stated.  Even if the Minister is not happy with the wording we have presented here, then he should tighten it up to state what it is intended to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other amendment concerning section 7 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, I do not think it is good enough for the Minister to say again and again that everything that is here was in the 1964 Act, that we are not adding <Col N="1443" /> to it.  Of course, we are not.  The intention of this legislation is to reform and improve and to get rid of sections of the 1964 Criminal Justice Act in relation to capital murder which were undesirable and to improve upon them.  He says there is nothing new in this.  That is the problem. We feel that there should be and that this type of situation should be dealt with.  It is for all these reasons that we are unhappy the Minister has left so many sections of the 1964 Act, and has simply addressed parts and left other undigested sections still there that no doubt will have to be dealt with in the years to come.  So, it would be a lot cleaner and healthier if this legislation did take on board these amendments.  They would certainly be an improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for Senator Costello.  Before you withdraw the amendment, I would like to say a couple of things.  First, since I have often been accused in this House of activities which are prejudicial to the preservation of public peace, I am very glad that the 1940 amendment to the Offences Against the State Act is not in force at present. Given some of the comments about our unwillingness to support the institutions of the State, I suspect those of us in the back benches might be the first targets for detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the reason I support Senator Costello on the first of these two amendments is because I would like to make it as difficult as possible to introduce internment without trial, because in my view it was used improperly in the past, it was threatened improperly in the 1970s and it is something that should only be resorted to when there is a real threat to the State, and not when the Government think it is a useful weapon to pacify a particularly outraged public opinion.  Therefore, the protection of those who have the job of looking after internment should be a part of the legislative process to deal with <Col N="1444" /> internment and not part of the ordinary law of the land.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister can say over and over again, like a cracked record, that in relation to a prison officer as defined, or a person having duties in relation to the custody of a person detained in prison, that that does not include officers of the Department of Justice &mdash; or maybe it does &mdash; and that it does not include the Minister for Justice, but I know and he knows that the Minister for Justice on a regular basis decides whether people can get early release or can go on various training programmes, whether they can have parole or a whole lot of things, because we all have files of letters saying &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister to say&rdquo; that he did or did not decide on a particular case of a person in custody to do something.  I do not know how the laws of logic could lead me to any other conclusion than that the person who writes those letters, the Minister for Justice, each of which is written in relation to the custody of a person detained in prison, how the person who does that is not covered by this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is a nice man, a decent man, and a good friend of mine over the years we have been in politics, but it is not good enough to say that it does not mean what he says, it means.  It is up to him to explain to me why it does not mean what I think it means and to explain it in simple language, or perhaps somebody else can explain it to me in simple language why it is that something that makes perfect sense to me does not apply in the way I think it applies.  In relation to the group the Minister for Justice set up to review the cases of people who have long sentences, do those people have duties in relation to the custody of a person detained in prison?  It is one thing to attempt to protect people who are actually responsible for protecting prisons or prisoners or guaranteeing that prisoners do not abscond, we can all see the logic of that, but to throw in a catch-all phrase in case you have not thought of somebody is the ultimate in sloppy language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> Finally, why is it that the murder of a garda or of a soldier when he is guarding prisoners is a worse offence than the murder of a soldier when he is guarding something else?  Nowhere in this legislation is the murder of a member of the armed forces treated as having the same gravity as a member of the Garda.  Why are the Army picked out in a certain cases as deserving of this protection?  I am fascinated, and I listened with interest to the Members of this House particulaly who think that deterrent is important, how we are going to get the criminal mind to understand that for murdering a soldier who is guarding prisoners he will go to jail for 40 years but if he murders a soldier somewhere else he will go to jail for the rest of his life, and how he would appreciate the distinction for that matter. The logic of all this, as I have said before, escapes me.  I would like the Minister to explain to me why I misunderstood this simple English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one point arising from what Senator Costello said.  When I visited Portlaoise Prison I never looked upon myself or my colleagues as being part of the establishment. According to the book of rules with which we were supplied, we were there to guarantee and monitor the rights of the prisoners and every representation we made was to the Department and to the Governor to alleviate or to extend parole.  Certainly, we never came across an occasion when the committee would be asking for the removal of an offender's privileges.  It is very difficult for an ordinary member of the prison committee to get the respect and the confidence of prisoners.  It takes quite a long time to be able to show them that the role of the voluntary members of a visiting committee is to serve and to endeavour to make the situation as humane and as socially acceptable as possible.  I would be aghast to think of a prison committee recommending the imposition or the removal of privileges from any offender.</P>

Of course, we expect a visiting committee to operate in the best way they can in relation to their duties; but remember that they have a dual duty and that one of them is to inspect and monitor the prisons and to report to the Minister. They have a second duty, which is one of discipline, and they have authority to remove privileges and take remission and to put prisoners in irons.  Those are their duties, to do that wherever it is appropriate.</P>

      <P>Sometimes we have the Army operating as a backup to the Garda, particularly in relation to the removal of money from banks and so on. Surely, if the Minister now tells us that the purpose of this particular phase is to protect members of the armed forces when they are operating as security forces in relation to the Prison Service, then surely we should have a separate section saying &ldquo;Garda Síochána includes any member of the staff or any member having duties in relation to the custody of,&rdquo; because sometimes, and increasingly so, we have members of the armed forces supporting the Garda in their activities. There is another anormaly in that area, so I really think the Minister should go back <Col N="1447" /> to this particular amendment and come up with an improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to make.  The first one is in regard to where Senator Ryan, Senator Costello and perhaps Senator Norris talked about this &ldquo;state of war&rdquo;.  I took a note of it at the time and I meant to reply to it.  This country is not in a state of war.  I do not think any Member of this House said we were in a state of war, but one Member said that, if one could take in the context of Northern Ireland, perhaps it would be in a state of war &mdash; but perhaps only. Nobody has said that and I want to clarify that situation.  In the context of Northern Ireland only, that is what was said.  We will see the record.</P>
      <P>Let me say that with regard to the definition in subsection (3), &ldquo;prison officer&rdquo; includes any member of the staff of a prison and any person having the custody of or having duties in relation to the custody of a person detained in a prison, so that includes a soldier or soldiers, a garda or gardaí if they have the custody of or have duties in relation to the custody of a prisoner or prisoners.  That is very clear.  There is no ambiguity whatever in that.  It does not include the Minister for Justice.  It does not include the staff of the Department of Justice.  It does not include visiting committees.  It does not include inspectors or members of a commission who have a particular judicial, legislative, ministerial function or a particular delegated function to carry out.  It is very clear and I do not think that there is any ambiguity about it.  I hope we can agree the section on that basis.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying to me that the Minister for Justice is not a person who has &ldquo;duties in relation to the custody of a person detained in prison&rdquo;? I have obviously been writing all my letters to the wrong person because the Minister has no duties in relation to a person detained in prison.  Whom should I write to?  Obviously, I am writing to the <Col N="1448" /> wrong person, because the Minister has no duties in relation to a person detained in prison.

      <P>This is a serious situation. The Minister for Justice has a political function to carry out and execute on behalf of prisoners in this country as he is charged with the overall political governmental responsibility for them. We are talking here about a Bill which clearly defines who is a prison officer, who can be construed as a prison officer in the course of the execution and the functional operation of the custody of prisoners.  There can be no doubt about that.  The Senator can still make his representations. There is no need for me to respond to him on that.  He knows full well whom to write to in all cases, I have no doubt about that.</P>

      <P>The Minister may know what he means by a &ldquo;prison officer&rdquo; and I think I know what a prison officer is. But let us be very clear here.  A prison officer here, in the Minister's words, include soldiers who are on duty at a prison.  That is not what people outside understand, so, actually, in the Minister's own words, the words do not mean prison officers as the ordinary citizen understands it.  The question then is not whether we are talking about prison officers, but where this definition leaves us.  This definition leaves us quite clearly to either the position where the Minister for Justice is covered or else the Minister for Justice is not a person who has a duty in relation to the custody of a person detained in prison.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  Either he is talking about prison officers, as we all understand them, in which it should say, a member of the staff of a prison.  Alternatively, it means what the phrase says and what the phrase quite clearly means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not the Minister who will interpret this legislation.  While the Minister has given it as his opinion that it refers to the Army &mdash; wherever he came up with that notion &mdash; in the context of what the wording is actually here it is beyond my comprehension.  It is the courts that will make the distinction and the definition in so far as the intention is encompassed in the wording.  The Minister has not answered the further question I asked him, which was: what is the situation if the Garda, in the course of their duty, are supported by the Army? Does that mean that if a garda was killed <Col N="1450" /> then it would be subject to the terms of section 3 of the Bill, but if a soldier was killed, then it would not?  How does he deal with that anomaly?  In other words, in relation to the prison context we have no specific statement or definition in relation to a garda.  I think that is part of what we have been complaining about in regard to this legislation.  It is far too loose.  There is no statement in relation to the Army, in relation to any back-up for the Garda in the course of their duty.</P>

    <Title>Private Business. - GATT Talks: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Dardis on 20 June 1990:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann rejects the negotiating position adopted by the United States of America in the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and noting the adverse effect that agreement to the US proposals would have on the Irish economy and on our agriculture, calls on the European Community to defend the Common Agricultural Policy and the family farm.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;defend&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the principle objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy in the interest of both producer and consumer in the Community.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Raftery.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When I finished speaking last week I was just moving on to the history of GATT and the attitude to GATT generally.  The impression should not be given that the USA or the CAIRNS group control the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  It would be wrong to suggest that the EC under the Common Agricultural Policy has not attempted to reduce surpluses which is something that is commonly put forward, I believe at the GATT rounds of talks.  Since the early eighties the EC has implemented substantial reform of the CAP with the introduction, first, of milk quotas followed by price freezes and spending limits, or budgetary stabilisers as they are called, in many of the major areas.  The reform measures have had a significant impact on the dairy sector where world prices are now at a relatively high level and where dairy farmers in general both in the EC and the international context have benefited greatly. I am sure every public representative and creamery manager will be well aware of the problems that were created when the EC introduced the milk quotas.  Even with the small quota holders, I understand that the quota that will be distributed will amount to about 400 gallons per farmer which is ridiculous but I suppose it is good to get anything.  I would make the point that in their attempt to oblige the USA and GATT many problems have been caused particularly to the smaller farmers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be said that when the USA joined GATT in 1955 that country obtained a waiver which allowed it to impose quantitative restrictions on commodities where public support programmes were in existence in the US which might be rendered ineffective by imports.  In other words, the USA will do precisely what they wish when it suits. It should also be stated that when the Common Agricultural Policy was established in the sixties the EC was allowed to protect its market against low priced imports of a range of products such as cereals, beef and dairy products through a variable levy system, but as compensation to other GATT members the EC agreed to limit or bind its import <Col N="1455" /> duties at very low or zero levels for other products such as vegetable oils, proteins and cereal substitutes.  As our colleague, Senator Dardis mentioned on the last day, cereal prices are at an all-time low. It is interesting to note that between 14 and 18 million tonnes of cereal substitutes are imported into the EC, yet the surplus is more or less the equivalent of that.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland's accession to the EC in 1973, agricultural policy in this country has been dominated by the CAP.  Irish farmers have not generally been concerned about GATT or its implications and it is only now when the matter is staring us in the face that we are all becoming very interested.  As I said here last week when I spoke on the motion, I felt honestly that every person in this country would give total support to opposing the attempt by the USA to dismantle the CAP in this round of GATT talks because if the proposals of GATT are implemented, it will in the first instance eliminate the benefits that accrue annually to this country which are, I understand, in the region of £1.5 billion. That is very substantial and that £1.5 billion comes into the economy.  There is this false notion that it goes directly into the farmers' hands; it is absorbed in the economy.  Secondly, it would cause some 70,000 farm families to leave the land. This is a figure that has been mentioned by all farm organisations and I have no reason to doubt their knowledge on that particular subject.  Thirdly, it would put the security of the world food supply at risk.</P>
    <P>It frightens me to think that the Labour Party, who purport to represent the small man, could put down an amendment which is totally supportive of the USA's position and philosophy.  That great socialist party who preach left and live right are so blinded in their attempt to attack the agricultural sector that they are putting the livelihoods of 70,000 farm families, mainly small farmers, at risk. They should be asked who will pay the social welfare payments.  They are saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; in effect to the £1.5 billion, much of which, as I said earlier, is absorbed <Col N="1456" /> into the non-farming sector of the community. They are obviously not aware that in the US farm size is ten times greater than in Europe, 20 times greater than the Irish farm size.  Are they aware that the US will use price supports when it suits for their own farmers?  Therefore, I appeal to the Labour Party to withdraw their amendment and show solidarity.  I regard their amendment as treachery. Let the USA paddle their own canoe.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has served us well.  It has guaranteed food supplies, it has ensured a high quality of food product, it has kept the fabric of rural Ireland intact.  If the US and the Labour Party &mdash; strange bed-fellows, I might say &mdash; had their way, 70,000 more farm families would be competing for social welfare, housing and for services. We have got to fight our own corner and we can only win if rural and urban folk work together.</P>
    <P>I fully support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed by the remarks of Senator Byrne, last week and he seems to have continued on the same diatribe this week.  He has missed the point entirely.</P>
      <P>We are not in the business of creating an urban-rural divide.  The Common Agricultural Policy, as it stands, is in need of a major overhaul and revamping because it is creating the divide between big farmers and small farmers, and that is the gap that we are trying to bridge. There is no good in attacking us for something we are not saying.  It is the gap between the small and large farmers we are anxious to reduce and there is no doubt that it is the large farmers who have gained massively from the Common Agricultural Policy as it operates.  It is in line with our policy, and indeed with the policies of quite a number of other organisations including the ICMSA, that we look at the area of direct income supplement. Let us not attack something that is not being said.</P>
      <P>I have no problems with the Fine Gael amendment, as it stands.  It proposes to insert:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> The principal objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy in the interest of both producer and consumer in the Community.</P>
    <P>That is recognising essentially what we are saying, that we have to look at how things need to be reformed.  We are going a step further and specifying areas where we feel that the EC should direct itself. Our amendment reads:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Common Agricultural Policy has failed to address the issue of falling farm incomes and rural emigration;</P>
    <P>further notes that price support mechanisms have added considerably to the cost of the food to the consumer, which carries a high burden for lowincome groups;</P>
    <P>and therefore calls on the Government to oppose price support mechanisms which are a massive subsidy to large, wealthy farmers, and support cheap food policies in line with progressive direct income supports for family farmers in the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The origins of GATT are very much like the origins of the EC; they are both for the same purpose in a sense.  They came about after the War to try to reduce trade barriers, to create fair and open trade and to ensure that economic depressions would not occur, as they had been occuring before, that countries would not be subjected to famine, that there would be a sufficiency of food and that economies would operate on a more organised basis.  They were both well intentioned.  The principles of the CAP, the EC and the GATT are very similar. GATT operate in the area of agriculture, the services, textiles and so on. Ireland is an open economy and we are dependent very largely on our exports. We have to take into consideration the <Col N="1458" /> situation in other countries in the context of protectionism, which, in fact, in many ways is what the CAP is all about.  If we are not successful in these GATT negotiations trade barriers will be erected and we will be in a world depression.  It is ironic that both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, who have always supported the open market and privatisation, should suddenly look to protectionism and a type of mé féin attitude in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is not in keeping with the mould they are supposed to be breaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as they break moulds in the national interest instead of in a destructive fashion I will be happy. Two-thirds of EC spending goes on the Common Agricultural Policy so, quite properly, it has to be spent well.  We are talking about in excess of £20 billion being spent on that annually.  Obviously the farmer who has a larger unit of operation will have proportionately lower costs.  He will have greater technology and machinery and naturally enough will be able to produce in greater quantity. Where State grants have been given in the form of farm credits they have been given to larger farms.  Farms of over 50 acres have benefited, not farms that have less than 20 or 30 acres.  That is the way the CAP has operated.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy was set up to enable farmers to become self-sufficient and to provide a better deal for them but it is a lopsided operation in terms of price mechanisms.  In October 1989 a resolution was passed unanimously by the ICMSA delegates at their annual general meeting stating that the association took a stance on the desirability or other use of differential prices for farm products as a system of income supplementation.  There should be a two-tier price system which would be the only hope of survival for small farmers.  They are concerned about the small farmer and that is the concern I want to see expressed in relation to the reform of CAP.  It is a pleasure to see the Minister in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> The Common Agricultural Policy, despite the best intentions, has not operated to the advantage of the small farmer. Since the mid 1960s half the farmers and agricultural workers have disappeared. They are no longer there.  We have lost out 50 per cent of that workforce and only one-sixth of the workforce at present is a rural workforce working on farms. That is a very small proportion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  It has been halved since the Common Agricultural Policy was introduced.  Senator Byrne has launched into a diatribe against Labour already but if he addressed this issue it would be a lot more productive.</P>
      <P>Between 1971 and 1987 there has been a drop in agricultural employment from 75 per cent to 25 per cent.  That is an enormous drop and it corresponds with the period of time that Ireland has operated the Common Agricultural Policy. Only 35 per cent of all employment in rural areas now comes from agriculture and that has dropped since 1971.  It has been a disaster for small farms and small communities and had led to emigration and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CAP needs major reform because of the nature of the support mechanisms. They maintain prices at an artificial level and create surpluses.  The surplus goes into storage and some of it may be converted, for example, wine is converted into alcohol.  A lot of it is destroyed for example milk is poured away.  It is either conversion or destruction and this has been happening fairly regularly.  Some surplus beef and butter was distributed to old age pensioners and those on social welfare. That is desirable but if does not get away from the fact that we have been creating huge surpluses and mountains of commodities. We have the export refund scheme where subsidies are given to export surplus produce to the USSR and Third World countries.  That has a depressing effect on the world economy because it undercuts world prices.  Import <Col N="1460" /> levies are imposed on imports from non-EC countries.</P>
    <P>There is a strong form of protectionism in the way the Common Agricultural Policy works.  The emphasis is on quantity rather than quality.  Where there is intensive food production a lot of synthetic-nitrate fertilizers are used and there are problems in relation to storage and export subsidies.  The end result is that consumers pay more and there are fewer farm workers.  The number of farm workers in Ireland has declined by 3,000 per annum on average since we joined the EC.  The CAP has not been beneficial right across the board.  Anybody who tries to say otherwise is living in cloudcuckoo land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the reform of the CAP.  It has been damaging in many ways to the environment.  In the past two decades there has been a doubling of water pollution and general damage to wildlife in the EC as a result of the indiscriminate use of fertilisers and so on.  Large farmers are getting richer and small farmers are not benefiting significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five per cent of the large farmers get 75 per cent of the money.  That is a fact.  Where does the money go?  Administration costs in Brussels, plus Government administration costs, are in the region of five to 10 per cent of the money; export refunds account for 40 per cent; the cost of storage for intervention is 20 per cent and the cost of withdrawing foodstuffs and destroying them is six per cent.  So of the money that is forthcoming we are talking about 30 per cent going directly to farmers.  In a budget of almost £1 billion we are talking about less than one-third of it going into the hands of the farmer. This is a burden on low income families and the IFA have accepted that a figure <Col N="1461" /> of £16 to £18 per week for a family of four is the value of the Common Agricultural Policy to every Irish family of that size. That works out at an average of £800 to £900 per annum.</P>
      <P>We have to look at the CAP part of the problem is the high level of support prices paid to those who produce the largest amount of goods.  We must look at it in terms of the Single European Act which will demand certain improvements in the context of VAT, MCAs and border taxes.  All that will mean a tightening-up on the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy, the intervention system and the quota system.  The intervention system is obviously exploited.  The quota system is a good one in the context of the super-levies.  The only way we can really ensure that there is major benefit here is to put the emphasis on quality rather than on quantity.</P>
      <P>We must put the emphasis on quality and on a healthy product and at the same time, make provision for direct income supplements to small farmers so that the amount of money is not reduced but is divided up and distributed among those who require it.  The intention behind this amendment is to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy does not operate in a wasteful fashion.  The underlying principles are good but its operation leaves much to be desired.  Now is the time for us to address the situation in the interests of the entire farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and will share my time.  This is a very important subject.  I will not go over what my colleagues have already said.  We are at a crossroads as far as agriculture is concerned. I have great confidence in the team we have in Europe headed by our Commissioner, Ray MacSharry.  He will fight a hard battle on behalf of our farming community.  As has been seen down through the years, when agriculture is not doing well the country does not do well regardless of party changes.</P>
      <P>The United States are putting on a lot of pressure, but the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his team will stand up to that.  There are ten million farmers in the EC and in the United States there are two million.  The Americans tell us that they are not subsidising agriculture. That is not true but I will not go into details.  There are ten million people employed in agriculture in Europe and if anything happens there the dole queues will get longer by the day.  This is a very serious issue and it will affect many people.  At present the bulk of subsidies seems to go to the larger farmer.  More attention should be paid to ensuring that they are channelled to the medium and small farmer in the future.  The Minister is devoting much attention to that area and I wish him well in his negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy served us well over the past 20 years. Agriculture is our most important industry. We produce the best food in the world.  Food prices have decreased rather than increased.  Most of our medium and small farmers have a very low income and they cannot afford for the CAP to be tampered with in any way.  Many small farmers have an income of approximately £2,500.  What would happen to them if the Common Agricultural Policy were tampered with?  Our team in Europe will stand up to the pressure exerted by the United States Government and other <Col N="1463" /> interests and secure that we have not only a good Common Agricultural policy but an improvement on the present system. I now share my time with Senator Kiely.</P>

      <P>In fairness to Senator Doyle, I was concerned that everyone should have some time.  I knew there was a time limit on the debate.  The Senator said it would be all right.  We have 15 minutes and we are taking that time.  If the Senator had agreed to an equitable sharing of the time earlier we would have agreed to that but we cannot do anything about it now.</P>
      <P>GATT is a multilateral treaty subscribed to by 97 Governments which together account for nearly 90 per cent of world trade.  The basic aim of this agreement, which entered into force in 1948, is to liberalise world trade thereby contributing to economic growth.  GATT functions as the principal international body concerned with negotiating the reduction of trade barriers and other measures which distort competition, and with international trade relations.  It is both a code of rules and a forum in which countries can discuss and overcome their trade problems and negotiate to enlarge world trade opportunities.  It has many aims and principles including trade without discrimination and protection through tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the Common Agricultural Policy was implemented to ensure the development of agriculture. However, the US and a group of other countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and a number of South American countries referred to as the CAIRNS group have put forward to GATT an extreme proposal that all protection and support for agricultural production and prices should be eliminated over five to ten years.  Clearly, the purpose of these proposals is to dismantle the EC Common Agricultural Policy and to gain access to the European food <Col N="1465" /> market.  I do not know if that would suit. I understand Carla Hills is representing the US at the GATT talks.  The US will probably find the EC markets hard to handle because of cultural and language difficulties.  However, that is their problem.</P>
    <P>Farmers' incomes in the United States are supported directly by deficiency payments or in the case of cereals through price supports as in the case of maize, livestock products and sugar.  The United States also actively subsidise exports through the export enhancement programme. Canada supports its milk prices by quotas on production and imports.</P>
    <P>A detailed report has been published by the OECD which quantifies the total level of support per farmer in a number of developed countries.  The definition of support includes both actual budget transfers such as deficiency payments and theoretical transfers from consumers in the case of supported markets.  In the United States there are two million farmers and they get $21 million in support whereas EC farmers are only supported to the tune of $10 million.  There are only two million farmers in the United States and there are 18 million farmers in the EC which is something Senator Costello should recognise.  It is clear that the support per farmer in the EC is less than half of that in the United States and significantly lower than in Canada and in non-EC countries.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Labour Party acknowledge that if the GATT negotiations succeed it will mean less revenue for Ireland and for the Community.  It would mean £900 less per person per year.  Where would that money come from?</P>

      <P>If you have not got it you cannot distribute it.  You must have wealth.  If the Fine Gael amendment was a proper amendment they should have included the CAIRNS group.  They are against our stand on the CAP also.  I commend the Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, who has outlined our main objectives. He stated that the main economic justifications for the whole exercise was to achieve a better balance between supply and demand on agricultural markets, to restore a more realistic relationship between production and the marketplace and to remedy distortions in agricultural trade.  He said that the specific nature of agricultural production and the very different structures have to be taken into account with wide differences between Europe and the United States or Australia.  For example, in the Community we have 11 million farmers whereas in the United States there are only two million, that the average size of our farms is 13 hectares while in the United States it is 187 hectares.  I warn the Commissioner to be careful in his negotiations and ensure that he gets the best deal for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, it would have been a shame to have missed that last contribution.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words.  This debate is critical and I commend the Progressive Democrats for putting forward the motion.  There are various versions of amendments none of which change very radically the main thrust of what we would like to debate substantially here this evening but regrettably will not be able to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a slightly schizophrenic attitude to all of this.  I find it very hard to know <Col N="1467" /> what side of the argument is in Ireland's best interest in the long term.  If we were to jump 20 years down the road, having gradually implemented, with various protections and support systems in between for those who would be most vulnerable particularly the small family farm, true liberalisation of agricultural production and went for a true market-orientated situation and if sufficient numbers of our farmers came through unscathed, I think we could be net winners.  The real problem is that to contemplate anything that has been proposed at the moment by the US and the CAIRNS group and others would mean virtually putting 90 per cent of our farmers out of business as structured today and we cannot tolerate that. You have the long-term ideal option if we could get from A to 20 years ahead versus the transition period and how it might be handled.  Under any proposals that are on the table at the moment one cannot contemplate agreement.</P>
    <P>Having said that, what is worse for Ireland &mdash; no agreement on this GATT round or an agreement that we do not like?  It could be Hobson's choice if one considers the outcome.  Our negotiators have an extremely difficult job to do.  I do not have the monopoly of wisdom or much experience in this area even though I have had ongoing interest in it for many years.  I tabled a parliamentary question over a year ago to the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, and, in a nutshell, his two-page reply could be concentrated into one line in which he said: &ldquo;I am prepared to participate in negotiations leading on a mutually advantageous basis to greater freedom of trade.&rdquo; It says everything and it says nothing.</P>
    <P>The truth is that none of us can say at this stage where we are going.  We cannot say where the balance of advantage lies, in having no agreement to this round and virtually having a trade war with the countries with whom we trade favourably at the moment, or having an agreement that is going to cause major problems.  I hope the Minister will be able to develop that aspect for us because we really do need to know the current thinking in the <Col N="1468" /> Department of Agriculture and Food, in Brussels and of our Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, on where Ireland's interests lie in this area.  Ireland, Denmark and The Netherlands have most to lose if this is not handled properly.</P>
    <P>The backdrop of all this discussion on the outcome of the Uruguay GATT round must be the fact that agriculture represents 10 per cent of GNP in this country.  But as a Community average it only represents 3.5 per cent to the other 11 nations.  We have far more to lose than the bigger nations in this.  We joined Europe in 1973 because we are an agricultural country, a net exporting country and because of the advantages to agriculture of CAP and the whole FEOGA support system.  Fine Gael canvassed for the Single Market a few short years ago on the basis of the advantages that were still to be gained in that area and the balance of advantage lay in being a full and equal member, not in being a sort of second-tier member of Europe in this.</P>
    <P>As we look forward to a barrier-free Europe, there is a great cloud hanging over the 1992 programme in relation to the outcome of this final round of the Uruguay GATT negotiations.  Will free trade in agricultural commodities win out over the more subtle European line of seeking to establish a level playing field as the basis for any free trade?  I do not know.  Will the US, Canada and CAIRNS group view win out over the European view?  None of us knows at this stage where we are heading.</P>
    <P>The consumer now demands a clean food chain.  Any agricultural system deserving our support must be sustainable over time in terms of the environmental impact.  We must ask ourselves if the only options to be found are those that are now on the table in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy or on the policy being pursued by the US, the CAIRNS group and others.  Have we not looked at other world agricultural systems such as the EFTA system at the moment, low intensity, model family farms which answer most of the Common Agricultural Policy's new requirements regarding extensification, and indeed <Col N="1469" /> answer most of the environmental requirements on sustainable agriculture and farming sensitively generally?</P>
    <P>There are other issues there.  Why must we be pressured into a yes or no situation in accepting the pressures externally on the CAP at the moment from the US and the others?  Let us look to internal pressure; let us reform, let us modify, let us improve the CAP.  Let us even go slowly down the road towards liberalisation, providing we protect the most vulnerable in our agricultural sector and do it at our pace and not be bullied by outside major nations into doing what they want, mainly for their advantage. Let us be honest.</P>
    <P>I see that the balance between the GATT demands and the present CAP policy perhaps tilting towards the best of the EFTA system.  We cannot take it all on board.  It might be a little simplistic for the developmental farmers and the commercial farmers but there is an awful lot to look at there.  There will be a winner and a loser in terms of the production end of the chain as long as the only options on the table at the moment in the current GATT round are the US view and the EC view.  Is it possible that in neither of these world agricultures is to be found the ideal answer for us here in Europe? That is an option we have got to look at.</P>
    <P>Consumers will benefit either way by free trade but, hopefully, from adopting a sustainable system rather than opting only for short-term gain.  There is a lot to be thought of, there is a lot to be balanced. There is a longer term view, there is a medium term view and there is the pressure that is on us between now and December to finalise what is on the table in this current GATT round.</P>
    <P>Let us not be bullied.  It is up to all of us to concentrate our minds and our attention on this most crucial of matters, the outcome of which for us as a small member of the European Community hangs in the balance.  We know why we joined Europe, we know why we are party to the Single Market.  We are, as a nation, committed Europeans but that does not prevent us from keeping what is best of our present policy and protecting <Col N="1470" /> our own, particularly the small farmers and our consumers, and also from learning what is best from other world agricultures. Let us be sure that all the options that need to be on the table are on it at the moment.  I would like to give my remaining time to my colleague, Senator Jackman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>All I could see over the last number of years were glazed eyes when GATT was mentioned.  I hoped the two farming organisations would come together and create some marketing ploy whereby GATT would be far more understandable to the ordinary man and woman in the street instead of just talking about GATT which does not mean much to them.  It is a bit late for that now but I am worried that with just a couple of months now to November-December when the four years talks will be completed with major implications for us that it is only now we are worrying about it. It is a typical Irish trait, that we tend to panic at the last moment.  I strongly suggest that in future far more be done to get rid of words like GATT, with connotations associated with industrial policy and not with agriculture, so that people would be very much aware of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any set of arrangements that affect agricultural production and prices has enormous importance, not only to the farming community &mdash; it is not just the Labour Party who are concerned with other areas of the Community &mdash; but also <Col N="1471" /> the processing industry and eventually to the housewife and her food budget which Fine Gael have taken into account in their amendment in regard to the protection of the consumer.  We must see the talks not only in the framework of agricultural prices but also from the point of view of rural development or redevelopment.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the EC agriculture support systems and similar US policy will dictate the future of a substantial section of rural and farming people.  On the other hand, we heard the other day where the Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, designated £300 million for the whole Community for rural development. That is just a mere drop in the ocean.  It sounds a lot, but not when you divide it among 12 countries.  At the end of the day, the GATT talks and the European attitude towards them will have a far greater influence for good or otherwise on rural development than Commissioner MacSharry's token gesture. We must keep in mind all the time the aspirations of Delors when not so very long ago he stated here his concept of a Europe where he wished &mdash; all of us wish and aspire to the same thing &mdash; to retain the fabric of rural Ireland.  I am afraid it is becoming more an aspiration than something we will be able to achieve eventually.</P>
    <P>When we look at the reasons we joined the EC in 1973 we wanted to become part of a club structure and we wanted obviously to have a balance in relation to the US and the CAIRNS group at a later stage.  Really, it was first as a safety net system for farmers and secondly to ensure food security in times of scarcity and crisis.  We never know when there will be a time of scarcity and crisis.  Hopefully, it will not be around the corner, but if it happens it will be outside our control. It can be climatic change, it can be to do with environmental problems, it can be to do with global warming.  We do not know and shall not have control over those areas.</P>
    <P>Seventeen years after joining the EC what was envisaged in the Treaty of <Col N="1472" /> Rome will be thrown to the winds, the whole reason why we joined the EC. Who will be our allies when we are fighting? We will have the Scottish farmers, we will have the farmers in the peripheral areas of certain regions of the EC, but we will be up against a huge population structure, which is far greater than the declining numbers in rural economies and rural communities.  We will have to fight that major pressure, that industrial pressure. If the talks are not completed at the end of the year, who shall take over in GATT?  Will the agricultural policy be put aside and will what other people might consider more important issues take over?  Will we get another six months to negotiate?  It worries me.  Between now and November-December is a very short time, particularly when we take the summer period into account.  That worries me exceedingly.</P>
    <P>As regards the various statistics that have been used we have got to put to rest once and for all, the whole notion that nobody is supported in agriculture except ourselves.  Other Senators have quoted figures to show our total support for farmers is less than 50 per cent when you look at the matter globally.  That that has got to be pushed across to the consumers in this country.  There will be a certain disregard by people in this country who will not have any great sympathy for farmers, who will tend to think all farmers have large holdings, who will not accept that 75 per cent of farming income is really below £5,000 and who think there is such a thing as rural poverty.  This country will be particularly at risk at a time of very hard bargaining for us in the EC if we want to retain what we have gained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to strongly support the motion because the basics are very simple to understand here.  This is an agricultural country.  We are not developed industrially in relation to other European countries and on the world scene.  We have two clubs operating at the moment. Certainly membership of the EC has been very beneficial.  In fact, it has been <Col N="1473" /> the lifeline for many of our small farmers. I shudder to think, if we were not benefiting from the EC at the moment, where the thousands of small farmers in the west of Ireland would go.</P>
      <P>I wonder what Senator Costello's solution would be to solve the problem of the family farm in the west of Ireland or could they all be housed and employed in Dublin?  It would be contrary to every principle of development everywhere. The GATT actually have quite a number of strong members who negotiate from a position of strength on behalf of their farmers.  Every one of them would have their own area of concern.  At the end of the day this country stands to lose if very tight negotiations are not in place.</P>
      <P>The Seanad has had an opportunity to recognise the vital importance of the negotiations which are taking place.  This House sends to Commissioner MacSharry its strongest support and concern for the outcome of the negotiations between GATT and the EC at the moment.  This is of paramount importance to us.  Anybody who is in touch with his own country would see it that way.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the motion is actually what one would expect from some Conservative representative in the heart of London.  It is certainly not what one would expect from somebody who is part of a small country with a population of 3.5 million people, which is largely dependent on agriculture which has yet to find its feet and is still developing.  I believe our future depends on how successful we are in maintaining people to survive and to work out an economy for themselves in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to recently, when we had a serious fall in cattle and sheep prices, we actually enjoyed the mechanism in use in the EC. It has sustained small farmers in rural Ireland.  I hope that difficulty and that position is recognised by everyone who is negotiating at every level.  The people recognise that this matter is of major importance to this country.  I am surprised that any section, for whatever political reason, finds it difficult to go along with this motion.  It is vital and timely.  I <Col N="1474" /> am glad to say a few words in support of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious to me from the contributions of Senators to the debate last week and again this evening that Senators have done their homework and have a clear understanding of the operation of the GATT.  I do not propose, therefore, to make further comments on this aspect in this debate.  It was also evident that Senators, with some exceptions, fully appreciate the importance of the GATT negotiations and the negative effects that acceptance of the US proposals relating to agriculture would have for Ireland and the Community.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, virtually all Governments intervene in a variety of ways in the management of their agricultural sectors and in agricultural trade. Such intervention varies from country to country and is generally attributable to a preferential attitude to agriculture and to a recognition of the special features and characteristics of the sector and rural areas.  The justification for supporting agriculture is based on grounds of food security, the maintenance of rural populations and the strategic importance and special nature of agricultural production.</P>
      <P>In the Community, support for agriculture is, of course, governed by the provisions of the Common Agricultural Policy, the principles of which are enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.  Various interlinked and complementary support arrangements for all the major commodities, apart from potatoes, were developed throughout the sixties and seventies. These arrangements aim to increase agricultural productivity, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to stabilise markets, to assure the availability of supplies and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements developed were very successful in achieving most of these objectives and, in particular, contributed to the growth of production in the Community. Indeed, whereas it had been a <Col N="1475" /> net importer, by the eighties the Community became more than self-sufficient in all the major commodities that can be produced in Europe.  As production levels exceeded available outlets, it became necessary throughout the eighties for the Community to adapt support arrangements to the new situation.</P>
    <P>Thus, over the last five to six years, institutional prices have been frozen and in some cases reduced in nominal terms, less permanent and more restrictive intervention arrangements have been introduced and other support measures have been modified.  The latter include measures that we have all become familiar with such as quotas, co-responsibility levies and maximum guaranteed quantities, all designed to limit production. The overall objective has been to make agriculture more responsive to market forces and to progressively adapt supply to demand.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these restrictions, the CAP continues to underpin the prosperity of Community and Irish farming. This support framework continues to be necessary primarily because Community agriculture is structurally weak and extremely diverse by comparison with out major competitors.  In this regard, it is relevant to point out that there are some ten million people in the sector in the Community and the average farm size is about nine hectares.  In the US, there are about two million farmers and the average farm size is 184 hectares.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, of course, continues to play a major role in Irish economic activity despite the growing contributions of other sectors.  In particular, the sector accounts for about 9 per cent of GNP and 25 per cent of our total export values. Employment in the agriculture, food and drinks sector amounts to 19 per cent of total employment.  The expansion of the food sector, in particular, is central to the Government's policy for national recovery.</P>
    <P>Ireland has received vast amounts of support under both the Community's guarantee and guidance funds for market support and for structural development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> Receipts under the guarantee heading since our entry into the Community amounted to £7,900 million and £600 million has been received under the guidance provision.  More than 20 per cent of our agricultural exports go to destinations outside the Community with the support of export refunds.</P>
    <P>The present round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round, was launched in Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986 and is the eighth such round.  At that time, the contracting parties agreed that agriculture would be addressed in a comprehensive and fundamental way for the first time in a multilateral trade negotiation. Agriculture is only one of the areas covered in the current round as negotiations also deal with issues such as tariffs, tropical products, natural resource-based products, textiles and clothing, subsidies, safeguards, intellectual property rights and services.  However, it is generally agreed that success in the agriculture negotiations is very important to the success of the whole round.</P>
    <P>At Punta del Este, contracting parties agreed that the agriculture negotiations should aim to achieve greater liberalisation of trade and bring all measures affecting import access and export competition under strangthened and more operationally effective GATT rules and disciplines.  This was to be achieved by: improving market access through, <i>inter alia,</i> reduction of import barriers; increasing discipline on the use of all direct and indirect subsidies including the phased reduction of their negative effects; minimising the adverse effects that animal and plant health can have on trade.</P>
    <P>Throughout 1987 and 1988 the negotiations concentrated on elaborating the elements of the negotiating proposals. The general direction and procedures to be followed in the final phases of the negotiations were agreed by the GATT Trade Negotiating Committee meeting in Geneva in April 1989.  The committee accepted that agricultural policies should be made more responsive to international <Col N="1477" /> market signals and that support and protection should be progressively reduced and provided in a less trade distorting manner.  The Trade Negotiating Committee agreed on the principles of short and long-term actions to achieve the objectives laid down at Punta del Este. Particularly important from the EC's point of view, was the acceptance by the committee that credit would be given for measures implemented since the Punta del Este declaration which contributed positively to the reform programme.</P>
    <P>In the short term, contracting parties undertook to ensure that for the period up to the end of 1990, current domestic and export support and protection levels would not be exceeded.  Participants also stated their intention to reduce support and protection in 1990 either by using an aggregate measurement of support (AMS) or by taking specific policy measures.</P>
    <P>As regards the long term, contracting parties undertook to negotiate substantial progressive reductions in support and protection either through commitments on specific policies, aggregate support or a combination of both.  The contracting parties also agreed to establish strengthened and more operationally effective GATT rules and disciplines encompassing import access, subsidies, export competition and export prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
    <P>In view of the varying circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the approaches of participants to the agriculture aspects are also different.  The extremes are represented on the one hand by the approaches of the US and CAIRNS group and on the other by those of the Community, Japan, the Nordic countries, etc.</P>
    <P>The US was the first country to submit proposals on long-term reform.  Its proposals effectively involve the phasing out of support and the full liberalisation of trade for agriculture.  On import access, the US suggested that all border measures, including variable levies, should be converted into bound tariffs to be subsequently eliminated or reduced to <Col N="1478" /> low levels over ten years.  Export subsidies would be phased out over five years.  On internal support, measures directly tied to production or price levels would be phased out over ten years.  In their definition, these measures would include price policies resulting from dual pricing arrangements, income support policies such as headage payments, marketing subsidies, etc.  Other supports, unless minimally trade distorting, would be reduced and better disciplined.  As regards sanitary and phytosanitary aspects, the US view is harmonisation should be pursued on the basis of sound scientific evidence while notification, consultation and dispute settlement systems would also be established under GATT.</P>
    <P>The CAIRNS group, which includes, <i>inter alia,</i> Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Argentina, tabled proposals along similar lines to those of the US. This group agrees with the US on the concept of tariffication and the phasing out of export subsidies although no time limit is specified for the latter.  On production and price supports, substantial reductions rather than elimination is highlighted although the ultimate objective of categorising support measures into prohibited, permitted but subject to discipline, and permitted is similar to that of the US.</P>
    <P>The Community has made it clear that the US and CAIRNS group approaches are not acceptable to it as an outcome to the negotiations.  At the same time, the Community indicated that it was willing to participate in negotiations to progressively reduce overall support to the extent necessary to re-establish balanced markets and a more market-orientated agricultural trading system.  It proposed to seek out better ways to manage international markets and to redefine GATT rules and procedures.  The Community is also seeking a rebalancing of support and protection for a number of sectors, including cereals substitutes and oilseeds, in order to remove distortions in trade between products such as cereals which enjoy high levels of protection and support and certain competing products <Col N="1479" /> where insufficient protection exists. Credit is also being sought for reform measures undertaken since 1986.</P>
    <P>The Community is also prepared to accept some elements of tariffication on the assumption that US deficiency payments would also be included in the system and provided the problems of rebalancing protection can also be addressed in that context.  Some controls on the Community's capacity to pay export subsidies are also envisaged on the same conditions.  The Community is also advocating the adoption of various mechanisms to deal with monetary and world price fluctuations.</P>
    <P>Japan's proposals emphasised the need for Governments to retain the capacity to support agriculture and issues such as food security and the exclusion of basic foodstuffs from the realm of the negotiations. Japan also supports the elimination of export subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Nordic countries favour an aggregate measurement of support approach in reducing support to agriculture; they also suggest incentives to move towards decoupled forms of support and addressing such issues as food security and environmental objectives.  As regards export subsidies, the Nordic countries indicate a willingness to work towards the elimination of most of their export subsidies.  Tariffication is seen as a possible means to reduced protection but only if allied to appropriate safeguards; variable levies should also remain a possibility.</P>
    <P>A process of clarification and elaboration of the comprehensive longterm proposals submitted by the major participants was commenced in February last. This phase has now been completed and real negotiations have commenced as the deadline of 23 July, for the development of a framework for the remainder of the negotiations, approaches.  The deadline for completion of the negotiations is December next.</P>
    <P>The Community's approach is designed to ensure that the fundamental mechanisms of the CAP can continue to be applied and that individual elements <Col N="1480" /> are not singled out.  In this regard, it is relevant to note that the Commission represents the Community in the GATT negotiations and that it operates within the framework of mandates agreed by Community Ministers.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Michael O'Kennedy, in his capacity as President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, has ensured that Agriculture Ministers are fully involved in developing the agriculture framework.</P>
    <P>In particular, the issue was discussed at both the April and June Councils.  In these discussions, Ministers reaffirmed support for the global approach to the negotiations being pursued by the Commission and, in particular, the Commission's defence of the basic principles of the CAP, including such essential elements as the two-tier price system, Community preference and the role of market policy.  We believe that it is essential that the Agriculture Council should continue to play a full role in the Community's input to the negotiations and in promoting the Community's agriculture interests.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined earlier, we believe that the retention of the CAP is essential to ensure the well-being of Irish and Community agriculture.  Others are seeking the progressive elimination of support and protection for agriculture over a ten year period.  The Community has made it clear that while it is reasonably open in its stance, there are limits beyond which it will not go.  Acceptance of fully liberalised trading arrangements for agriculture would not solve international problems but instead would lead to trade on a totally free and chaotic basis.</P>
    <P>In this regard also it is important to note that current international prices do not represent costs of production but are merely the prices obtaining for residual production.  These products would not be available at current world prices in a free trade scenario but instead prices would fluctuate widely in line with supply and demand.  For example, the world price for milk used by OECD in its producer subsidy equivalent calculations for the <Col N="1481" /> community fell by more than 50 per cent between 1983 and 1986 and doubled between that year and 1989.  Thus, the CAP also assists the consumer in assuring availability of supplies at reasonable and stable price levels.  As regards the latter, estimates suggest that Community food prices would fall by only modest amounts from present levels if support and protection were eliminated.</P>
    <P>At the same time, acceptance of world prices even somewhat higher than obtaining at present would force many farmers in the Community to leave agriculture. We could quite quickly become dependent on third countries for some of our basic foodstuffs.  It is difficult if not impossible for efficient family farms, given our cost structures, to compete on equal terms with producers elsewhere, some of whom have farms extending to thousands of acres.  Removing supports to Community agriculture is not levelling the playing field, it is tilting it in the direction of our competitors.</P>
    <P>While the CAP continues to account for almost 60 per cent of the total Community budget, CAP expenditure has stabilised in recent years and accounts for only about a half of 1 per cent of the Community's GNP &mdash; a relatively small price for the benefits that accrue to both producers and consumers.  I have already referred to Irish receipts from the guarantee fund.  Recent calculations by Alan Matthews of Trinity College show that the net value of these budgetary transfers, together with our access to the relatively high priced Community markets for our agricultural products, represented some 9.7 per cent and 7.6 per cent of Irish GNP in 1979 and 1986 respectively. Any expectation that consumers would benefit significantly from trade liberalisation or suggestions that comparable benefits can be secured through alternative arrangements such as direct income supports are totally unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Other studies that have been undertaken also show that the Irish economy would lose substantially more than other member states under support reduction scenarios.  The losses would be felt most acutely by farmers but the services and <Col N="1482" /> food sectors would also be badly affected. The food sector alone currently employs 25 per cent of those engaged in manufacturing and free trade would place many of these jobs in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Much work remains to be undertaken during the remainder of the year if the round is to be completed on schedule.  For our part, and as the Community is the world's largest importer and the second largest exporter of agricultural products, we clearly want a successful outcome to the negotiations.  However, the outcome must be one which is mutually advantageous to all parties.</P>
    <P>Our principal objective in the negotiations is to ensure that the outcome will permit the Community to continue to support farming and rural areas generally so that production, farmers' incomes and exports are maintained at reasonable levels.  In this regard I believe that the Community's proposals are comprehensive, realistic and consistent both with the aims of the negotiations and our desire to support agriculture.</P>
    <P>The informal agriculture Council meeting in Dromoland last week expressed its strong belief that the special needs of rural areas must be given a high priority by the Community.  This was explained as meaning among other things the maintenance of a viable market support policy.  Every opportunity has been used at political and official level to defend the CAP and the Community approach to the negotiations.  I attended a ministerial meeting in Innsbruck last month where considerable support was evident for the Community's broad approach to the negotiations from both Community and EFTA countries.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food will continue to ensure that the Community's Agriculture Ministers remain involved in the formulation of policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery outlined the problems which might arise if there is no agreement. However, I note that President Bush has said that the United States will walk away from the negotiations if they are not satisfied with the outcome. Despite the dangers in this course of <Col N="1483" /> action the Community has also indicated that it, to, has principles to defend and that these are not negotiable.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the benefits which accrue to Irish producers, consumers and the economy generally under the present support arrangements for agriculture.  I have also attempted to spell out what the Community's position is in the GATT negotiations.  While it is primarily a matter for this House to determine which approach it should adopt, I believe that the case I have made demonstrates clearly that it is in Ireland's overall interest to ensure that the CAP support arrangements should be maintained to the greatest extent possible.  In my view, the motion in the names of Senators Dardis, Keogh and Cullen, as amended by Senators Raftery and Hourigan, best reflects what we are attempting to do.  I would, therefore, strongly recommend that approach to Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, first, thank the Minister for attending here over the two weeks of this debate and for his contribution. I must say I am greatly encouraged by the content of his speech and it brings home to me that the Government are very well aware of the implications of this particularly grave matter for the country and for Irish farming.  I hope the talks that will take place between now and the end of the year will lead to a successful conclusion and one that will be of benefit to the country.  It certainly is a measure of the importance of this debate, and the importance which the House attaches to it, that so many people wanted to speak.  I was very encouraged by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main things we can do here is to make people aware of the GATT and what it is about.  I share Senator Jackman's view that there is definitely a lack of awareness about it in the country. It is undoubtedly one of the most serious matters that has confronted this country, this economy and the farmers in Ireland since we joined the Common Market.  I <Col N="1484" /> repeat what I said last week: it is possibly one of the most serious matters to confront us since the economic war.  That is what it is about.</P>
    <P>It is most unfortunate that because sections of the media in this country do not understand the GATT and do not understand its implications they are not prepared to report it and let the people know what is involved.  If we achieved that and nothing else we would have done a good days work in this House.  Of course, we do not always get the reportage we deserve.  Sometimes we get reportage we do not deserve, but on this occasion possibly we do not get the reportage we deserve.</P>
    <P>The objective of putting down this motion is to strengthen the Government's hand in whatever way we can in bringing the message to the Commission, to Brussels, that the Parliament of this country takes such a serious view of this matter that it has debated it and has come to a conclusion on it.  If that can in any way help the negotiating position of our Minister for Agriculture and Food or our Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Commission &mdash; and I re-emphasise again that it is the Commission's responsibility to negotiate the Treaty &mdash; or strengthen their hand then I think there is a serious responsibility on us to do that.</P>
    <P>I share many of the remarks made by Senator Doyle, but I do not have the reservations which she had about the balance of advantage in relation to taking long term and short term views and so on.  There is no question about where the balance of advantage lies.  The balance of advantage is in protecting this country's interests, not just the interest of the farmers of the country but in protecting the country's interests.  That is a short term objective and is one which must be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a different way of supporting agriculture and that there is more than one way of supporting agriculture. In relation to what was said about EFTA, which is the European Free Trade Association, certainly the way they look after their agriculture is something we could look at and possibly go down <Col N="1485" /> that line.  I think it needs to be said that they are in general wealthy countries and that they have a very small proportion of their population in farming relative to the Community as a whole.  That creates a different set of problems and a different set of circumatances entirely.</P>
    <P>To come to the central point, this is the most important event, in my view, since we joined the Common Market and possibly for a much longer period.  The next five months are going to be absolutely critical.  We must let the Commission know what the view is in this country about it.  It is our solemn responsibility to defend the family farm. We can argue about how we can do that best.  Certainly, if the US proposals go through on the nod, in the short term the family farm will be decimated and there will be catastrophic consequences.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment dispute the figures which have been given to us by Senator Costello about the numbers of people who have left agricultural employment, the numbers of people who have left the land in the past 20 years or so but if we did not have the Common Agricultural Policy the numbers would be far more and the numbers employed in processing our agricultural goods and in marketing our agricultural goods would be far fewer and the country would be much poorer as a result.  We are not a wealthy country, but we would certainly be a far poorer country without the Common Agricultural Policy and without having joined the Common Market, as it was then, and the European Community, as it is now.  It is in the agreed <i>Programme for Government</i>&mdash; I am glad it is in it &mdash; that the objective is to promote the viability of the maximum number of Irish farms and anything we can do in this place to achieve that objective is something we must do; we do not have a choice about it.</P>
    <P>I reject Senator Costello's suggestion that the farmers in some way do not get what the Community is offering.  Certainly, the processors &mdash; there is no question about it &mdash; get a significant amount of the money which might properly be put into the farmers' hands.  However, it <Col N="1486" /> comes back to the same point again: there has been colossal national benefit to this country from the Common Agricultural Policy and from being a member of the Community.  As I say, we can argue all we like about reform of the Common Agricultural Policy but, if we did not have it, we would be in a very sorry state indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a question of, as it always seems to boil down to, the big or the small farmer.  It is not a question of either/or; it is a question of all farmers, and all farmers will benefit.  They will certainly benefit in different degrees, there is no question about that, but that is life.  All farmers benefit, both big and small.  There is certainly a need for separate measures to support the smaller and more vulnerable farmers in our society, but that does not take from the central view that the policy must be defended against what the United States are saying. Allowing as many people as possible to make a decent living from the land through efficient farming is the best guarantee we have of being able to keep viable rural communities in place and of keeping people off the dole queues, the planes and the emigrant boats.  That is what we must be about.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I have no difficulty whatsoever in saying an unequivocal &ldquo;no&rdquo; to what the USA are proposing. Certainly, in the long term we must look at alternative ways of supporting our agriculture, at liberalising our trade to the degree that is possible, but not at the expense of taking people off the land onto the dole queues which are already oversaturated.  How then do we explain to people that they have no future and no hope?  I do not know how we can do that as politicians.  I was glad to hear the Minister say in his speech that the Community have made it clear that the US and the CAIRNS group approach is not acceptable to the Community as an outcome to the negotiations.  I congratulate him on saying that.</P>
    <P>We can look at matters like supply management and so on, we could get into the technical detail of how the CAP operates and how farmers should be supported. <Col N="1487" /> Supply management has a role to play, it has worked very well in milk in terms of controlling the surplus, but there are problems in relation to the small farmers.  However, the answer is not to reduce prices.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, we have some difficulty about figures: within the past 20 minutes we have succeeded in losing one million farmers from the Community.  The Minister has a figure of ten million and I have nine million.  I realise they are leaving the land but I did not realise they were leaving it at quite that rate.  I will not go through the figures; we have gone through the figures in detail of the relative sizes of the US farm as against the Community average farm in terms of the level of support in America <i>versus</i> the Community. Of course, it is true that the individual farmer gets a far greater level of support in America because there are fewer of them.</P>
    <P>However, coming back to the central point &mdash; £1.5 billion a year is coming into the country of which £1 billion is coming from the guarantee fund.  I do not know where we would be without that £1 billion. We have a big enough national debt without contemplating what it would be like without that income every year.  In terms of income support, I am saying that is not the way to go.  It is certainly an option in relation to keeping some small people on the land and keeping the basic rural society in place, but it must be a combination of both.  Nobody seems to have mentioned that.  Again, it seems to be a matter of either/or: it is either income support or price support.  It is not; it can be a combination of both.  The community is already going in the direction of income support to a degree.  It is in the document that was produced on rural development in 1987.  Headage payments are one way of putting money directly into the pockets of farmers and not giving it to the middlemen where it will be soaked up.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the Common Agricultural Policy has defects.  It has produced surpluses but why was it instituted in the first <Col N="1488" /> place?  We had a Europe that was hungry. We had a Europe which was not self-sufficient. As I said last week, the balance between self-sufficiency, between surplus and deficit, is a very delicate one but I believe that, apart from the deficiencies which may be there in the Common Agricultural Policy, it has been spectacularly successful in making us comfortable and well fed.  There are people living on the mainland of Europe who have great reason to be grateful for what agriculture has achieved within the Community in the past 25 or 30 years.  We did not go through the trauma they went through in the Second World War.  Certainly, there were scarcities and restrictions, but we did not know what is was like to starve. That is what was faced by people on the mainland of Europe and that must never happen again.  If there is a price to be paid for that, so be it.</P>
    <P>The matter of the dependence of the economy on the whole farming scene has been gone through in detail, so I do not need to emphasise that.  However, one of the things I believe needs to be said is that there seems to be a question that if farming is doing well the other sectors of the Irish community are not doing well. Of course, that is not the case.  If farming does well, the country does well.  If industry does well, the country does well.  I have just returned from Hungary and I was fascinated with the recognition at every level there of the importance of food production to that country and what it could achieve.  I was fortunate enough to visit New Zealand and it was exactly the same thing.  We are a country with a population of 3.5 million people and we cannot get it into our heads that if agriculture prospers the country prospers and if industry prospers the country prospers. There is a market out there of 350 million people and if we could only increase our share of that market by 1 per cent it would have enormous national consequences. Why does it have to be either/or?  I do not understand that at all.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to something Senator Raftery said last week: that we do not have a world price.  I accept that fully.  We do not have a world price.  The <Col N="1489" /> price on the world market is governed by stuff that is dumped by the US and other countries onto that market so we do not really have a true world market.  It is a lie to suggest that there is a true world market in agricultural produce.  There is not.  I also share his view that free trade does not equate to fair trade.</P>
    <P>If these proposals from GATT went through, it would be like the potato trade. I said it last week and I repeat it: it would be up one year, down the next year, people going into production, people getting out of production.  That would not be in the interests of the consumer, just as it would not be in the interests of the farmer.  The consumer, in my submission, has a vested interest, too in seeing that the Common Agricultural Policy stays and is kept in place.</P>
    <P>The question of cereal substitutes has been dealt with.  That is a very serious matter for tillage farmers, in particular in this country, and I believe it needs to be brought into that whole aspect of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe there is widespread agreement on all sides of the House in relation to this matter and I would be quite happy to accept the amendment as proposed by Fine Gael.  I am a little disappointed that the matter of the family farm is not included but I accept the general thrust of what everybody is saying and in that spirit I would be happy to accept the proposal.</P>
    <P>I do not like the Labour amendment and I would not be prepared to accept it because I do not accept that price support mechanisms are a massive subsidy to large wealthy farmers.  They are certainly helpful to large farmers; they have not made them wealthy and there are very few large farmers or small farmers in this country who are very wealthy by international standards.  I do not accept the Labour motion.</P>
    <P>Could I once again thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate and thank the Minister for his attendance over the two weeks.  I hope he will convey the view of this House to the Government in no uncertain terms: that we do not accept what the US are <Col N="1490" /> proposing under the GATT round of talks; we hope it can be concluded successfully before the end of the year and, hopefully, we will not get into a trade war.</P>

    <Title>Private Business. - Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the amount of borrowing which the Industrial Credit Corporation plc. may undertake and in the State guarantee of such borrowing. Under existing legislation there is a limit on ICC's borrowing and on the State guarantee of £800 million and the Bill provides that this figure be increased to £1,000 million.  The Bill also provides that the company amend its Articles of Association to take account of the increase in its borrowing powers.</P>
      <P>The ICC's current borrowing limit of £800 million has almost been reached. The previous limit, prior to the passing of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1983, was £400 million.  ICC borrowing includes deposits with the company from the public as well as what might be termed ordinary borrowing &mdash; mainly on the interbank market.  All such borrowing is covered by State guarantee, except for a minor amount of advances from the Exchequer itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the present limit was introduced in 1983 the business of the company has expanded considerably.  Its assets have grown from £476 million to £841 million, an increase of 77 per cent.  The company has experienced a very successful period of growth, despite some difficult years. The past few years in particular have, in line with the upturn in the economy, been very successful, culminating in its most profitable year ever in 1989.  In that year <Col N="1491" /> profits after tax reached over £10 million, including an exceptional item of £5.5 million.  The company has continued to perform impressively in the current year. Its recently announced interim results for the half year to 30 April 1990 show that profits after taxation were £3.1 million compared with £1.9 million for the corresponding period in 1989.  The company is to be congratulated on its performance. It is developing its core businesses and has expanded into new areas such as trade finance and fund management.</P>
    <P>ICC ceased to be dependent on borrowed funds from the Exchequer in 1980, though it has had considerable benefit from Exchequer-backed schemes which are now, however, in the process of being phased out.  The increase in its borrowing powers and in the related State guarantee now proposed is essential in order that the ongoing activities of the company may proceed without interruption.  It is expected that the new limit should be sufficient to meet the ICC's requirements over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the company is, I am happy to say, very positive.  As I have said, its profitability in the current year is very strong, based on the first six months of trading.  While its loan book is expanding rapidly it is nevertheless adopting a prudent approach to its business which, in the long term, will stand to its credit.  This company has shown a profit in every year since its establishment in 1933 and has paid a dividend to its shareholders in most years including every year since 1969.  This is a proud record and I have every reason to believe it will continue to be increasingly profitable in the future.  Its contribution to the well-being and development of the industrial, tourism and services sector of our economy has been immense and is a tribute to its board, management and staff over the years.</P>
    <P>The main strengths of ICC lie in the high regard with which the institution is held by Irish business and its range of small and medium-sized business client firms.  These firms provide good scope for profitable further expansion by ICC in <Col N="1492" /> the years ahead.  The company has diversified into new areas in order to meet the demand for new services from its clients and to generate increased income.  It now provides a wide range of financial services comparable to private sector financial institutions, such as: corporate finance and planning; venture capital funding; stock market flotations; pension fund management; foreign exchange; full range of trade finance services; deposit and loan facilities and hire purchase and leasing facilities, including leasing business in the Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>The company has already established itself as a successful and innovative financial services group and its transition from being primarily a development bank to a commercially orientated entity is well under way.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Bill, 1990, which is before the Dáil.  That Bill proposes that on the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta, its portfolio of loans and investments will be transferred to the ICC to administer. There is, however, no connection between this Bill and the Fóir Teoranta Bill.  The present Bill is necessary, as I have said, so that the normal ongoing business of the ICC may proceed without interruption and is urgent because the existing borrowing and guarantee limits have almost been reached.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware of my announcement on 17 May 1990 that I had invited proposals from a number of financial advisory bodies on the terms on which they would advise me in relation to the future development and capital requirements of the ICC.  For a number of years now, ICC have been making the case that the present statutory restrictions on its lending activities should be removed, and that more capital should be put into the company by the State as its main shareholder in order to strengthen its capital base and enable it to develop to its full potential.  I am anxious that the company should not be impeded in its development, particularly as the State-backed schemes for higher risk categories of borrower and for currency exchange risk schemes are now being <Col N="1493" /> phased out.  Moreover, new EC banking directives which are due to come into oepration in 1992 will require the company to substantially increase its capital ratio.</P>
    <P>Any shortfall will be required to be made good by way of additional equity or subordinated loans, or a combination of both.  I, therefore, consider it timely to seek independent advice as to the various options which exist in order to ensure the substained future growth and development of the ICC and on the best course to follow in relation to those options. As I said earlier, it is expected that the increased borrowing and guarantee limits proposed in this Bill should be sufficient to meet the ICC`s requirements over the next few years, by which time decisions will have been taken in relation to the future development of the ICC.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 provides that the company may borrow up to £1,000 million less any amount which has been paid by the Minister for Finance in respect of State guaranteed funds borrowed by the company. No such amount has had to be paid by the Minister to date.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the Minister may guarantee the borrowings of the company up to £1,000 million less the amount, if any, which the Minister may have previously paid under a guarantee given in respect of ICC borrowings.  No such amount has had to be paid to date.</P>
    <P>Section 3 requires the company to alter its memorandum and articles of association to take account of the higher borrowing limit provided for in this Bill. Section 4 deals with the short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This is enabling legislation which will increase the borrowing limits for the ICC.  Looking at Irish banking there are very interesting times ahead in the context of the 1992 programme and the various EC Directives that will impinge on this country.  We have relaxed exchange controls and automatically from this must follow removal of most of the financial controls.  These will have to be done away with before 1 January 1993. It is in that context, particularly with the ICC in mind, that we must consider the implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC is one of two State owned banks.  ICC plc were established in 1933 following the Industrial Credit Act of that year.  Their objective is and has been over the years to promote economic growth through the provision of financial services to the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy.  Since their establishment they have been particularly successful. They have provided over £1 billion to Irish business.  ICC's initial activity concerns raising capital for industrial companies by issuing or underwriting shares launched on the Irish Stock Exchange.  The company have steadily expanded their range of financial services, as the Minister indicated in his contribution.  These now include short, medium and long-term loans, trade finance, foreign exchange, instalment credit facilities, property loans and investment, <Col N="1495" /> equity investment, corporate financial advice and fund management.</P>
    <P>I notice that the range of businesses the ICC are involved in expanded between the Dáil consideration of this Bill and the debate in the Seanad today. The Minister, Deputy Smith's contribution was amended by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds here today and a few extra services were included. The similarity between the two speeches is noted, with little additions here and there to throw us off line.  There is only so much that can be said, on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for the protection, I was in need of it.</P>
      <P>The company, ICC, promote the development of the national economy through their support for the business sector.  We all agree that, as a commercial semi-State body, they have been very successful and the management and employees of ICC down through the years are to be complimented.  Their activities are financed largely by way of deposits from public and private companies, from institutions and from professional and private investors.  The company offer a complete treasury service, including a comprehensive deposit-taking service at competitive interest rates for deposits.  Deposits enjoy trustee status and, importantly to date, are guaranteed by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the ICC were founded in 1933, the economic climate was completely different to that of today and, more importantly, to that which we face as we enter the Single Market post-1992.  There was a high degree of industrial protection <Col N="1496" /> and high tariff barriers and the ICC were founded in response to the sort of protectionist environment of the time.  Given the environment that existed for business in the commercial and industrial sectors at the time, the creation of the ICC was a perfectly justifiable move.  Now, however, we must look to the ICC again, to their memorandum, articles of association and to their general terms of reference and question whether the same terms of reference of operation are, in fact, in order today as we are about to step into a total barrier-free Europe.  A body, an institution, a commercial semi-State bank that was created in a protectionist environment in the thirties would hardly seem to be the same institution that we need for our barrier-free, open trading Europe of the nineties and the next century.  We should not be afraid, no matter how successful our State organisations are, to be sure they are exactly what we will need in the years ahead, to revise our views and to look again at the State investment or State portfolio, or in this case, the 99 per cent shareholding the Minister for Finance has in the ICC.  In that climate one must question and look slightly beyond the narrow terms of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>The specifics of the Bill are fairly non-contentious in that every few years the Minister of the day has had to come before both Houses and raise the borrowing limits which, in itself, was an indication of the success of the ICC and their successful policy over the years. However, I think we are missing an opportunity in not being able to use this opportunity for a more broad ranging and wide ranging debate on the broader terms of reference of the ICC, of the need for State-owned banks at this juncture in our economic history, or, perhaps, broadening the terms of reference of the ICC to be sure &mdash; if we accept the need for a State bank &mdash; they meet the needs of the country and the development of business generally in the decades to come.  Perhaps there is no need for change, but we should not be afraid to make decisions. <Col N="1497" /> If amendments or broad changes in direction are needed, we should concentrate on them and, above all, ensure that what has been a successful organisation is in no way hindered by us, as legislators, in continuing to prosper and to thrive as they take their position in a barrier-free and in an open-trading Europe in the years to come.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the domination of the EMS, European interest rates, the position of the Deutsche Mark and the open competition from financial institutions and banking services post-1992, one worries slightly about Irish interest rates, albeit with the half per cent reduction that we heard about today.  We are still far ahead of the main central band of interest rates in Europe.  If we are talking about no financial controls following the relaxation of exchange controls, we must wonder how the Irish institutions lending money at whatever the going rate will be in two or three years' time, will be able to compete with the continental financial institutions with the Deutsche Mark or Euro-money that will be able to come here and will be able to lend money at 3 or 4 per cent?  I am not sure how we will cope and I would like the Minister's views on this.  Will the continental banks be able to come here and pick the plums, the bigger and better businesses, lend money were there is least risk, and leave the domestic banking service to look after the high risk businesses, the smaller businesses or those whose repayment rates may not be so good, or those whose history of repayment may be a little more chancey.  This whole area needs addressing, not only in relation to the ICC and whether there is a need for State banks at this time, but in the context of how our banks are going to compete <i>per se</i> post-1992.</P>
    <P>The creation of a State bank, or a State credit corporation, in the thirties when all private banks were owned by non-nationals as a general rule, and with a protectionist economy prevailing at the time, was understandable; I am sure I <Col N="1498" /> would have applauded the establishment of the ICC at that time.  In relation to the future of the ICC will the Minister say whether, in the broadest sense, their terms of reference will best suit to do the job and to compete with the European banks and financial institutions in the years ahead.  That is a very important aspect.  No matter how we figure out the borrowing limits or what praise we heap on the ICC for all they have done over the last 50 or 60 years, if we do not best fit them for the years ahead, we are doing a major disservice to what has been an excellent arm of State over the years.  I regret that we are not having a broader discussion on the role, functions and whole purpose of the ICC in the years ahead and I await the Minister's response to that, especially as the economic position has changed since the original objective was established.</P>
    <P>I would also like a specific response from the Minister on whether we need State-owned banks now or in the years ahead.  The ACC are the only other State-owned bank but they have not been as successful at the ICC.  If the ACC can get their act together and manage their business properly &mdash; that is a more difficult area with cyclical profits in agriculture generaly &mdash; and if they can bring their business to the same level as the ICC, and if the Minister is not keen to accept the idea that we should have a State bank at all, should we not be considering the amalgamation of the ACC and the ICC?  I would not propose that if the ACC were to be a drag on the profitability of the ICC, but providing the ACC could come up to an acceptable level of profitability and manage their portfolio properly, is there a need for two specific State banks with two totally different terms of reference?  Do we need any State banks, given the open competition and the threat from lower interest economies that all banks in Ireland will face post-1992?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect I would like the Minister to address.  This is an area <Col N="1499" /> on which I do not have very definite views but on which I have misgivings.  Given the success of the ICC and the way they have handled their portfolio generally, why do we need to continue State guarantees for the borrowing aspect of their operation?  That would appear to be at variance with the general line of thinking on financial services and banking development in the years ahead.  Is that necessary?  Could this aspect of the ICC's business not stand on its own two feet quite healthily at this stage?  If I recall correctly, the response in the Dáil to that point was that one could not make flesh of some depositors and fish of others and if some now had the benefit of a State guarantee we could not withdraw it from those who come in from now on.  That type of argument was used but this is an area which will cause some contention and is necessary, given the success of the ICC.  What is the Minister's justification for this in the context of the EC banking directives, where we are going in the years ahead as members of the Single Market?  How can we continue to justify State guarantee in this area when it actually is not necessary given the success of the ICC.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the ICC is 99 per cent State-owned.  I recall reading that when they were established in the early thirties, the Minister for Finance offered shares to the public generally by way of flotation and they were not taken up in sufficient numbers.  I am not quite sure what the legal status is but should we not be considering moves in that direction now?  It need not be a majority shareholding that the State would sell out but it should make an offer and see what sort of take-up there would be.</P>
    <P>The ICC have been particularly successful and profitable.  They may have departed slightly from their original purpose. Their minority purpose has now become a major one in that their lendings, generally, are between £609 million <Col N="1500" /> and £610 million, whereas equity investment is now only around £10 million. Originally, the ICC were established on the basis of taking an equity investment in manufacturing, tourism and service-type industries.  That now has become the minority purpose and most of their capital is ties up in lendings to the different sectors.</P>
    <P>Given the success of the ICC &mdash; albeit with the reservation that they slightly departed from the main purpose for which they were created &mdash; their profitability record and their commercial success, will the Minister consider off-loading some of the State's interest in the ICC?  That money could be then reinvested in other State companies that need an equity injection.  There are many possibilities as to what could be done with that money; in other words use the State's stake in the ICC as a sort of revolving fund.  We can withdraw safely from the ICC now if we attracted private investment from other financial institutions. The State could then, perhaps, more profitably use that as priming money for some of the State and semi-State operations that are limping along and who have not had the same successful trading record as the ICC.  A greater number of jobs could be created in, for example, natural resource areas.</P>
    <P>When we talk about natural resource areas everyone refers to forestry and calls for more investment in forestry, but that is being well catered for now by Coillte Teoranta.  However, generally in natural resource areas there is still many a niche for Government investment whereas the moneys we have tied up now in the very successful ICC, are, perhaps, not needed.  We should attract pension funds and other institution moneys from the private sector into the ICC and release the Minister's shareholding to work in a more profitable way for the State and the taxpayer generally.  In other words, we should make some attempt to reorganise the State's portfolio so that it would give <Col N="1501" /> a greater return to the taxpayer and employees.</P>
    <P>The whole area of Fóir Teoranta, about which the Minister has made statements recently and which he mentioned this evening, is rather a vexed question. Apparently with the winding-up of Fóir Teoranta, their portfolio, assets and whatever else, are being dumped into the ICC.  Perhaps the Minister could explain how a profitable commercial semi-State organisation could continue to operate strictly as a commercial body and take on the rescue portfolio from Fóir Teoranta? Let us be honest, they will be taking in assets in companies that have been teetering on the verge of collapse and that are generally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I would love to hear from the Minister.  There is some confusion in the financial world, and in the economic world generally, as to how the lumbering of ICC with Fóir Teoranta's portfolio will not drag them down to some extent, as the ICC have been strictly a commercial body to date, and a very successful commercial body.  The Minister is asking them to take on assets and shareholdings in companies that are a bit dicey, to say the least, with some teetering on the border of solvency that have been primed by moneys from Fóir Teoranta.  Of course, we would like to see State help rescue them and nurse them along and, hopefully, they will come back to profitability some day but there is no doubt that all the investments of Fóir Teoranta could not have been and have not been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a calculated risk in investing in companies which have a marginal <Col N="1502" /> viability in terms of their future.  The Minister has handed over the portfolio of Fóir Teoranta to the ICC.  Given the present terms of reference of ICC in their shareholding and portfolio structure, will the two roles &mdash; the role of Fóir Teoranta as a rescue agency and the role of ICC on a strictly commercial basis &mdash; be compatible without bringing down the profitability of the ICC?  In relation to the point I made about the possibility of selling some, or part, of the shareholding in ICC &mdash; floating it, if you like &mdash; lumping in Fóir Teoranta would surely make it a less attractive proposition for the private sector to offload from the Minister some of his shareholding.</P>
    <P>I am confused about it and I know there is confusion generally about it.  How does the Minister propose marrying the role of Fóir Teoranta to the commercial success of ICC without dragging down the commercial viability of ICC?</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the possible marriage of the ACC and the ICC.  I throw that out more in a sort of quizzical way because the real problem is how we can justify State involvement in the banking sector at all.</P>

      <P>The ICC are very important even though the Bill in itself is only enabling legislation.  The whole context of the ICC should be broadened slightly in terms of the response the Minister might choose to give us later.  I have mentioned the ACC and ICC and whether we should have any State banks. If it is decided that we should &mdash; and I wait to be told the reasons in the context of the Internal Market and all that goes with it &mdash; one State bank would be sufficient rather than having two with different terms of reference in terms of servicing specific sectors.  However, the ICC should not be dragged down by the present questionable profitability of the ACC even though recently, they have begun to sort out their difficulties.  I would like to see them merged or, preferably, shoved into the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are talking about equity investment, priming capital and priming the economy to create jobs and industries, which all of these banking organisations have to the fore, we must mention NADCORP, the National Development Corporation.  The National Development Corporation's lack of relationship with the ICC needs further teasing out.  They do not have exactly the same terms of reference, as the Minister <Col N="1505" /> will point out.  NADCORP seem to be more involved in the natural resource sector and in priming funding for start-up industries, if I interpret it correctly, whereas generally the ICC's equity investment has been more in established industries, expanding them and in the manufacturing/service sector generally. The expertise of both organisations could be pooled better.  I read recently Mr. Charlie Murray's book &mdash; a former secretary of the Department of Finance and former Governor of the Central Bank &mdash; about the whole question of whether we have undue separation and compartmentalisation in all the sectors that are servicing industry and the economy generally.  They all have the same objective, which most of us share, to invigorate and prime the economy, to create jobs and, generally, to serve the country from a financial point of view as well as possible. Are they all too fragmented and separated; have we too many of them just now, with ACC, ICC and NADCORP? Is there a need to bring them together, or at least to ensure that the expertise that is gathered at the top in those companies is shared among the companies so that we will, collectively, get the best view in terms of individual investments?  I would love to hear the Minister's response as to what the relationship, if any, is, or should be, between the National Development Corporation and the ICC in this area?</P>
    <P>The ICC have pointed out to the Minister that there is an urgent need over the next two years to increase the ratio of shareholders' funds to raise assets substantially in the ICC.  Perhaps the Minister, in this context, would outline his plans.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, in his Dáil Second Stage speech, made what has been a difficult statement to interpret. I will refer to it and, perhaps, the Minister for Finance might interpret it for us.  I am quoting from the Dáil Official Report of 8 June 1990 on the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> Deputies will also be aware of the statement the Minister for Finance issued on 17 May 1990 in which he said he had invited proposals from a number of financial advisory bodies on the terms on which they would advise him in relation to the future development and capital requirements of the ICC.  He is seeking this independent advice...</P>
    <P>In what context is the Minister seeking independent advice, from whom is he seeking it and for what end?  I assume it must have something to do with the possibility of off-loading some of the State's share in ICC and at the same time ensuring a profitable and healthy future for the ICC, whether a majority or minority shareholding should be sold off or if we should leave it to take its natural course, depending on the demand for the shares.  If the Minister would interpret what was a slightly vague &mdash; I do not mean that in any derogatory sense &mdash; statement that was hard to analyse, it would clear up any ambiguity.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ICC and to many of the semi-State bodies, there can be a certain inertia among all of us, as legislators when it comes to a review of the State's portfolio of investments.  Why are we reluctant to look at the terms of reference and the articles of association of those State and semi-State companies and at whether they have the role that best fits them for the future?  Why are we reluctant to look at even the successful semi-State companies?  We are usually dragged in screaming to look at the unsuccessful companies for all sorts of financial reasons but we are reluctant to look at the financial affairs of successful State and semi-State companies.  Perhaps there is a slight reluctance to rock the boat.  We could use, as a revolving fund, money that is tied up in some of our successful semi-State companies and reduce the State's shareholding in them. That money could be put into new existing State companies which need priming <Col N="1507" /> or more equity investment.  This would increase their assets thereby benefiting taxpayers and employees generally. Is there a policy decision not to review those areas?  Why has there been this reluctance, and I am not being politically critical when I say this, because the reluctance has been equally shared among different Administrations.  Perhaps, it is just the burden of work and the fact that it was never got around to but, given the competitive environment those bodies will face in the years ahead, to do justice to them and to ensure that the Irish economy is best served, we must review them now and ensure they are in a healthy shape to take on the best competition that Europe no doubt will bring.</P>
    <P>There are many areas we could expand.  I am conscious that the terms of reference of the Bill are fairly narrow, but I wished to talk about the wider aspects to ensure that the economy, and the terms of equity investment, are best served by us as legislators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I would like to comment on this important Bill.  The Minister has indicated that the Bill deals with the current limit on ICC borrowing and the State guarantee which is £800 million at present; this Bill provides that the figure be increased to £1,000 million. In addition, it provides for changes in their articles of association.  The limit of any company's borrowing will obviously affect their trading, assets and profits.  I would regard this as normal understandable trading.  Obviously, any increase in the borrowing capacity of a company like ICC should help the further growth and profitability of that company. The Minister referred to the fact that the present limit of £800 million was introduced in 1983, Of course, this has helped to improve the assets of the company to the tune of 77 per cent which is an excellent achievement and one that we and the company can be proud of.  More importantly, the company were helped <Col N="1508" /> by their increase in borrowings over the years &mdash; whenever it was needed increased borrowing limits were introduced. It helped the company to continue to make profits; in fact they have made a profit each year over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to levelling the playing field.  This is very much the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing at the moment in many areas of Government, and indeed in the area of the ICC.  I suppose that is what we are doing here this evening.  We have done it in regard to building societies, the ACC, the banks, the Trustee Savings Banks and Bord na Móna, which is a different area of activity perhaps but nonetheless it is part and parcel of a changing financial world.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to lending money and borrowing and so on.  That is all part of the movement of the ICC. It is interesting to note that many financial and economic commentators said our interest rates might continue to rise whereas the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, said quite the opposite; in fact, he has been proved right this very day.  Again, on inflation they were saying it will continue but the fact is that last week we were told we would have an annualised rate of approximately 3 per cent.  Hopefully, the last quarter will produce figures of 2.5 per cent and 2.75 per cent.  That has to be good for confidence in the economy, for improvement in business, for opportunities in enterprises, and generally to create a better environment and a better way of life for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many people who have availed of money from the ICC and who have investments and deposits with them. People are happy with the performance of the company and clearly have confidence in it.  The ICC are regarded very highly in business circles and small Irish businesses have been helped enormously by the ICC loans over the years.  The ICC have helped firms to expand and thus created new jobs that are so important at this time.  At all times we should have the creation of new jobs as a priority.  By <Col N="1509" /> helping Irish companies the ICC have allowed them to grow and expand and plainly this is an important role in the whole creation of jobs and of making companies competitive nationally and internationally.  At all times we must sustain and increase the rate of job creation. Small industries and medium-sized to large industries have been very important generators of jobs over the years and this has been very marked over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to se that ICC's growth is allowed to proceed at all times; they have served this country very well since the formation of the company. I have every confidence in their future and I wish them success.  Certainly I am convinced this short Bill will allow ICC to grow further in the years ahead and naturally I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this evening we are all being asked in a rather obscure way by this Bill to give a vote of confidence to the ICC because in asking to increase its capacity to borrow we are saying it is obviously a responsible body and that we have confidence that it will treat that particular exercise responsibly. Therefore, we can give it the go-ahead. I certainly would like to join in the applause which all sides of this House and the other House gave to the work of the ICC in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can remember when I went into stockbroking in 1973-1974 that ICC was not a company which was considered to be particularly lively, important, big, enterprising or aggressive.  At the time it was not rated very highly in the financial services industry but that has changed and it has made enormous progress.  At the time it should be said it was a sleepy organisation which has changed fairly rapidly in recent years.  I can remember when ICC decided to diversify into portfolio management it was thought that for a State-owned company this was a peculiar decision.  It was also thought that the ICC would have serious difficulties in <Col N="1510" /> competing in this area because in portfolio management it was competing with major banks and their merchant banking subsidiaries in the private sector and it was thought that a Government-owned group would find it difficult to compete here.  It did not.</P>
    <P>I know some of the people who manage funds for ICC, who do the portfolio management, and they are as competent as anybody in any similar position in the private sector.  ICC itself has done extremely well in its diversification.  We heard from the Minister and it is worth quoting his comment.  He said:</P>
    <P>ICC now provides a wide range of financial services comparable to private sector financial institutions such as corporate finance and planning, venture capital funding, stock market flotations, pension fund management, foreign exchange, full range of trade finance services, deposit and loan facilities, hire purchase and leasing facilities, including leasing business in the financial services centre.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that does not include all the services offered by the private sector but it is comparable.  What I would like to see now is the ICC growing up, I would like to see the ICC over the next few years being able to go out into the financial world without being attached to the Government in any way or form.  I think it has grown up and is capable of standing on its own two feet.  I think by supporting this Bill we are giving it the confidence to do that.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government have not taken the chance to open a broader debate on the ICC, on State banks, on the ACC and the role of State banks and if they are relevant any longer and whether they are a useful addition to the economy.  The first thing I would like to ask the Minister is why every few years &mdash; I think the last time was in 1983 &mdash; we have a Bill to increase the ICC's borrowing and every few years again have a Bill to increase the ACC's borrowing.  It <Col N="1511" /> seems to me it shows a certain lack of foresight and thinking.  It shows we are patching up the holes and we have not really decided what we want these two banks to do.  I am all for ministerial accountability to the Dáil and Seanad and not for the Minister giving ministerial orders but if the Minister has to come back to the Dáil and the Seanad every few years about both these banks and say we want to increase their powers to borrow, it seems to me that it is a piecemeal type of legislation.</P>
    <P>I gather this Bill is now urgent because the ICC are very near their limits but really we should have given more thought to the role of the ICC and the ACC.  By granting them small amounts every two years in some way gives ministerial and Dáil control over these banks, but in other ways it exposes the lack of thought we have given to their role.  It is simply piecemeal legislation.  I believe we should ask why we have a State bank at all, why it is necessary to have a State bank?  I do not want to get into the detailed socialist, capitalist problems of ideological discussions with my colleague, but I think it is time that we asked him and those who support it why we need a State bank.  We should ask whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most extraordinary point of order I have ever come across, but nevertheless it is the first time I have ever known the Senator to be out of order, so we will let him go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC, as a bank, is unrecognisable from what it was in 1933 when it was set up. I was not around in 1933 and I do not remember why it was established, but I gather the purpose was to help the small, fledgling manufacturing industry of that <Col N="1512" /> time, which was very unprofitable and needed State assistance.  That need has obviously gone and I am not sure whether the State bank at that time got directions from the Government about where it put its money or was under pressure from the Government about where it put its money or made investment decisions purely on the basis of commercial criteria, or whether it made decisions, rather like NADCORP with employment and fostering industry which is in a vulnerable state as well.  In other words, was it taking risks and was it under State pressure to give employment in certain areas?  Whatever it was doing then &mdash; the reasons it was set up are patently obvious &mdash; it has changed unrecognisably.  It is now a bank which has been set up to attempt to compete with the private sector.  It has changed its colour, its whole purpose.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether he thinks it can properly compete with private banks &mdash; with the Bank of Ireland, with IBI, with the Investment Bank of Ireland, with AIIB, with the Ulster Investment Bank &mdash; in this very cut-throat business in the financial services sector.</P>
    <P>Can it compete with foreign banks which are coming in here?  We see the Financial Services Centre attracting some foreign banks.  Some of them are coming here simply to conduct operations which are not in direct competition with the ICC, but some will be in direct competition with the ICC, and it seems that the ICC, because it is not governed by totally commercial criteria, has its hands tied.  The ICC, despite all the praise which has been heaped upon it today and its performance, cannot actually compete on the same basis with these banks because for one reason, its borrowing limits are so small.  These other banks can borrow thousands of millions without very much bother.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to look at the case of the Trustee Savings Bank, which we had here in last December's <Col N="1513" /> Bill.  That is another anomaly in the banking system.  What is happening in this Bill is lacking in drama, it is not a very dramatic change just to raise the borrowing powers of the ICC, but what we are going to have are different levels of banks competing at different levels.  We are going to have the ICC doing a very good job within limitations, and we are going to have the Trustee Savings Bank doing a very good job within even more severe limitations.  But the ICC may be at the most serious disadvantage when the multinationals, the really large German, Japanese and American banks come here &mdash; which the Government are encouraging with the incentives they are giving in the Financial Services Centre but with the opening of all barriers, and financial barriers as well, in 1992, big will be what matters and big is going to swamp small; the ICC will be small and will find if very difficult to compete.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister considers &mdash; this is no revolutionary idea &mdash; that one of the best ways to let the ICC compete is to let it float away into the sunset, that all Government restrictions are lifted and that this institution, which we all have been praising, is left to its own devices in the commercial world.  I suggest that if it is left in its present state, like the ACC, it will not survive, it will not be able to compete and there will be certain areas where the foreign banks will come in and take over because they will be able to compete on more competitive terms.  It is like the supermarket against the small grocer; it is exactly the same principle.  I suspect the Minister will reply by saying he has called in consultants &mdash; which the Minister for Finance has done &mdash; to look at the ICC and make recommendations on the future of the ICC. I would like to ask him what the terms of reference of these consultants are, whether it includes the release of the ICC from all its bondage and the particular restrictions imposed on it by Government.  I think there is a certain irony in the Minister calling in consultants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> I would like to say in passing, that, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, there have been, to my knowledge, several reports by that committee on the ICC. This particular body works relatively slowly, because things keep getting slipped in &mdash; that is not meant to be in any way a pejorative word &mdash; things keep taking priority, but the ICC is due to be reported on again by that joint committee very shortly.  It seems to be a bad reflection on this Committee of the Oireachtas if, while that committee are sitting and has the power to look into the ICC &mdash; and will also probably call in consultants &mdash; the Minister is calling in consultants to look at the ICC.  There seems to be an overlap there.</P>
    <P>I have had a been in my bonnet about the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies for quite a long time because it is a committee which is sent away to do a certain amount of work, left to its own devices, writes reports and then just goes away.  I ask the Minister if, in his consultations with consultants, he will first ensure that there is no overlap with the work of the joint committee and that he will also ensure that it does not simultaneously call in consultants, in which case we will get two consultants' reports on the ICC at the same time.  There is a serious danger of going that.  If that body is to do anything, and if it is to mean anything, it should be the instrument used by Members of the Oireachtas, to examine the ICC, and the Minister should not call in consultants.  That is an important point.</P>
    <P>Second, in his future plans for the ICC, has the Minister considered any of the work done by this joint committee in the past on the ICC?  The reports that have been issued, the inquiries that have been held, and the holding of evidence, by this body &mdash; it is particularly relevant in the context of this particular Bill &mdash; seem to be totally ignored.  I do not know, but I will wager with the Minister, that none of the reports of the Oireachtas Joint <Col N="1515" /> Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on the ICC have ever been debated in either House, and I would guess that very few of its recommendations have been implemented by the ICC or the Government.</P>
    <P>Instead of calling in consultants, which perhaps he has done already, the Minister might consider using that body to examine the ICC and to make recommendations about its future and about how he can improve its present performance. That is what it should be doing.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask a question, Senator Doyle asked this also, why a State guarantee is necessary.  If the ICC is performing so well &mdash; I think it is performing very well; it is aggressive, enterprising, and a tremendous body within the limitations in which it operates at the moment &mdash; why is it necessary that there should be any State guarantee?  It seems to me that the State is taking a totally unnecessary risk, that it is now a company which makes decisions on a commercial basis and that if it was to borrow more money those who are going to lend it more money will consider those particular applications on their commercial merits alone.</P>
    <P>If the ICC has a State guarantee behind it, it is not going to have any difficulty, this Minister knows this, borrowing that money and nobody lending that money to the ICC in whatever form is going to look twice at it because they know that their money is guaranteed by the State. That, in itself, means that commercial pressure is taken off the ICC when it is borrowing money and it means that in this case it is operating with a great advantage over its competitors because those in the private sector obviously do not have Government guarantees.  It is actually working on a completely different level from the private sector while it is trying to compete.  It is unfair in some ways and it is working at an advantage in other ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> It seems to me it is an extraordinary anomaly to have a bank which we do not really need &mdash; we need a Central Bank but we do not need a State bank of this sort.  To have a bank operating on a different level from the private sector, at an advantage in one place and a disadvantage in another one, is utterly anomalous.  I am disappointed that this Bill came forward to extend that anomaly, to say we accept this is an anomaly but we really have not the imagination to consider what to do with the ICC so just for the moment they need to increase their borrowing powers and let us do that.  That is a pity and we must ask the fundamental question about whether a State guarantee is necessary.</P>
    <P>Even if the State continues to hold shares in the company, of which I am very doubtful, is it necessary for the State to give such a guarantee?  I ask the Minister to consider that as well and whether it is necessary for the State to put itself at risk, because the State is putting itself at risk here, totally unnecessarily, because I submit that the ICC could borrow this extra £200 million and a lot more, if its performance and its assets are anything like what we are led to believe. I did not look at the accounts before this debate but I believe the Minister and everybody has said this.  It seems to me a healthy company will have no difficulty doing this and it will exert that sort of pressure on the company to keep healthy.</P>
    <P>There is nothing worse for a company than to get a State guarantee.  Look what happened to B &amp; I over the years.  It was a disaster for B &amp; I that it got a State guarantee.  I think it cost the State £106 million in share capital over a very short period.  It is a very bad principle.  Eventually, the State had to write off the £106 million.  To extend that to what is now a healthy company is very dangerous. Healthy companies can become very, very unhealthy if commercial pressure is not continually exerted upon them.</P>
    <P>The area of selling the shares in ICC is also something which should be touched <Col N="1517" /> upon in this debate.  Senator Doyle mentioned it but I do not think the Minister mentioned it in his contribution.  It is a very thorny subject to suggest privatising any of these State companies.  It really boils down to ideology in the end and what your gut instinct tells you ought to do.  If this company has done well as we are told it has, if its future is so rosy as is painted in the Minister's speech that shares in ICC are of an enormous value and that the State made an extraordinarily good investment in 1933 when it set up this company, it seems to me absolutely logical that the State should cash in.  I cannot see what is wrong with the State having made a good investment taking the cash and investing it in something else.  If it is a successful company there will be plenty of institutions, fund managers, merchant banks and individuals very happy to subscribe to shares in the ICC.  The State can take many hundreds of millions out of it by privatising it and go and spend the money on something else which will fulfil the priorities of the Government at the time. It could, of course, be used &mdash; as could selling off the ACC and Irish Life &mdash; to reduce the national debt dramatically and, therefore, reduce our interest payments every year.  It could also be used for any other purpose for which the Government think fit.  The Government are always crying out for money.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the socialists among us do not make more of this, why they do not say, &ldquo;sell off Irish Life, sell off ICC, sell off ACC and put the money into education&rdquo;.  The Department of Education are crying out for money. There have been education cuts on an unbelievable and unprecedented scale. The same applies to the Department of Health.  We hear people screaming, and rightly so, about the health services where real hardship has been imposed on poor people as a result of Government health cuts.  Yet, people scream when you say &ldquo;Let us sell off Irish Life and ICC to rich, fat capatilists and put the <Col N="1518" /> money into the health services&rdquo;.  It seems to me to be the most logical thing in the world to do.  That is what Government investment is for.  Every investment is made so that at some stage the Government either get a dividend or get a profit. At the moment for the sake of the public sector deficit the Government need a profit.  I cannot understand why the Government has been so slow on the Irish Life business and in this case on cashing its chips and putting the money where it is really needed.  It is really needed in the health services and in education.  The sale of ICC, the sale of ACC and the sale of Irish Life could make a fundamental and dramatic difference to these particular areas where the Government have made cuts.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider this and should tell those people who so strongly object to the selling off the State assets that the money is going into infrastructure for education and health and let us see what they say.  They will say they do not want that money, they want money from somewhere else, they want to borrow money.  It is the most extraordinary contradiction which the left makes all the time, where they do not actually want the cash from certain sources to help those whom they purport to represent.  I would like to see the Government selling off all profitable State industry, provided they can get a good commercial value for it and putting that money either into the Departments of Health and Education and into infrastructure there or into serious venture capital projects where there is room for expansion, for employment and for improving the economy.  I cannot understand why this is not done and why it is considered to be so difficult, especially from a Government of this sort or a Fine Gael-type who do not have ideological hang-ups about privatisation. I would expect those matters to be considered on their merits.</P>
    <P>It also seems strange &mdash; and I am not opposing the Bill in case the Minister <Col N="1519" /> thinks I am &mdash; and there is a limit on borrowings.  I would like to know where the Minister got this figure of £1,000 million. Why is it increased by £200 million? Did they have consultations with the ICC?  Did the ICC ask for another £200 million and say that will keep them going for another three or four years?  I would like to know exactly where this figure came from.</P>
