      <P>I have notice from Senator Avril Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately outline the future employment prospects for all our customs officers in the light of the free trade position in the EC from 1 January 1993, and in regard to his recent announcement concerning the introduction of automatic entry processing and direct trades input on 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to urgently provide permanent accommodation and proper facilities for the pupils of St. Aidan's Christian Brothers secondary school, Whitehall, Dublin 9, to replace the present totally inadequate prefabricated structure which has been in existence for over 20 years.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister to initiate <Col N="1338" /> a programme to overcome the enormous delays and the deteriorating position in the Land Registry, and the need for the Minister to make a statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Doyle, Costello and Neville as suitable for discussion on the adjournment.  I have selected Senator Doyle's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Costello and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We propose to take all Stages of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, today.  I trust that we will have the co-operation of everyone to enable us to complete all Stages of this Bill today.  We are flexible in relation to time. We propose to take the Horse Breeding Bill, 1985, and a Private Members' Fianna Fáil motion: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann welcomes the unification of Germany&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be extremely orderly knowing the Leas-Chathaoirleach's capacity to be extremely impartial. I am prepared to be eminently reasonable about the timescale for the Defence (Amendment) Bill but I am not agreeing to a guillotine.  This Bill was severely guillotined in the other House. One of the few privileges we have left in this House, in its declining years, is not to restrict debate on Government legislation. I do not want at 6.30 p.m. or at some other time where discussion on this important legislation, which many people feel has defects, will be terminated without a proper detailed Committee Stage debate.  The Acting Leader was hoping we would be reasonable and I have never been other than reasonable in my time in this House.  Being reasonable is not the same as giving a blank cheque to close the debate at a particular time just because it suits the Government; I would like something more specific.  Is he hoping or is he asking us to decide that a discussion <Col N="1339" /> of this Bill will be completed today, because there are two very different questions involved?  In the light of our comments last week about the success of a film, I am very glad the Fianna Fáil motion does not refer to any congratulations to the Government for the unification of Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to item No. 8, on today's Order Paper and with reference to that I welcome the Government announcement to abolish the death penalty. That is something which Members of this House have been clamouring for since 1982.  I would make a special plea to the Leader of the House &mdash; I do not know whether a decision has been made on this Bill yet &mdash; that we as a group have had a Bill on the death penalty on the Seanad Order Paper for seven years and the least the Government can do is to introduce the abolition of hanging in this House rather than in the Dáil.  I would ask the Leader of the House to make representations for the Minister for Justice immediately before the Bill is published so that it will be published as a Seanad Bill because this House would do it justice.  The last Bill dealing with the abolition of capital punishment was introduced in 1981.  Unfortunately that fell because the Dáil was dissolved.</P>
      <P>Finally, on a matter of order, I noticed Senator Norris in the debate last week was interrupted on a point of order by a Member on the Fianna Fáil side for reading his statement.  This was probably correct, although there is some sort of ambiguity about statements.  There is a tendency creeping into the business of this House where people are reading speeches, and that is against the traditions and the rules of this House.  Perhaps, the Leas-Chathaoirleach could watch that fairly carefully.  I am not going to interrupt someone when they have prepared a speech and taken a lot of trouble over it, but it is against the rules of this House for people to read speeches.</P>

      <P>I would like the Seanad <Col N="1340" /> to consider an urgent matter under Standing Order 29 in view of the fact that the Seanad will not be sitting for a number of weeks.  That is why we call on the Minister for Finance to locate an office of the Ordnance Survey in the mid-west centred in Limerick in line with Government policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible to arrange, as a matter of urgency, for a debate on pollution.  Yesterday the season of the fish kills opened when concrete was dumped into a lake in Galway thus destroying the fish.  This has been the pattern over the last few summers and there is a great need for an increase in awareness of the awful difficulties caused by pollution and the effects it can have on the environment and on our tourist industry.</P>

Má bhíonn ormsa mo chuid óráidí a scríobh amach i mBéarla agus iad a léamh anseo, beidh mé ag briseadh na rialacha, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ross ansin.  Nílim ag iarraidh é sin a dhéanamh. Bíodh go bhfúil geallúint tugtha go mbeidh an córas aistriúcháin againn tar éis na Cásca, tá an oiread sin nithe geallta nach bhfuil déanta, go bhfuil imní orm faoi.  Dá bhrí sin tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Chathaoirleach agus ar Cheannaire an Tí a chinntiú go mbeidh an córas aistriúcháin insealbhaithe roimh an samhradh seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the call of Senator Ross for legislation to abolish the death penalty.  I think this House would indeed do justice to that very <Col N="1341" /> important legislation if it was introduced here.  I should like to state for the record that the wording of the Independent's motion that has been on the Order Paper for so long is virtually a direct lift from the motion on the same matter put forward by my former colleague, Mrs. Gemma Hussey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It was at variance with what was agreed by the Whips.  We were lectured by the Acting Leader about the need for Senators to go along with what was agreed while he proposed that we would have three hours to debate all stages of the Social Welfare Bill, which concerns one of the largest spending Departments.  Again today there is a proposal for a guillotine, which has not been agreed by the Whips, in relation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, there was no guillotine on the Social Welfare Bill.  The fact is that when the Bill was debated in Committee the Labour Party were not present.  They did not have the guts to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate your protection to speak without interruption. The Order Paper refers to the Second Stage of the Defence (Amendment) Bill and does not refer to all stages.  This is an extremely important Bill which took <Col N="1342" /> a long time to debate in the Dáil.  Many important issues arose during that debate, and it is totally unacceptable that we should now be told by the Acting Leader that we are to dispose of it today. This is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the question of a death in an Irish prison this morning.  Yesterday I raised the question of the trouble in a British prison, Strangeways, but the Acting Leader felt that it was not relevant here.  I dispute that because the British prisons and the Irish prisons are very similar in their operation.  This is the fourth death in the space of five months in our prisons.  Because this problem is clearly escalating and getting out of control I ask the Acting Leader of the House to give us time for a discussion on the incidence of deaths in prisons, the causes and the need for prison reform.</P>

      <P>By way of information, I accept that a guillotine was not applied to the Social Welfare Bill.  We were given as much time as we required to debate the Bill yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to item No. 89 on the Order Paper which calls on the Government to clarify, as a matter of urgency, their position regarding the implications of the Supreme Court's decision in Shelly <i>v</i>.  District Justice Mahon.  I raised this matter with the Leader of the House on 22 March.  At that time the Leader said he would speak to the Minister for Justice and get back in touch with me.  I raised this matter again last week but the Leader did not reply to my question.  I want to ask again if the Government have made any decision on how they will handle this matter in view of the serious implications involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Costello, I think, in the interests of fair play to the prison service who do a marvellous job, that we should have an early discussion on the problems in various institutions.  From my own experience, I know they have a very difficult task.  The medical service needs to be stepped up and more use <Col N="1343" /> should be made of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, so that people who are not well will not be put into institutions which are overcrowded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the remark made by Senator Fallon.  The Senator should have checked with the Whips before he made the outrageous statement that the Labour Party did not have the guts to vote against the Social Welfare Bill.  The fact is that the Labour Party voted against the Bill in the Dáil. I considered the matter and said that because it was a money Bill which had to go for early signature we would not cause any unnecessary delay but would record our opposition to it.  When we were asked if we agreed to the Bill we said no.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to get tied up in phrasing the same matter several ways.  We propose to take all Stages of the Defence (Amendment) Bill today. We will co-operate to the fullest in ensuring that every Member of the House who wants to contribute will have the opportunity of doing so.  There are no waffle about it.  That is the straight message.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross asked for the opportunity to discuss the death penalty.  When the Minister was here during the debate on the Larceny Bill he referred to his intention to introduce legislation for the abolition of the death penalty, which he has since done in the Dáil.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in this regard and I believe our concern is being attended to by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton asked for a debate on pollution.  I do not think that there will be any difficulty about that.  I suggest that this matter should be put down for discussion at the Whips meeting so that there will be no difficulty.  I believe every Member of the House would welcome the opportunity to have a debate on pollution.</P>
      <P>Senator Pól Ó Foighil referred to the delay in providing a translation service. We would support any initiative in this regard.  We are not making enough progress. Perhaps we can co-operate more here.  Senator Costello mentioned the question of prisoners and the difficulties being encountered both here and in England. That concern is shared by all Members of the House and I hope we will be able to have a debate about it.  We will bring this matter forward for early consideration at the Whips' meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville was interested in item No. 89.  I will speak to the Leader of the House and I hope we can get agreement <Col N="1345" /> here also.  Senator Harte is most co-operative. The Labour Party and others had the complete co-operation of the Leader of the House in dealing with the Social Welfare Bill when we switched that business from Friday to Tuesday to suit Members of that side of the House.  There is no question, therefore, of a guillotine or any intention to press business through against the wishes of anybody in the House.  We are co-operating very satisfactorily on the flow of business thanks to the useful meetings we have on Thursdays.  Where there is complaint and lack of satisfaction I would strongly urge that they be brought forward at the meeting of the Whips.</P>

    <Title>Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan) Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to permit the establishment of representative associations in the Defence Forces.  Last July two very significant developments regarding the Defence Forces were announced.  One was the establishment of an independent pay commission for the first time ever. The deliberations of the commission, which is chaired by Mr. Dermot Gleeson, senior counsel, are proceeding.  The second major development was the announcement that preparations had been initiated for the establishment of a new structure regarding remuneration and related matters for privates, noncommissioned officers and officers.  The draft legislation now before the House is the result of the studies and consultations which have taken place over the months since the announcement.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a major development in the history of the Defence Forces.  Members of the Defence Forces will, in future, be enabled to elect representatives to associations which will be established for the purpose of giving them a representative voice on pay, allowances, grants, pensions and various other matters.  Military personnel will, also for the first time, be given access to conciliation and arbitration.  It is important that the new institutions will be put in place, without compromising systems of command and control which are essential in any Defence Force and the Bill provides for the necessary safeguards in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill, which is essentially an enabling one, are as follows. Section 1 deals with definitions. Section 2 provides for the establishment of associations and the scope of their representation excluding matters such as operations, command and discipline from the scope of such associations.  This section also recognises the right of individuals not to be members of an association and provides that the associations will be independent of and will not, without the Minister's consent, be associated with, or affiliated to any trade union or other body.  It also provides that members will not join a trade union or body, other than <Col N="1347" /> an association established under the Act, which seeks to influence the remuneration or other conditions of service of members of the Defence Forces.  This will prevent a proliferation of groups which would be a most undesirable development. The section also empowers the Minister to make regulations to provide for a system of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the suspension of associations during a state of emergency as provided for in section 4 of the Defence Act, 1954.  A state of emergency as provided for in that Act relates only to the Defence Forces and is entirely different from a national emergency as provided for in the Constitution.  Section 4 of the Bill deals with a situation where the Defence Forces are on active service and section 5 deals with the situation where members are serving overseas.</P>
    <P>A person subject to military law is prohibited by section 6 from endeavouring to persuade a member of the Defence Forces to join a trade union or other body &mdash; except an association established under section 2.  Section 7 deals with the laying of regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas, while section 8 provides for Short Title, collective citation and commencement.  In regard to the latter, the Act will be brought into operation by order of the Minister and different commencement dates may be fixed for different provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>In considering this legislation it is well to keep in mind the fundamental constitutional consideration involved.  The constitutional right to form an association is provided for in Article 40.6.1 of the Constitution.  It is not, however, an absolute or unqualified right.  The same Article provides that laws may be enacted for the regulations and control in the public interest of the exercise of the right &mdash; thus explicitly providing for the limitation of the right.</P>
    <P>Under Article 15.6.1 of the Constitution the right to raise and maintain military ar armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The supreme command of the Defence <Col N="1348" /> Forces is vested in the President under Article 13.4 and Article 13.5.1 provides that the exercise of the supreme command shall be regulated by law.</P>
    <P>The Constitution, therefore, recognises the unique position of the Defence Forces and the manner in which the State may provide by law for their organisation and control.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the Defence Forces is specifically provided for in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and the Defence Act, 1954.  It is but one of a number of functions in relation to the Defence Forces the exercise of which, for fundamental reasons, is controlled and regulated.</P>
    <P>In a parliamentary democracy such as ours the armed forces are subject to civil control and the controlled and regulated system of command and authority is fundamental to the raising and maintenance of a Defence Force in our democratic State.</P>
    <P>It is also important, however, that members of the Defence Forces should have suitable machinery available to them to give them a representative voice in regard to their pay, allowances and other conditions of service.  The matter, therefore, required very careful examination in order to get the balance right. We had to find a way to meet the legitimate wishes of the members of the Forces without compromising the system of command and discipline in the Forces.</P>
    <P>There is great diversity in regard to representative bodies in other European countries.  A report in March 1988 by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe indicates that the number of member states of the Council which permit the members of their armed forces to join associations equals the number of member states which do not. Unlike the majority of other armies in western Europe, the Permanent Defence Force is an entirely volunteer force.  It is necessary, therefore, that we should create a system which is best suited to our own situation, a system in which the military personnel themselves will have confidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> The Bill before the House being an enabling one, the intention is to fill in the detail regarding the actual representative arrangements in consultation with those directly involved.  From the very outset I have sought to involve the members themselves in the process of consultation in regard to the new structures.  Three teams &mdash; one for officers, one for noncommissioned officers and one for privates &mdash; were set up for the purpose of making submissions to the Independent Pay Commission and last December I availed of that pre-existing arrangement to address the teams on the question of representative bodies.  To continue this process of consultation most effectively, I propose as a first step to proceed with the holding of elections in order to identify representatives of the personnel. These representatives, democratically elected, will be given full opportunity to participate in the drawing up of the new arrangements before the associations are established and before any Defence Force Regulations under the Act are made.  In this way we will try to ensure that the arrangements which emerge from the process of consultation will have the confidence of the members of the Permanent Defence Force at all levels. In this connection I propose to use the mechanism in section 8 to postpone the coming into operation of the variou provisions of the Act to allow time for discussion with interested parties.</P>
    <P>The first election will be conducted under the general supervision of the principal officer of the Franchise Section of the Department of the Environment.  It will also be a matter for him to determine, on the basis of submissions from interested parties, the procedures for the election of representatives and the structures into which they will be elected.  In order that the elections can be held as soon as possible the Head of the Franchise Section has already initiated consultations with military personnel.</P>
    <P>Once the elected representatives emerge from the election the entire representative system in all its aspects will be discussed fully with them; I have no intention of imposing a structure as <Col N="1350" /> this would, in my view, be counter-productive and would not be in anybody's interest.  As regards the numbers of associations to be established, there will be separate representation for officers and other ranks.  As to whether there will be one or two associations for noncommissioned officers and privates, this depends essentially on what the personnel themselves want.  At this stage it would appear that the majority of personnel have a preference for one association for these ranks and this is entirely acceptable to me.  When the arrangements have been agreed they will be enshrined in Defence Force Regulations.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, in broad outline what is envisaged is that the associations will represent members in relation to remuneration &mdash; pay, allowances, gratuities, grants and pensions &mdash; and other matters to be prescribed by regulations.  Their role will also include welfare matters such as credit unions, recreational facilities, medical benefit schemes and family support systems.</P>
    <P>Spokespersons for the associations will be permitted to make statements to the news media on matters which fall within their mandate and the associations will be permitted to raise money by subscription, in addition to receiving certain facilities by way of accommodation and staffing from the Department.  A system of conciliation and arbitration will be provided.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the arrangements I have outlined will, I suggest, provide the framework for the establishment of representative associations which will meet the legitimate needs of members of the Permanent Defence Force while, at the same time, preserving the system of command and control which are essential and must be maintained.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As Defence spokesman for Fine Gael in the Seanad I welcome the Minister to the House.  The whole question of Army pay and conditions has been ongoing for a number of years.  It has had a great deal of media attention <Col N="1351" /> and has resulted in much to-ing and froing and agitation, and we hope it will soon be resolved.  The issue was badly handled by the Minister's predecessor and, to be fair, by that Government. It was ignored for some time.  Perhaps successive Administrations took the Army &mdash; and the Garda Síochána &mdash; for granted.  That must not happen again. The 1954 Act and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 provide for matters relating to the Defence Forces.  I have said in the past that automatically certain Acts should come up for periodic review. If that had been done, perhaps by a committee of either House, some of the problems which have evolved could possibly have been avoided.</P>
      <P>I pay special tribute to the members of the Army who have served this country very well both at home and abroad since the foundation of the State.  Many of us here have had connections with the Defence Forces in friends or relatives serving with them.  It is important that we pay tribute to the great work that Army personnel have done down the years on peace-keeping duties in the Congo, Cyprus, the Middle East and latterly in Lebanon.  Because of that the Irish people are held in great esteem and people in many such areas like to have members of the Irish Defence Forces present.  From time to time even in the past ten years we have had to resort in times of trouble to the Army to deal with refuse strikes, bus strikes, energy crises and when petrol was difficult to get.  The Army have been brought in to assist with prison duties.  The Army have continually acted as a back-up to members of the Garda in coping with the ongoing problems and difficulties of Border duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, too often the Army were taken for granted.  Too often we did not realise what the difficulties were &mdash; in fact we did not want to know the difficulties and problems and the poor pay and conditions members of the Army were experiencing.  In the past few years the problems began to be critical and when we saw some Army officers trying to support a wife and family on not much <Col N="1352" /> more money than we were talking about yesterday in relation to the Social Welfare Bill, yet, they were ignored.  It has been a sad chapter, but let us hope that, given the right approach now, belated though it is, we can undo the damage and improve the situation for the future.  We had many representations regarding to pay and conditions but, apart from some minor gesture on the part of the Minister's predecessor, little was done by way of any adequate response.  As one Member said in the other House, if the Army spouses had not stood for election last year and brought the whole matter to the electoral platform and in the process got quite a number of votes in various constituencies, I do not think we would have done anything about it.  It was only latterly, with the formation of the new Government, that the matter was taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Gleeson report which is inquiring into pay and conditions of the Defence Forces.  He indicated that the report will probably be completed by May.  There has been too long a delay because many of the queries, grievances and claims have been well documented over the last few years and the report should have been initiated much sooner so that the recommendations contained in it could have been acted upon.  At least if we get it right now it will be a job well done. I hope, when the Minister receives the report, that he will give a clear commitment that it will be acted upon.  A commitment is needed to put cash on the table and to ensure that members of the Army, at all levels, will be given the recognition they deserve.</P>
    <P>The representative body to represent the Army has been dragged along from an initial stage.  I criticise the fact that there was a great lack of consultation at an earlier stage.  The Bill was introduced in the other House although there was little or no consultation with anybody concerned.  Indeed, people were talking about boycotting the proposed elections. At a later stage we had the spectacle of Members of the other House, acting off their own bat or as a result of a nod <Col N="1353" /> and a wink from the Minister, talking to Army personnel.  It is unusual for a couple of Deputies to act in this manner and one must again ask why there was not full consultation in advance.  Did the Minister and his officials meet representatives of the Defence Forces prior to the publication of the Bill?  There is a lot of common ground in this area and, knowing the Minister's capability in the past to listen, to make progress and to get to the nub of a problem, I am sure that if discussions had taken place some of the hiccups and problems would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>The Chief of Staff sent a booklet to each member of the Defence Forces and he indicated that the documents accompanying the letter set out the Government's proposals issued by direction of the Minister for Defence for a system of consultation and representation for all ranks.  What consultations had previously taken place with members of the Defence Forces? PDFORRA want to ensure that there is a forum for making genuine claims in regard to pay, conditions, education and related matters.  I do not know if departmental officials or other people were trying to prevent them from getting what they wanted, but I do not think that the gap between the Minister and members of the Defence Forces was very big.  That is why I should like to know what consultations took place at that stage. Thankfully, we have made some progress since then and certain consultations have got under way.  However, I should like to know what progress has been made to date so that the ambiguity, distrust and difficulties which arose will be things of the past.  It is important to solve these problems so that we can make progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that regulations will be introduced in relation to the formation of the representative body but it is unfortunate that this House will not have an opportunity to discuss them. They might not be opposed but there should be a proper sounding base in relation to discussions with members of the Defence Forces.  Many problems in this area would have been avoided if <Col N="1354" /> there had been more discussions and less taking for granted on the other side.  I suppose the distrust was born of differences between the Department and members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Great tribute must be paid to many Army spouses who, when their husbands could not make representations, protested themselves.  They kept up the fight even when they were ignored.  There is no doubt that there was total neglect of the problems within the Defence Forces and I hope the Minister will bring about a situation where they will be solved.</P>
    <P>I am glad there will be an opportunity for members of the Defence Forces to discuss matters with the media.  I wonder if that right will be restricted because, according to the booklet, it will be at a very high level only.  It is important that in matters relating to pay, conditions, education and general welfare, if necessary, members have a right to talk to the media like any other body.  I hope the elections will take place as soon as possible. I do not know if the Minister can give any indication of the time-scale he envisages for this and when the regulations will be introduced.  I hope things will not be allowed drag on.</P>
    <P>I believe it is the preference that there will be one group for officers and a group for men but whatever groupings emerge after the elections, I hope they will be in a position to move immediately to remedy the difficulties.  There has been far too much foot-dragging over the years.  I had hoped that within a year of the Government taking office last July we would have gone a certain way down the road.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister confirm that the legislation will apply to the various ranks of the Defence Forces and to both the Air Corps and Navy as well?  I would also like to know what is envisaged for the FCA?  They are an integral part of the Defence Forces.  We all know people who have served and continue to serve in the FCA and it is important that we know exactly where they stand and what role they will play in the future.  I hope that improvements will be made in their section also, as it would be suicidal for us to <Col N="1355" /> face the problems we have already faced over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>One cannot state often enough the poor circumstances that many members of the Army have found themselves in in trying to raise a family on very low incomes and without having recourse to procedures to improve their lot.  The Minister could find himself in the position of Commander in Chief of the Defence Forces at some stage and I hope he will have left a legacy of improvements in the Defence Forces.  At some future stage he could say, &ldquo;When I had specific and direct responsibility for the Defence Forces I consulted with them and after much difficulty we improved the situation&rdquo;.  It is important that we do not compound the errors of the past with further errors.  It is important that there should be full and frank discussions and consultation.  If the Minister is not happy with what his officials are telling him, then he should meet with the Army personnel.  Although the gap between them is very narrow, the two sides do not seem to be able to get together.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask a few questions on the Bill.  With regard to the provision that this legislation will cease during times of emergency, I would like to know if this applies to the Defence Act or to the more general emergency provisions.  What arrangements will be made for those who are serving overseas to have their views taken into account?  Seven or eight hundred people may be serving in Lebanon for periods of six to 12 months at any time and I would like to know what safeguards there will be to ensure that they have the full rights of persons serving at home. Obviously I presume they will be represented by the representative body but I wonder whether there will be opportunities for full discussion to take place. When will the regulations, which have been promised, be brought before the House?  I know an official of the Department of the Environment has been meeting with the officers to plan the elections but I would like to know if there is a time scale for the holding of elections.  I would <Col N="1356" /> like to know how things stand in relation to that.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have reached this stage. I think it is important that full dialogue and discussions continue to take place.  I hope that the mistakes made previously will not be repeated.  It is important that having come this far we do not hinder matters.  I hope the Minister will receive the report on pay and conditions as soon as possible, and that in his own inimitable fashion he will be able to bat hard at the Cabinet table when it comes to getting extra cash for improvements in pay and conditions, and a system of work.  As the Minister is undoubtedly aware, it all boils down to money.  I think all Members of this House realise we have to look after the people who have served this country well.  It is a scandal that for far too long they have been taken for granted.  It is important that we give them sufficient backing.</P>
    <P>It is high time we took decisions and that full consultations and discussions take place.  Many members of PDFORRA have been actively campaigning for improvements and it is important that regardless of what the new associations are called, there is no repetition of the past mistakes.  I ask the Minister to make every effort to put the problems behind him and go on from here.  Army morale is low.  There was a delay in promotions; the chain of promotions was broken and people were stuck at certain levels and could see they would not be able to move.  That was very bad for morale.  It is important that the Minister does everything to raise morale in the Army and if he does that he will certainly have the support of this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted to see him here and looking so well.  I also welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the Minister for taking the initiative in setting up the first representative association for members of the Defence Forces.  As he said, the main purpose of the Bill is to establish a mechanism whereby members <Col N="1357" /> of the Defence Forces have representation with regard to remuneration and related matters.  It also &mdash; and this is a very important point &mdash; provides for access to conciliation and arbitration for the first time and I pay tribute to the Minister for including that clause.  That development was at the Minister's own initiative.</P>
      <P>This Bill was introduced as a result of a lot of extremely hard work and following the establishment last July for the first time of a completely independent commission to investigate remuneration and conditions of service for the Defence Forces.  At the same time, the Minister instructed the Chief of Staff to make preparations for the establishment of a new structure to deal with remuneration and related matters for privates, non-commissioned officers and officers.  It has to be accepted that a great deal of research and consultation has already taken place.</P>
      <P>Representative groups will be established on the basis of elections by secret ballot and they will be supervised, as the Minister said, by experts in this field.  The Bill is to be very warmly welcomed.  It is a new departure, showing fresh thinking in relation to representation in the armed forces.  I do not think anybody can doubt the Minister's commitment and genuine approach to this matter.  I congratulate him on his initiative which is a very positive response to the need to establish a representative structure in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the provisions in the Bill are very similar to those in legislation relating to the Garda Síochána. It has to be acknowledged that the Minister had an extremely difficult job. On the one hand he has to allow a very clear voice from members of the Defence Forces on remuneration and related matters while, at the same time, ensuring that proper controls are maintained in the operational and command areas of the Defence Forces which, in a parliamentary democracy, is subject to civilian control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the Bill is an enabling one and is intended to provide the necessary framework by secret ballots <Col N="1358" /> and genuine participation and discussion in which the Defence Forces will have a major say.  We must understand that the Defence Forces, as with the Garda Síochána, are in a different position from other sections of the workforce.  Because of the nature of their work, both from Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are subject to limitations on their right to form associations which other citizens would not have to accept.  The Constitution recognises the unique position of the Defence Forces and the manner in which the State may provide by law for their organisation and control.</P>
    <P>We must take the requirements of national security very seriously.  In the Bill the Minister puts forward proposals which are suited to our circumstances. The constitutional right to form associations and unions is subject to public order and is not an unqualified right.  Cooperation between the armed forces and the Government is clearly important.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have to behave in a responsible manner and not be seen to fuel confrontation.  I think the Minister has made it abundantly clear that he wishes to be as co-operative as he possibly can.  His role is definitely not a confrontational one.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very positive response to the demands of PDFORRA for representative structures.  As the Minister has said, we must at all times keep in mind that under the Constitution the right to maintain military and armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.  We also have a corresponding responsibility and that is too ensure that we do not erode the essential integrity of the armed forces.  Our rights and duties cannot be pre-empted by steps taken in relation to representative structures in the Army.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment by secret ballot of representative groups in the Defence Forces.  This is a major fundamental development and provides the first step towards a formal channel for representation in which there will be genuine participation.  It will not be just a talking shop for the Defence Forces.  It is obvious from the attitude adopted by the Minister that the last thing he wants <Col N="1359" /> is to impose structures.  He wishes to provide a legal framework for the setting up of a forum for genuine participative discussions in drawing up regulations. The Defence Forces want a mechanism through which they can express their views and opinions and have a say in pay and related matters and this legislation meets their needs.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill also goes much furthert in that for the first time ever it provides for conciliation and arbitration. The Minister and the Defence Forces want a system of effective representation and I assume everyone in the House wants the same.  Conciliation and arbitration are seen as very fair mechanisms and those who participate in that system have great confidence in it.  No doubt it will prove to be extremely successful in this case.  The nearest comparison to this structure is the Garda Síochána representative body.  The schemes operating in that regard have been extremely successful in dealing with issues of pay and related matters.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Cosgrave, I want to pay tribute to the Defence Forces on the outstanding contributions they have made both at home and in a multiplicity of peace-keeping missions all over the world.  Indeed, I had the great honour and privilege of meeting some of those people when on a recent visit to Nicaragua. They were undertaking duties that were a credit to them and their country. I do not think the Defence Forces need have any fears about this legislation.  The same opportunities will exist in regard to this body as with other representative bodies.  The security of the State is dependent on the Defence Forces.  The Minister has formulated excellent proposals which provide for review and change in the light of the experience of the operation of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adopted a very positive approach in relation to this legislation. His attitude can be summed up from the remark that when the elected representatives emerge from the elections the entire representative system and all its aspects will be discussed fully with <Col N="1360" /> them.  He has no intention of imposing structures.  He said this would be counter productive and would not be in anybody's interest.  He is prepared to accept the recommendations of the elected members as to whether they want one or two structures.  He is telling them to make their own arrangements in relation to the representative body, to decide whether they want one or two structures, and that he will go along with that.</P>
    <P>This is a positive approach by the Minister. He has done an extremely good job and he is prepared to explore all avenues to ensure that the structure put in place for representation in the Defence Forces is a good one.  All representations will be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on his initiative. The Bill is an excellent one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time I spoke on defence related matters I got myself into a minor storm and on this occasion I shall try to be more careful with the words I use.  It is worth reminding ourselves a little about what armies are supposed to do for us.  They get the short end of the stick on everything.  Historically, they have been dressed up in extraordinary glamour, full of ambivalences and of quite contradictory perceptions.  There is an enormous amount of romanticism attached to armies in terms of uniforms, marching, brass bands and so on to create one image.  On the other hand, certain of the more common obscenities in our society were described, at least by my grandfather's generation, as the soldiers world.  In expressing this extraordinary ambivalence in our society &mdash; in fact, in all societies and we are probably less infected with it than others because we have an all volunteer force and the army has a clearly subordinate role and does not consume an enormous proportion of our national expenditure &mdash; it is important to state that it runs through our history.  It raises the question about violence, where its role is acceptable in society and where a society is entitled to use it to defend itself.  A large part of it is an attempt by society generally all <Col N="1361" /> through history to anaesthetise itself against what violence is like and to give a feeling that somehow there are different ways of using violence.</P>
      <P>Violence is always brutal, nasty and horrible.  The fact that we ask people professionally to be prepared to do that on our behalf behoves us to have a considerable regard for those who do it and not to blink in front of what we are asking people to do.  Therefore, we must take every possible step to ensure that we do not ask or allow people to become part of the force which does that for us except and to the degree that is necessary for our defence.  I mean &ldquo;defence&rdquo; because it is a fact that every major millitary power in the world calls its army a defence force.</P>
      <P>No army in the world is called an offence force notwithstanding the fact that the world is now spending the best part of $10,000 billion each year on armaments. That money ostensibly is spent in the name of &ldquo;defence&rdquo;, defence of the people, defence of a nationality or defence of a patch of territory.  It does not matter if two of the super powers, or anybody else, have their forces operating as far away from their own country as is geographically possible, they are still defending themselves.  When South African forces were in Angola, thousands of miles from home, we were told that they were defending South Africa.  When forces of the United States were in Vietnam we were told that they were defending the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;defence&rdquo;, like all the other words that circulate around armies, deserves to be critically appraised.  There is a tendency to create a mystique about it.  It was pointed out to me, for instance, that if one watches British television news regularly, particularly on the BBC, one will see a nice glossy story each week about the defence forces in the United Kingdom, a nice pastiche towards the end of a news bulletin romanticising armies. I do not think we should romanticise the job.  We should respect what armies do. If we accept that the use of violence to defend our society can be justified we should respect the fact that those people, <Col N="1362" /> fortunately for us, choose to do it.  We should also raise questions about the armies.  It is the tradition of non-violence, non-violent resolution of conflict, non-violence as a resolution of conflict within society and as a response to violence that we should look very carefully at what we ask armies to do.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that we convey a mystique about armies through the uniform, and all the other things which create a type of separate existence.  We create a view of the Army as it is portrayed by all societies.  There is something mysterious about being in the Army. There is the romance of the Army.  We should remember that until recently it was not just being in an army that was romanticised but war was romanticised. All the recruitment to fight in any war at any stage through history, when people were not shanghaied or press-ganged, was based on a romantic, exaggerated and usually distorted view of what one was fighting for.</P>
    <P>Looking back through history at all the wars of the great imperial powers, which were romanticised at the time and in which people were seen to be heroes, it is impossible to look at them without coming to the conclusion that they did not have much to recommend them in terms of the resolution of a movement towards justice.  So many of them had to do with power, religion and some of them had to do with sex.  They were dressed up in far more noble cloth than that.</P>
    <P>One of the great developments of the 20th century is that increasing sections of all societies are beginning to raise serious questions about the romanticism of war and the gloss that goes with it.  There is the two-hands view: on the one hand everybody agrees that war is dreadful and on the other hand whenever it is our little patch that is involved our war is different. We have seen it in Central America, in Vietnam and in Afghanistan.  What it comes back to is the nonsense of the philosophical basis for a just war.  There may be a position where organised killing indiscriminately of opposing forces, which is what war is about, is justified but <Col N="1363" /> it is hard to look through history and see a moral justification for those wars.</P>
    <P>The role of all the major churches in anaesthetising the consciences of the ruling classes, as they were until democracy took root &mdash; I am not picking on one particular church &mdash; in giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the established order to effectively determine when it was or when it was not right to use force, is one of the least honourable parts of the history of the churches.  The just war theory sounds grand until one reads the last line which is to the effect that those who must decide when all the conditions are met are the lawful authority of a particular state.  In other words, if the lawful authority says that the war is justified then no right thinking Christian has any right in conscience to object.  Our bishops managed to produce a pastoral on the sanctity of human life without mentioning even the possibility of the right to conscientious objection.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable regret, for instance, that four or five European democracies have people permanently in jail for refusing to be conscripted to join the armed forces.  Countries that would be paraded as models of liberalism, models of freedom, and in some cases models of social democracy, have extraordinarily draconian laws about conscientious objection.  The reason we are so wary about allowing democratic structures to take root in the armed forces is because somewhere in the back of our collective minds is a considerable unease or unwillingness to confront what we expect armies to do.  We expect them to do whatever is necessary up to and including killing other people at our behest and on command without the right or the obligation the rest of us have to refer to their consciences.  We tell them that their position within the armed forces under command is such that they are not obliged to refer to their own judgment and to hand it over to somebody else.</P>
    <P>If a structure is created which gives people the right to be excluded, or to exclude their own personal responsibility <Col N="1364" /> from something as serious as that, it is obviously extremely difficulty to accept that in other areas of life they are not going to be inhibited as well.  A system and a force is being created which is based on the assumption that what I am told to do on the most fundamental issue of the taking of human life is right, not what I believe to be morally right.  I would love to hear many of the moralists who, quite rightly, denounce the use of violence on this island, and indeed in other areas of conflict, address the question of how to deal with the position of individual members of any armed force in the face of serious threat.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that the Provisional IRA have done awful things in Northern Ireland which are to be condemned but it was an elite section of the highly respected &mdash; in the United Kingdom at least &mdash; British forces which shot dead 13 people in Derry on Bloody Sunday.  It was not an accident.  Nobody who reads the accounts could imagine for one second that a group of paratroopers all suddenly went berserk and all miraculously happened to shoot only people of a particular age and overwhelmingly male, people of what would be called a military age.  They did it under orders. People do things under orders and it may well be necessary in the way our society is and in the face of violence that this should be done but we should not bury it in romanticism or mystique and we should not avoid confronting what it is we are asking people to do on our behalf. That is where I would have changed my views from what I said seven or eight years ago here.</P>
    <P>The clear responsibility for what an armed force does is with and through society, through the institutions and through the Oireachtas.  A considerable part of the harsh reality of the membership of an armed force is that we put people under severe risk but we also expect things from them, but there is the nonsense rhetoric that goes with it, the favourite one being that membership of the Army makes a man out of somebody. I have heard a person who is now a member of the Fine Gael Party in this <Col N="1365" /> House suggest that a solution to youth unemployment would be to introduce compulsory military service for our young people on the grounds that it would teach them discipline, make a man out of them, etc.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that we need an armed force in terms of the realities of life but I am not prepared to accept that compulsory training in the use of weapons for all our young people will do them much good, will do our society much good, or will be much of a remedy to any problem.  There is a lot about service in an army which does people harm, both in terms of the use of weapons and also in the sort of structures that are created.  The principle that the Defence Forces should be able to speak on their own behalf, separate from the command structure, is one that is much to be welcomed and I am glad this is being dealt with to some extent in the Bill.  The Minister's speech suggests possibilities and I will refer to those later.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that discipline in the Army necessitates the kind of caste system that exists between officers, NCOs and enlisted people.  That caste system is an historical anachronism based on the days when the only properly and decently educated people in an army were the officer class and most of the rank and file were illiterate and uneducated.</P>
    <P>We have an entirely different situation now where one would hope that all members of the armed forces are relatively well educated, with the officers being overwhelmingly university educated. That should mean changes in internal relationships.  That is a matter which impinges on military discipline and it is also a matter which is excluded from the concerns of a Permanent Defence Forces representative organisation.</P>
    <P>When looking at the whole question of who should be a member of our armed forces, how they should be represented, how they should be organised and what we should do with them, we would be well advised to keep our feet very firmly on the ground because we have a tendency to let our Army run off in different directions at once.  It is, of course, an <Col N="1366" /> extremely worthwhile role for our Defence Forces that they should work in peace-keeping in a number of areas.  It is a matter of profound regret that an allegedly democratic government in Israel have been indirectly responsible for the deaths of a considerable number of members of the Irish Defence Forces and the matter cannot be adequately condemned. I think our Defence Forces have played a magnificent role and it is a tribute to the quality of their training that they do those jobs well.  That is the positive side.  I have not yet figured out why certain other decisions had to be taken.</P>

      <P>The notice of motion was that Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Finance to locate an office of the Ordnance Survey in the mid-west, centred in Limerick in line with the Government's policy of decentralisation. Why I consider it urgent is because when this was first raised there was a notion of withdrawing a substantial section of the field office staff to Dublin.  Since then the Minister has conceded to decentralisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Society must not allow itself to be deflected from an unblinking assessment of everything to do with the one body within our society which is set up under the Constitution and which has the right to use force if necessary to defend us.  It is a unique body and the drafters of the Constitutions of all democratic societies have recognised that fact in the severe constraints they impose on them.  The fact that the Army exist and a job on our behalf should not allow us for one second to ignore what they do.  It should not allow us to fudge issues to do with what our Defence Forces are for, and what they need to do to achieve those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions have been made about defence expenditure, about the purchase of equipment, which are dubious to say the least and do not stand up to serious scrutiny.  I have raised some of these matters on a few occasions and they are on the record.  The purchase of a surface-to-air missile which, according to authoritive international journals, will not <Col N="1368" /> work in wet weather does not seem to make sense given the Irish climate.  It does not seem to make much sense to purchase an entire stock of new rifles when the allegedly old rifles are still in use by countries with far more extensive military activities than ours, to purchase Chieftain tanks to serve what purpose I do not know or to purchase certain armour piercing missiles.  I could be wrong about those things but what is true is that all those decisions were taken under a cloud of fudge; I do not know if this is because they have to do with national security.  I have tried via the Committees on Public Expenditure not to prove myself right but to find out the other side of the argument.  The best response I have received is &ldquo;this was taken on the best advice available and we are satisfied that it is a good idea&rdquo;.  That is not an answer; that is an excuse.</P>
    <P>If we are going to talk about how the armed forces can be allowed to represent themselves, we must not restrict them in terms of that representative body, to a very narrow agenda.  There are many things about Army life that deserve to be scrutinised and the best people, as in every other area of life, to talk about what is wrong with any organisation are the people who work within it.  One can pay consultants and get advice from all the experts from outside but (if they are any good) all they will do is properly package the experiences of those on the inside.  If they come up with things that contradict the experiences of those who are on the inside, the proposals they make either will not work or will make the situation worse.</P>
    <P>I want to identify the realities about Army life which I believe could do with being scrutinised.  First, our Defence Forces are poorly paid.  One of the extraordinary traits of most countries is that they romanticise, glamourise and do a great job saying wonderful things about the Defence Forces and then almost invariably pay them very badly.  I have never understood this but it is part of the ambivalence we have about armies.  On the one hand, we think they are wonderful but on the other we seem to have <Col N="1369" /> a view of those in the Army, particularly in the enlisted ranks, which does not justify paying them well.  The fundamental test of how one group in society treat another group is whether they are prepared to devote adequate resources to pay them well.  Even though there has been an improvement I know that many enlisted personnel are still far from happy.</P>
    <P>There is an excessively straitjacket caste system in operation.  It is very difficult to know what the present position in the armed forces is about the relationship between the different ranks because, by and large, personnel are precluded, except on an informal basis, from talking too much about it.  When talking to former members of the Defence Forces one is perpetually reminded about an extraordinarily rigid caste system which people accept, in which the officer caste has not only a sense of hierarchical superiority but also social superiority over the enlisted men.  This is not a hostility but is often a very paternalistic system.  I do not think the sort of democratic participation or sense of the rights of the subordinate or the junior members of the staff that would exist in most large organisations today has yet entirely permeated the armed forces.  Some members of the current unofficial organisation, or perhaps illegal organisation, give a very clear view of the continuing views of senior officers to any sort of a representative body.  It is in that context that the Minister's activities are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that need to be looked at.  If we invite people to join our armed forces and do this unpleasant job on our behalf, we ought to ensure that when they leave they have acquired some skills that will be useful to them in civilian life.  As I have said before in similar debates it is one of the regrettable facts that there seems to be a disproportionate presence of unmarried members of the armed forces in the down and out section of our society.  There seems to be a loss of a sense of comradeship, involvement and of participation that affects unmarried members of the Defence Forces when <Col N="1370" /> they leave.  I am not trying to sensationalise the issue.  But a continuing concern is expressed to me that when people leave this structured organisation where their social life and everything else rotates around an Army barracks, they can lose their way in society.  This is something we just cannot ignore when people leave the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>A question which is only partially addressed in the Bill is whether there is going to be any attempt to look at the working hours, or working weeks, of members of the Defence Forces.  I gather from the Minister's speech, but not from the Bill, that what they will be able to talk about will be, and I quote: &ldquo;pay, allowances, gratuities, grants, pensions and other matters to be prescribed by regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having said what needed to be said, I believe we spend far too much money on defence.  We spend, as a proportion of our GNP, more than countries of our size which are richer than ourselves.  The last figures I saw show that we spent proportionately more than Finland, which shares a border with the Soviet Union, or Austria, which is neutral and also has a border with what used to be Eastern Europe.  We spent more proportionately than the other much-talked about neutral country, Sweden.  I notice that those from a military background who are inclined to talk about our neutrality always dig up Sweden as an indicator of our obligation to spend a large amount of money on defence.  There are other neutral countries in Europe which are, in geographical terms, in more vulnerable circumstances, and which do not have a large arms industry and manage not to spend proportionately much more than we do.</P>
    <P>We need to be very clear about the purpose of our Army.  We have an Army for a number of reasons.  They protect us from internal subversion, a threat I am not persuaded is as severe or as extensive as we are led to believe, but it is there, and they serve the cause of peacekeeping around the world.  They are theoretically there to deter an external invader.  If I was living in the middle of Western <Col N="1371" /> Europe or the eastern extremes of western Europe at the height of the Cold War, or up to three or four years ago, I could understand why people would be worried about deterring an external invader. However, since the end of the Second World War I have never been able to find anybody who could convince me, first, who it was we were thinking might invade us and, secondly, what a small Army the size of ours could do to defend us against such an invader.  Since about 1950 the most likely war that would affect this country would be an international nuclear war.  As I have said before, in such circumstances our Army or any conventional force would hardly be out of bed, not to mention out of barracks, before we were all obliterated.  It is difficult, therefore, to see what objective we can serve by pretending we have an army that is somehow involved in the great plays of international operation.</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of considerable worth that our Army is not involved in any international military alliance.  There is a tendency now to see NATO in a very clear light.  I have never had much time for Warsaw Pact activities because it was essentially an imperialist operation in which a number of small countries were controlled from the centre of the Soviet Union, but NATO tended to glamorise itself.  It is worth while remembering that NATO never regarded democratic Government as a credential for membership and quite happily operated for 25 years with fascist Portugal as a member. Neither had NATO any great problems with Greece when it came under dictatorship nor with Turkey when it came under a military dictatorship.  The credentials of NATO as the defender of freedom are, to say the least, highly dubious.  I am very glad we were not and are not a member of NATO.  I sincerely hope that we will not become a member in any way and that we will not have an invitation to have a debate on membership of NATO, which is the usual signal of those who are in favour of us joining NATO.  I have never met anybody yet who expressed the usual regret <Col N="1372" /> that we are not having a serious debate about neutrality who was not in favour of dumping it.  There is a debate in our society and those who say that we have never properly defined our neutrality or that nobody who advocates neutrality knows what they mean, are people who know precisely what I and my political colleagues mean by it, and that includes the Minister who I think, believes in our continuing non-participation in military alliances.  We all know what it means and it is only the people who have a different view who dispute that.  Again, let me say that some of the more extreme positions on membership of NATO have been expressed by members of Senator McDonald's party from time to time.  It is an issue that that party should clarify because they seem to be expressing two different views depending on who says it and where they say it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Who was saying it lately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's colleague in the European Parliament, Mr. McCartin, has a peculiar voting record on the deployment of nuclear missiles within Europe and his ex-Minister for Defence, Mr. Cooney, has made remarks about neutrality as well which are hardly a clarion call to retain it.  Those are just two examples off the top of my head.  If the Senator gives me a chance, I will dig up a few more.</P>
      <P>I am sorry for going on at such length but the issue of the use of violence by anybody in a society deserves to be looked at comprehensively and not just talked about as if there is a difference. We expect armies to do awful things on our behalf.  We are the ones who are responsible, not them.  It is we who give them the brief, who create a structure and provide the resources for them.  We should not duck it by dressing it up in war games, in romantic uniforms and nice music and all the other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given what we ask them to do it is particularly important that those who are asked to do that should be able to communicate with our society about what <Col N="1373" /> we are asking them to do and how we ask them to do it.  Therefore it is most welcome that we are moving in that direction. The Minister deserves to be complimented. I did say to an active member of the unofficial organisation that they probably had their best chance of getting some significant progress now because of the person who was Minister for Defence at this period.  Given the benefit match that the Minister had on Friday night, I do not want to say any more kind things about him than he heard then, lest they go to his head, but it is true that I said that and, to an extent, my faith has been justified.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will argue with me about the term &ldquo;trade union&rdquo;, but this is essentially a trade-union-type structure which is essentially set up by the employer, which has the activities that it can engage in and the areas of interest that it is allowed to express an opinion on determined by the employer, and which, effectively, can be dissolved by the employer, not just in times of active service or in the case of an emergency &mdash; and I am very grateful to the Minister for the explanation of the difference between a national emergency and an emergency under the Defence Act &mdash; but can be dissolved because a Minister who can make regulations can change those regulations so much as to effectively dissolve it.</P>
    <P>It would have been quite useful and quite worth while to put a lot more into this Bill.  Many things that are not in the Bill need to be in it.  That is one of the issues I would like to address now without going into a Committee Stage discussion. There are all sorts of areas of welfare.  I do not mean what the Minister has defined as credit unions and recreation facilities, but the impact on individual members of being within the armed forces with the structure they have and the job they are expected to do.  It interacts with discipline and organisation but there is no reason to believe that the views of enlisted men in particular would not, if they were allowed to express them, have a considerable improving effect on how we organise our armed forces.  I am <Col N="1374" /> concerned that because of the use of the words &ldquo;excluding matters relating to organisation and discipline&rdquo; many areas of concern that would be legitimate concerns of a trade union in a different kind of employment will be excluded.</P>
    <P>I have a list here which includes things like the trauma that affects members of the armed forces in the event of them having to get involved in a violent confrontation in which some of their own members and perhaps some other people are killed.  What exists within the armed forces to deal with that? From what I know of it, I am afraid that the mystique of the armed forces is such that we are reluctant even to admit that participation in the use of violence can be very painful, traumatic and difficult for people, particularly where they or other people get hurt.  We cannot pretend that it does not happen.  The evidence of other countries is that veterans of war &mdash; and I am not pushing the analogy too far &mdash; suffer enormous trauma when they come back. In the United States more veterans of the war in Vietnam have died from other than natural causes since the war than died in the war, most of those being arguably related to the trauma of participation in the war.  That is an extreme analogy.  We ought to allow a body which represents the Defence Forces to talk about the issues that matter to members of the Defence Forces like their training, their ability to deal with the difficulties they face, the stress that being a member of the armed forces and of serving in difficult areas puts on them and on their lives.  While it apparently is necessary that a very strict system of discipline must apply within the armed forces, the process of discipline ought to be a matter which would justifiably be able to be addressed by a representative association. There should be a clear insistence that it should not have to come to individuals ending up in the courts to ensure that disciplinary procedures within the armed forces conform with &mdash; dare I mention the phrase in this august House &mdash; natural justice.  It ought to be possible to demand these things.  I would be concerned about all of the other things <Col N="1375" /> including the quality of training and education that is available to members of the Defence Forces.  All of those things ought to be legitimate concerns of a representative association.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the associations will represent members in relation to pay and allowances, gratuities, grants, pensions and other matters to be prescribed by regulations.  What bothers me is that the Minister's regulations obviously cannot conflict with the Bill and the exclusion without qualification of matters relating to any operation and the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces.  How can a legitimate body talk about issues that affect their members if they cannot talk about the maintenance of the Defence Forces, the raising of a Defence Forces, the operation and discipline of the Defence Forces?  So much has been put in there that they can talk about nothing except wages and conditions and related matters.  Can they talk about the quality of housing available to members of the Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not exclusive.  That is one of the reasons we do not put it into the Bill, that there are so many areas, a whole long list, which come under welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we will come back to it on Committee Stage and we can have an interesting discussion on it.  There are a couple of other things to clear up also. Occasionally it is suggested that there are difficulties within armed forces &mdash; not in this country &mdash; about misuse of power by superior officers against junior officers, and officers against enlisted men.  The way in which different ranks are dealt with by other ranks ought to be a matter for legitimate concern.  There is nothing about the operation of a defence force <Col N="1376" /> which suggests that the sense of human dignity of any individual should ever be taken away from them or that any sort of humiliating power structure should exist. There is no need for people to be made feel small in order for them to operate according to conditions of extremely strict discipline.  There are operations of a non-military kind which need extremely strict discipline.  Operation of a large scale chemical processing plant for, instance, requires people to operate to very strict rules, very strict discipline and according to very tight conditions of safety.</P>
      <P>We should not let the sort of mystique of an armed force get away from that. How they are trained, what they are taught, what sort of educational facilities are available to them, all of that is a legitimate concern.  I do not know how they can deal with the pain and trauma of some of the things that they have to do in the disciplinary processes.  For instance, why should a body who are arguing for the best conditions for their membership, if they see waste and inefficiency, not be able to raise this matter with the public?  I think it is because of wariness of letting people think for themselves which runs through our society in a big way.  This body will not be allowed to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Why?  I suspect I know the answer though it is not specifically stated. The prisons officers can do so although the Garda representative association cannot and I am not sure why.  There are knee-jerk reactions.  I think all of our bodies, if they wish, should be entitled to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is quite likely that members of the armed forces will come under the terms of a public service pay deal which will be negotiated by an ICTU who will not have within their body representatives of either the Army or the Garda. It is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, there are international organisations representing the representatives of defence forces.  Will this body be allowed to affiliate to international organisations which deal with international issues and which have been <Col N="1377" /> set up and linked to the armed forces in a number of countries?  This is not clear and it should be clarified now.  I cannot figure out also whether the body would be allowed to have a permanent secretariat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

I cannot see why it should not be recognised that a number of other bigger issues like housing, the personal well-being of the individuals, like the process of transferring people from one barracks to another should be dealt with.  I am quite happy to leave the details.  I cannot understand why it is not stated in law what the Minister says in his speech, that spokespersons for the association will be permitted to make statements to the news media.

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification of what an emergency means under section 4 (1) of the principal Act. This is probably ignorance on my part, but where in law is there a definition of active service as referred to in section 4 and which the Minister referred to in his speech?  What does &ldquo;active service&rdquo; mean and where in law can a member of the Defence Forces find out when he is or is not on active service?  With the exception of the provision for members acting outside the State with an international unit or otherwise, a member who is on active service shall not be represented by the association.  The Defence Forces, both the organisation and the membership, are entitled to a fairly clear definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  It is not, as I recall, defined in the definitions at the beginning of the Bill, I did not go through the principal Act line by line so I may well be missing a definition somewhere.</P>

      <P>That was last week, Senator Honan.  We are on much better terms on both sides of the House this week.  Since so much of the constitution, operation and the detail will be covered by regulations they must, of necessity, be debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a great pity, therefore, that the Minister proposes the negative control mechanism of dealing with regulations which means that unless they are annulled within the next 21 days they will stand.  There should be a requirement that the regulations are debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas which would mean that there would be a process of positive affirmation of regulations.  So much of this Bill will depend on regulations that they should be debated. <Col N="1380" /> Given that there is a Government majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas it is extremely unlikely that time will be allocated in either House to discuss them unless a group decide to use Private Members' time to debate them.</P>
      <P>The trouble with regulations, as the Minister knows, is that they can be only approved or rejected, they cannot be amended.  An enormous amount of important detail will not be subject to detailed scrutiny; we can either vote for or against them and if the regulations are considerd appalling, perhaps the Government will allocate time to discuss them. Issues dealing with the fundamental liberties of an important section of society should not come into force before there is an Oireachtas debate.  Therefore, the regulations should required the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas on this occasion and in future because, of course, the Minister can amend those regulations as he sees fit.  It means that a Government of the day could change these regulations without serious debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>What I said at the beginning of my remarks still holds good, that the Defence Forces are fortunate to have the best liberal in Fianna Fáil as their champion on this issue.  I look forward to the setting up of a dreadfully long overdue recognition of the democratic rights of the members of our armed forces.  I hope &mdash; although I am not optimistic &mdash; that we will succeed in improving the conditions in the Defence Forces.  Most of all we accept the broad goodwill of the Minister to enshrine in legislation important principles which are not adequately defended by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation although I had deep reservations about the Bill.  I thank the Minister for introducing it and for his speech this morning. He referred to matters which are not contained in the Bill but, as he told Senator Ryan, regulations will be introduced to cover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the men in uniform who serve our nation.  I do so because Derry, who was a long serving <Col N="1381" /> Member of this House, also had the honour to serve his country.  At a time when he was very low and knew he was dying I asked him &mdash; this is the first time I referred to this, whether he wanted a guard of honour or his Army cap on the coffin and he opted for the cap.  He joined the Army as a private and if there are problems in regard to privates and NCOs I should be seen as listening to them.  If members of the Defence Forces had been consulted earlier we might have avoided the problems and hassle which arose later.  In fairness PDFORRA did not set out to cause any trouble or to embarrass the Minister and the Government.  I am not saying they were naive but one must correct some of the things that were said about them.</P>
    <P>When members of PDFORRA listened to the Minister's speech in the other House their reaction was that they trusted him and they hoped that the provisions in the Bill would benefit them. They used the word &ldquo;trust&rdquo; and the word has never been more relevant in public life than here this morning.  We talk about the men in uniform proudly serving our country and if they trust us when the legislation goes through the House and is signed by Uachtarán na hÉireann I will depend on Minister Lenihan to see that their trust in us and in him is warranted.</P>
    <P>Much of the trouble and hype was caused by lack of communication.  I will not point my finger at a former Minister because that is not my style.  Mistakes were made by other Ministers for Defence before Minister Noonan took office.  It is wrong that one Minister should be singled out and blamed as many Ministers neglected this area.  Serving soldiers come back from abroad and are decorated with medals and so on.  While it is very important to those men and women, they also have to look after the material side in regard to themselves and their families.  As my colleague, Senator Cosgrave said, the Army are called on in strikes and they are at everyone's beck and call.</P>
    <P>I understand that Army wages and increases have not been maintained.  It was said in the Dáil that increases granted <Col N="1382" /> in the seventies have not been maintained. I understand that a man with 12 years' service in the Army brings home £150 per week out of which he has to pay a mortgage of perhaps £45 per week. How is he supposed to live on the rest and maintain his family?  PDFORRA have no problem in regard to a properly elected representative organisation and it is wrong for anyone to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>I hope that the ground rules laid down for them by the Department and the Minister will not be too harsh that they cannot put in place the things they are asking for.  It is no trouble to the Department to lay down conditions &mdash; and no Department may be tougher than the Department of Defence &mdash; for people serving but they must be conditions which can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed his good intentions in his speech today, but they may not be in the Bill.  I understand also that they are asking for separate groups for NCOs and privates, but as far as I know they do not want to be separated, unless they have changed their minds.  One has to be so careful, when talking about Army matters one is supposed to say: &ldquo;I talked to men who had served, because the men who are serving, who wanted to talk to the few of us who wanted to talk to them, made it quite clear to me that the rules were laid down for them&rdquo;.  I sought their opinions when I saw the pitch things were getting to, and they were not being listened to, because as I have already stated, I have great love for the Army, who are serving our nation with distinction.  I felt it was my duty to talk to them so that I would know the true story.</P>
    <P>I then had to say that I had talked to persons who had retired.  It was no bother to say that.  There is a change of attitude in this Bill before us today, and in the Minister's speech, and I wish to put that on record.  I am delighted that somebody had the good sense to talk to the men and to tell the Minister how serious things were down the road.  I am not a bit worried about what TDs went to talk to the men, if at the end of the day it is of benefit <Col N="1383" /> to the men and women serving in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan talked about romance &mdash; the romance we are supposed to see in the Army today.  I can assure Members that the privates and corporals do not see too much romance in the Army they are serving in today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator said she loved the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a distinction between romance and love.  There is a difference.  The men are upset about all this publicity and all the hype which is sometimes generated for the wrong reasons.  They would have preferred &mdash; I have their absolute word on it &mdash; if they had been spoken to, without all this publicity and all this hype.  Indeed, some politicians may be using them for further down the road but I am not going to point the finger.</P>
      <P>I think it is our duty as long-serving Members &mdash; those sitting here are long serving Members &mdash; in public life to do as these men and women who have talked to us have asked.  They have trusted us to put this legislation through.  They want to be consulted about their needs.  There was some reference to the damage they did in the last general election.  Very few Fianna Fáil people would get up and say what I am going to say: they did do us damage.  I am not saying the Army wives were right in marching with placards, but I am well aware that families like mine, who would have long associations with the Army, took a poor view of the fact that privates and non-commissioned officers were not being listened to.  It is wrong to categorise them as a militant group.  In all my years I never talked to more reasonable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, has put this legislation through the House.  I hope he has listened carefully to my worries.  In his reply I hope the Minister will pay more than lip service to the people who serve our country today.  I do not mean that remark to be taken personally but I want to say how <Col N="1384" /> strongly I feel about this legislation before me.  I do not have to read the Minister's speech to be aware that the Constitution recognises the unique position of the Defence Forces and the manner in which the State may provide by law for their organisation and control. I am well aware of the role of our Defence Forces in preserving and protecting this democratic nation of ours and the excellent way they have done so.  While I serve in public life I feel it is my duty to bring to public notice the worries of non-commissioned officers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  Like Senator Cosgrave, I hope it will not be a year or two years before the association is put in place with properly elected representatives. The few of us who spoke to the men found they were so careful not to ask for rights.  I do not think they even used that word when speaking to me. They said only what they were asking for; and told us what wages they had.</P>
    <P>I think it was known that I had reservations about this Bill.  I felt there was an onus on me to see that we did not, as we have done since 1977, put the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas without implementing it fully. I am asking the Minister for Defence to make sure that the legislation is implemented and that the elections are held.  I think we will all benefit from doing the right thing in the end.  Again, would we have had this long, upsetting episode if people had talked to those involved?  I am not saying the Minister should have done it, but somebody should have listened to them.  It is strange; nobody could talk to anyone involved some weeks back, and all of a sudden two TDs can talk to them.  Much of our trouble in public life today is because of lack of communication.  My success, and indeed that of the Minister, derives from communication and talking to people.  When I am talking about the non-commissioned officers I am referring to our three forces, the Navy and Air Corps as well as the Army.  I know that senior officers did not want these men to have a voice &mdash; and I say that as the widow of a senior officer &mdash; but they were not listened to.  They <Col N="1385" /> did not mean to go out on a limb and cause embarrassment, if that is what they did, to the Minister for Defence but they have been neglected.  I am glad to hear the Minister say there is more to this matter than is in the Bill.  There is more in the Minister's speech today than is in the Bill.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that the needs of the non-commissioned men and women, the people whom we praise so much, are considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just listened to a speech from Senator Honan in the old style and tradition of the House, the kind of straight presentation that has been heard rarely in the Oireachtas in recent times.  I welcome this Bill but it is a pity, as Senator Honan so rightly said, that there was not a quicker response to the demands in this area.  The Defence Forces are lucky because, since Mr. Donegan's time in that office, this Minister for Defence is the most powerful and certainly the most influential Minister at Cabinet who had dealt with the Army.  I sincerely hope he will take the opportunity to bring the service up to 1990 standards.</P>
      <P>Is it adequate that we have an Army serving the country, one that was established in 1922 or 1924 and which has changed little in structure and format and in its operation in the intervening years. Insufficient thought has been given to this matter.  Surely this is an opportune time to review the structure and role of the Defence Forces.  It is crucial that that exercise be undertaken.  We should look at whether we require an Army of the old style or whether we should have a militia more designed to supporting the Garda.  At present we have an Army in the old colonial tradition but what use does that serve at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in the Defence Forces arose from the time the Army took up duty in the prison in Portlaoise.  There were three arms of the State services, first class, second class and third class, doing the same job and there was no difference in pay, conditions, service or hours and that is where the problem arose.  The pay of a prison officer, with overtime, is in <Col N="1386" /> excess of £20,000 a year while that of a soldier with 12 years' service is £100 a week.  That is a stark contrast to a job which could be comparable from a recruitment point of view.  It is regrettable that successive Governments did not recognise the problems that arose in that regard.</P>
    <P>The amount of adverse press coverage over the past couple of years is a cause of great regret.  It is unfortunate that matters have been allowed to slide to such a degree.  Recently I read with alarm the scales of pay of the different defence forces serving with the United Nations and I was horrified to find that our men, who stand shoulder to shoulder with forces from countries of four continents, receive roughtly one-third of the salary of soldiers from what are described as Third World countries.  This is something of which everybody should be thoroughly ashamed.  There are sections of our forces serving in at least 19 countries.  I do not know whether that figures is correct &mdash; I did not make inquiries from the Army press office because the last time I had occasion to contact them they said they do not give out information and, unlike Senator Honan, I have not spoken to anybody in the Defence Forces in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>Surely if we are going to ask the Defence Forces to take on peace-keeping duties with the United Nations, there should be a special overseas or foreign service allowance to bring their salary on a par with that of members in other countries who are serving alongside them.  I think that is not too much to ask. Of course when these people come home, that allowance would be terminated.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly in this area, in that we do not have sufficient officers of senior rank.  In some cases a lieutenant colonel could be supervising the work of a major general of another nationality and this puts our people at a disadvantage.  If we do not have the complement of senior Army grades from colonel up, there should be some system written into the regulations of allocating temporary postings which would save our <Col N="1387" /> people embarrassment.  Our Defence Forces have carried out their duties in foreign countries with tremendous skill, success and dignity.  That is one of the main reasons the Secretary General of the United Nations is very anxious to have members of the Defence Forces serve in the trouble spots around the world.</P>
    <P>There should be some relation between the conditions and pay structures in our three services, the Garda Síochána, the prison service and the Army.  I am not suggesting that the roles played by those in the three services are the same but there should not be such a huge gap in the pay of those involved.  We have an opportunity in debating the Bill to compliment the members of the Defence Forces on the way they have carried out their duties.  They have served the country well down the years.  We should bear in mind that it is only in recent years that some of their conditions have improved.  For example, it is only recently that those on escort duty travelled in covered jeeps.  I have seen soldiers in the heart of the winter travelling around the country in open jeeps.  I accept that it is important that they should be able to make a fast exit from the vehicle but I do not think soldiers should have been asked to endure such hardship.  I do not know if protective clothing is supplied, and that is another matter that can be raised by the new representative bodies.  One could not fail to notice the bad conditions members of the Defence Forces have had to endure.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to aggravate Senator Brendan Ryan, but I should like to state that one year ago I would have been advocating that we should be part of NATO on the basis that we have an obligation to defend the community of which we are very much a part, but when I read that one of our sister member states will this year pay one billion Deutsche Marks to maintain 360,000 Russian troops in the European Community, I was taken aback.  It is of the utmost importance to this country that we reassess the role we expect the members of our Defence <Col N="1388" /> Forces to play.  The Minister for Defence, as a matter of urgency, must reorganise the Defence Forces.  The time is long overdue when we should redefine the role to be played by them.  We have an opportunity to do that and we should not let it pass.</P>
    <P>It is my wish that members of the Defence Forces will be able to organise their associations into effective bodies that will argue for better pay and conditions. Those in the Defence Forces should have an exciting and profitable career structure.  I welcome the Bill and I intend to raise a number of questions about its provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that a Member from the town of Athlone, a town with a long Army tradition, should make a contribution in the debate on this historic Bill.  Over the years I have made great friends with members of the Defence Forces of all ranks.  Some of my happiest days were spent in the gymnasium at Costume Barracks playing basketball with Army personnel.  Many of them were international players of the highest standard.  Indeed, I played many other sports with them.  Down the years Army personnel in Athlone played a major role in the sporting and cultural life of the town.  Nationally, the Army have been a great support to the civil authorities.  The security of the State largely depends on them proving, if proof is needed, that they are a group of intelligent, competent and resilient people. They have proved their worth time and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Internationally, Army personnel have played a major role when on difficult assignments overseas.  I am referring to places like the Congo, the Lebanon, Cyprus and on the Iran-Iraq border.  We should not forget that many Army personnel were part of the UNIFIL force who received the Nobel Peace Prize recently.  There is no doubt that we can be proud of the Army.  In my opinion the Army is too important an organisation to be treated lightly.  A career in the Army is much sought after.  I can recall the time when district justices suggested to many <Col N="1389" /> young offenders who appeared before him that they should join the Army because if they did, they would not have to serve a prison sentence.  Thankfully, that day is long gone.  Today the Army is recognised as an excellent career for young men and women.  There has been a lot of talk about low morale in the Army but when the Minister for Defence announced that he intended recruiting 1,000 people to the Defence Forces, almost 7,000 people replied.  That is proof that many young men and women regard it as an attractive career.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which provides for the setting up of the first representative associations for members of the Defence Forces.  Its introduction follows an initiative taken by the Government in July last. The provisions in it arise from discussions with representatives of the Defence Forces.  I agree that such a Bill should have been introduced many years ago but now that one has been introduced we must do the best we can with it.</P>
    <P>The representative groups will be established following elections by secret ballot which will be supervised by an official from the Department of the Environment.  That individual is an expert on elections.  I see the Bill as a reflection of the new thinking in regard to representation in the Defence Forces. Nobody can doubt the genuine interest and concern of the Minister for Defence. I support him in his initiative and I see the Bill as a wholesome response to the need and request for a representative structure in the Defence Forces.  The provisions in the Bill are similar to the arrangements that exist in regard to the Garda Síochána.  It is a middle of the road compromise in that the Minister is endeavouring to steer a middle course and hold that line.  On the one hand he is permitting a clear voice in regard to remuneration and conditions while, at the same time, he is ensuring that proper control is retained in the operational, command and discipline areas.  In keeping that clear course it is very important to ensure that the Defence Forces carry out their duties properly.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to provide the <Col N="1390" /> necessary framework.  That is the first step not alone to provide protection for the Government but especially for the members of the Defence Forces.  Following the legislation and the secret ballot, I hope there will be very genuine participation and discussion on the regulations on the shape of which the Defence Forces will have a major say.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) recognises the right of individuals not to be members or to be represented by an association other than the association that would be formed on the passing of this Bill.  It is interesting to note that PDFORRA in their draft constitution make the point that the association shall be a non-political organisation and shall not be obliged to belong to other organisations.  Subsection (3) provides that an association shall be independent of and shall not, without the Minister's consent, be associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body.  This is understandable because we recognise that the ordinary workforce differ from the Defence Forces.  We know that the citizens of this country have the right to form associations or unions or to become members of associations or unions.  Many countries around the world exclude armed forces and police from associations and/or unions.  In Ireland the Garda are not free to join trade unions of their choice.  While they have associations &mdash; very worth-while and effective ones &mdash; they are not allowed to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The constitutional right to form associations and unions is subject to public order and is not an unqualified right.  Co-operation between the armed forces and the Government is important and therefore, as Members of the Oireachtas, we have to behave in a very responsible way and not contribute to any confrontation. When the Bill was initiated I had discussions with the Minister.  I indicated the need to head off any confrontation and, indeed, the response from the Minister at the time was that he did not want it either.  He wanted the Bill to be proceeded with and to have full and open consultations with anybody who wanted to discuss the problem with him.  The <Col N="1391" /> Minister, apart from his role as Minister for Defence, has made it clear that what he wants is co-operation as opposed to confrontation.  That is the style of the man.</P>
    <P>PDFORRA sought representative structures for the Permanent Defence Forces.  The Bill is a comprehensive response to their needs.  The issue does not need further mention or investigation. It is agreed that the initiative for a representative structure for the Defence Forces should rest with the Minister for Defence and the Government and not with any unregulated group. PDFORRA are aware of that and they responded magnificently when discussions took place.  The Constitution maintains the right to raise and maintain military or armed forces and makes the point that this right is vested totally and exclusively in the Oireachtas.  That right gives rise to other responsibilities as well. I suggest that we have a responsibility to ensure that there will be no erosion of the integrity of the Defence Forces.  It would be unacceptable if steps were taken in relation to the representative structures in the Army that could in any way pre-empt the decisions of the Oireachtas.  That is our right.  We have had other cases of that in the House in the past.</P>
    <P>I congratulate PDFORRA on their response to this Bill.  The provisions of the Bill provide for the establishment, by secret ballot, of representative groups in the Defence Forces.  This is a major, fundamental development.  Setting up for the first time a proper legal channel for representation means genuine participation as opposed to what would be there if PDFORRA continued as an unregulated group who would be no more than a talking shop for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The new machinery envisaged under the provisions of this Bill will provide the opportunity for members of the Defence Forces, including those of PDFORRA, to opt by secret ballot for participation in the arrangement leading to representative associations.  On this point, the <Col N="1392" /> Minister has gone out of his way to indicate that he will not impose the structures. That will be a matter for full and open discussion.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the point that PDFORRA are not moving to the stage of holding their own elections.  If they did they would place themselves in direct confrontation with the Government of the day.  Confrontation between Government and PDFORRA could be a recipe for disaster.  I am delighted that everybody is on the same wavelength in regard to this measure.  I am also pleased that PDFORRA, as members of the Defence Forces, will become members of the democratic process in the taking part in these elections.  These elections must be fully democratic.  We should congratulate Deputy Brian Hillery and Deputy Tom Kitt, who spent 11 hours in the Aisling Hotel some weeks ago talking to the eight members of PDFORRA.  Two better qualified people could not have met PDFORRA.  Deputy Kitt is an understanding and patient person and Deputy Hillery is a renowned expert in the field of industrial relations.  I understand that Deputy Hillery will continue to have discussions with PDFORRA until this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>It is important not to have controversy. Controvery between the Army and the State would impinge on the very core of the authority of the State.  If PDFORRA were to proceed as an unregulated association could have very serious consequences for the institutions of the State.  I know that when the procedures for the elections come up there will be full consultation with Mr. Sexton of the Department of the Environment. It is true to say that the Army have fallen behind in relation to welfare and pay matters and other areas of medical benefit and family support schemes. This association, when formed, will represent members in relation to pay, allowances, Border allowances, gratuities, pensions, welfare matters, recreational matters, medical benefit schemes and family support systems.  The representative group will be entitled to speak to the media once they are established.  As <Col N="1393" /> we all know the present situation is most unsatisfactory and it has been left to the wives of the Defence Forces personnel to put forward their grievances through the media.  They did a very good job but I know the men in the Army would prefer to be able to speak for themselves, which is what this legislation is partly about.</P>
    <P>On the question of structures, I think the Minister has made it clear that he has no wish to get involved in a debate about whether there should be two or three associations, whether they should be made up of officers, non-commissioned officers and privates or whether the NCOs and privates should come together as one group.  I want to stress that it is essential to establish democratically what the Army personnel want.  All members of the Army must be seen to participate in a fully democratic election.  These elections must be for all members of the Permanent Defence Force.  It has been pointed out that if a member wants to opt out, he has the constitutional right to do so but I do not think too many people will do that.  I hope there will be a full, open and democratic election when the time comes.</P>
    <P>This is enabling legislation.  It is proposed to have full and detailed consultations and discussions after the election so that the regulations can then be agreed between the Minister, the Department, the Army, PDFORRA and anyone else who wishes to make a submission. As provided in the Bill, these regulations can then come before the House for further discussion.  That progression makes sense.  I know that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Lenihan, was never a sergeant-major or had any rank in the Army, but he knows the thinking of the Army.  The Minister and the Army know that trust and confidence is needed on both sides and I have no doubt that that is there in abundance.  Not alone is it important that there be trust between the officers and men but there must be trust between the Army as a whole and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The loyalty and competence of the Army and members of the Defence Forces are not in question.  We all accept <Col N="1394" /> this and I think the public at large accept it too.  We look forward to the conclusion of the Gleeson Report on pay and conditions because we want to see the conditions and pay of our armed forces improved.  It is not good for the morale of the Government or the people to have a disgruntled Army.  It must be stressed, that the Defence Forces are the responsibility of Oireachtas Éireann and that the legislation we pass here today will be governing legislation.  This legislation was introduced by the Government because there was no legislation governing representative bodies in our Defence Forces and so that any bodies which are in existence or which were to be set up would be legitimate.  That situation which existed since the formation of the Defence Forces in 1922 is now being changed.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that this is enabling legislation which provides for consultation with all the personnel of the Defence Forces on structures that will be acceptable to them.  The Government have wisely gone down this road, which was the one chosen in the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, which set up the Garda Síochána representative body.  This too was enabling legislation and regulations were subsequently brought in after consultation between the Department of Justice, the Garda authorities and the Garda personnel.  We are proposing to follow the same pattern in this legislation to enable the Permanent Defence Force to have a voice on issues such as pay, allowances and other conditions of service.</P>
    <P>The structures now being established under the Bill will accommodate the need for a representative body for the Defence Forces so that the Army will have an outlet to express their views on pay and related matters.  Not alone will the proposed machinery meet the needs of the Defence Forces but it will go further by providing for the necessary conciliation and arbitration machinery.  The issue of conciliation and arbitration will be the subject of consultation before it is put into place.  I understand that conciliation and arbitration were not provided for in the PDFORRA constitution.  The <Col N="1395" /> Government have gone further down the road than PDFORRA expected.</P>
    <P>Basically our role is to put the proposals on a very sound basis.  I believe this is what we are doing.  I think that trust and confidence abound in the Army and in the Minister.  I welcome and support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Like much of the legislation which has come before this House since I became a Senator this legislation is welcomed in principle by the Labour Party but we have a problem with the substance of the provisions in the Bill. What we have before us is a Bill which will provide for the establishment of associations to represent members of the Defence Forces on certain matters. Nobody can disagree with that.  Even though this Bill is overdue and is necessary, its actual provisions leave a lot to be desired because of the way this enabling legislation has been drawn up.</P>
      <P>This matter should have been dealt with a long time ago.  It is about time the Defence Forces had a representative organisation.  They are one of the three services representing security forces in this country, that is, the Garda, the prison officers and the Army.  Both the Garda and the prison officers have very strong representative organisations.  The Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors &mdash; two separate organisations, one for the officers and one for ordinary gardaí &mdash; have been working very effectively and have improved the pay and conditions of gardaí.  The Prison Officers' Association is not just an association; it is a trade union having successfully applied to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for union status.  This body is now formally a trade union in every sense of the word.  The pay and conditions of employment of both those arms of the security forces are in direct and drastic contrast to the pay and conditions of our Defence Forces.  I believe the reason for this is that the Defence Forces have not had a representative body.  That is the core of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> If the Army had had its representative body I have no doubt we would not have witnessed in recent years the marching of spouses of the armed forces.  Because the Army personnel themselves were not allowed by law to protest, the National Army Spouses Association had to be established to represent their spouses who themselves did not have their constitutional right as citizens of this country to represent themselves.  It was a gross anomaly in our society that people could not represent themselves and the only form of representation was through their spouses.</P>
    <P>In recent times we saw women marching on the streets protesting against the deteriorating conditions of employment of their spouses.  We must congratulate them on the work they have done.  It is because of them we are discussing this legislation today and for no other reason. Nothing has been done since the foundation of the State in 1922 and I have no reason to believe that this legislation would be before us today were it not for those courageous women who marched and protested and spoke out publicly and demanded that their menfolk &mdash; there are some women who would have male spouses in the Army &mdash; be treated properly as citizens of this country.  That is why we are here today.  Fianna Fáil know that well because they might not be coming here today as partner in a Coalition if they had addressed this matter at an earlier stage.  They have brought this upon themselves by not responding to the dire need that existed.</P>
    <P>An <i>ad hoc</i> representative organisation was established, the Permanent Defence Forces and Other Ranks Representative Association which has recruited widely and represents some 8,000 members within the Defence Forces.  That is the backdrop to what we are discussing here, spouses marching on the streets and members having to recruit without the blessing of the military authorities or the Government and, indeed, in the teeth of opposition by Ministers for Defence in the years gone by.</P>
    <P>The question of pay has been a thorny <Col N="1397" /> one for some time.  The 1988 interdepartmental pay review committee indicated the atrocious nature of the pay of the Defence Forces in relation to other sectors of society, particularly the other security forces, but their recommendations on pay were not translated into money in the pockets of members of the Defence Forces.  Now we have the Gleeson report.  All of this is the result of the failure of the Government to address a matter that demanded attention urgently.</P>
    <P>We have before us a Bill that negates developments rather than addressing the new association.  There is more in it that limits the extent, authority and power of representation of this new body than there is about the positive extension of the civil rights that are enjoyed by every other body of citizens in this country. That is a crying shame.  On the one hand we have enabling legislation that sets out to establish a representative body and on the other hand is so anxious to restrict its independence that one gets the feeling that is the main purpose of the Bill.  That is particularly focused in section 6 where it is stated that a person who is subject to military law shall neither endeavour to &ldquo;persuade nor conspire with any other person&rdquo; to join a trade union or other body.  That is a most loaded phrase.</P>
    <P>It is hardly conspiracy to persuade a member to join a trade union.  Under the Constitution every citizen has the right of assembly and the right to organise, and it is wrong to describe that in terms of conspiracy, with undertones of subversion. That is why I am saying that what I perceive as the purpose of this Bill is a negative one, to undermine these developments which should have been dealt with long ago, the organisation on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the Defence Forces themselves with the support of their spouses to get their rights.  That is what makes this Bill so unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe which has not granted representation or encouraged representative bodies among its Defence Force members.  The norm is to have a representative body.  We were the people <Col N="1398" /> who were out of line in Europe in general and in the EC when the matter was discussed in 1984 in the European Parliament and again last month when it was presented by the Socialist group.  That further underlines our political inability to address a major problem which should be addressed as a right for our citizens rather than done under persuasion, under threat and with a negative approach. Effectively the Bill makes it illegal to be a member of PDFORRA.  That is the main intention of the Bill.  Another representative body is set up but the effect and the intention is to make illegal the existing <i>ad hoc</i> body, and the provisions refer to that.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the major provisions. In section 2 (1) the Minister is given power to specify regulations but the regulations are to be specified in relation to every area; &ldquo;matters affecting their remuneration and other such matters&rdquo;. There is only one area the Minister is generous enough to specify that will be covered by this body and that is matters of pay &mdash; remuneration.  Any representative body have as their primary function to deal with matters of pay and conditions. That is always the core principle of any representative body who are an association representing a membership in society.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the Minister cannot come out from hiding behind this barrier of regulations which he will decide at his discretion, even though he will put them before the House.  Why can he not tell us now some of these matters that are going to be dealt with by regulation?  Why can he not state categorically the work and conditions as well as the remuneration for this body?  Are the regulations going to deal with the welfare of members? Are they going to deal with education matters?  Are they going to deal with grievances of any nature beside remuneration?</P>
    <P>It is expecting us to buy a pig in a poke in relation to the regulations.  They are not specified and they will determine the entirety of what is to be provided, whether we are going to have one association, or three, and then they are going <Col N="1399" /> to cover the operation of the powers the extent and the parameters of the body or bodies.  All of that is left hanging in section 2 (1) and the Minister seems not to care that we are going to pass the Bill which will hand back to him almost total authority in relation to the nature of the association or associations to be set up.</P>
    <P>In section 2 (3) there is a contradiction. The section provides that: &ldquo;An association shall be independent of and shall not, without the consent of the Minister, be associated with or affiliated to a trade union or any body.&rdquo;  How can we have an association which is independent if, at the same time, they do not have the scope to take any actions of their own accord in terms of affiliation to any trade union or any other body?  The Prison Officers' Association have affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the prison system has not collapsed.  I suppose it was already in dire circumstances, but the prison officers have not ceased to be good servants of the State as a result of getting full entitlements as trade unionists.  I see no reason that there should be a categorical statement on the one hand that the body should be an independent body and on the other hand that there can be no possibility of their affiliation or association with any other body.</P>
    <P>The same vein of thought goes through section 2 (3), (4), (5) and section 6.  In section 2 (4) &ldquo;members shall not become or be&rdquo;.  I would suggest that the wording of that be changed to put the future second and put the present first; in other words &ldquo;a member shall not be or become&rdquo;, but that is a minor point.  The substance is that a member shall not become a member of a trade union or any other body which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with remuneration or conditions of service of members.  Section 2 (5) provides that the Minister shall determine any question that arises as to whether any trade union body or any other body is a trade union.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous concern in relation to the association's role being very tightly monitored and limited.  In section 6 there is an outrageous reference <Col N="1400" /> to conspiring to persuade somebody to become a member of a trade union.  In relation to the standing of trade unions in this country this is an insult.  The trade union movement has a long record of integrity and honour, and here we have a Bill which sets as its primary function to ensure that there is no possibility whereby an association established under this Bill can ever get full trade union rights.  The legality of that must be questioned as must its constitutionality, because citizens are equal under the law and there is no constitutional prohibition in this regard.  The Constitution, to the contrary, would seem to encourage the establishment of representative bodies. It is the right of every citizen to organise, as it is the right of the State to arm its citizens in terms of a Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) makes the unusual provision that any association shall be dissolved under an order under section 4 (1) of the Principal Act which refers to a state of emergency.  Of course we are living in a state of emergency and we have been living in a state of emergency since 1939 when the Offences Against the State Act was enacted.  What constitutes a national emergency? I would be interested to hear the Minister's explanation. If we pass this Bill the Minister might feel entitled to dissolve the association as soon as they are established.  Section 3 (2) refers to the revocation of that order.  Both those areas require some degree of clarification.</P>
    <P>In section 5 there is discrimination.  It provides that: &ldquo;the Minister may provide by regulations that an association for members of a specified rank or ranks of the Defence Forces may represent such members&rdquo; but no members who are not of a specified rank.  What is the reason for choosing one rank as against the other?  Why should there not be representation in relation to members of the Defence Force who are serving abroad? We have an honourable tradition in this country of the Defence Forces serving under the United Nations in various trouble spots in the world.  It seems strange that there should be limitation in relation to the area of representation of <Col N="1401" /> somebody who is on active service on behalf of his country irrespective of whether that active service is at home or abroad.  These are matters I would like the Minister to address that point.</P>
    <P>The measure in relation to our internal affiliation to trade unions is something I find very difficult to accept.  It is an insult to the trade union movement in general. Why is this so specifically a point and why is it put in that wording that has overtones of subversion, of conspiracy to persuade anybody to become a member of a trade union?  That is totally unacceptable to me as a trade unionist and, I can well imagine, to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions when they see the wording of section 6.  We could take it a step further. There is, of course, an international European organisation, EUROMIL, established under the Council of Europe. Are we to say that there is no question of the Irish Defence Forces having any association with European counterparts?</P>
    <P>I recognise a danger here in terms of Irish neutrality but that fact did not stop us joining the EC, so I do not see why there should not also be the possibility of certain rights and contacts in the context of representative organisations.  I am not talking about an organisation that would discuss military matters; that is not the function of an association.  The only matter specified in the regulations is simply one of remuneration, although we hope that that will be extended to a wide range of other social and economic areas concerning members' work and livelihoods.</P>
    <P>Why is the possibility ruled out of any link-up between representative organisations? Our Garda force link up with police organisations throughout Europe. There is no problem of contacts there.  I am not talking about working contacts in terms of police operations, about fraternal contacts between associations on common matters in relation to pay and conditions.  I should like the Minister to address that aspect of it as well, although of course it is not as important as the internal link-up within our own trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister again reserves to himself <Col N="1402" /> absolute rights to when the last section in the Bill will come into operation by order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have engaged in an alteration.  I am coming to a close.  The lack of consultation has been at the heart of the problem and I am concerned because there had been negligence in dealing with this matter for so long that a veritable Pandora's box opened in relation to it over the last few years.  The Minister has belatedly come up with a response but this response is now colouring the Bill to such a degree that it is concentrating on the negative rather than the positive.  It looks like a begrudging type of Bill which is saying we will allow an association to be set up because we have no choice but that we will put the boot in strongly against those people who have fought for these constitutional and legal rights for the members of the Defence Forces.  While the Bill is welcome in principle many of its provisions are not just undesirable but highly questionable in terms of legality and constitutionality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is very good to see him here.  We in the Progressive Democrats welcome this Bill and I also must say that I very much welcome the tone and the content of the Minister's speech this morning.  It contained very many positive aspects and I hope that the Minister is successful in achieving the objectives which he has spelled out in that speech.</P>
      <P>I come from a place within a stone's throw of the Curragh Camp.  I was born and brought up there, so I can make some claims to understanding a fair bit about the Army; I certainly know very many Army people.  When I was growing up it was one of the major achievements to have a pass to the Curragh training camp which allowed one to swim in the pool there, which at that time, of course, we called the baths.  The point needs to be made that 20 or 30 years ago the facilities which the Army enjoyed in the Curragh Camp were the envy of those of us who lived around it.  Now it is the reverse; the facilities in the towns around the Curragh are the envy of Army personnel.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the members of the forces accept the Minister's desire to give them a say in their pay and conditions and the reassurances which he has been attempting to give them over recent weeks and months.  I do not think that there is any wish on the part of the vast majority of those in the Defence Forces to erode military discipline or to interfere with its process.  However, there is a fairly widespread suspicion among them of the political process and they had hoped probably for broader scope and more specifics in the Bill.  That is not meant as a criticism of the nature of the Bill but that was their hope.  The Minister has gone a long way &mdash; much further than his predecessors &mdash; in convincing them that many of their reasonable demands will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon earlier spoke of trust, and I fully support what he had to say. At this stage the success of where we go from here depends very largely on trust between the Minister, PDFORRA and the other people who will be involved in <Col N="1404" /> forming the associations envisaged under the Bill.  We all agree that the Army have fulfilled a very valuable role in the State at very many levels, not all of them just in relation to military matters.  In their active duty role it cannot be denied that they have brought immense distinction upon themselves and, indeed, immense credit to the country in the way they have conducted themselves at home and abroad, particularly in relation to their UN duties.  It should not be forgotten that they have given their lives in defence of some of the things which we take very much for granted and which are not so obvious in other countries.  They have shown a tremendous level of responsibility right down through the years.  The State is not very old and one of the points which was not mentioned this morning &mdash; and which should have been &mdash; is that we can stand up here in a free parliament, unfettered, and give our views freely and openly.  That is partially due to the way that the armed forces have conducted themselves over the years.  They have displayed at all times an immense loyalty to the State and to its institution, and for that they need to be congratulated.  They have also, in my part of the country, contributed enormously to the work and effort of voluntary bodies outside their army duties.  There are very many voluntary bodies who owe Army personnel a substantial debt of gratitude for the time and effort they have given in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that we do not need an Army.  There seems to be a view in some quarters that armies are an unnecessary luxury, but certainly that is not my view.  I think we are well served by our Army and we need them.  That has been shown in relation to Border and security duties.  They play a valuable role at home, and in addition they have shown us what they can contribute in the wider international context.</P>
    <P>They have probably suffered because they were so conscious of their responsibilities to the State and to its institutions, over the years that they showed a marked <Col N="1405" /> reluctance to get involved in the political process and in some of the areas which I feel they were forced to get involved in over the past year or so.  I think they have paid the price for their responsibility.  The Army Wives Association highlighted something which needed to be highlighted, because without them we possibly would have gone along congratulating the men but not really addressing or thinking, about the pay and conditions which operated within the Army.</P>
    <P>There are people in the Curragh Camp whose living conditions are not fit for human habitation.  I think Army personnel tolerate housing conditions which the vast majority of the population would not tolerate.  Their basic pay, which has been referred to, is disgraceful.  At one time their pay levels were comparable to the Garda Síochána but they have fallen way behind.  Senator McDonald mentioned the situation in Portlaoise.  I understand that Army personnel serving in Portlaoise over the Christmas holidays need to spend three days there to earn the same amount of money as members of the other services would in eight or nine hours.  That is not acceptable, so I can fully understand the underlying grievance and sense of frustration in the Army over the past year, and indeed before that.  I think our Army personnel have been badly treated and until the Minister's intervention, the situation had been very badly handled.  One of the problems was that we confused the requests for improvements in conditions and other reasonable requests with a challenge to authority that was never there.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello has mentioned trade unions.  In my view there is no desire on anybody's part within the Army to be a member of a trade union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that one would be a member of a trade union is to suggest logically that there is a right to strike. Nobody in the Army wants to strike.  It is not acceptable, apart from whether <Col N="1406" /> they would want to or not.  It is not acceptable that anybody in the Army should be able to strike, but my view is &mdash; and I firmly believe it, having spoken to them &mdash; that nobody in the Army wants to be in a trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the strides he has made in resolving some very difficult matters.  I realise the diplomatic problems involved in dealing with people who are not in duly constituted representative associations but I think the Minister has made a very reasonable compromise in trying to address that problem and in trying to sort out the difficulties which were there.  I congratulate him on that.  Army morale had been very low.  I would like to paraphrase what the Chief of Staff said in his circular to all members of the Defence Forces in relation to the Bill we have before us and on another matter.  He said he was confident that the crucial subject would be approached with trust, a sense of duty, common sense and goodwill by all members of the Permanent Defence Forces, and that the outcome will be in the best interest of the Defence Forces and the State.  I do not think anybody can disagree with that sentiment.  The conditions which pertained in the past for members of the Army, and I referred to some of them already, were far from satisfactory, and in the negotiations between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on the formation of the present Government last July, this issue received particular attention.  Indeed, in the agreed Programme for Government it is dealt with specifically where it says that the Government state that the long-term objective is that the Army should be restructured with the aim of substantially improving basic pay and reducing overdependence on special Army duty allowances. Those special allowances were the cause of serious grievances and the Army personnel rightly felt badly about them. My information is that as recently as 1987 there was only one rank outside the officer rank which earned more than the average industrial wage, and I understand that in 1988 the average Garda earned more than a commandant in the <Col N="1407" /> Army.  A private's wages would need to increase by something of the order of £45 a week and a sergeant's by twice that much to restore the parity between the Army and the Garda Síochána.  We cannot dispute the fact that we neglected the Army.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which are of concern to Army personnel &mdash; pension and gratuity rights which were devalued by leaving out increases in military service allowances when calculating those rights, and the non-pay elements of some of the claims which were to be made, such as medical cards and so on.  Soldiers should have free travel when they are in uniform.  Most countries in the western world do that and I do not see why we should not do the same.  All allowances paid to Army personnel should be linked to basic levels of pay.  The fundamental problem is with basic pay and not with all these special allowances for special duties which on the one hand, appear to give people money.</P>
    <P>As far back as last May I said there was an urgent need for an independent review board to be set up to look at Army pay and conditions, and I also said that those serving in the Defence Forces should be entitled to some sort of representation on it, representation on the same lines as the Garda representative body; that allowing the Department of Defence to arbitrarily and unilaterally decide on pay submissions made by the Army without appeal was not justifiable. I am very glad that the pay committee have been set up and I look forward to their findings.  This was a vitally important step to resolving the many problems affecting the Army and the working conditions of the Defence Forces.  This Bill provides for the holding of elections to representative associations of the armed forces and this in conjunction with the committee is a tremendous step forward which I am confident will help to resolve the difficulties that existed in the past. Unfortunately, the debate on the proposed establishment of the representative associations has been subject to a <Col N="1408" /> good deal of misrepresentation and confusion. My party have consistently supported the right of the members of the Defence Forces to have representative bodies &mdash; and I have just referred to what I had to say about that nearly 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us is a satisfactory basis for bringing about a settlement to all these problems and I and my party are satisfied that the proposals provide an acceptable basis for the formation of such bodies.  The important point to bear in mind here is that this is enabling legislation.  Senator Costello seemed to get very concerned about a lot of the words.  I thought he was a little pedantic in some of his concerns in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with matters affecting remuneration and such other matters as the Minister may specify in the regulations. I am sure &ldquo;such other matters&rdquo; will cover conditions.  I note from the Minister's speech this morning that he specifically referred to the fact that the Defence Forces should have suitable machinery available to them to give them a representative voice in regard to their pay, allowances and other conditions of service and I do not doubt the Minister's intention to deliver on that.  The most important point to bear in mind is that this is enabling legislation which provides a mechanism for the holding of elections to the associations and gives members of the Defence Forces a mandate to speak on behalf of the forces as a whole.  When these elections have been held, detailed discussions can take place on the regulations which will govern the associations and in that process the elected representatives of the Defence Forces will have their say.</P>
    <P>The elections will be held on the basis of a secret ballot, with a single transferable vote.  When the Defence Forces have elected the people to speak on their behalf they can sit down with the Minister for Defence and his officials to discuss the structures and the proposed regulations governing the way the association will operate.  Nothing could be more open and democratic than that and I reject <Col N="1409" /> some of the suggestions to the contrary. The people who will be given a mandate by every member of the Defence Force will be parties to the formulation of the regulations to govern the conduct of the association in direct talks with the Minister and his officials.  There will be no pre-empting of the situation and the way the regulations have been drawn up is quite correct.  This will be the task of the elected representatives, in consultation and negotiation with the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Another concern of the members of the Defence Forces is the question of full, open and democratic discussion.  On the point about whether there should be one or two associations and whether it should include NCOs and men together, the need is for flexibility.  There should be consultation with the members and nothing should be imposed from general staff.  I am sure the Minister will accept that and I do not think there will be any difficulty with it.  Another matter of concern is how these representative associations should be organised geographically. That is covered by the communication sent out by the Chief of Staff. Will the associations be based on Army commands or units or in different barracks throughout the country? That is something we need to know.  It underlines the extent to which nothing has been preempted. All the key issues affecting the establishment of the associations will be agreed later.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the point made earlier that I do not believe there is any desire within the Army to create any type of trade union organisation.  What the members want is to have their grievances aired and dealt with and no more.  One other matter which concerns them is the question of the level of deduction which will be made to fund the organisation but, again, I suspect that matter would be more appropriately dealt with by the association than by anything we do here.</P>
    <P>The whole question of redress of wrongs causes some difficulty in the sense that it is quite possible for somebody who has been wronged to find that a person with a vested interest is dealing with his <Col N="1410" /> case.  That is my understanding of the matter but i am open to correction on it. Certainly given some of the events that have taken place in this House in the past few weeks, it would be very wise to have an outside arbitrator adjudicate on the redress of wrongs.  Possibly people who are very close to the situation are not the best people to deal with it.</P>
    <P>When all the facts are conveyed to the various members of the Defence Forces they will realise that the proposed system is fair and reasonable.  I think they have gone a long way towards realising it already through the efforts of the Minister. The elected representatives will have a full say in all the pertinent matters relating to the proposed associations, the regulations governing them and the matters which the associations can deal with, including pay, allowances, grants, pensions and conditions in general.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Defence, Deputy Lenihan, on the way he has approached the task of establishing the representative associations for the Army and for facilitating the fullest consultation possible in doing so.  Having considered the proposals in detail and having been sensitive and sympathetic to the legitimate grievances of members of the Defence Forces, my party are satisfied that the mechanisms put in place for the holding of elections and providing a basis for negotiation and discussion on the role and functions of the proposed associations are reasonable and satisfactory. I am sure the fullest consultations will continue in an atmosphere of co-operation and that nobody will take up entrenched positions.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate aspects of this matter over the past 12 months has been that there was not enough talking.  I realise the sensitivities in talking at official level but there was not a lot of talking in this case.  One of the things we can learn about the way we conduct our affairs in general &mdash; and this relates to Northern Ireland matters &mdash; is that the more talking we do the better we understand one another and from there we can make some progress.  I was appalled last May to meet ladies whose husbands are <Col N="1411" /> in the Defence Forces and to listen to them cry about what was happening to their husbands, the difficulties they were having in trying to provide for their families and educate them and in trying to live any sort of reasonable and decent life.  That should be the entitlement of every citizen and most certainly of those people who have served the country well over so many years and still have so much to offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to be associated with the welcome expressed to the Minister on his return to this House.  I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution on this very important legislation which provides for the setting up of the first representative association for members of the Defence Forces.  The legislation is long overdue.  It follows the initiative of the Government in July of last year when these proposals were first mooted. Representative groups will be established on the basis of election by secret ballot and full supervision.</P>
      <P>I understand the provisions in the Bill are similar to those already in operation with regard to the Garda Síochána.  In recent months I have been approached by a number of concerned members of the Defence Forces where, up to some time ago, there was wholesale confusion. I accept the point made by the Minister when he said: &ldquo;To avoid doubt I wish to add here that the formal establishment of the association and the making of the relevant Defence Force regulations will not take place until after the consultations and dialogue, to which I have previously referred, and the various issues involved have been resolved&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister that before finalising the legislation the relevant and positive views of the ordinary members of the Defence Forces be taken into account.  It is important that they are satisfied that they have a representative voice in the proposed body.  It has been alleged over a long period that no consultation has taken place.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has set in train a <Col N="1412" /> system of dialogue with regard to this new process and that he is making every effort to involve all those members affected by the new system.  I am satisfied he will continue along this line.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the armed forces and the Government is most important.  For this reason we, as legislators, must at all times be positive and behave responsibly.  Again, I have no doubt that we will.  The Minister has already indicated that he wants a co-operative approach to the Bill and has made it clear that the very last thing he wants to do is impose structures which are not acceptable.  I hope the structures established under the Bill will accommodate the need for representation in the Defence Forces which will lead to outlets where members can express their views and opinions and have a say on pay and related matters.  I am satisfied therefore that the proposed machinery meets the needs of the Defence Forces and also provides for conciliation and arbitration. Provision should be made for further consultation before it is finally put in place.</P>
    <P>We can be very proud of our Defence Forces who have already proved their worth both at home and abroad, such as in the Congo and elsewhere.  I have no doubt the most intelligent and competent representatives will be selected to represent the ordinary members of the force and that these new associations will prove themselves to be most co-operative and positive and bring honour to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I congratulate the Minister for the time and effort he has put into this Bill.  He has the complete confidence of the ordinary members of the Defence Forces and I am sure he will take into account their many submissions to him before the Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Seanad for the very constructive way it has approached this debate in which all the important matters were touched on by various Senators.  I would just like to put one or two things into perspective and emphasise my approach to the Bill which I think <Col N="1413" /> the Seanad appreciates.  First, it is important to keep in mind that this is an enabling Bill, which provides for the type of consultation that everybody agrees is so necessary.  If this was not an enabling Bill, incorporating all the various suggestions being made here, it would then be a Bill imposing various matters upon the members of the Defence Forces.  What I am seeking to do in the Bill is provide the enabling framework within which the regulations can be made providing for the establishment of the representative bodies.  All of the details with regard to the establishment of these bodies should be worked out in consultation with the elected representatives of the Defence Forces personnel.  It is they who are the important people to be consulted.  We in the Oireachtas have to provide the framework within which the election can take place and the representative bodies can be established.  Their mandate can be spelt out in detail in the regulations.  The format of the structures to be put in place not just for today or tomorrow but for a substantial period of time, can be embodied in the regulations to be drawn up after consultation.  That is the important difference.</P>
      <P>Amendments have been tabled here, as in the other House, which seek to incorporate in the Bill matters which will be included in the regulations in the Bill. I do not think they are suitable for incorporation in the Bill.  I am giving a guarantee here in principle that these matters will be included in the regulations, the details to be worked out with the representatives themselves.  We would do the representatives of the men and the Defence Forces personnel themselves a great disservice if we decide to pre-empt here what is good for them.  What I am saying is that we should let them come forward for consultation with the official side and work out the details and when they have been formulated, they can incorporate in the regulations setting up the structures under which the representatives of the Defence Forces personnel will work.  That is a much more satisfactory way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> I wish to emphasise there is no difference between us in principle in terms of what should or should not be included in the mandate of the representative bodies.  All matters relating to pay, conditions of service, welfare, housing, health, recreation and credit may be incorporated in the regulations.  Such matters are incorporated in the regulations under the Garda code setting up their representative bodies.  We are going to do precisely the same for the Defence Forces.  They have worked very well in the case of the Garda representative bodies which were established under enabling legislation that is almost on all fours with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that if we start to put matters into the legislation that we feel are good and proper we would be pre-empting what may come from the representatives of the men themselves. In assuming that role here within the Oireachtas we would prevent consultation taking place.  What I want to do is provide a flexible framework within which consultation can take place.  That was exactly the approach taken in the case of the Garda representative bodies and it worked very well.</P>
    <P>I wish to give a guarantee here, as I did in the other House, that the regulations, the details of which are to be worked out, will incorporate all matters which all interested bodies and I agreed should be incorporated in regulations following the establishment of the Garda representative bodies.</P>
    <P>There are a number of such matters. I have mentioned the range of welfare matters and services which will be of concern to the representative bodies.  There is also the question of whether there should be one body for the men and NCOs and one body for the officers.  That appears to be the preferred option.  I have an open mind on that matter but it seems that is the way in which the bodies interested in this matter are proceeding, and I would go along with that.</P>
    <P>Discussions are taking place at present between the returning officer, Mr. Timothy Sexton, a principal officer in the Department of the Environment, and the <Col N="1415" /> interested parties within the Defence Forces with a view to setting up the mechanism for the election which I would hope to have ready in a matter of weeks following discussion.  All sides are agreed that after the election the parties concerned, senior Army headquarters people, the Department of Defence and the elected representatives, should get down to working out the details of the matters in connection with which Senator Ryan has put down some amendments. Before Senator Ryan came in I explained that there is no difference between us. We can discuss his amendments on Committee Stage, but it boils down to a question of whether the matters should be incorporated in the regulations or in the legislation.  I am strongly of the view that they should be incorporated in the regulations.  This would provide a more flexible instrument and would be of greater service to the men who could from time to time, add to the list of welfare areas or amend or improve the existing list of welfare areas.  All in all, they will have in the regulations a flexible instrument within which they can operate the administration of their representation mandate over the wide area of pay, conditions and a whole range of welfare areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to how they should be run, as I have assured everybody concerned in the other House this will be an independent body within the fullest meaning of that word.  They will be independent of Army command when it comes to specific matters within their mandate.  Army command, discipline and all these matters are an essential aspect of Army administration but, within their mandate, it is the representative bodies who will have authority.  In the other House Deputy Bell was very strongly of the view that command and discipline should be kept strictly apart &mdash; and this is written into the legislation &mdash; from pay, conditions of service and welfare. PDFORRA have made it quite clear that that is the way they want it too.</P>
    <P>Other aspects that will form part of the regulations are the manner in which the <Col N="1416" /> secretariat will be established, the freedom to take on outside experts, the idea of having, as the Garda Síochána have, a location in an outside barracks, if they wish, and access to the media.  Of course, under their constitution they are guaranteed access to the media and now they will be guaranteed access to the media once this Bill becomes law &mdash; there will be no further doubt about that.  This access can be decided by way of regulation or part of a regulation.  The representatives of the men will be concerned about how, and in what circumstances the appointed spokesman can make his presentation or report to the media on a whole range of issues. They will decide how to do this.  I hope they will have the very same authority as the Garda representative bodies when it comes to their spokesmen having access to the media.  There can be no question of any curtailment of that right, which is a free right under the Constitution. Details may have to be worked out to the satisfaction of everybody concerned but that matters which come within the compass of the representatives can be worked out in consultation and incorporated in the regulations.  This is a matter that cannot be written into legislation and if you try, you will be restricting the regulations.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I do not want to write into legislation anything that might pre-empt the process of consultation that will take place with the representatives of the men because it is after that process of consultation that the agreed views will be incorporated in the regulations.  If we try to limit that process by writing in a range of restrictions into the legislation, we will inevitably get into trouble, because (a) we will be pre-empting consultation and (b) no matter how brilliant we are here in the Seanad, we will not be in a position to put down an exhaustive list that will cover every option and requirement.  Inevitably something will be left out and this will create chaos.  It is much more straightforward in legislation of this kind &mdash; this was the approach adopted with the Garda representative body &mdash; to provide the <Col N="1417" /> enabling framework and then to let the consultation process start with the elected representative prior to devising the agreed structures and manner in which the associations can operate.  As regards access to the media all these details can be worked out and incorporated in regulations.  The representatives of the men are the people best fitted to do this and it would be a mistake for us to get into that.</P>
    <P>I know the intention is good.  I am not disputing Senator Ryan's intention nor did I dispute the intention of people in the other House who sought to write many of these matters into the legislation. I agree with the Senator but I think in everybody's interests, particularly the representatives of the men, it is much better that they should be party to that because they know best.  Irrespective of what may have happened in regard to consultation in the past &mdash; I am not going into that &mdash; as far as the future is concerned, it is very important that when it comes to the nitty-gritty of how the associations are to be established and the manner in which they will function, the representatives of the men are fully involved.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the level of funding. Members of PDFORRA and other people interested in having representation for Defence Force personnel were very keen that a degree of independence would be given to these bodies by enabling them to establish their own funding arrangements.  That is conceded, that is sensible.  I gave guarantees in the other House that we would help them officially by providing them with accommodation and other facilities.  There are plenty of ways in which we can help officially within the Army structure, but without prejudice to their capacity to raise additional funds for additional purposes, this may not be covered at official level.  That is the way the Garda representative body work.  In some respects they get help at official level and in other respects they get help by way of subscriptions raised by themselves. However, this is a matter which can be worked out in the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> The most important innovation in this Bill &mdash; this part did not come in for much comment in the Seanad &mdash; is the provision of conciliation and arbitration.  If this system was not established at this time much of the good in setting up representative bodies would be dissipated.  While the setting up of representative bodies merely to make representations, etc. is desirable in the interests of public relations, letting off steam, as it were, it does not have any concrete end product unless there is a system of conciliation and arbitration in place.  One can make all the representations in the world but when it comes to the point of not making any progress, it is essential that there is a system of conciliation in place to try to achieve progress and, if that fails then an arbitration system.  In that way there is a guarantee that the end product of all the discussions and the representations will be some findings by way of the ultimate arbitration system.  That is exactly how the system has operated in regard to the whole of the public service and, in particular, the Garda Síochána.  This system has worked out in a very practical way and is really the most important matter in the legislation.  If I were asked to put my finger on the most important matter in the legislation I would say the conciliation and arbitration scheme because it takes out of the Bill the talking shop category and makes it real.</P>
    <P>If in addition to a representative body structure or structures we have a functioning system of conciliation and arbitration &mdash; that is the whole purpose of the Bill and will be a major part of the regulations when they are established &mdash; it will give real teeth to the whole process. This means that this Bill and the whole process will mean something at the end of the day as far as the men are concerned. This right they are now being given has been enjoyed by the rest of the public service for some time.  It means that the Defence Forces have now really come under the umbrella of the whole C and A system, which has been accepted as valid for the public service, including the Garda Síochána.  This has now been extended to them and they will have their <Col N="1419" /> own specific conciliation and arbitration system relating to their requirements.</P>
    <P>Another aspect commented on related to the association's relationships with other bodies and trade unions.  Here again the association will be independent and that is very important, but it will not be debarred from such affiliation or association provided it is done with the consent of the Minister.  It is legitimate that the Minister should be involved in any such approval of their association witho outside bodies because the Minister, on behalf of the Oireachtas, carries the ultimate responsibility of overall authority in regard to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are an important constitutional entity within the State and it is important that if a group within the Defence Forces affiliates with outside bodies such outside bodies should have the approval of the Minister.  There are plenty of outside bodies that would obviously get approval automatically, for example, specialised areas within the Army and trades areas.  Electricians or engineers may want to be members of outside bodies related to electricians or engineers and that is perfectly legitimate. Any association of that kind would obviously get approval.  However, as Deputy Bell pointed out in the other House, there are other areas where association with such bodies may run counter to the national interest.  This will be so only in exceptional cases and then it should be for the Minister to look at the matter and tease out whether it is desirable that such an association or affiliation should take place.  There is nothing more to it than the requirement of the consent of the Minister which is perfectly legitimate.  The independence of the association is emphasised.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise something else. The word that is now used in certain circumstances is &ldquo;suspension&rdquo;, not &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; as Senator Costello said.  We changed that on Report Stage in the Dáil. The Senator may have been looking at an older copy of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In section 2 one should read subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) together. <Col N="1420" /> They seek to ensure that once these bodies have been established by way of elections, like the Garda representative bodies &mdash; we will assume now that it is one body for the officers and one body for the other ranks &mdash; that they be given a certain statutory legitimacy, in other words, supported by legislation and regulation. These sections are designed to prevent a proliferation of such bodies after this becomes law.  If this is not prevented there is a danger of frustrating the progress we are trying to make.  By leaving the way open to all sorts of bodies to establish subsequently one is obviously opening the door to a state of anarchy. However bad it is not to have representation, it would be highly undesirable to allow representative bodies in every barracks and unit in the country.</P>
    <P>What is proposed is in ease of the legitimate elected body.  Everybody who has an interest in it, including the PDFORRA people who have shown themselves to be interested in it, will see the importance of that.  On a first reading it appears to be against civil liberty that we should be legislating here and determining that there should not be other bodies but it is in protection of the legitimate body or bodies we will be establishing that we are setting out these rules. There is no point in having all sorts of other bodies in the Defence Forces and claiming to represent men in relation to pay and conditions and various other matters.  The trade union movement have proven the legitimacy of the idea of one big union and have made tremendous progress towards that in amalgamations that are proceeding at present.  One of the weaknesses in the Irish trade union movement over the years was a proliferation of unions.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Forces it is highly desirable that the bodies that are being established now by statute speak with one cohesive voice, that there is one cohesive organisation speaking for the NCOs and the men on the one hand and one cohesive body speaking on behalf of the officers and that we do not leave the door open to a proliferation of such bodies and a <Col N="1421" /> state of anarchy in regard to representation. I want to emphasise that because it has come in for a certain amount of misrepresentation largely, out of misunderstanding.  Senator Costello in particular emphasised that aspect. Deputy Bell in the other House has a certain amount of experience in this area. As a member of the Defence Forces of long standing and of a trade union, he understood it perfectly and made some very valuable contributions on this aspect in the other House.</P>
    <P>In general the Bill is an enabling one. Issues arising will be dealt with by way of regulations after consultation.  I am thankful to the House for the way they have addressed the matter here today because it means we can make progress without rushing the Bill through.  Already we have initiated talks on the election with the various representatives who are at the moment discussing the details of the election process with the principal officer of the Franchise Section of the Department of the Environment. Immediately after that we will go into the preparation of the regulations and there should not be too much difficulty in that because over the whole range of pay and the definition of pay and remuneration, conditions of service, welfare matters and conciliation and arbitration, there is very little difference between us and any of the spokesmen for the interested bodies in the Defence Forces.  There is practically complete agreement.</P>
    <P>As I said initially, we have now practically reached agreement on the fact that there should be one body for privates and NCOs and one body for officers.  I would see the regulations being devised fairly quickly and all of this in operation in a matter of months after the election which could take place weeks after the passage of the legislation.  That is the sort of timetable I envisage and that, linked with the conclusions of the Gleeson Commission which should be to hand in June, should mean that by autumn this year we should be in a positive position in regard to the representative bodies and the implementation of pay and conditions of service appropriate to our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> I am glad it has taken this turn because for a while, due to misunderstanding, there was a certain lack of communication on the matter.  We have surmounted that hurdle now and everybody recognises that we are going somewhere. It is very important that we do so on a totally apolitical plane because this is a national matter rather than a party political matter.  I emphasise that here.</P>
    <P>The state of health of the Defence Forces is basic to any civilised society and particularly to our own because they have important roles <i>vis-á-vis</i> their aid to the civil power here.  They will always have an important role in backing the State on the Northern Ireland problem.  They will always be an essentail element here more than in most other countries.  There has been a traditional attachment between the armed forces and the community, a traditional regard and mutual respect. Too much that is valuable has been built up over the years to dissipate and we are not going to allow it to be dissipated.  It is on the rails now through the process of consultation that has commenced and that will succeed.</P>
    <P>I am thankful to the Oireachtas for enabling this Bill to go through in a constructive manner.  I can assure them that it will not be long-fingered.  Having helped to create the climate that is there now, I am most anxious that the matter be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible and that the matters we are discussing here will be resolved so that the niche which has been established by the Defence Forces for themselves can be there on a permanent basis by having satisfied Defence Forces in tune with the public and not at odds in any way with us here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, with the Government of the day or with the public at large.  It is most important that the Defence Forces be integrated into the community and be given due recognition for that fact.  I hope when this Bill becomes law and in particular when the regulations come into effect that recognition will be seen to be real and will bear fruit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This arose in the other House but I did not trouble this House by putting down an amendment on it. What operation does not involve a definition of a military task?  There are many tasks of a non-military kind in which the Defence Forces are involved. The absence of the word &ldquo;military&rdquo; before &ldquo;task&rdquo; seems to broaden the definition of an operation well beyond national security.  There are many tasks in which the Defence Forces are involved, among them, for instance, providing an emergency bus service if we have a transport strike.  I do not think national security is in the least bit involved in an issue like that.  I cannot see why in that case we have to have a definition of a task undertaken by the Defence Forces which does not make it clear.  We are simply talking about what they have to do as a military force because that is where the whole issue of national security and the difficulties of legislation like this arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;member&rdquo; means an officer, a non-commissioned officer, private or seaman of the Defence Forces.  Does it include members of the Air Corps?  In relation to a question I asked &mdash; I do not know whether I was out for a minute or whether the Minister replied on Second Stage &mdash; what is the position regarding the people who serve from time to time with the FCA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan) The Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)">
      <NameTxt>The Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo; covers the <Col N="1424" /> FCA and the Naval Service.  It relates to an officer, non-commissioned officer, private or seaman of the Defence Forces. That covers Air Corps, Naval Service, Army, both the front line and the reserve, and the FCA.  I am anxious to emphasise that it includes the Air Corps as well.  The Air Corps and the Army are linked in our system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked about the definition of &ldquo;operation&rdquo;.  Any task undertaken by the Defence Forces in the discharge of their duties is an operation. It can be regarded as a military operation, a non-military operation or whatever other objective you wish to put before it, but it is an operation when it is a task undertaken by them as part of their duties.  The duties of the Defence Forces can be multifarious and have been so under our systems.  They have come to the aid of the civil power over a whole range of areas connected with natural and other disasters, in the case of the provision of emergency services where there are refuse or electricity strikes from time to time, be they accidents or an act of God.  Their duties also relate to a fire, or road blockages caused by storms.  An infinite range of emergencies arise from time to time in which the State, the local authority or even the community call on the Army to come immediately to their aid.  Army personnel engaged in those tasks are carrying out an operation.  The tasks undertaken by Defence personnel are part of the military code.  They come under the heading of aid to the civil power and cover a very wide range of duties. That definition could not be more simple and appropriate.  If it is defined in any other way, it might lead people to differentiate between tasks.  Members of the Defence Forces are not any the less soldiers, Naval Service personnel or Air Corps personnel because they are participating in non-military tasks.  They are participating in an operation in discharge of their duties even though they may not be defined strictly in our meaning of the word &ldquo;military&rdquo;.  They are not, in other words, engaged in warfare but in tasks in the discharge of their duties and that is <Col N="1425" /> an operation.  In the course of such operation, they are primarily within the whole range of aid to the civil power.  In that whole range of duties they are engaged in operations in discharge of their duties. That is a straightforward as I can put it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely happy with those comments.  I have a feeling the Minister might not be entirely happy either but that is not for me to judge.  As the Minister said, the Defence Forces are there to help out in emergencies of a natural disaster kind.  Why should the associations being set up be precluded from having a view on such operations? The problem about operation is that, in section 2, matters relating to any operation are excluded from the remit of the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what PDFORRA want.  Nobody sane could seriously suggest that we should bring them into any area covered by what the Senator has drawn attention to including any operation, relating to the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation or discipline of the Defence Forces.  In the first page of their submission PDFORRA ask that all those matters be excluded from their remit. Nobody wants that whole area which covers them in operating on non-military duties in aid of the civil power to be included in their remit.  They are still acting as members of the Defence Forces and are part of a military operation, even though they may not be engaged in a military task.  They are still subject to military discipline and command.  This point was made in the other House by Deputy Bell of the Labour Party who supported me on this point.  He said in emergency cases it is more important that members of the Defence Forces react in a military-type manner, that they react to command and discipine and do it swiftly and quickly and immediately without any consultation.  It should be a question of &ldquo;go&rdquo; in an emergency or an urgent situation.  It is precisely in these situations or contingencies that Army personnel must act with the maximum haste, <Col N="1426" /> expedition and immediacy, all of which means acting under military command and direction and control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Garda have to do precisely the same in a situation like that, and the Garda Representative Association are not precluded from talking about the way matters like that are dealt with.  They are not precluded from representing their members if those members have the view that certain things are being run very badly.  They are not precluded from communicating with the public that things like that are being done very badly.  The unique thing about the Defence Forces and the reason they are specifically referred to in the Constitution is the right to use arms on our behalf.  The unique thing which makes the Defence Forces different from any body in our society, is the fact that they can use arms and are trained to use arms on our behalf.  In every other way they are another disciplined force carrying out an operation, like the Garda.  The Garda Síochána Act, 1977, says that the association represent members of the Garda Síochána on all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency.  I like the use of the word &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; and I used it on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand what is wrong with an organisation which represents members of the Defence Forces being allowed to comment on the efficiency of many areas of operation of the Defence Forces.  I am not talking about people saying there will have to be a mass meeting of the Defence Forces in order to decide if a certain operation will be done or not.  That has never happened in the Garda Síochána.  I do not believe it has ever happened in the fire services and there is no reason to suspect it would happen in the Army.  There is an excessive narrowing.  If PDFORRA think differently, that is their view.  I have a view of what people should be allowed to do in their own organisations.  This is my own opinion, I am not here as a lobbyist for PDFORRA.  They have quite clear objectives and they are happy that many <Col N="1427" /> of their objectives have been achieved. That does not get away from the fact that I would like to know why in non-military operations the Army must be treated differently from the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>We must remember the context of this, we are talking about the security forces of which the Garda, the prison officers and the Army are all part, and I must agree with my colleague, Senator Ryan, that this section is unnecessarily restrictive.  In fact, one of the major criticisms of the entire Bill, is that there are restrictions on just about everything.  As we will see in the next couple of amendments, there are restrictions in relation to regulations.  The parameters are so restrictive.  There is no good reason that a representative association should be prohibited from commenting ona matter that their members should be involved in.  Surely it would be relevant for a representative organisation to have the authority to express an opinion on an emergency operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, there are other matters that are prohibited as well, in relation to organisation and discipline.  This is allowed in the Garda force, who are equally at the cutting edge of security, and likewise the prison officers.  To quote the PDFORRA as the imprimatur, or for that matter my colleague in the other House, Deputy Bell, is not relevant so let us deal with the matter in this House. The Minister should look at the merit of the issues rather than quoting some authority.  PDFORRA is not quoted as an authority later on down the line.  In fact, a lot of this Bill is directed against PDFORRA so it is hardly putting the <Col N="1428" /> stamp of acceptability on them because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Shall I say that this Bill makes it illegal for any other organisation to exist and it hits out very strongly against the possibility of any trade unionism entering the association.

      <P>I am surprised at Senators Ryan and Costello being so very niggardly in relation to this aspect.  As the Minister has said, they are a military organisation and irrespective of what Senator Ryan might say about whether the members of the Defence Forces should have consultation about different things, in an emergency they have to act as the Minister said, as a military force and in a military fashion.  It is extremely important that that would be there.  If the facility was given to them to have consultation, there would be an ongoing difficulty with the whole situation. PDFORRA, who are the people who have been at pains over a considerable period of time in seeking representation, are quite satisfied with it and I do not understand the attitude of Senators Ryan and Costello.  I am surprised at Senator Costello's comment on Deputy Bell, who is a member of the Labour Party, as is Senator Costello.  Surely they have a particular attitude in relation to this subject?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the case was so self-evident that I just brought in the <Col N="1429" /> other supporting views to emphasise it. It is quite evident that this lies at the core of the whole thing.  The Bill is about legitimising activities of a representative body or bodies in relation of pay, condition of service, and a whole range of welfare matters, while preserving the whole purpose of Defence Forces as it has always been, the military organisation available to this State, to act in military matters in defence of the country, to combat subversion, to act in aid of the civil power and on various UN duties and so on.  These are military matters that are under the command of the State, the Minister for Defence, on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are in control of this and it is to our advantage as a civilised society that we have military forces at our command to act in a disciplined way at the request of the Minister of the day, who does so on behalf of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The core and ethos of the Defence Forces in this and in every other democratic country, is discipline and command. Nobody in their senses would suggest otherwise.  I find it amazing.  I did not think I would have to defend this here.  That is why I mentioned the other people who obviously supported me in this matter.  It should be self-evident to any parliamentarian that this area must be reserved for the Defence Forces, and it is so reserved in every country in the world, particularly in democratic countries where we want the Defence Forces under our command to be able to act expeditiously and urgently in certain situations.  This is what democracy is all about.  It is not about bringing the Defence Forces to a state of anarchy; it is having the Defence Forces, under a legislative framework and under the Constitution, available to preserve and enhance democracy and make it effective. At the end of the day we must get to the nub of the matter which resides in this whole command and discipline area. The Defence Forces have to be able to act in the interests of society and are given very serious powers to do so such as the power to kill in certain circumstances and also the power to act under command <Col N="1430" /> and discipline without questioning.  If they do not have these powers to deal with serious situations then they are not a Defence Force at all.  I have gone into a very deep philosophical area that I did not think I would have to go into because, as I have said, it should be self-evident to anybody who qualifies for membership of this or the other House that it should not be up for discussion at all.</P>

      <P>I was not going to say any more but after that little exercise from the Minister I will have to say something. First of all it is a bit much to talk about democracy in this House after what happened last week.</P>

      <P>Secondly, to talk about the qualifications of membership of this House after last week is a bit much, too. There seems to be no basic qualifications for Members of this House any more.  I simply am not going to be diverted away from a question to which I think there is an answer.  In reality for most of the time in this country the brunt of violence is taken by the Garda.  They deal with riots and have been badly injured in the process. They have dealt with most of the armed subversion in this country and have been injured and killed in the process. They are the people who deal with bank robberies in which violence is used. In all those cases the Garda act in an organised, and hopefully efficient way, and they use weapons etc. on our behalf. I cannot see why gardaí are perfectly entitled to be members of an association which can comment on the merits or demerits of any of those operations while, at the same time the organisation which represents the Permanent Defence Forces is precluded from talking about any operations.  I do not see why a body representing the ranks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be unhelpful.  I am simply trying to find out if there is a clear legislative distinction.  I know what an army is supposed to do and I think our Army do their work remarkably well but I am a little concerned about the apparent scepticism about the capacity of members of the Defence Forces to respond in a disciplined fashion simply because the organisation that represents them can talk about matters that might affect the welfare of their members, which impinge on some areas of operation.  I am happy to accept, with some reservations, that matters relating to the raising, maintenance, command, constitution or organisation of the discipline of the Defence Forces may well present problems but I am not at all clear as to why the word &ldquo;operations&rdquo; has to encompass everything people do under the Defence Acts.  Let me remind the House that an amendment to this effect was put down in the other House by Deputy McCartan from The Workers' Party to insert the word &ldquo;military&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;task&rdquo; in section 1 and I do not see anything unreasonable in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the difference between the Army and the Garda.  I know the difference between what they need to do in times of civil unrest and I know what an Army is for but I cannot see why an organisation representing members of the Defence Forces should not be allowed to talk about the way the forces are organised in the same way as do the Garda representative association.  I do not think we should let the mystique of the Army walk us into too many restrictions on what I accept is well-intentioned legislation.  I resent suggestions that the fact that I raise the issue implies an unfitness, either in my intellectual capacity or my sanity, to participate in the workings <Col N="1432" /> of this House.  I would not like to cast aspersions on the similar qualifications of an aspiring presidential candidate because it would be very improper.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I will not get involved in an exchange of invective.  I believe that the rights of the citizen to participate in independent associations is not in conflict with their responsibilities to the State.  In my view, the Garda or their association have never used industrial action to avoid taking great risks on our behalf, to avoid doing things that the rest of us would not like to have to do. To suggest that their organisation could not represent and talk about their interests even in non-military operations, is unfair to the members of the Defence Forces.  I am simply saying that in so far as possible they should have similar rights to other parts of the security forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to labour this point any further but I would remind the Minister that it is not so long ago since his predecessor said it was self-evident that the existence of a representative association would undermine the Defence Forces and that it could not be tolerated.  He said there could not be a representative body for the Defence Forces.  The Minister is now telling us that something in this Bill is self-evident. I am just as bemused as Senator Ryan about what the Minister has described as self-evident.  He has been overbearingly dismissive about the real issue.  As has been pointed out, there is a parallel with the other areas of the security forces who have the opportunity to discuss openly in public, at their conventions and so on, matters that concern them in relation to their operations.  To simply say that they will not be allowed to have an opinion, or if they are allowed to have an opinion and express it, that it would undermine the security forces is rather presumptuous on the Minister's part.  They are citizens and they are entitled to the rights of citizens.  When we restrict those <Col N="1433" /> rights we must do so only for the gravest of reasons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 27, after &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;housing, welfare, health, education, training and related issues&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think we will probably have a somewhat calmer discussion on this issue.  The first thing that needs to be said is that section 2 contains a fundmental and much welcomed change in our attitude to the Defence Forces.  It contains the provision that an association may be set up which will represent the members of the Defence Forces.  That is a good thing and is to be welcomed.  Anything I have to say about amending the section is meant to add to that and not in any way take away from the fact that the Minister has produced such a section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Act defines what a Garda representative association can do for the purpose of representing the members of the Garda Síochána in all matters affecting their welfare and effeciency. This is an extraordinarily broad definition by comparison with the almost painstaking exclusions of certain areas from the present section.  Without going into another long discussion, there are certain areas of military operations which much be excluded from the ambit of concern and operation of a representative association.  That is a hypothesis that I accept but do not agree with.  I cannot see why we cannot have fully functioning trade union representation inside the Army.  The implication that membership of a trade union would somehow make a person a less loyal member of the Defence Forces is quite offensive to trade <Col N="1434" /> unionists.  The implication is that somehow, in certain delicate areas, if people are in a union they will not perform as well as if they were not in a union.  I find that implication, which is contained in a lot of these qualifications, rather difficult to accept but I will accept it for the sake of argument.</P>
    <P>There is a very narrow and limited view of what a representative body or, as I would prefer to call it, a Defence Forces' trade union should be talking about.  The amendment I have proposed which, reads &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;housing, welfare, health, education, training and related issues&rdquo; is by no means a comprehensive amendment. What I am attempting to do is put in an amendment consistent with the spirit of section 2 but which elaborates on those areas on which members of the Defence Forces trade union would be free to comment. There are two responses the Minister can give me.  The first is that he will make regulations concerning some of these and the second is that some of these somehow impinge on the efficient performance of the Defence Forces.  I fail to see why it cannot be explicity written down.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by the Minister on Second Stage, in a comprehensive and fairly generous reply which covered most of the issues raised, that there are many matters which are best dealt with by way of negotiation, agreement and subsequent regulation.  I have no problems with that but there are principles, out of which regulations can spring, which ought to be incorporated in legislation. I have been led to understand by the Minister that it is intended that such an association would be able to talk not only about matters such as the quality of housing but also about the welfare of members, and not welfare as defined in the Minister's speech but welfare in the sense of their conditions of service and the way they are treated, about a host of issues that could arise, the way they are dealt with and about abuses of power and position within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> Trade unions exist in every organisation. The reasons I, Senator Costello and indeed Senator McKenna, who is in the same trade union as myself, are members of trade unions are, first of all we want them to deal with the question of remuneration and second to protect us from anybody in a superior position who would be inclined to misuse their power <i>vis-à-vis</i> ourselves.  It is pointless to pretend that there will not be a misuse of power within the Defence Forces.  It is a human organisation, just like every other organisation.  Therefore, it is necessary that, in terms of the welfare of individuals, the representative body have the right to make representations on those issues.  In relation to the question of health and safety at work, there is no reason to presume that somehow the Defence Forces should have to operate in living and work conditions or in terms of their dealing with dangerous substances or anything else, which are not covered to the extent that they can be by health and safety at work regulations.  It is quite proper that a representative body should be able to make vigorous representations about those matters.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the extension of employment equality legislation to the Defence Forces.  Will the association the Minister has in mind be legitimately able to argue this question?  We then go on to the education that members of the Defence Forces receive within the Defence Forces and the educational qualifications needed.  These are all matters which are interlinked with the welfare of the members.  It just cannot be confined to credit unions, medical benefits and similar matters.  The definition of proper remuneration includes both pay and other ancillary benefits.  People are not only concerned about their level of pay but also about the training they receive. Therefore, it is quite clear education and training are issues that ought to be on the agenda for any representative association.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not tell me that somehow the security of the State will be undermined if a Garda or Army <Col N="1436" /> representative association can talk about the welfare, health, education, training and housing needs of their members.  If the Minister is going to tell me that these will be covered in the regulations I would also like him to tell me why he thinks that matters such as housing, welfare, health, education, training and related issues, &ldquo;and such other matters as the Minister may specify&rdquo; should not be included in the legislation?  This seems to leave too much power in the hands of the Minister and too little in the legislation.  A balance has to be struck.  The Minister believes in broadly based regulations but that is a bad idea and not necessarily the best way to draft legislation.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment I wish to point out that this should not be just a body who talks about pay and related issues but a body to represent the interests of members in every area except military discipline and the taking of commands, which we accept in the same way as the Garda accept that they must obey the instructions of their superior officer and act accordingly.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything Senator Ryan has said on this matter. Our amendments are closely related. Section 2 (1) is unnecessarily restrictive in that it specifies that the association can also deal with one matter and that is remuneration.  Side by side with the question of remuneration comes the question of conditions.  Pay and conditions are the necessary combination of activities that any association representing the interests and welfare of members should be dealing with.  I believe categorically that these should be spelled out in this section.  As Senator Ryan pointed out, housing, welfare, health, education and training are in fact issues which affect people's lives and they too should be mentioned.  Pay and conditions, which are traditionally the functions of any representative organisation, are the minimum that should be provided for in section 2 (1). I am rather unhappy with the present wording.  The Minister has proposed that it refers only to remuneration and &ldquo;such <Col N="1437" /> other matters&rdquo; and gratuitously inserts in brackets &ldquo;if any&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take it the point has been made.  While I am delighted to note that it has been deleted, this does not take from the substance of the issue we are debating, namely, that the regulations should specify at this point the basic principles under which this association will work.  I have been very critical of the Bill in terms of the discretion being given to the Minister to decide first of all, in relation to the regulations, whether an association or associations should be established.  We would certainly like to know how many there will be, if there will be more than one, and also something more definite about the nature of that body.  The minimum that should be written into this section is a reference not just to remuneration but also to employment and other conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what the Senators are concerned about in relation to this issue.  The Minister indicated earlier that the regulations will include all of those matters to which they have referred.  As the Senator said earlier on, the Minister is specific on what should be excluded but if one wishes to be specific about what should be included, then one could end up having a multiplicity of things included.  This could present a difficulty in relation to the Defence Forces because it could be argued quite simply that because one single issue has not been covered it cannot be discussed.  The Bill specifies what may not be discussed or considered by the representative association but the Minister has indicated that he is quite prepared to negotiate on all the other points being made.  The amendment would be a limiting factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can reassure the House in relation to this <Col N="1438" /> matter.  The booklet which he sent out specifies pay and related matters, conditions of service other than matters which would affect security personnel, administration, discipline, etc., welfare matters such as credit union, family support, recreational facilities, medical benefits and schemes.  I would have thought that everything apart from purely military matters was on the table and could be discussed.  This would include pay, conditions, health, education, welfare and pension provisions, safety at work and compensation for accidents.  I would have thought that all the matters specified in the amendment were already part and parcel of the section.  If the Minister had excluded any specific matter such as education, I would be concerned.  We would all be concerned if matters other than military matters were excluded.  I hope the Minister can give a categorical assurance that anything related to the general welfare of Army members or their spouses is covered.  Some members of the Defence Forces have been tragically killed while on active service at home and abroad and matters such as compensation for widows and their families must be included.</P>
      <P>There could be a danger in having the section too narrow.  I suppose the phrase &ldquo;such other matters&rdquo; can cover everything. If we specify four or five areas we might unwittingly exclude others.  I would ask the Minister to give an assurance that everything other than purely military matters can be included in the discussions on the welfare of members of the Defence Forces.  It is important that the Minister should be clear on this and should state that the matters covered in the amendments are already included within the scope of the section.  There is the danger that if the regulations were too specific they could be interpreted as excluding matters not itemised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave's interpretation is entirely correct.  The whole purpose behind the phrase &ldquo;and such other matters as the Minister may specify in the regulations&rdquo; is to make it as broad as possible.  It provides for a <Col N="1439" /> wide framework within which every conceivable welfare matter can be raised.  It would extend to matters which could arise in several years' time.  It is very inappropriate to include a list which would require definition.  The list could be interpreted as being limited.  I want this to be limitless and as open ended as possible.  It is in the interests of the representatives that it should be phrased as it is.</P>
      <P>In my letter of February last covering the proposals by the Army headquarters staff I said that the new arrangements would give members of the force a representative voice on welfare matters such as credit union, family support systems, recreational facilities and medical benefit schemes.  I did not include matters which Senators Ryan and Costello have included but they have not included all the matters which I included.  We are all trying to reach the same objective, the Senators in their amendments and I in my covering letter.  My letter did not comprehend fully the range of welfare services which I would envisage as being incorporated in regulations.  If we specify and define certain welfare services the list might be regarded as conclusive, precluding other forms of social welfare. There could be a restrictive interpretation based on precisely the matters specified in the statute.  I do not want this.  I want to provide for anything and everything that might arise now or in the future.  All legitimate welfare matters should be capable of being included in regulations.  That is my purpose.  My letter of 20 February emphasised this point and gave a list of welfare matters as an example.  It is not, however, a comprehensive list.  Neither of the two amendments is comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best way to frame the section is by leaving it as wide as possible, using the phrase &ldquo;and such other matters&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; is defined in section 1 but it would be futile to attempt to define the almost limitless range of other matters which could arise now and in the future.  Such an exercise would carry its own dangers.  It is much better that this <Col N="1440" /> matter be left to the common sense of the representatives.  They will meet to devise what is to go into the regulations, but regulations can always be amended and reviewed as time goes on.  If they feel that is necessary, it can be done.  They will be in the driving seat once the representative bodies are well established with a good secretariat to advise them. All the logic is in favour of leaving the section as it stands.  I will put into the regulations what the representatives want.  They are the best judges of the welfare matters to be included.  They are aware of the problems that may arise in regard to credit union, education, medical benefits and housing.  They know what is pertinent and relevant.  It is their area and they will be engaging in day-to-day representational activity.  The welfare area is appropriate to them rather than to us, as long as we give them the statutory framework within which to operate in conjunction with the authorities.  I hope I manifested the goodwill and trust that is there.  This is what we are about and I have often gone public in saying it here and in the other House.  The men know that is the intention and indeed the Garda representative bodies operate on this basis as well.  While agreeing fully with what the Senators are seeking to do, I suggest I am seeking to do the same thing, and more in a better and more flexible manner and in a way that is more appropriate to the particular role of these functioning representative bodies.</P>

      <P>We were talking in generalities. I accept the difficulty of detailing all these issues but the Minister is <Col N="1441" /> making it clear that they can discuss <i>inter alia</i> welfare, health, education and training. Neither my amendment nor Senator Costello's amendment is exclusive in any way because the Minister still has the power to raise other things.  What I cannot understand is how, for instance, training can be a matter for the Defence Forces representative association if the section as it stands, which does not refer to training, specifically excludes matters relating to the maintenance, command, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces.  Surely the training that members of the Defence Forces receive is part of their organisation, disciplne and maintenance?</P>

I am not claiming the Minister is misleading us but it is not at all clear that he can introduce regulations to do with training which are consistent with the Bill if he does not include words like &ldquo;training&rdquo; into the Bill.  The regulations cannot do anything or include anything that is excluded by the legislation.  The regulations are subsidiary regulations and are not a way of amending the Bill.  No provision is made in the regulations to amend the Act.  I cannot see how matters to do with, for instance, training&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not a military training course.  I am talking about training in the sense of vocational education training courses and training for apprenticeship courses.  I am talking about social training. As this is under the whole umbrella of welfare obviously it will not include military training.  Does the Senator now see the sort of morass one can get into if one starts to define all of these matters in the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the morass we could get into and that is why <Col N="1442" /> I want it included in the legislation, where it is written down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be included in the legislation if it is a difficult area.  I want to give an example.  Military training is not some sort of thing out there on its own; it is the training a person who is recruited into the armed forces receives. There may well be areas of that training which the members of the armed forces believe are inadequate.  The gardaí are perfectly free, through their representative association, to comment on the inadequacies of the training they receive and the inadequacies of the equipment that is available for training them.  Is an association like the one envisaged here going to have a similar freedom or will it be precluded from doing so by the provisions of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss that with the members themselves.  They will talk about that with us.  Training has many manifestations.  I was thinking of training in a welfare sense, for example, vocational training, apprenticeships and training for occupations.  This area of training is very important under education training.  That is precisely what I was thinking of in the welfare context. Military training is a different matter altogether; it is a matter of discipline and command.</P>
      <P>This matter should be discussed with the representatives of the men when they are duly elected.  They will see the difference quite clearly.  These men who are participating in the consultations will see that there are two types of training.  This bears out precisely why I want to retain the present wording of the Bill.  If ever an argument was made for me, this is it.  We are discussing the difference as between military training and welfare and social training.  There is an obvious difference between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the words &ldquo;such other matters the Minister may specify&rdquo;, I will put into regulation what is suggested to <Col N="1443" /> me by the representative bodies and what they want.  As Senator Cosgrave said, apart from matters relating to discipline and command everything else that can be considered under the welfare umbrella will literally be on the table.</P>

      <P>I only have a responsibility to get re-elected, which seems to be successful, so far anyway.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely happy.  It is amazing that while the Minister thinks the argument is proving his point I am equally convinced that the argument is proving my point about the inadequacy of the wording of this section leaving whole areas of uncertainty.  I do not think a body can represent the interests of its members &mdash; I am not talking about issues of national security &mdash; if they cannot make representations to public representatives, other bodies and the media which say &ldquo;our members are getting a lousy training as soldiers&rdquo;.  Are they not entitled to say that?  That is military training. The Garda representative body can say that their members get lousy training or used to get lousy training.  For years the Garda have vigorously, through their representative bodies, demanded higher qualities of training and education for their members.  That is Garda training.  Is the Minister saying that since military training is excluded in all forms, this association will not be able to make representations to improve its quality?  That is one question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question is: will the association be able to talk about matters if the Government decided to close a particular Army barracks?  That would cause considerable disruption to members who are transferred to other locations.  Is that a <Col N="1444" /> military decision or not?  If it is, will the association be entitled to speak about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is policy.  It is not even military, it is Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are my union entitled to speak about the closure of a school when the Army representative association will not be able to talk about the closure of a barracks?  I cannot understand why there should be a difference. Even though these are policy matters my union are perfectly free to speak, make representations and lobby on behalf of their members if somebody wants to close a school.  Why can the representative association of the Defence Forces not do the same thing for the Defence Forces? I thought that everything was on the table.  If that sort of a simple matter is not on the table then a huge range of matters is not on the table.</P>
      <P>I am simply saying that as a matter of policy, it does not get us any closer to an answer.  It is not a matter of national security or even a matter of military discipline. It is an organisational matter decided by the Government.  If, for instance, civilian employees in the Department of Defence who are affected by a decision like that are free to make representations to their union about the inconvenience caused by it, why will the Army representative association not be able to make similar representations? That is the sort of issue I should like to tease out.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to accept, as the Minister said, that much of this is best done first by negotiations and then by regulations so that as negotiations are ongoing from year to year if matters do not work out too well they can be amended by agreement.  I am not disputing that.  We should put the principle of what is involved here clearly on the record.  The section as it stands is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to three instances which are alleged to occur from time to time in all large organisations.  The first relates to an abuse of position by a superior in, say, the vocational education sector.  My <Col N="1445" /> union are entitled to make representations on my behalf in that case. Would an Army association be entitled to make representations to a superior officer if a person felt that he or she was a victim of abuse in such a situation? Secondly, there is the allegation from time to time in all large organisations, namely, victimisation of individuals which is related to the first instance. Thirdly, by way of an interesting example but one that has all sorts of real possibilities, there is the question of sexual harrassment.  Would issues like sexual harrassment within the armed forces be part of the brief of a representative association, or would there still have to be things that would be dealt with through the Army command structure? In one case we are talking about a trade union having the right to represent the interests of its members; in the other case we are talking about a limited body which can talk about a certain range of things. I would like to know what principles are involved.  That is where this section should be elaborated on.  I will not make a big issue about the wording in my amendment but there is a fundamental question about what is and is not included in the brief of this association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite everything the Minister has said, I must say that I am fully in agreement with the remarks made by Senator Ryan in relation to the need to elaborate and spell out in greater detail. That is highly desirable.  I would like to ask a specific question of the Minister.  In relation to his remarks that he was being generous and that it was his intention to make the capacity for regulation virtually limitless, why did he consider it necessary to specify one area that the association would be concerned with, namely, the area of remuneration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the important one.  It is self evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That word has been bandied about for a long time in relation to the Defence Forces.  Everything is self evident until there is a bit of pressure <Col N="1446" /> put on and then it becomes somewhat different.  I am concerned about this aspect.  I have no doubt that the Minister has the very best of intentions in relation to these regulations but in relation to what a representative body should be doing in representing its members there is that unwillingness to accept a single amendment, and I am not talking about the details or about spelling out every single area.  I am talking about the recognised basic function of a representative body which is negotiating on remuneration and conditions, and I still cannot accept that the two words cannot at least be put there and cannot be put in terms of my amendment without getting into any morass of definition or of any other problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am worried about is that section 2 (1) limits the area to simply remuneration and everything else is left to regulation after the association is set up.  Then it is taken in the context of trade unionism. I would regard the wording of sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 as an attack on trade unionism.  Section 7 states that every regulation made under the Act shall be laid before each House soon afterwards. In other words, the regulations are made first.  What we have here is a sop to the Defence Forces.  In other words, the Minister is selling enabling legislation with the carrot of dealing with one issue, the issue which precipitated most of this discussion and this Bill before us, namely, the demand for better pay.  That is why the spouses were marching and that is what brought us into the Seanad and the Dáil these few days.  Then everything else is a pig in a poke.  Everything is left hanging. We do not know what will happen. This Bill is so carefully couched that we are passing nothing but legislation enabling the setting up of an association that deals with remuneration.  I am not at all questioning the Minister's good intentions. I am talking about the language that is being used in this Bill and the whole thrust of the Bill.  It is couched in a negative rather than a positive fashion. What is being provided for is not being given generously but grudgingly.  Despite anything the Minister has said, I cannot <Col N="1447" /> see any reason for not accepting the amendment that I have put down here which does not go into any great detail but does specify both pay and conditions. That is the minimum the Minister can give.  A step towards the maximum would be the position proposed in Senator Ryan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can do is restate what has already been said.  All that is specific is what is excluded and everything else is at issue.  If we accept Senator Costello's proposals to insert &ldquo;employment and other conditions of service&rdquo; do we exclude then what Senator Ryan is saying, &ldquo;welfare, health and education, training and related issues&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the issues the Minister mentioned in his letter and there are numerous other areas that I could list and which every other Senator in the House could list.  Where does one draw the line?  It is unfair of Senator Costello to suggest that this legislation is a sop to the Defence Forces, in view of the way the Minister has handled this issue.  He has been very positive and has been at great pains on every occasion to take the views of everybody into consideration. All I can do is repeat that everything is on the table here with the exception of what is specified in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the issue that Senator Ryan spoke about in relation to training, it would be inherent in section (2) that the maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces would include military training.  What is open for consideration and negotiation relates to social training in respect of VEC work, <Col N="1448" /> apprentice work and all that type of thing. That is recognisable.  I would ask the Senators to recognise this legislation and not to have this attitude that there is some sort of underhand operation going on to exclude all of these things.  In fact the Bill is providing that they should be included in negotiations with the different organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting forward this Bill for a bit of sport, as it were.  I am seriously intent on it.  The Gleeson Commission has been established and they will be dealing with remuneration and related matters.  They will come up with a report in June.  There is a question that a plethora of representative bodies might be established calling themselves this and that but with no power, legislative function or authority, no conciliation and arbitration scheme and no statutory definition on protection.</P>
      <P>I decided to bring forward this Bill side by side with the Gleeson Commission and their consideration of remuneration and related matters.  I believe that it is necessary for the Defence Forces to have such representative bodies and I want to protect them by giving them a strong association. That is the purpose of the whole of section (2), to avoid having a multiplicity of such bodies debating against each other and devouring each other. I want to beef them up with a proper secretariat, a proper range of matters that they can discuss, a capacity to raise funds and so on.  I believe in this.  I am trying to strengthen it and to give it as wide a framework as possible into which they will have a major input.  That is the whole purpose of the exercise.  Otherwise it would be just lunacy for me to be here passing the measure at all.</P>
      <P>There is no reason for this measure. This Bill means what I say it means. I appreciate the bona fides of Senators Costello and Ryan in this matter, but I would like them to bring a little reality into what we are trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are on the way to setting up for the first time since the formation of the State representative bodies within our Defence Forces.  Discussions were going on the <Col N="1449" /> day before yesterday, yesterday and today in regard to the elections.  All this is taking place currently and Defence Force personnel are involved.  They want to see an independent association or associations. As I said, two associations will probably emerge, one for officers and one for the NCOs and men.  They want to see this work.</P>
    <P>Coming back to these amendments and the section to which they relate, the best possible way they can work is if the mandate in the non-remuneration area is as wide as possible so that the elected representatives of the members of the Defence Forces will have the maximum input.  I see them coming in strong on this matter.  We have defined remuneration. We know what that means, but the whole range of issues that are closely related to the welfare of the men &mdash; conditions of employment, welfare matters and so on will give real interest, involvement and meaning to the members of the Defence Forces for the first time ever.  They in particular will have a maximum input into this area, allied to the process of conciliation and arbitration.  That means that for the first time they will have a real say in their standing in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It is a tremendous opportunity for good, and it is meant to be.  It is intended that this enabling legislation will be as flexible as possible so that the representatives of the men will have the maximum input.  I am satisfied as to the calibre of the people who are interested in establishing these representative bodies, and their good intentions.  In this Bill I am making an article of faith in their purpose, and their bona fides.  This is an enabling Bill which will allow the associations when established to make the maximum contribution to the drawing up of the appropriate regulations.  They will be flexible regulations which can be reviewed from time to time to see how they work, how they can be improved, amended, reviewed and so on.  That is the spirit of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is a question of changing an area of mistrust into one of trust.  That is what I am talking about.  There is no nonsense <Col N="1450" /> about this.  We are serious about this and we should keep our minds on that track. Anything else is only diverting us down side alleys away from the main thrust of this Bill, which is to establish permanent representative bodies which will work and to act for the men in a cohesive manner and ensure they will be protected by the law against any other bodies which may seek to interfere with or meddle in their affairs.  They and they alone will be the judges of what is best for themselves and for the men.  That is what we want to see established here.  The whole purpose of this legislation.  We in the Oireachtas have the job of setting up the framework within which we can allow that process of consultation to proceed and to evolve in the months and years ahead.  That is why I think these and other amendments, however well intentioned, are restrictive and can only cause further trouble and lead one from the main purpose of the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to drag out the discussion.  However, in relation to what Senator McKenna said, at no stage did I question the good intentions or bona fides of the Minister.  Perhaps I can take this opportunity to welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on being in such sparkling form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the Bill and improving it.  The Minister stated that the Bill means what he says it means.  I am not prepared to accept that.  The Bill means what the Bill says, and long after the Minister, I and all the other Senators are gone, the Bill will still be there and it is the wording of the Bill that matters. I have been concerned about how this wording has been couched, what it means in substance in relation to what is being granted and what is being left out.  That is why I have been anxious to ensure that there be inserted in it the standard conditions that are applicable to a representative body when they are established. I am talking not about specific, individual details; I am talking about principles.  That is why I think the terms of the amendment I have put forward <Col N="1451" /> here are very relevant and would be very useful if the amendment were accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 36 and 37, to delete &ldquo;of and shall not, without, the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;but may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (3) reads:</P>
      <P>An association shall be independent of and shall not, without the consent of the Minister, be associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am astonished that any independent organisation should depend &mdash; I say this without being offensive &mdash; on the whim of a Minister as to whether it would be allowed to have an association with any other body.  There is a contradiction between describing a body as independent and then saying that you cannot <Col N="1453" /> actually associate with, whatever about being affiliated to, any other organisation without the permission of the Minister.  I know there are fairly far fetched possibilities that could be thought up where the association might decide to become an affiliate of various campaigns that might not be consistent with the operations of the Defence Forces, or for example, it might decide to affiliate to the campaign for nuclear disarmament, but I have a considerable regard for the good sense of people in any organisation, particularly the members of the Defence Forces.  I know from my discussions with one of their chief spokesmen, a friend of long standing &mdash; the man may be the subject of disciplinary procedures because he dared to talk to the media and exercise his constitutional rights &mdash; and from talking to others that PDFORRA are very clear about their obligations under the law and under the Constitution. To suggest that they could only affiliate with organisations of which the Minister approved is to undermine immediately their independence.  If people accept the obligation of membership of the Defence Forces, we have to accept that they accept and understand what they are doing.  They take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution; they accept the responsibilities thereof and my own view is that they should be trusted to decide where or to whom they will affiliate.</P>
    <P>The first thing my amendment proposes effectively is to delete the provision that the Minister's consent would be required to allow them to affiliate to any other organisation.  The second amendment is to ensure, in case anybody is worried, that the affiliation shall only be to bodies which are somehow similar in intent to a trade union.  This may be too conservative on my part, but I want to be reasonable.  I think we should leave it to an organisation like this, as we should leave it to the Garda representative association &mdash; and we do not &mdash; to decide to whom they will affiliate.  I can see absolutely no reason that an association representing the Defence Forces should not affiliate, for instance, to the Irish <Col N="1454" /> Congress of Trade Unions.  There is an implication in the refusal to allow them to affiliate which suggests that somehow there is something wrong with trade unionism, something inconsistent between membership of a trade union and work within the security services. There is a whiff of Margaret Thatcher and GCHQ, Cheltenham about the apparent unwillingness to consider the idea of the affiliation of a representative association defined under section 2 (1) in fairly cautious terms &mdash; we are not going back over all that old ground at this stage &mdash; and whose functions, other than those contained in subsection (1), will actually be defined by regulation by the Minister. Though I accept fully the bona fides of the Minister that there will be intensive and serious discussions with the members of the Defence Forces to agree on what the other functions will be, nevertheless, the Minister effectively will be able to determine ultimately what issues beyond remuneration the representative associations can talk about.</P>
    <P>If he can do that and if he has written into the legislation so many exclusions, why in Heaven's name does he have to put yet more exclusions in subsection (3). What I am suggesting, quite seriously, is that the association shall be independent but may be associated with or affiliated to any trade union or other similar body. Specifically what I have in mind is that if the members of the association feel it is in their interest to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, they should be entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like fairly explicit reasons, not based on the fact that other countries do not allow it or that this is new, why two parts of our security forces, i.e. the Garda and in this case the Army, will not be allowed to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions when the Prison Officers' Association, the other arm of the security forces, is allowed to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. There is an implied sense of something slightly inappropriate about people in very serious responsible positions within the security services being involved with the trade union movement.  I know it is <Col N="1455" /> not intended to be offensive, but, nevertheless, I think it is offensive to trade unions and it has a whiff of GCHQ about it.  I suggest that the Minister could usefully improve this Bill by allowing any association which is set up to be independent as he intends but also to be able to decide with whom and to whom it should be associated or affiliated without his interference, and if the association choose to go wild, the Minister is then in a position to bring in legislation to deal with this.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that if this association were to be so irresponsible as to attempt to associate with an unacceptable organisation, then it would be such an irresponsible organisation that a Minister would probably have to bring in legislation to deal with it anyway, and if they do get the notion into their heads that they want to associate with some organisation, and the Minister says no, I do not believe that would be the end of it.  There would be yet another unpleasant confrontation between the members of the Defence Forces and successive Governments either directly or via a spouses association and we would be back to the same old problems.  The real and only solution is to trust the members of such an association to act in a responsible fashion and to get away from the paternalistic idea that somehow they cannot be trusted and that they must rely on the Minister to decide by his consent or by withholding his consent what is good for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put the matter into perspective.  I know this argument has been rejected already in connection with the previous amendment, but I want to emphasise that this is an enabling Bill to facilitate the members of the Defence Forces to organise themselves into representative bodies on an independent basis and to consider various matters, which I have already outlined at some length.  They are almost 100 per cent on all fours with the objectives we propose. At the moment they are working out details of the election and will subsequently be very involved in working <Col N="1456" /> out the structures which will be written into the regulations.</P>
      <P>The draft PDFORRA constitution, which I have with me, has already been submitted by them.  This is their own recommendation and their major principle is that they shall not be aligned to any other organisation.  They do not want to be aligned to any other organisation whatsoever.  They are very strong on the independent principle.  That principle also operates with regard to the Garda Sochána.  Any such affiliation, as far as the Garda Síochána are concerned, is done with the consent of the Minister for Justice.  There are all sorts of affiliations that may be relevant.  For instance, there is an Irish Conference of Professional and Services Association with which engineers may be associated on non-pay matters. There are all sorts of trade union and professional bodies or institutes concerned with non-pay matters and they can be associated with them with the consent of the Minister for Defence. Obviously consent would be forthcoming, as was the case on the part of the Minister for Justice in regard to the Garda Síochána, in any case where no conflict arises and I would not envisage a conflict arising.  I would envisage that any affiliations or associations sought by the representative bodies would be legitimate affiliations or associations that would preserve their right, as the one cohesive, independent body, to represent the Defence Forces.  They have no interest in attachments to other bodies. If the question of association or affiliation arises from time to time a case could be made for it and if the Minister for Defence thinks the case is sufficient he may, under the subsection as it now stands, consent to such an association or affiliation.  Otherwise the representative bodies will be, as they themselves require, one independent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of what they seek is to be an independent body and the main thrust of the conciliation and arbitration provision is to give them their own conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The Defence Forces are recognised, under the Constitution, as being in a particular <Col N="1457" /> category.  They are particularly amenable, as the only arms bearing force in the State, to the Oireachtas, the Parliament of the State, and to the Minister for Defence elected by that Parliament. There is a basic constitutional niche into which they fit and they recognise that. There is nobody more conscious of their responsibility in this respect than the members of the Defence Forces.  It is to these people we are now giving a lift in this legislation by enabling them to form their associations to represent their interests.  They are very well aware of what their interests are and what they should be concerned about.  It is not matters of command and discipline or affiliation with other groups, although that may arise in the future; the main thrust of what they want is an independent body or bodies to represent their interests in the areas of remuneration, conditions of service and welfare and I propose to give them the widest possible framework within which to operate in that respect. In future years if they wish to be affiliated or associated with any other body, the Minister for Defence can consent to that.</P>
    <P>That is obviously a danger &mdash; I hope it will not arise &mdash; that associating or affiliating with some other body, either internal or external, may be contrary to national policy, security or the interests of the State.  The saver is there in the section, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;, just as it is there in the case of the Garda representative bodies, in that case with the consent of the Minister for Justice. There is nothing untoward about that.  The Minister, on behalf of the Oireachtas, should have an overall governing interest in who the representative body or bodies of the State's Defence Forces are affiliated to or associated with and I offer no apology for that. It is basically good administration under the law and the Constitution.  It recognises the responsibility that whoever is here as Minister for Defence must carry on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>In all the discussions that have taken place &mdash; late though these discussions may have been, as some of the criticisms seem to imply &mdash; there has not been a <Col N="1458" /> word about this matter in so far as PDFORRA or any other interested bodies of the Army are concerned.  Their main interest is to have independent bodies established.  The question of affiliation or association may arise but it is very much a fringe matter.  If it does arise and if it is something with which these bodies can be legitimately associated &mdash; I can see plenty of examples of legitimate associations and affiliations &mdash; that would be readily granted.  That assurance has been given.  It is no harm, in the interest of security and in the national interest, to ensure that the Minister of the day has this residual control.</P>
    <P>If the Senator's amendment is carried, an impromptu decision could be taken overnight without any reference to the Minister or the Government of the day. It is to preclude something like that happening or any conflict arising out of something like that happening that this saver is included.  That saving clause is written into the Bill in the overall national interest and I would defend it to the end of the day.  The Oireachtas has certain responsibilities and it is surely a minimal responsibility to ensure, if the representative bodies of the armed forces of this State have affiliations and associations, that we have a say in who they are affiliating to or associating with.  As obtains in practically all cases, consent can be given in this regard but it is important to have a saver in case some particular association or affiliation may be against the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are concerned primarily with the execution of national policy.  Mention was made already about the policy of neutrality and that is just one example.  There may be some international body of like-minded members of defence forces attached to a country that is strongly concerned with military aggression of one kind or other, or some military policy that runs entirely counter to our military policy.  It would surely be very wrong for our Defence Forces to be affiliated with the Defence Forces of a power that has a totally different policy or a different military attitude to neutrality. That is just an example that occurs to me <Col N="1459" /> but in time there might be other examples.  That is all this provision is designed to cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be smart.  The interesting thing is that at least one of the Garda organisations is affiliated to the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Association; I think it is the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why they can be affiliated to the Conference of Professional and Services Association and not be affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It would be interesting if the Minister said that in principle he agrees that they could be affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going back too much into history, when PDFORRA were set up the political climate suggested that no representative body was practical or possible. They had quite a clear and definite objective which was to get one to deal with what was the immediate issue, and perfectly justifiably so, the appallingly low pay of many members of the Defence Forces.  That was a perfectly reasonable view.  That the remuneration is the primary issue is reasonable but that is not the end of the issue.  The Defence Forces should be able to move further into other areas and make decisions for themselves. It is a question of whether our Defence Forces are trustworthy.  I think, as does the Minister, and probably with less reservations than I have, that they are trustworthy and that they take their responsibilities extremely seriously. There is a contradiction here.  If, as I believe, the Defence Forces take their position under the Constitution and the <Col N="1460" /> law very seriously, they can be trusted not to get themselves in areas of serious conflict.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the international affiliation.  I have a separate amendment down on that matter and we can talk about it later.  I want to point out to the Minister that what we are talking about here is the association.  Any of these dealings with professional bodies would be on an individual membership basis and we can talk about that again.  We are talking here simply about the association and their right to affiliate.  I am intrigued that, for instance, in both the Department of Justice and the Department of Defence there are civil servants who have access to highly sensitive information to do with the security of the State but who are free to be members of trade unions and those unions in turn are free to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions without the permission of either Minister.  The sort of information those people have at their disposal is very sensitive. The same is the case with many members of the Prison Officers Association. They would know a lot about the plans of various branches of the prisons regarding any activity within the prison, either an attempted break-out or any other activity.  However, they can be trusted to be affiliated to the ICTU and not to abuse their knowledge when they act as members of their union.  I cannot understand why the Defence Forces have to be treated differently.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves that the Garda, because of the sorry state our country is in, use firearms, as distinct from carrying them, more frequently in positions of combat than members of the Defence Forces.  That is a regrettable and unfortunate position for which the Garda are not in any way responsible.  While we allow the Garda to have a certain freedom of membership, we do not allow them to affiliate to the ICTU.  We are making too much out of the military aspect of this.  We are talking about an association to represent the interests of members with, as the Minister said, a fairly broadly based remit.</P>
    <P>We should permit people to make their <Col N="1461" /> own decisions about such matters and trust them.  If they show signs of getting involved in matters we do not want them to, a gentle reminder from the Government that that was bringing a potential conflict to the surface which might well necessitate legislation if it continued could deal with the matter.  I do not like paternalistic attitudes which believe we know better than the members in the Defence Forces what they should or should not do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was at pains earlier to tell us of the type of organisation that represents the Garda Síochána and he wanted to know why we did not permit a similar organisation to represent the members of the Defence Forces.  Now that the Minister has included a provision in the Bill to permit members of the Defence Forces to affiliate, the Senator is not satisfied.  On the one hand the Senator argued that the representatives of Garda sergeants have something that members of the Defence Forces will not have but when that was rectified he was not satisfied.  We must remember that trade unions affiliate to international organisations.  On Second Stage the Senator referred to our stance in relation to neutrality and he said he was satisfied that we never did, and he hoped we never would, become associated with any military alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inherent danger in permitting representatives of the Defence Forces to affiliate to international organisations. They are in a unique position and we must acknowledge that.  If we allow them the freedom to affiliate with a trade union there is the possibility that internationally they may be affiliated to an alliance that would bring our neutrality into question.  If that occurred there would be uproar here and we would be asked why the Bill did not take cognisance of that possibility.  It would be too late in the day to send a reminder to those associations that they should be careful when affiliating with international organisations. It is important that the Minister should have a say in what associations the <Col N="1462" /> representatives of the Defence Forces are affiliated to.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 6 states:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 11 and 12, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) An association may affiliate to and participate in the workings of international organisations representing associations and organisations with similar and/or related purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the light of the remarks by the Minister I should like to sort out what is involved in amendment No. 6.  To my knowledge PDFORRA are affiliated to an international organisation which attempts to represent at international level the bodies that represent the defence forces in many of the countries affiliated to the Council of Europe.  They have been accepted as members and are anxious to continue as members.  Can the Minister make it clear to me that any association will be allowed, even if he does not accept my amendment, to affiliate to appropriate international organisations similar to themselves?  PDFORRA are affiliated to such an international body.  They have received considerable support, moral and otherwise, from the international organisation. I would like it to be made clear that the new association will be permitted to affiliate to international bodies.  I would encourage them to have active contacts with other organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the organisation they would be involved with would have membership from countries that are within NATO and outside.  Indeed, it is quite possible because of the way proposals are being prepared to extend membership of the Council of Europe, that within a few years we will have countries that are still, at least theoretically, within the ambit of the Warsaw Pact.  Both pacts have <Col N="1463" /> outlived their usefulness and should be dissolved quickly.  However, both exist and are liable to continue for some time. In the context of my amendment No. 6 and of section 2 (3) I should like to ask the Minister to make it clear that an association set up under the Bill will be allowed to affiliate to international organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (4), line 4, after <Col N="1466" />&ldquo;members&rdquo; to add &ldquo;of the Defence Forces alone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an important issue involved here that deserves our careful consideration. The Minister in referring to professional bodies and such organisations talked about engineers and so forth.  Section 2 (3) refers to the association, while subsection (4) refers to individuals.  Subsection (4) as it stands says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>A member shall not become or be a member of a trade union, or any other body (other than an association), which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with the remuneration or other conditions of service of members.</P>
    <P>The reference to remuneration does not present me with many problems, although I will explain where one may well arise, but conditions of service could have to do, among other things, with professional standards and also with development of the skills for instance, of craft workers in the Army apprentice school who, although members of the Defence Forces, might well have good reason to remain in contact with or retain membership of a craft union.</P>
    <P>Let me give a couple of examples.  I am thinking here of the Irish Medical Organisation which is both a professional body concerned with medicine, and a trade union, representing doctors in many cases; it will do both.  It is also a centre of professional learning.  There are other more specific examples, such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a professional body, who endeavours to make representations about the manner in which members of that profession carry out their business.  It is also concerned with the conditions under which people work.</P>
    <P>A good case could be made for allowing members of the Permanent Defence Forces Representative Association to be members of craft unions and professional bodies.  The Institution of Engineers of Ireland is one classic example.  It devotes an enormous amount of effort to work of a professional nature involving, among <Col N="1467" /> other things, the continuing education and updating of the skills and knowledge of their members.  According to its constitution it is also a trade union concerned about the remuneration and conditions of service of engineers.  Another example is the Irish Dental Union, but there could be many others who seek to improve skills while also working as a trade union.</P>
    <P>While I fully accept we do not want fragmentation or the setting up of a number of associations or unions within the Defence Forces to represent them on remuneration or other issues it seems that the present wording of subsection (4) precludes membership of any professional organisation with a trade union element. If this is so, doctors in the Defence Forces will be precluded from taking out membership of the IMO, engineers from taking out membership of the IEI or of the various other professional institutions which represent engineers.  Craftsmen would also be precluded from continuing membership of craft unions where there may well be discussions about standards, different ways of approaching things and changes in the skill base.  The amendment I have moved suggests that this prohibition should only apply to a trade union or any other body who seek to influence or are otherwise concerned with the remuneration or other conditions of service of members of the Defence Forces alone, in other words, any body or organisation set up to represent only the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There is a serious question to be answered here and that is whether what seems to be a reasonable position is actually going to inhibit the professional activity of professional members of the Defence Forces.  A small amendment could deal with the issue.  While I do not want to get involved in an argument with the Minister, the subsection, as it stands, could seriously inhibit members of the Defence Forces being members of various professional bodies.  Subsection (5) does not give a way out.  It states that the Minister may determine any question which arises as to whether any trade union or any other body is a trade union <Col N="1468" /> or body to which subsection (4) of the section applies.  The bodies I am talking about are trade unions concerned with the remuneration and conditions of service of their members.  It would be standing the truth on its head to say that the IMO or IEI are not trade unions as defined by subsection (4).  That is manifestly one of the jobs they had and it would be much better to rewrite this part of the Bill to make it clear that members of the Defence Forces can be members of professional bodies or craft unions.  It could be done by a simple amendment. This is an important point on which I would like to hear the Minister's view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>When members of the Defence Forces are encouraged to acquire skills and professions they should be allowed to remain in touch with their professional or craft body and keep themselves abreast of any changes.  The Army would be the beneficiary of such contact. It can only be to the benefit of the Army if greater opportunities are given to officers and NCOs to pursue various courses of study.  Membership of various professional bodies should not conflict with the terms of this Bill.  Such membership should not involve military matters.  Subsection (4) is slightly ambiguous and I am not sure if changes may be required. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that membership of, for example, the Institute of Engineers, is not precluded under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I can reassure Senators Cosgrave and Ryan that membership of professional bodies is not an issue.  Of course members of the Defence Forces can remain members of such bodies or institutes and avail of their non-pay facilities. My concern is that when it comes to negotiations regarding pay and conditions there should be only one negotiating body, namely, a body established under the terms of this Bill.  Such a body will take into account in the discussions and negotiations, and ultimately at conciliation and arbitration, the rates of pay and conditions of their professional counterparts outside the military forces <Col N="1469" /> and may take their advice on how to proceed.</P>
      <P>All I am seeking to ensure is that such outside bodies are not involved with the remuneration and conditions of service which are being determined by the representative body and are not also acting as spokesmen for the Defence Forces.  The representative body of the Defence Forces will take into account the views of bodies to which their members are affiliated.  In matters of pay and conditions there must be one body speaking for the people concerned, that is, one of the bodies established under this legislation. It makes sense that we should not have separate claims being pursued by separate bodies in regard to one issue.</P>
      <P>Doctors within the Army are members of the medical association and by reason of their membership they improve their medical knowledge.  They also know the rates of pay obtaining outside the Defence Forces and relate such rates to those obtaining within the forces.  They can make up their minds to push for certain improvements through their representative bodies under the system to be established as a result of this Bill; there must not be another claim being pursued by the body to which they are attached outside the Defence Forces.  I am seeking to clarify that there will be one body dealing with pay and conditions within the Defence Forces, but that body can take into account the association of their members with outside bodies.  Such outside bodies will not carry on parallel negotiations.  The Minister can determine any question that arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a dispute between the Minister and me about what he wants to do, although other Members might have a disagreement.  I have no problem about the principle involved here.  The difficulty is that many of these bodies will claim the right to talk about these matters.  I have seen comments in medical journals to which I have access about the remuneration and conditions of service of officers with professional qualifications within the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section refers to a trade union or <Col N="1470" /> any other body which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with remuneration. It does not refer simply to bodies which want to negotiate.  Either the law will be stood on its head by bodies, who have hitherto seen themselves as entitled to seek to influence conditions of service, being exempted from the terms of this legislation or being told that members of the Defence Forces can only be members of their association on condition that the association never again speak in public about conditions of service in any way which could be seen to influence or otherwise be concerned with remuneration.  I have no problem with the principle contained here, but the practice has been that certain professional bodies have claimed the right to attempt to influence public opinion about remuneration or conditions.  What will happen now if members of this association are members of those bodies?  Will they have to persuade the association to be quiet?  Otherwise the Minister can say the IMO is not such a body but the truth is that if they continue as they have been, they will act as if they were.  That is the first question. Secondly, it would be improper to make a distinction between professional organisations, such as that, and say to skilled craftsmen within the Defence Forces that the white collar professionals can join professional associations but members of the Defence Forces are precluded from joining craft unions which would discuss matters dealing with the various areas of the trade which, for instance, influence the Department of Education curricula. The craft unions negotiate with both the Department of Education and FÁS about the training of apprentices.  That is a professional interest of the member and it has to do with standards.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to allow doctors and engineers to become members of professional associations in order to ensure that they were in touch with their own profession and tell craftsmen who are members of the Defence Forces that they could not be members of craft unions in order to keep in touch with what is happening in their own skill areas.  If both of those are possible then which union <Col N="1471" /> will not be recognised?  I still think there is a case to be made for an amendment here.  I want to be reasonable and I am not necessarily saying it is my amendment. Either we will have logic stood on its head by a whole raft of trade unions and professional organisations being said by the Minister that they are not a trade union or any other body as defined by subsection (4) or else we will have serious problems down the line.</P>
    <P>An amendment to this section could be drafted to do precisely what the Minister and I are agreed should be done, ensure that on the issue of remuneration only one body shall be entitled to claim the right to negotiate.  I suggest to the Minister that the words &ldquo;any other body which seeks to negotiate&rdquo; would be one possibility.  He has better draftspeople at his disposal than I have but as it stands there is a potential either for serious conflict between the Minister and various professionals and craft organisations or for having to stand the law on its head by giving a <i>carte blanche</i> to a whole range of organisations to say that they are not &mdash; what they manifestly are &mdash; trade unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to meet the latter difficulty that I have inserted subsection (5) which states that:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall determine any question that arises as to whether any trade union or any other body is a trade union or body to which subsection (4) of this section applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the subsection that is concerned with the remuneration or conditions of service.  The Senator is postulating the situation that applied up to now where there were no such representative bodies within the military forces.  Now we will have these representative bodies so we are into a new ballgame as it were.  In that new situation they will carry out the negotiations.  They will be concerned about conciliation and arbitration and so on and will be representing the men and/or officers.  They will be associated with other fringe associations or bodies for all sorts of other purposes, for <Col N="1472" /> example, training and FÁS or any one of a number of other professional bodies with advice to give and so on.  I see nothing wrong with that so long as those other bodies do not get involved in actual negotiations.  Up to now they have become so involved.  Now all this will change because there will be a representative association of all the personnel who will carry the can on behalf of all the members, professional, trades, craftsmen and others and who will, of course, take advice from outside.  In the normal course of events they can do that because there has to be some parity between rates and conditions inside and outside the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the determining person in the case of any conflict that may arise as to whether any trade union or any other body is a trade union or body to which subsection (4) applies.  Subsection (4) relates to the member not becoming a member of any trade union or any other body which is concerned with remuneration or any other condition of service. The determination of any such issue will reside with the Minister.  The demarcation line cannot be any more straightforward than that.  I agree that what the Senator has postulated could arise from time to time and that somebody must adjudicate on it.  The subsection says that the Minister shall adjudicate on that aspect.  I do not see how it can be any plainer than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial clause in this dispute is the phrase in subsection (4), &ldquo;which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;which seeks to influence&rdquo; is not a negotiating phrase.  I would like to have a dictionary with me because we could go through it. The Minister is probably grateful that I do not.  The other phrase &ldquo;or otherwise be concerned with&rdquo; is a sweeping phrase. That phrase does not mean negotiating and is nowhere near negotiating.  It is almost expressing an opinion that doctors who are members of the Defence Forces are under paid or are not given adequate inservice training.  What we are precluding is membership of any other body <Col N="1473" /> which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with the conditions of service of members.  I can see how the Minister could conveniently interpret that so that the bodies we are talking about are interpreted as being acceptable such as the IMO or craft unions but I cannot see how that interpretation would be consistent with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put a possibility to the Minister that this representative association &mdash; one or other of them &mdash; may feel that some of these professional bodies are interfering with their exclusive right to negotiate on behalf of members and would then seek a judicial review to have the Minister's decision that these organisations were acceptable overturned by the courts.  We could then be in a mess.  There is a problem there because I am not sure that when the legislation was being drafted the two roles of many professional bodies were clearly appreciated.  The two roles are the cause of the problem.  For example, I could be a member of the Institute of Chemical Engineers and of the TUI and those two bodies would claim the right to negotiate on behalf of engineers; one lives with that but in this case we are talking about any body which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with.  If we deleted the words: &ldquo;or otherwise be concerned with&rdquo; and said &ldquo;which seeks to influence&rdquo; it would be better.  We are saying that any body concerned with conditions of service of members is a body of which a member of the Defence Forces cannot be a member. As the Minister said, there could well be marginal cases.  I can accept that he will not agree that any new trade union type organisation should be set up to represent members of the Defence Forces but in his attempt to do that he is putting at risk the possibility of much contention about the way this operates either from members of professions who will feel that their professional organisation has been unjustly excluded by the Minister or else by the association which feels that certain privileged members of the association have dual negotiating rights or dual ways of getting access to public opinion to <Col N="1474" /> influence thinking on their behalf.  I think that section could be redrafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise here that in setting up these new bodies the primary purpose is to safeguard them. The whole thrust of the Bill is in establishing the actual bodies.  I want these bodies to represent the members and I do not want another body from outside moving in on their territory.  The Senator rightly interpreted that as one of the purposes of the Bill and pointed out the difficulties involved.  There may be difficulties but they can be resolved by leaving the adjudication on the matter to the Minister.  That is why section 2 (5) is included.</P>
      <P>If everybody was being bloody-minded, it could give rise to a problem and then the Minister would have to decide one way or the other.  Short of stopping them from being members of outside bodies, which I do not want to do, I do not see any other way of doing this.  They can be members of outside bodies for the reasons I have mentioned but when it comes down to the whole area of remuneration I want the members of the Defence Forces to speak with one voice. Obviously the negotiating team or representatives of various executive structures established by the represented bodies, will take into account the special cases made by craftsmen and professional people within the Defence Forces.  I take it that that is the way it will work out, and I cannot see it working out any other way.  While allowing the primacy, as it were, to reside with the representative body or bodies at the same time I cannot preclude specialised membership of outside professional trade bodies on a whole host of outside matters which are related to remuneration or conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how the Senator's amendment will improve the Bill in any way. If he reads the subsections as they are drafted, I believe he will agree that the case is met.  The Minister is there in an adjudicating capacity and inevitably if a case like this arises nobody else can determine it.  When there is a demarcation <Col N="1475" /> dispute, so to speak, between the outside and inside bodies somebody has to adjudicate, and the most appropriate person in the circumstances will be the Minister.  I hope that that sort of situation will not arise.  We are talking largely in a vacuum, as it were, because common sense will obviously prevail.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the merit in two bodies pursuing claims in this matter.  I do not think this would appeal to either bodies in practice.  The primacy in regard to matters of pay and conditions must reside with the bodies we are now establishing. We cannot preclude members from being members of outside bodies or associations of that nature but we can withhold the right to negotiate with outside bodies. I do not see what other way we can approach the issue.  I do not think one can reconcile the primacy of the internal association and the individual or personal rights of the people inside the armed forces to be members of bodies outside the forces other than in the way I propose here.  Inevitably there will be a difficulty in giving them the freedom to be members of outside bodies and in trying to set up the new bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I genuinely think this is my last comment.  If we were at an earlier stage in this debate and we had a decent time interval between the various Stages I believe we could have worked out an amendment which would make this much more precise.  The issue is not really who tries to influence remuneration or who tries to be concerned with remuneration: the issue is who should negotiate on behalf of members about remuneration. If half the trade unions in the country want to talk, as they have done from time to time, about Army pay we are not going to stop them talking about how much the Army should be paid.  Anybody can attempt to influence or otherwise be concerned with the remuneration of members of the Defence Forces. Members of the Oireachtas have always been and will continue to be concerned about the remuneration, conditions of service and facilities in terms of housing, <Col N="1476" /> etc., available to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The critical issue is that there should be a single body who can negotiate with the appropriate authorities on issues of remuneration and all the other issues we spent so much time talking about earlier today.  It seems to me that the simple solution would be to include the words &ldquo;or any other body which seek to negotiate about remuneration or other conditions of service for members&rdquo;.  That is the crux of the issue.</P>
      <P>We should provide that only one body can negotiate so that if other bodies want to talk about a matter they will have to write to the Minister about it and if he feels that a professional service or membership will be beneficial to a member he can consider it.  Only one body should be allowed to negotiate and be recognised as having a negotiating capacity.  That of itself would settle the problem.  I strongly believe that if we had more time I would be able to persuade the Minister to include the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; instead of the present wording.  I am still hopeful that he might do this but given that the Dáil is in recess I am not too sure.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 14, after &ldquo;expedient.&rdquo; to add &ldquo;Such regulations shall provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the guarantee of free access to the media by members of an association, the establishment of a permanent independent secretariat for an association, and a guarantee of independence in the day to day operations of an association.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 comes back to the question of the extent to which the drafting of the regulations ought to be openended and the basis of the negotiations that are taking place.  What is proposed in this amendment are three of the fundamental principles any representative body ought to have.  By emphasising the words &ldquo;<i>inter alia</i>&rdquo; I am not trying to preclude or exclude other matters from the regulations.  I am simply suggesting to the Minister that there is a good case for stating that certain fundamental things will be contained in the regulations.  How he will work these things out in the regulations is a separate issue.  They should guarantee free access to the media by members of an association, the establishment of a permanent independent secretariat for the association and a guarantee of independence in the day-to-day operations of the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any independent association who are separate from the command structure, who are able to talk and act independently on behalf of their members <Col N="1478" /> and who have a separate corporate existence via an independent secretariat should have these basic conditions.  I am not trying to say how these things should work out in detail or that only these matters should be referred to in regulations. What I am saying is that these are three very fundamental principles that ought to be contained in the regulations.  My amendment is different in many ways from the amendments that were put forward in the other House.</P>
    <P>I accept the validity of the Minister's argument that there is so much that needs to be discussed and so many issues that need to be teased out, and it is so important that whatever structures and procedures are set up, are set up by agreement. I accept that all that is true and, therefore, the details of these things should be contained in the regulations.  If they are to be contained in the regulations there are certain fundamental principles that deserve to be mentioned within the legislation, because I would hate at some stage in the future for a less well disposed Minister to feel free to rewrite the regulations, to restrict access to the media and to restrict the degree of independence that the association would have particularly if there was a difficulty or conflict.  That is why certain principles to do with the criteria of an effective organisation in a free society &mdash; access to the media, independence in day to day operations and a separate independent secretariat &mdash; ought to be referred to as being the type of issues, amongst others, that should be referred to in the regulations. As things stand I do not believe that is the case.  The Minister has every intention of ensuring that there is access to the media.  He has every intention of ensuring that there will be a secretariat which is separate to and is acting on behalf of the members and he has no intention of trying to influence the day to day operation.  They are fundamental principles and the details of how they operate are adequate or proper material for regulation, but the principles ought to me in the legislation and that is what my amendment provides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that there will be access to the media obviously within certain guidelines under the scope of this legislation in relation to pay and conditions. In passing, I hope there will not be a witch hunt for an individual who spoke out at an earlier stage.  He only said what others were saying.  As stated in the booklet which came out, we cannot expect this operation to run on fresh air; there will be specified funding to enable them to carry out their work.  An association obviously must have certain tools of its trade.  It must also be independent. There is no point setting up a body like this if, at the same time, we say it can only do what we say it can.  If that came to pass we would be no further on than we were 12 months ago and I do not think that is the intention.  There is a difficulty in putting in various things: is there to be funding to provide a building, many secretaries, etc.?  There is a danger in that.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned some points and I presume his list is not exhaustive. He has just touched on a few fairly obvious things, such as freedom of expression and back-up facilities.  He said that a body will be set up with no money or back-up, that basically what is being provided is a forum which should not be hamstrung by the Department officials saying it cannot do this or that.  These things have to be negotiated.  It is important, in the light of dialogue breaking down and possible misrepresentation in relation to this, that a categorical assurance should be given here that these items, along with others, can be made available to whatever association is set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is like an earlier amendment.  It is one that I agree fully with.  It is so obviously a part of the principle of the legislation that I do not feel it necessary to incorporate it in the legislation.  The whole purpose of having this enabling legislation is to set up these independent bodies which will have the gurantee of free access to the media on matters within their mandate and will involve an independent secretariat.  That would obviously be consequential on <Col N="1480" /> having an independent body.  If it is to be effective, it can only be made effective by funding.  It can be funded jointly by way of provision of facilities by the State, and if the associations want to top up those facilities by way of individual subscriptions themselves they can and all that would carry a guarantee of independence which we are writing into the legislation.  We are only precluding matters of command and discipline.</P>
      <P>Senator McKenna emphasised that point earlier.  Other than the exclusion of the command and discipline areas which are the prerogative of military organisations, a whole range of matters will come within their mandate.  These bodies will have their role to play on behalf of their members over the whole range of remuneration and related matters, conditions of service and related matters and welfare matters.  Part and parcel of that mandate will be an independence of operation in pursuing that mandate which would involve an independent secretariat and funding of an independent nature in addition to the State facilities, an independent approach by them in the presentation of their views to the media as they wish.  All this is to be spelt out in greater detail in the regulations which can be agreed between the Army Headquarters, the Department of Defence and the bodies themselves when they are elected.  This is the type of detail they will get down to discussing, what protection and safeguards the representatives of the men will require in their new representative bodies to ensure that they will have real independence, real clout, as it were. All that Senator Ryan is rightly concerned with is covered and the fact of setting these organisations up means that all this will follow, it is consequential on the establishment of these bodies, like night following day, with the detail to be worked out and incorporated in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can reassure Senators Cosgrave and Ryan that what is proposed will be on the lines of what is in Senator Ryan's amendment and I honestly do not see the need to incorporate it in the legislation. It is further confusing the legislation and <Col N="1481" /> interfering with the widest possible consultation, input and consideration by the elected representatives to what should and should not go into the regulations. What best suits them under the headings referred to by Senator Ryan is what should go into the regulations to govern their particular bodies.  It goes without saying that the principles adumbrated by him in that amendment will be part of the permanent weave, as it were, of the permanent representative bodies.  If they are not independent and do not have their secretariat or access to the media they are just not representative bodies. It takes the bottom out of the matter. Really it is a <i>sine qua non</i>, that what is proposed here by Senator Ryan will be part and parcel of the body when structured, but part and parcel with greater detail and greater emphasis as required by the elected representatives themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One point needs to be made.  Here we have a conflict between the legislative Chambers of the Oireachtas and the Executive about what detail is needed in legislation.  It happens to suit Governments always to have the minimum legislation and the maximum regulation because it is a much easier way to do business.  The alternative is that the Oireachtas should be the one which is insisting on detail in legislation.  Let me say in withdrawing the amendment that we are in this country excessively run on legislation via regulation.  Whole areas of people's lives are governed by regulations that have never been adequately debated on discussed in the Oireachtas and are effectively a ministerial fiat.  We have passed legislation in this House which enables the Minister by regulation to amend the legislation, and it is standing the whole procedures of the Oireachtas on their head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a strange feeling that somebody soon is going to raise serious constitutional questions about the extent of regulations.  A question could be raised <Col N="1482" /> about such a fundamental matter as legislative regulations for an association which did not involve stating the principles of those regulations within the legislation. It seems to be sailing very close to the wind in terms of the constitutional distinction between regulations which are meant to be matters of detail and legislation which is meant to be statements of principle.  Of course, I accept fully and with no equivocation that the Minister intends to have all the things I have in my amendment together with provision for adequate funding within the regulations. Therefore, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just two questions on section 2.  Section 2 (1) of the Bill refers to &ldquo;offences in relation to the Defence Forces and military property under that Act&rdquo;.  That is referring to the Defence Act, 1954.  The list of offences in the Defence Act is enormous.  Am I to understand that such a body will have no function in relation to a member of the Defence Forces who is being tried for an offence under the Defence Act, 1954? That Act contains about 250 pages in the <Col N="1483" /> English version and obviously about the same in the Irish version.  It is an enormous piece of legislation.  Section 2 (1) of the Bill refers to the representing members of such ranks in relation to matters affecting their remuneration &ldquo;but excluding matters ... and offences in relation to the Defence Forces and military property under that Act&rdquo;.  That means the whole area of offences &mdash; not all of them military offences; for instance, being drunk in and out of uniform is a military offence.  It seems rather peculiar that an association set up to represent the interested members cannot represent a member if he is on a charge of being drunk, which is one of the offences. There is a long list of them, some of which are quite clearly military offences like being absent without leave, insubordination and so on.  Others are far less obviously of a military nature but they are offences under the Defence Act.  I would like the Minister to say whether my interpretation is correct.</P>
      <P>My second question is in regard to conciliation and arbitration provided for under section 2 (6).  The Minister is quite right in pointing out that it was not adequately welcomed.  The principle of arbitration for any dispute is something the ambulance drivers in Britain spent six months on strike for and which the British Government refused to concede to them. I am very glad the Minister is conceding arbitration to the members of this force. Does the Minister intend that a system of conciliation and arbitration be set up for the Defence Forces separate from the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration provision?  If it is being set up, why do we need two separate systems of conciliation and arbitration?  There are two questions, one on section 2 (1) and the other on section 2 (6).</P>

      <P>The system of conciliation and arbitration as it operates generally throughout the public service operates on the basis of different systems for different areas of the public service as of now.  All we are doing is adding to this by having a specific conciliation and <Col N="1484" /> arbitration system for the Defence Forces.  That is all that is meant.</P>
      <P>The military law matter, is surely separate altogether.  There is the whole corpus of military law and offences in relation to military law.  There is a whole system of courts martial, judge advocate general, a system of law within the law, so to speak, to cover all of that.  This Bill is not intended to cater for that area.  We can look at that in separate legislation if we wish to reform it in regard to various aspects such as the redress of wrongs.  It is a different area which is not the concern of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With Senator Costello's permission I would like to raise an objection to section 3 because there are other complicated issues to be sorted out here. Section 3 is a somewhat peculiar section which provides for the suspension of the association in the event of certain things happening, the first, the major one, being a declaration of emergency.  One's education can always be advanced.  The Minister has contributed to my education, because we have two kinds of emergency, which is rather peculiar.  We have an emergency under section 4 (1) of the Defence Act, 1954, which provides that: &ldquo;The Government may, whenever they consider the circumstances are of such a nature as to warrant their so doing, by order under this subsection declare that a state of emergency exists.&rdquo;.  That is a state of emergency and it can be referred to as a period of emergency according to section 4 (3) of that Act.  That is one period of emergency.  Article 28.3.1º of Bunreacht na hÉireann refers to a different kind of emergency which requires a vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas. I am at a loss to understand how we have got ourselves into having one period of emergency defined in the Constitution and another period of emergency defined <Col N="1485" /> in legislation.  It raises an issue about peculiarities in our legislation and in its drafting which could well be addressed at some future date.  The Minister has clarified that.</P>
      <P>What I do not understand is why the provision under section 5 of the Defence Act, 1954 about active service would not be adequate to deal with the question of either an emergency or active service because &ldquo;active service&rdquo; as defined in section 5 includes a person attached to or forming part of a force engaged in operations against an enemy, etc.  Subsection (5) dealing with &ldquo;active service&rdquo; also refers to a period of emergency.  I cannot understand why section 4, which says that the association shall not represent any member who is on active service, is not sufficient.  Why do you have to suspend the entire operation in the case of an emergency declared under the section?  Why not simply say that in the case of an emergency all members are on active service and that, therefore, the association no longer represents them? Why does the association have to be suspended? Why not say that during an emergency the association cannot represent the members?  One of the definitions of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is under a state of emergency as declared in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed my view on the question of having two different kinds of emergency. Given that we are in a permanent state of emergency under the Constitution, how can the Government declare a second state of emergency within the existing one?  It is beyond me and I should like a lawyer to explain it.  Does that mean that we are in two states of emergency, that the first one gets rid of the second one or <i>vice versa</i>?  There is a serious fundamental question regarding our laws when you could have two states of emergency. I do not see any purpose in suspending the entire association when section 4 says that the association cannot represent the members if they are on active service and the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; in the principal Act incorporates the state of emergency as defined by the Act.  There is no reason for what is proposed. Suspending the association seems <Col N="1486" /> to be an over-the-top reaction to a necessary provision that members on active service are acting as members of the armed forces, and therefore, cannot be involved in para-trade union activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We went some of the way to meet the point of view expressed by Senator Ryan by eliminating the word &ldquo;dissolve&rdquo; which was the original word used which I thought was too draconian. Suspending the association is less draconian and, to that extent, it goes some way towards meeting the Senator's complaint. I tabled an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil to include &ldquo;suspend&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;dissolve&rdquo;.  Obviously, in an emergency it is a logical clause.  I should also say that it has nothing to do with the constitutional emergency to which the Senator referred.  I will not debate the rights or wrongs of that because it is not relevant to the issue.  We are concerned about the state of emergency under section 4 of the Defence Act, 1954.  In that type of emergency we suggest that the representative associations would not be operative.  I am leaving the matter of the national emergency aside because one could get into a long constitutional debate about its efficacy.  However, the state of emergency aspect is real and is defined under section 4 of the 1954 Act.  It means that obviously representative associations would be suspended, not dissolved. That is why I came half-way towards the point of view expressed by Senator Ryan.</P>

      <P>What is the difference between suspending the association and the association not being able to represent their members?  Section 4 says that an association shall not represent a member on active service which includes certain things not covered by an emergency. If an emergency is declared all the armed forces will be on active service. What is the difference?  Does it simply mean that the staff will not be paid?</P>

      <P>I cannot entirely agree with my colleague in the Labour Party <Col N="1488" /> in regard to this.  I accepted the principle of section 2 (4) and it raises the issues which we discussed at length on section 2.  I will not go back over them.  When I was reading the Defence Act I discovered that all members of the Defence Forces are precluded from joining secret societies. The definition of a secret society is very wide and I do not expect the Minister to comment now.  It seems it would include societies of a religious nature, which are quite secretive, and other organisations of a crypto-religious nature which are also secretive.  It might be no harm to remind members of the Permanent Defence Forces and the Reserve that they are precluded from joining secret societies, not as they define them but as they are defined in the Act.</P>
      <P>If we are going to prohibit people from joining trade unions or joining organisations like this, we ought to make sure that the prohibitions that already exist under the Defence Acts are actually in force for all members of the Defence Forces and that they are not members of any religious or semi-religious organisations which have a secret dimension to them, because the definition of a secret society under the Act is quite broad.</P>

      <P>On the other point, I want to emphasise that the purpose of section 6 &mdash; and we already debated this fully in the earlier sections is to protect the bodies we are establishing here.  We want to establish them as one cohesive union, on the one hand speaking for the privates and NCOs and on the other hand speaking for the officers.  We want two strong cohesive bodies that will speak for the men on an independent basis, fully funded, and with full access to the media. They are developing the expertise to participate in conciliation and arbitration and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want a situation where they <Col N="1489" /> are going to be threatened by other bodies or associations.  We do not want a fragmentation of views channelled into other bodies.  We do not want to see a situation arising where you are going to have a special body for Athlone barracks, a special body for barracks in Cork, a special body for barracks in Dublin, for this unit, that unit, the Curragh Command, the Southern Command and Western Command and causing all sorts of divisions between various sectors of the Army, Navy and Air Corps.  The list is endless as to how we could divide it up. Surely it is of paramount importance that when we are doing this, we do it right. Now that we are going about it for the first time since the formation of the State, we should do it right.  I would stress to Senator Upton, in particular, as representing the trade unions and trade unionism, that it has long been the wish of the trade union movement to achieve that sort of status within the trade union movement.  That was the original idea behind OBU &mdash; one big union &mdash; and the recent link-up between the Federated Workers Union of Ireland and the Irish Transport Union and so on.  What the trade union movement is doing at the present is getting together and joining up and having more effective trade union units.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure now that we are setting up structures, that we do it right and that we protect them.  Section 6 is designed to protect this new structure that we are establishing with the two bodies representing the two areas of the military forces.  That is the purpose of this section and the earlier sections, and it has no purpose other than that.  If one thinks of it in depth it is very important for the point of view of these new bodies that they get off the ground, that we structure them properly and that they are not being challenged by break away, splinter or new groups or whatever based in this command or that command or this barracks or that barracks.  That is the purpose of this section.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 7, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.  Where it is proper to make regulations under this Act, a draft of each regulations shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a resolution approving the regulations has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment that ought to be accepted by the Minister, because so much of what is in this Bill is actually only enabling things to be done.  Amendment No. 8 simply suggests that instead of regulations which may be annulled by the Oireachtas, any regulations made under this Bill will have to be approved by the Oireachtas, which means they would have to be debated by the Oireachtas and we would have a clear account of their adequacy or otherwise.  It would not necessarily guarantee that they would be any better than they would otherwise be but it would increase the degree of accountability that surrounds these regulations. I do not think that it is a great pity, and I cannot understand, given his considerable goodwill to produce regulations that are fairly well universally acceptable, why the Minister would not ensure, even for no reason other than to give himself the considerable credit that might well come out of it, that these regulations were actually debated within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They cannot be amended, they can be either approved or disapproved of, but given the extraordinary broad reach of any regulations they are going to cover everything; they are going to cover what the association can do; they are going to cover all the things we talked about earlier &mdash; access to the media, permanent secretariats, funding and so on.  They are <Col N="1491" /> going to have enormously detailed regulations and neither House of the Oireachtas has any guarantee that they will ever be discussed within the Oireachtas.  Perhaps if I had an aspiration or a hope of being a member of a Government at some stage or other I might have more sympathy with the Minister, but my part of the legislative process is via the Oireachtas, and I do not like to see large areas of what is effectively legislation slipping through the Oireachtas by default on this negative provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>These are major regulations to do with a major institutional innovation within the armed forces.  They ought to be discussed within the Houses of the Oireachtas and the proper way to have them discussed is by ensuring that the regulations need the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would also ensure that any regulations in the future which might amend these regulations, which might broaden or narrow them, depending on the mood of a Government at the time and what they wanted to do, would also have to be discussed within the Oireachtas.  I think there is an element of bypassing the Oireachtas here to make life simpler in the future.  That is a great pity.  It is why I tabled amendment No. 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to proceed step by step with this whole matter.  We will start retracing our steps if the amendment put down by the Senator is accepted.  We have the provision in section 7, which is a stock provision in all enabling legislation to allow for the regulations to be laid here, not just allowed for, but making it mandatory that they be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the annulling regulation can take place within 21 days.  I appreciate that it requires a resolution of the House within 21 days, otherwise it becomes effective, but if you proceeded in the direction suggested by Senator Ryan you are following a route that is only very exceptionally taken in legislation and not at all in <Col N="1492" /> enabling legislation.  In enabling legislation the route taken is the route that is taken here in section 7, because we are consciously proceeding here by way of enabling legislation.  That is the whole thrust of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything wrong or derogatory in this.  I know I am getting on to quasi-philosophical discussion here, but Senator Ryan is talking about the merits of this type of legislation.  I would defend this type of legislation where you require the goodwill of a large body of people, such as the members of the Defence Forces who are crucial in the whole establishment of these representative bodies. In that sort of a situation the less the Oireachtas has to do with the detail of it, the better.  The purpose of the Oireachtas is to provide the framework in principle. This is the whole idea behind this type of legislation for this particular type of case. We want the detail to be filled in by the people who are primarily concerned with the working of this legislation and the detail will be incorporated in the regulations. That is very much the aspect that is most important to the actual membership of the proposed new bodies.  They are the people who will be operating the new representative bodies.  It is in their interest that it is being done.  They are the people who should make the contribution as to how the structure should be established and their contributions should be embodied in the regulations.  The detail will concern them and they will have to live with it month in month out, year in, year out, right into the future.  In that type of situation enabling legislation is ideal.</P>
      <P>Too much detail by us into what is essentially their business can be counterproductive and too restrictive.  If we provide the framework, they can make the inputs into it.  I would always defend such legislation in a case of this kind, where you are making provision for administration by bodies outside this House, in this case two representative bodies to be established by this House.  Ideally this is the right sort of legislation and this is the appropriate clause to have in it in regard to the regulation that emerges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> We do not want to retrace all the steps in the regulations if the regulations have been agreed to by the people concerned, the people in the newly elected representative bodies, the personnel who, through the representatives, expressed their points of view in detail as to how the regulations should be structured and how they should operate.  That is their business and it is they who will be handling its operation.  Provided we are satisfied with the framework within which these bodies operate &mdash; there are certain reserved functions for the Minister which are included as safeguards and which we debated earlier &mdash; I believe this is the right way to proceed.  As I have said from the word go, there has been a difference of opinion in that regard but I think our approach is the correct one in the circumstances. Too much detail would be inappropriate in the case of the type of problem we are dealing with in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no disagreement with the Minister about the necessity for a lot of this to be dealt with by regulation but there are principles missing from the regulations.  The Defence Forces have no guarantee that in the future some other Minister may not choose to restrict, inhibit or abolish their right of access to the media or their right to an independent secretariat, simply by regulation.  Incidentally, the regulations would not even have to be discussed by either House of the Oireachtas.  Certain fundamentals such as funding, media access and so on which the Minister accepts are necessary should be referred to, in principle, in the legislation.  The Minister made no case for the passing of the regulations.  It is not true that it is unusual to have the regulations approved.  I have seen that done and this is a major institutional change.  It is the first time in the entire history of the State that we have given the members of the Permanent Defence Forces the right to have an independent organisation, and that is something on which I have complimented the Minister on more than one occasion today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Related to that is the need for and the <Col N="1494" /> right of the Houses of the Oireachtas to be involved.  We are talking about the Defence Forces and unless somebody chooses to raise an argument about them in Opposition time, the regulations will not be debated.  Extraordinarily enough, the last regulations that I remember debating were those under the Intoxicating Liquor Act which were to allow certain restaurants to apply for full licences.  The extraordinary legislative priorities which would suggest that regulations about liquor licences are more important than regulations about a trade union for members of the Defence Forces defy my imagination.  I suspect even the Minister, in his most eloquent flights of fancy, would find it hard to justify that set of priorities.  Something as fundamental as a new association, an institutional innovation, will not be debated in detail in either House of the Oireachtas, whereas something as trival as the decision to do something reasonable and logical like ensuring that restaurants could have liquor licences was debated here and in the Dáil.  I do not understand those priorities and that is why I put down the amendment.  Having said that, I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily and therefore I withdraw it.</P>

    <P>I put down this amendment to remind myself to ask the Minister if there is a timescale or a target date for the setting up of this association.  Does he hope to have the association up and running by the end of the summer or the end of the year?  I am not asking him to give me a particular date but, given the urgency <Col N="1495" /> with which he has ensured this legislation goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas and given his resistance to amendments in this House for fear it might be delayed, I assume he has a timescale.  It seems we ought to be talking, at the very latest, about six months time.  Once the burden of the Presidency is off the Government's shoulders &mdash; the Minister for Defence will hardly be presiding over anything connected with his area of activity, unless something has happened that I have not heard about &mdash; this association ought to be set up fairly quickly.

I want to in no way force anybody's hand or wave a big stick and declare any body or bodies illegal.  If this process of consultation is lengthened, and I hope that will not be the case, I would like it to be lengthened to a full consultation procedure.  However that is the pessimistic side and I am not inclined to be pessimistic.  All the information I have <Col N="1496" /> is optimistic.

Eckermann was to Göethe what Boswell was to Johnson.  He said he had no doubt but that Germany would become one.  His words were very prophetic. He thought Germany would become one because of trade and the excellent roads and railways coming into existence.  If we look at the West German economy at the moment we can see why anybody would want to be one with them.  Before we look to the future let us look at history.  The unconditional surrender of the German armed forces which brought the Second World War in Europe to an end on 8 May 1945 led to the political collapse of Germany.  In contrast to the end of the First World War the whole of Germany was now occupied by the four Allied forces and the Germans were relieved of all governmental functions.  The second defeat signalled the end of the German nation state which had been established by Bismarck in 1871 and decisions were soon taken by the occupying forces, which still influence matters to the present day, principally because their political and social aims soon proved to be incompatible.  Germany soon became an ideological battle ground between the two super powers, the United States of America on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conflict between them led eventually to the division of Germany in 1949 into two states each of which in turn was incorporated into an opposing political and military bloc.  On the Soviet side the <Col N="1498" /> political structure became a Communist structure which included collectivisation of land and property and the nationalisation of industries and banks.  The Western allies encouraged the establishment of a parliamentary democracy and the process was completed on 23 May 1949 by the passing of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>
    <P>West German politicians and parties agreed by a large majority to accept the temporary &mdash; I stress the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;&mdash; division of their country even though this was a hard pill for most of them to swallow.</P>
    <P>They accepted, however, that this was the only practical way of getting the country back on its feet, at least in the Western zone, and they hoped that by building a thriving economy they might be assisting in the eventual re-unification of their country.  There had been attempts by Germans to stop the division of their country.  The most notable meeting was the Munich Conference of Prime Ministers which was, in fact, the only meeting of all the leaders of the German Länder.  Their attempts failed because of the limits imposed by the forces of occupation and also because of the differing political views which were developing in both zones and which were quickly becoming irreconcilable.</P>
    <P>The East/West confrontations reached a peak at the time of the dispute over Berlin, the former capital.  The Soviets imposed a blockade of all land and water routes into Berlin on 24 June 1948 because of currency reform in the Western zone.  The Western allies responded to this with an airlift to the two million people who were then the inhabitants of Berlin.  For 11 months those two million people were supplied exclusively by air transport until the Soviets lifted their blockade on 12 May 1949.  During the siege the division became complete and separate administrations were set up in the Eastern and Western parts of the famous old city.  Berlin was truly divided. That was sad but at least the complete annexation of Berlin into Soviet territory had been avoided.</P>
    <P>The Western powers in the early part <Col N="1499" /> of 1948 instructed the Prime Ministers of the Länder to draft a new constitution for a West German state.  The Prime Ministers were reluctant and only because of the blockade of Berlin and the pressure from the then mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter did they agree to establish a &ldquo;provisional arrangement&rdquo;.  The Federal Republic was officially established on 23 May 1949 and the Soviets followed suit by setting up the German Democratic Republic on 7 October 1949.  The division of Germany was now complete.</P>
    <P>The occupation of the Federal Republic continued until 23 October, 1954 when the new state received full sovereignty. The occupation ended but still remained in some ways because the three Western powers retained the right to station their armed forces in the Federal Republic even though the Federal Republic joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on 5 May, 1955.  The whole future relationship between the Federal Republic and the three Western powers was defined in the Bonn Convention of 26 May, 1952.  Article 7 of that Convention states:</P>
    <P>The signatory States are agreed that an essential aim of their common policy is a peace settlement for the whole of Germany, freely negotiated between Germany and her former enemies, which should lay the foundation for a lasting peace.  They further agree that the final determination of the boundaries of Germany must await such a settlement.</P>
    <P>In the same Article they note that they... will co-operate to achieve, by peaceful means, their common aim of a re-unified Germany enjoying a liberal-democratic constitution like that of the Federal Republic, and integrated within the European Community.</P>
    <P>All of the agreements between the victorious powers and the two German states had provisional character under international law.  They were regarded as a <i>modus vivendi.</i></P>
    <P>Richard Von Weizsäcker, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, in an <Col N="1500" /> address to the Berlin Senate on the twentieth anniversary of the construction of the Berlin Wall &mdash; he was then the governing mayor of Berlin and the date was 13 August, 1981 &mdash; stated:</P>
    <P>Observers in East Berlin called August 13, 1961 the secret founding day of the German Democratic Republic. The wall is the archetypal and anti-human construction.  It is politic's petrified rejection of humanity.  The reasons for the construction of the wall are quickly told.  Fearing a worldwide lack of credibility the Socialist Union Party SED, the Communists, made a full scale attempt to stem the continuing flow of people out of their own sphere of power.  The aim of the SED was the consolidation of their own State.</P>
    <P>Richard Von Weizsäcker said:</P>
    <P>In truth it could not possibly represent an instrument of consolidation. The Berliners are not becoming accustomed to it.  Indeed, how could a thinking and feeling person have expected that they would?</P>
    <P>The famous man who banged his shoes, Khrushchev, obviously recognised that very early on.  Speaking to the German Ambassador he said, &ldquo;I know that the Wall is an ugly thing.  One day it will disappear again, though not before the reasons that have led to its construction cease to apply.&rdquo;  The Wall has gone and I have a piece of it in my briefcase which I intend to keep for all time.  I might even have it mounted and put on my wall.  If we follow Khrushchev then the reasons for its construction no longer apply. Khrushchev meant: The Wall is necessary in order to consolidate the GDR. Apparently, the Soviet Union has decided either that such a consolidation is impossible or that with the new Soviet policy it is no longer wanted.  Possibly both reasons apply: The Wall was not strong enough to keep the East Germans in &mdash; the Hungarians saw to that &mdash; and the Soviet Union decided to give way to the self-determination of peoples.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> I would like to quote Göethe who explains it better than I could.  He said:</P>
    <P>Who will withstand the masses?  Not I, I stand back and observe.  The masses busy themselves, hurry here, hurry there, until finally they are once more one.</P>
    <P>Von Weizsäcker also said:</P>
    <P>The Wall reminds us every day that city, country and continent are divided. Inadvertently, however, it also proves to us every day that we belong together, above and beyond it.  It will not last.  The freedom and worth of the individual compel us.  They will prove the stronger&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Berlin Wall was not the result of the Second World War as many people think.  People forget that the war ended in 1945 while the wall only went up in 1961.  Equally, Germany after World War Two was to be treated as a unit &mdash; this was agreed at Potsdam &mdash; the divisions only came with the Cold War. The creation of the GDR was the outcome of the Cold War and of the attempt to divide Europe into two ideological groupings.  This intention has failed and, with its failure, the division of Germany comes to an end.  It no longer makes sense.</P>
    <P>Charles de Gaulle said: &ldquo;The German question is the European problem par excellence&rdquo;.  Germany is divided because Europe is divided and Europe is divided because Germany is divided.  We cannot want Europe and not want unity.  De Gaulle also said: &ldquo;In such a united Europe France will always be France, Italy always Italy.  In such a Europe Germany can be nothing else but Germany&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the new European order &mdash; the European Community &mdash; all member states have transferred substantial elements of their sovereignty.  All European peoples, including the German people, have the right to live in their national state.  These national states are connected as equal partners in the Community. as long as the Iron Curtain existed, the Poles, Czechs, Slovacs, the Hungarians and the Germans were <Col N="1502" /> denied the right to decide themselves over their own future.  Now that the Soviet Union makes that attempt to harmonise its own security interests with the interests of the other nations in Europe a new era has begun.  This united Europe will guarantee the peace between the great world powers.  It is no longer a necessity to maintain the largest conglomeration of military might on German soil.  Once the absurd military effort is a thing of the past, all nations, especially the Soviet Union, will be able to devote their resources to the rebuilding of their societies.  In a European Community there is no place for the old game of balance of power which led to catastrophic developments in Europe twice in one century, rather what strengthens one state should be regarded as a strengthening of the Community.</P>
    <P>In relation to what I said about the Soviet Union I would now like to quote from the text of Chancellor Kohl's statement to the press in Moscow on 10 February.  He said:</P>
    <P>This evening I have a singular message to convey to all Germans.  General Secretary Gorbachev and I are in agreement that it is the sole right of the German people to decide whether or not they want to live in one state.</P>
    <P>General Secretary Gorbachev gave me an unequivocal pledge that the Soviet Union will respect the German decision to live in one state and that is a matter for the Germans themselves to determine the point in time and the road to take for unification.</P>
    <P>General Secretary Gorbachev and I were also in agreement that the German question can only be solved on the basis of the realities that exist, in other words they must be embedded in the overall architecture of Europe and in the overall process of East-West relations.  We must take into account the justified interests of neighbours as well as our friends and partners in Europe and the world.  It is now up to us, the Germans in the Federal Republic and in the GDR to travel this <Col N="1503" /> common road with prudent judgment and with determination.</P>
    <P>What do the other peoples of Europe think of German unification?  What about the people of Poland?  Professor Geremek, chairman of the Solidarity parliamentary group was quoted as saying that he was &ldquo;in favour of the Germans reuniting&rdquo; in an article which went on:</P>
    <P>He allowed that safeguards would have to be built in to ensure that a unified Germany would not be a threat to any other country, but &ldquo;my main point is that the Germans have the right to unification&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Michnik, a member of Parliament and chief editor of the pro-Solidarity daily <i>Gazeta Wyborcza</i> expressed himself still more clearly on the subject. Geremek was right, wrote Michnik.  It is not just a moral imperative; Polish reasons of state dictate that we grant the Germans what we claim for ourselves; namely the right to a state&rdquo;. German's abnormal situation, he said cast a shadow on Polish-German relations.</P>
    <P>Those quotations are from an article on Poland's view on German reunification by Stefan Deitrich in <i>German Comments.</i></P>
    <P>What about the French view?  President Mitterrand on 22 December 1989 in Berlin said:</P>
    <P>It's of great interest to me, but the democratic process is ultra simple: the East Germans and West Germans are going to vote.  When they have voted, they will have Members of Parliament. Majorities will emerge from those Members of Parliament, and Governments from those majorities and they will have programmes, platforms.  If on both sides the platform is &ldquo;immediate unification&rdquo; the problem will be posed democratically.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting with Chancellor Kohl on 4 January 1990 President Mitterrand was asked a question on the <Col N="1504" /> inviolability of the frontiers in Europe and he replied:</P>
    <P>I said this in Berlin.  There is an intrinsic difference between the frontiers established by treaties, agreements, acts after 1945, which were very specifically, with quite a few mistakes, defined nationalities, and the problem of the German frontier that was invented to separate one and the same people.</P>
    <P>I will repeat that because President Mitterand said it, &ldquo;and...the German frontier that was invented to separate one and the same people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What about the other members of the European Community?  I wish to quote from the Conclusions of the Presidency of the European Council at Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December 1989.  The declaration on Central and Eastern Europe is pertinent.  It is:</P>
    <P>Each day in Central and Eastern Europe change is asserting itself more strongly.  Everywhere a powerful aspiration towards freedom, democracy, respect of human rights, prosperity, social justice and peace is being expressed.  The people are clearly showing their will to take their own destiny in hand and to choose the path of their development.  Such a profound development would not have been possible without the policy of openness and reform led by Mr. Gorbachev.</P>
    <P>We seek the strengthening of the state of peace in Europe in which the German people will regain its unity through free self-determination.  This process should take place peacefully and democratically, in full respect of the relevant agreements and treaties and of all the principles defined by the Helsinki Final Act, in a context of dialogue and East-West cooperation. It also has to be placed in the perspective of European integration.</P>
    <P>What have the East Germans to say about this?  On 18 November 1989 Dr. Hans Modrow, chairman of the Council of Ministers, had this to say at the Twelfth <Col N="1505" /> Session of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic:</P>
    <P>I welcome the agreed meeting between Council of State Chairman Egon Krenz and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and I wish to add that the Government of the GDR is ready for talks on all issues within its competence, and that will now be a full competence.  This offer is also addressed to political and economic policy-makers in the FRG and other European countries who, for example, contemplate or wish to examine an involvement in the GDR's economy or have proposals to make to this effect.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Despite all the dissimilarity of their social systems the two German states share a centuries-old common history. Both of them should realise the inherent chance to lend their relationship the character of a distinct good-neighbourliness&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We all know what has happened since then.  On 18 March this year the Germans in the GDR impressively opted for freedom and unity, for democracy and a social market economy, for Europe and peace.  What about here in Ireland?  The Irish Council of the European Movement, of which I am an executive member, announced that they had sent a memorandum to the Taoiseach urging him to launch a comprehensive initiative during Ireland's Presidency of the European Community to support German unification and the development of the new democracies in Eastern Europe.  I have no doubt that a very positive response will be forthcoming from our Taoiseach, both in his role as President and in his role as Taoiseach, because he more than any other person is well aware of the troubles that can be caused by divisions in a country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply upon his return from the meeting in Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> The Council expressed its support for the German people to regain their unity through self-determination in conditions of peace and stability, with full respect for all relevant agreements and treaties and respecting the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and in the context of dialogue and East-West co-operation.  It is emphasised that this has to be placed in the perspective of Community integration.</P>
    <P>He also said that on the occasion of the opening of the Berlin Wall he sent a message to Chancellor Kohl conveying our support and best wishes on an historic occasion for all Germans.  Although I do not speak for the Government, I am sure we will not be wanting in support of our friends in Germany.</P>
    <P>Hans Dietrich Genscher, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany, addressing a special session of the WEU Assembly in Luxembourg on 23 March 1990, said:</P>
    <P>German history has never belonged to us Germans alone, nor will our future belong to us alone.  The destiny of the German nation is inextricably linked to Europe's destiny.  The two German states want to become a driving force behind the development that overcomes the division of Europe.  The Germans in East-West have long been in agreement on this point.  German soil must never again be the source of war but the source of peace.  We seek the process of German unification of the context of the Economic Community integration, the CSCE process, partnership for stability, the construction of a common European house and the creation of a pan-European peaceful order.  We Germans do not want to go it alone or to follow a separate path.  We want to take the European path.  We seek dynamically evolving stability for the whole of Europe.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>In its resolution of 8 March 1990 the German Bundestag advocated that as soon as possible after the elections in <Col N="1507" /> the GDR the two freely elected German Parliaments and Governments issued an identical declaration essentially stating the following:</P>
    <P>The Polish people are assured that the right to live in secure borders will not be questioned by us Germans through territorial claims either now or in future.  We realise that the finality of Poland's western border at the Oder and Neisse rivers is a fundamentalist pre-requisite of peace in Europe.</P>
    <P>Dr. Helmut Kohl, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, at the opening of the CSCE Conference on economic co-operation in Europe in Bonn on 19 March 1990, said:</P>
    <P>For nearly 40 years we have resolutely helped build the European Community.  We have surrendered considerable sovereign powers, especially in the economic field, and are willing to take further steps towards integration which must strengthen parliamentary responsibility in particular. As early as 1957 with our partners in the Treaties of Rome we left the door open for the GDR.  We start from the assumption that a united Germany will be a member of the Community without the necessity of any further amendments to these and subsequent Treaties.</P>
    <P>In 1953 Thomas Mann stated, &ldquo;We want not a German Europe but a European Germany&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Richard von Weisecker, on assuming office in 1984, described the task of the Germans as follows:</P>
    <P>The German people live in both German states.  We wish to make our contribution towards the future in order to live inwardly and outwardly in peace, to overcome the division of Germany, to further the unification of Europe and to fulfil our responsibility in the world.  There are two basic facts that characterise the situation.  One is that of belonging to the West and <Col N="1508" /> having chosen the basic values of the liberal and social state based on the rule of law.  The choice is definitive and irrevocable.  It is on this spiritual and humane ground that German membership of the European Community and the Atlantic Alliance is based.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>Our desire for this partnership is no opportunistic episode of brief duration and by no means a counter to our German identity but rather an indispensable part of it.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>As beautiful as Tenerife is and as important as Silicon Valley may be for our development, the innovative reconstruction of the Semper Opera in Dresden and the life of the Christian congregations in the GDR also touch deeply.  An elementary human affiliation joins us Germans in East and West which enforced partition and the passage of time have not allowed to die away.  What binds a people in two German states to one another can only flourish in peace time.  The Germans have no more anxiety or love of peace than other peoples but their affiliation transcending pact borders endows them with a special impulse towards peace.</P>
    <P>Anybody who doubts that statement could look at the statement of 1 September 1989 by Helmut Kohl on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of World War II entitled &ldquo;Remembrance, Sorrow, Warning, Responsibility&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
    <P>The founders of the Federal Republic of Germany shaped this, the second German democracy, in the light of the experience of German history.  They led our country back to the path of liberal traditions which neither war nor tyranny had been able to destroy.</P>
    <P>We can take pride in our liberal constitution, in which we</P>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledge the absolute precedence of human dignity in all areas of life;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" />&mdash;reject war and force as a political tool as well as any revanchism, a decision that was endorsed not least by German expelees in the 1950 Stuttgart Charter;</P>
    <P>&mdash;are committed to the goal of a free and united Germany in a free and united Europe.</P>
    <P>He paid tribute to those people of the resistance who during the war fought for peace and fought to bring Germany back to that road.  In particular he made reference to a number of people whose names I should like to place on the record.  They are the cabinet-maker Johann Georg Elser, Colonel Claus Graf Schenck von Stauffenberg, the Kreisau Circle around Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, the White Rose personified by Sophie and Hans Scholl, such steadfast people as Julius Leaber and Carl Goerdeler, and the many others who, on grounds of conscience, courageously opposed tyranny.  He mentioned one other man who has been mentioned time and again in the Seanad.  He was a young man who in 1944 at the age of 32 risked his life to rescue in Budapest 100,000 Jews who were threatened with death.  In 1945 he was deported to the Soviet Union and has been missing ever since.  I did not raise the matter here before but some other Senators did and I supported them. I hope this man will one day be made a citizen of Ireland.  He has been made a citizen of several other countries.  I refer to Raoul Wallenberg.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that this motion will be passed unanimously and that Seanad Éireann will offer it as a small gift towards a reunited Germany.  I should like to see a reunited Germany take its place among the nations of Europe in a free and united European Community.  I started with a quotation and I will end with one from Friedrich von Schiller's <i>William Tell:</i></P>
    <P>A single unified united people or brothers let us be nor be divided in any danger or emergency.</P>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were not out of order I join the Leas-Chathaoirleach in extending a very warm welcome to our German parliamentary colleagues who have graced the sitting this evening.  I will have to refrain from doing so.</P>
      <P>I support the motion that Seanad Éireann welcomes the unification of Germany and I compliment our Minister for Foreign Affairs on convening the special Summit meeting in Dublin Castle on 28 March last on all the questions involved, not least that of the inclusion of East Germany in the Community.  I hope that the European Community will give a warm welcome and take very positive steps to assist in the unification of this country by providing whatever aid is practicable and possible.  Of course I accept that it is a matter for the German people themselves, that we have seen in the recent East German elections that the people have spoken in no uncertain way.  They have very clearly voted in favour of the policies supported by Chancellor Kohl of West Germany.  How could we, as a nation, take any other line but to support this movement because the right of self-determination is a democratic principle, endorsed by the Charter of the United Nations, which has long been supported, upheld and defended by successive Irish Governments and, indeed, by Ministers for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the implications of German unity at this time will affect all the people of Europe, the Community of Twelve, the EFTA countries and the rest of Europe.  As full members of the European Community we cannot but recognise the fact that the involvement of the Federal Republic of Germany in unification with East Germany will have a profound effect on the policies and economy of the 11 other EC member states.  The Community had an opportunity to discuss this entire programme at length at the last meeting in Strasbourg at the end of last year.  I would guess that the unification of Germany will move on the fast lane, and I presume that the <Col N="1511" /> Germans would themselves desire to have the task completed well before 1 January 1993.  In that way it would have a less profound effect on the Community partners.</P>
    <P>It is very gratifying to note that so far unification has advanced in a most peaceful and democratic manner and, it has moved out from under the four allied partners of the last war.  I am very happy that their strategies should be so irrelevant at this particular time.  I believe that the unification of Germany will strengthen peace in all of Europe and will in a practical way implement the principles defined by the Helsinki Final Act.  I hope that the Community will, through dialogue and East-West co-operation, put the series of agreements we have been considering for decades into practice and that the entire exercise will move along in the context of European integration.</P>
    <P>This debate will help to stimulate and focus public attention on the evolution of Europe and on Ireland's place and role in it.  However it is regrettable that this is the first opportunity the Seanad has had to make any input into the policies of Europe and the evolution of Europe this year.  This is the first time our Members have had an opportunity to express a welcome, a profound welcome, to the developments the world has witnessed. It is really great to see the rule of law and the respect for human and civil rights emerging in those ancient countries of Europe.  Indeed the revolutions we have witnessed and which continue to happen day by day are based on the idea of liberty and independence.  As far as I can see when the general public in any country decide that they require freedom, both personal and national, with the help of people power of the nineties it is not possible for any force to intervene or to stop them.  We should have generous support and encouragement for <Col N="1512" /> the people who have decided to transform their own living and working conditions.</P>
    <P>The new movement in Eastern Europe should be a source of consolation, support and help to the policy makers and decision makers here in Western Europe because it clearly demonstrates that the policies of the European Community are on the right track and that the policies designed in the socialist republics, Marxism, Leninism and Communism, have been clearly shown to have failed the people they were designed to assist and to liberate.  I think we should take that lesson from it and be clearly supportive of the Community institutions and redouble our efforts to ensure that the dynamic dimension of the Community should continue over the next crucial decade in the history of Europe.</P>
    <P>I have been a supporter and an advocate of European Union since it was first raised here in 1962.  It is true that I have always admired the work of the founding fathers of the European Community and it would be most gratifying for them to see the success of their efforts &mdash; on which I suppose many people did not put great value after the last World War.  The great change in the East has come about since the Chernobyl accident when Western countries so generously poured in aid and assistance, experts and material help to those people who were so adversely affected by that catastrophe.  That, to my mind, was the first occasion the Russians and Eastern Europeans witnessed the desire of the rest of Europe and, indeed, the free world, to give genuine assistance without any strings attached.  There is a school of thought which suggests that action in support of all this reform began in and in the main is being concentrated on Poland and Hungary where for the last decade they have been looking towards the West.</P>
    <P>The response of the group of 24, chaired by the Commission of European Communities, has been recognised for what it is: a genuine desire to help and <Col N="1513" /> to be of economic assistance.  Of course there is a tremendous problem facing the East German population.  When we consider that the East German people were at the mercy of propaganda for the past 40 years or more, there will be major difficulties in merging with the highly educated, wealthy and sophisticated population of the Federal Republic.  I, for one, wish Chancellor Kohl and his Government success and congratulate them on what they are so unselfishly setting out to do.</P>
    <P>The German question has come to the fore, just as the Single European Act comes into its own.  Two features of this new Europe are of particular relevance in the present situation; the growing complexity of its political system which renders the simplistic notions of national sovereignty rather obscure and the increasingly high international profile of the European Community institutions. The Single European Act, through its introduction of qualified majority voting and its extension of the powers of the European Parliament, transformed the political system of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Once the principle of majority voting was accepted in certain key areas of Community business the practice spilled over. Even though the national interest was fiercely fought for in regard to the virtual abandonment of the veto, there has been a marked tendency across the Community to tamper with unilateral initiatives and ambitions, which indeed bend with the prevailing wind.</P>
    <P>The decision that no one State can dominate and no one State can block represents a tremendous advance in Community decision-making.  It is difficult to see how a United Germany augmented by the addition of 16 million citizens, but without I believe any increase in voting power in the Community institutions, can change that particular trend.  Leadership is one thing but dominance is another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Of immediate significance to the European Community is its formal stake in the definition of the new Germanys' external frontier.  This question has been raised to some extent already.  This is only one aspect of an extremely complex list of issues which will have to be discussed between the two Germanys and the Community institutions.  Nobody seriously doubts that East Germany will be absorbed rather than admitted into the Community.  Important questions will arise about the implications for the Community budget of the extension of the Common Agricultural Policy to an area which has traditionally been of crucial importance to German agriculture and the arrangements involved in affording East German industries temporary assistance. For that reason we must not forget that the initiative does not lie only with the Germans themselves.</P>
    <P>The position of NATO must be addressed.  A strong united Germany must be a part of NATO, While I readily agree that the importance of defence and security issues will decline over the next decade as economic and monetary union looms large on the horizon the Community will still be faced with the prospect of a full member nation paying at least one billion DM a year for 360,000 Soviet troops on Community territory. Perhaps they can all be negotiated away. This is the kind of <i>de facto</i> situation we will find ourselves in if solutions are not found.  I am sure solutions can be found and I wish the people involved in the negotiations every success in doing that. An imaginative gesture of generosity by Germany's partners would not go amiss in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Having been an observer for the past few years, I believe that the Bonn-Brussels axis is now much stronger than the Paris-Brussels axis.  The obvious visible good relations between Dr. Kohl, and Mr. Delors and Mr. Genscher augur well for the success of whatever negotiations are entered into.  The EC-US discussions <Col N="1515" /> on the new relationship, the EC negotiations with eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the European Community negotiators with EFTA are all taking place in tandem.  We are living in very interesting and truly historic times. European history is being made almost on a daily basis.  Events which we would have thought were completely impossible six or 12 months ago have now taken place throughout central and eastern Europe.  Because the European Community has become the mainspring of European integration the impact on recent developments has been crucial and is now the natural focus for the emerging European order.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act of 1987 and the objective of completing the Internal Market by 1992 has made the Community the centre of attraction for the rest of Europe and the envy of the rest of the world.  The Community's relations with the countries of central and eastern Europe are developing rapidly as the pace of their transition to democracy and a market-orientated economy quickens. This year the Community have trade cooperation agreements not only with the East German Republic but with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland and the USSR.</P>
    <P>The reason I should like a united Germany to be part of NATO is because I believe military power will play a dwindling role in Europe as economic power gains importance in the decades ahead.</P>

        <b>Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary):</b> Thank you, Senator.</P>
      <P>I should like to begin by commending the Seanad on organising this debate on such a significant and timely subject.  This debate is taking place on the day the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the European Parliament on the same subject.</P>
      <P>The recent elections in East Germany, whose results have given a major impetus to the unification process, where a clear and decisive expression of that will to freedom and self-determination which was so evident in the dramatic opening of the Berlin Wall on 9 November last. The collapse of the Wall has become a powerful symbol of our time &mdash; a symbol of hope for all Europeans, east and west. Since the developments in relation to German unification have been moving very fast, and it is important that this House should have an opportunity to take stock of them and consider their implications for Ireland and the European community.</P>
      <P>I have listened with great attention to the well thought out and well researched speech of Senator Lydon and to the very relevant comments which have been made by Senator McDonald, based on his vast experience of European matters and I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's views on this topic.</P>
      <P>As Senators will recall, the Government's policy on German unification was outlined in the Dáil by the Taoiseach in reply to a question on 13 December last. As the Taoiseach noted on that occasion, the right to self-determination is a principle endorsed by the Charter of the United Nations.  Ireland supports the right of the peoples of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the German Democratic Republic to determine their own future by a free democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach also pointed out on 13 December, the Twelve Heads of State or Government of the European Community, at their summit meeting in Strasburg, reaffirmed their support for the <Col N="1517" /> strengthening of the state of peace in Europe in which the German people will regain its unity through free self-determination. They said that this process should take place peacefully and democratically, in a context of dialogue and East-West co-opearation, in full respect of the relevant agreements and treaties and of all the principles defined in the Helsinki Final Act.  The Strasbourg Declaration also specified that progress towards German unity should be placed in the perspective of European integration.</P>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear that Ireland wholeheartedly welcomes the prospect of German unification.  Progress towards German unification must be seen as part of the remarkable transformation which is taking place in central and eastern Europe as a whole, which in turn has been influenced by the process of reform and openness pursued in Moscow under Mr. Gorbachev.  Just as the origins of events in Germany must be seen in a wider context, so must their results: the coming together of the two German states must contribute, and be seen to contribute, to the overcoming of the division of Europe.  The regaining of their unity by the German people should become a sign of hope for all the peoples of this continent.  It presents us with an historic opportunity to forge a new set of relationships based on a spirit of genuine co-operation and an end to confrontation.</P>
    <P>While German unification is first of all a matter for the German people themselves, its implications will affect all the people of Europe in particular the Federal Republic's partners in the European Community.  Unification and the consequent incorporation of what is now the German Democratic Republic into the Community will present us with major challenges, which will have to be addressed.  The meeting of Heads of State or Government of the European Community which the Taoiseach has convened for 28 April, will provide an <Col N="1518" /> opportunity for a first examination at the level of Heads of State or Government of the implications of unity for the Community. Major issues to be discussed will include how the Community can best contribute to the adaptation of the the GDR regions to the system of policy and law which the Community has evolved over nearly four decades.  We will also have to ensure that the targets set for the Community's own development &mdash; the completion of the Internal Market by December 1992 and the launching of economic and monetary union &mdash; will stay on track while we address the challenge of German unification.</P>
    <P>Discussion at this meeting will be assigned by papers being prepared by the Commission on the implications of unification for the community.  In preparation for this summit, the Taoiseach is also currently undertaking a tour of Community capitals to ascertain the views of partners.  As the Taoiseach said after his meeting with Chancellor Kohl on 28 March, &ldquo;we hope that the Dublin summit `will send out a reassuring statement to the European community and to our friends that unification will take place very smoothly and with no fall-out for anyone, particularly in the financial and economic areas'.&rdquo;  Of course, detailed consideration, within the community framework, of the impact of unification will continue after 28 April.</P>
    <P>An essential aspect of the unification process is that it is firmly rooted in the context of European integration.  The Federal Republic was made it clear that what they are seeking is a &ldquo;European Germany, not a German Europe&rdquo;.  Chancellor Kohl has reiterated his Government's commitment to the Community, of which it will remain one of the motive forces, and in particular to completion of the Internal Market and to the goals of economic and monetary union and political union.  He has repeatedly stressed his Government's desire to maintain close co-operation and consultation with Community partners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> An indication of this commitment to the Community is shown in Chancellor Kohl's recent statement that German unification and European political union were two sides of the same coin.  This and other ideas which have been put forward in recent weeks suggests that there is a strong conviction that the opportunity has to be grasped to push forward with political union, in parallel with the work which the Community is pledged to start in December on economic and monetary union.  As the Taoiseach indicated last week, the Government share this view. We would consider that the appropriate approach would be to hold two parallel intergovernmental conferences &mdash; one should deal with economic and monetary union while the other should consider issues related to institutional and European poitical co-operation matters.  The meeting of Heads of State or Government later this month will provide an opportunity to discuss this proposal further and see if a consensus emerges. Obviously, both of these intergovernmental conferences will have to be carefully prepared.</P>
    <P>German unity will affect all the peoples of Europe.  As Senators will be aware, talks on the external aspects of German unity will shortly begin at ministerial level between the Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.  These will be followed by negotiations between these two Governments and the Governments of the USA, UK, France and the USSR. We understand that the topics discussed will include security matters concerning neighbouring countries as well as the military status of a united Germany.  The need to take account in these negotiations of the concerns of Poland and of other states has been recognised.  It is also expected that the issue of German unification will give a major impetus to the work which will culminate in the CSCE summit later this year.</P>
    <P>Although the Community does not <Col N="1520" /> participate directly in the &ldquo;2+4&rdquo; talks, consultations within the EPC framework on the relevant external aspects of German unification are already taking place.</P>
    <P>On the question of our national position on the military status of a united Germany, Senators may wish to note that my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated in the Dáil on 13 March, in reply to a question, that the issue of the status of a united Germany is one for that country to pursue.  The Helsinki Final Act provides that states have the right to belong, or not to belong, to treaties of alliance; they also have the right to neutrality.</P>
    <P>The question of the borders of a united Germany is another issue which has received a great deal of prominence.  This topic must be seen in the context of the Helsinki Final Act, to which both the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic have subscribed. That document, to which Ireland and all other European countries, except Albania, together with the United States and Canada, have also subscribed, provides that &ldquo;the participating states regard as inviolable all one another's frontiers&rdquo;. It also provides that &ldquo;their frontiers can be changed, in accordance with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement&rdquo;.  The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany itself has declared that a solution to the German question can only be achieved within the framework of the CSCE process. Obviously, we welcome this declaration.</P>
    <P>Particular concern has been expressed on the question of respect for the current eastern border of Poland.  Senators will recall that on 8 March the West German Parliament adopted a resolution recommending that, as soon as possible after the German Democratic Republic's elections on 18 March the Parliaments of the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic should both declare that the right of the people of Poland to live within secure borders will <Col N="1521" /> not be questioned by German territorial claims either now or in the future.  The resolution also declared that the border question should be settled in a treaty between the Governments of a unified Germany and of Poland.  Subsequently, it has been agreed that Poland will participate in the &ldquo;2+4&rdquo; talks when matters which particularly concern its borders are being discussed.</P>
    <P>It is clearly very important that the views of all those who might be affected by German unification should be taken into account.  However, I consider that the assurances which have been provided by the Government of the Federal Republic and the negotiating and consultations mechanisms which have been agreed will ensure that this will happen. Also, Chancellor Kohl has declared that Germans respect the legitimate security interests of all European countries, especially those of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of my statement that the coming together of the two German states must be seen as an opportunity for a much wider rapprochement in Europe.  The Twelve will work to ensure that German unity becomes both the inspiration and the instrument for bringing about a new quality in relationships between a whole range of European countries and indeed with Europe as a whole.  The Community is ready to deepen its ties with Central and Eastern Europe and is also engaged in negotiations of the creation of an economic space which will include both the Twelve member states of the Community and the six members of EFTA.</P>
    <P>The Community will also have to continue to take into account the interests of its Mediterranean and ACP partners, as well as the concerns of the other countries with whom it has close economic and trading links.  A self-centred Europe would be completely unacceptable, and the Government will work to ensure it does not come about.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, is making his way in to take this adjournment debate.  May I make a minor amendment to the wording of the motion?  My motion should read: &ldquo;The need for the Minister for Finance to outline immediately the future employment prospects for all our customs officers in the light of the free trade position in the EC from 1 January 1993 and in regard to his recent announcement concerning the introduction of automatic entry processing and direct trader input from 1 January 1991.&rdquo;  That is how it should read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, but I am very disappointed that the Minister for Finance could not find half an hour to come into the House this evening to address this most important issue.  He has avoided the pleading of the Customs officials to communicate with them in relation to their futures post-1992 and, more immediately, post-1991 after the introduction of AEP.  I say to the Minister of State what I have said as a former Minister of State myself, that I recognise the &ldquo;rent a Minister&rdquo; syndrome.  The Minister has been wheeled in here tonight, he has been handed the script, and I must say I object to that treatment <Col N="1523" /> of this most important issue.  He is personally welcome nonetheless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>He has but a job to do but will he please let his colleague know how I feel on the matter?  The main reason morale among the Customs officials, both indoor and outdoor, is at an all time low is the failure of management and the Revenue Commissioners to communicate with and to update the customs and excise group of the PSEU on the effects of the completion of the Internal Market on customs and excise generally, namely, the effect of the impact of 1992 or the post-1992 situation in the EC.  To that problem can be added a further layer of uncertainty in relation to the staffing implications of the introduction of AEP &mdash; automated entry processing.  Basic staff-management procedures have been totally ignored, and I accuse the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy A.  Reynolds, of creating unnecessary tension.</P>
      <P>AEP, proposed to start in January 1991, is a newly automated import-export procedure in a computerised system.  It includes DTI &mdash; direct trader input &mdash; which is basically the computerisation of Customs clearance documents generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many questions to be asked of the Minister.  Why is there such a huge investment as we look forward to a barrier-free Europe?  I am talking about AEP and DTI, and the hardware and, I hope, the training costs that will be necessary.  Given the philosophy and the concept of an internal market, a barrierfree market, why are we investing in such expensive hardware at this time?  Is it because the direct trader input is part of a master plan to collect trade statistics after 1993?  Presumably there will be no Customs clearance documents as we now know them, but import-export statistics will still have to be collected.  Is that really why DTI is being brought into the <Col N="1524" /> procedure at this stage?  It is hard to understand.  Why the millions for the managed network, if this is not the reason behind it?  What company will affect the managed network?  Has a contract gone out?  Has the Minister even tendered for the contract?  What is going on?  Why the secrecy over all this area?  January 1991 was to be the commencement date of AEP.  Is that the target now to be met?</P>
    <P>AEP has major implications for the indoor Customs officials.  Although it will impact somewhat on the outdoor staff also.  In Rosslare Harbour &mdash; I do not apologise for having a particular interest in Rosslare Harbour as a Customs post &mdash; five of the 16 indoor staff are vulnerable. The hardware for the computer terminals is still awaited in Rosslare Harbour and, I am sure, at other Customs posts.  Test runs are due to start there in June 1990, yet the hardware has not arrived.  What training will be put in place to make this system of AEP effective? Be sure that those in the fraud industry will be one step ahead, yet we have not even indicated to the Customs officials what training will be put in place for this total changeover and automation in this procedure.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder the Minister faces limited industrial action in Dublin from what was the Indoor Officers' Association? There has been no consultation on redundancy, redeployment, retraining, maintenance of seniority, the possibility of whether they may buy out contracts instead of opting for redundancy, etc. Could the EC not fund the purchase of contracts?  After all, there are 30,000 EC Customs officials directly affected by the Single Market provisions and there has been no forward planning, at least if there has it is the best kept secret around.  We must remember that since Customs officials by their qualifications and experience are totally unprepared for private sector employment, that option is virtually unavailable to them.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that Customs officials welcome change and accept it as <Col N="1525" /> necessary and will co-operate, respond and contribute to it while ensuring justice, equity and balance &mdash; to borrow the words of Richard Beamish, Chairman of the Customs and Excise group of the PSEU.</P>
    <P>Is the Mattheaus programme a preparation for European redeployment?  Are we looking at the concept of European Customs officials rather than national ones?  The Minister's answers are awaited.  His colleague, the Minister for finance, has evaded answers for so long now that I hope the Minister of State has come in here tonight prepared with answers for these questions.</P>
    <P>With consideration of redeployment the whole question of general servicing raises its head.  The PSEU welcome this. There will be difficulties and concerns, not least in the taxes union.  What is the present state of negotiation on this most important issue?  Why has the Palma document not been brought to Customs officials' notice?  This sets out the timetable of changes to be introduced between now and 1992 in the control of movement of people and merchandise in the EC.  Why the secrecy?  Why not put it up on the table and discuss it with the Customs officials and their union representatives?  What is there the Minister does not like or wants to keep from them?</P>
    <P>The announcement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy A. Reynolds, in January last failed to address the staffing implications of automated entry processing or the very important area of training for this new system.  There is a very sophisticated fraud industry on standby, and if the Minister fails his officials by not providing comprehensive training &mdash; time is running out if the January 1991 deadline is to be met &mdash; he can rest assured that those involved in the fraud industry are ready and waiting.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to detail without further delay whether Customs officials will be involved in collecting Revenue and trade statistics, public health, coastal <Col N="1526" /> patrols etc.  I welcome the recent introduction of the first coastal patrol boat on our waters.  Will they be involved in cytosanitary checks?  The whole rabies spectre raises its head.  Will they be involved in arms and security, import prohbitions, drugs, arms, etc?  Will they continue to be involved, for example, in the registration of shipping?  There is an interesting aside here, import licences have gone for agriculture and fishery products but prohbitions have not been done away with.  For example, meat still has to be inspected.  The Customs agency involvement has been done away with but not the involvement of the Department of Agriculture officials who now ask customs to hold on to consignments of meat for them.  The Customs have no role but they have to act on behalf of the Department of Agriculture officials in this area.  Should we not be talking about the possibility of a one stop shop of Government employees at Customs posts and borders?</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's intentions in relation to the future of the men operating our Border at present?  What role will there be for the Border posts?  What kind of checks will be necessary to maintin post-1992?  At Rosslare Harbour we had the spectacle of vets rushing up from County Waterford to do Department of Agriculture checks.  Surely this inefficiency can no longer be tolerated?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to specifically answer the questions I asked.  For too long the Minister for Finance has evaded the answers and has created tension which has resulted in industrial action.  None of the Customs officials want to turn the clock back but they are human beings first and Customs officials second.  Their future &mdash; and the future of their wives, husbands and children &mdash; must be prepared and planned for.  The Minister, by his inaction and lack of communication with these people who have served the State well for so long, is preventing this planning from being put in place.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for the particularly warm welcome.  I am very glad to be able to reply to this most important issue and the Senator did a service to everybody by having it discussed here.  I am glad to have a comprehensive reply for her and her friends in Rosslare.</P>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to clarify the position as best I can as to how the future employment prospects of our Customs officers may be affected in the light of the free trade position that will prevail from 1 January 1993 in the European Community and the introduction of a computerised automated entry processing system which will allow direct trader input from 1 January 1991.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have for some time been addressing the staffing issues what will arise on foot of both these developments.  At this stage it is not possible to accurately stress the staffing implications for Customs and Excise in advance of definite proposals emerging in relation to the completion of the internal market.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, a memorandum prepared by the Revenue Commissioners outlining the changes in the role of the Customs and Excise service which the abolition of border controls from 1992 would bring has been circulated to the unions concerned.  The unions have been consulted and are kept abreast of developments at all times.</P>

      <P>As soon as the hardware and software are available, there will be full and comprehensive courses available to all the staff concerned.  That is a definite commitment in regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post 1992 situation is also being examined in other Departments such as Agriculture and Food, Justice and the Environments whose border control functions are carried out by the staff of <Col N="1528" /> the Customs and Excise on an agency basis.</P>
    <P>A sub-committee of the Civil Service General Council has been established under the conciliation and arbitration scheme to examine the implications of the implementation of the internal market, and, in particular, the consequences for staffing.</P>
    <P>There is also a pilot survey at present being carried out by the Institute of Public Administration for the purpose of establishing the attitude and views of Customs and Excise staff to redeployment and voluntary redundancy in the context of changes that may arise on completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator can appreciate from the foregoing that the Revenue Commissioners are keeping the situation under review &mdash; they will keep staff interests informed and will consult them as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Whereas the setting up of the internal market arose from an EC decision, the decision to introduce an automated entry processing system was taken by ourselves. Ireland has a very open economy and we have approved our ability to adapt to a competitive free market since we joined the European Community in 1973. Our experience since then has highlighted the necessity for the fastest possible processing of customs documentation on behalf of the country's trading interests to allow them to compete on an equal footing with their competitors.</P>
    <P>Representations had been made for some years past to the Revenue Commissioners seeking the early implementation of a computerised system.  The introduction of the single administrative document (SAD) in 1988, which led to the investment by many companies in computer hardware and SAD preparation software, gave further impetus to trade demands for a system which would accept the SAD data automatically.</P>
    <P>It is planned to introduce the new system of technology, viz. automated <Col N="1529" /> entry processing at all import and export points including the land frontier on 1 January 1991.  The computerisation of customs import and export procedures will facilitate the automated presentation of custom documentation by traders.</P>
    <P>Automatic entry processing will computerise most customs procedures at present applied manually to the single administrative document (SAD) which is the principal import and export document. An important feature of the automatic entry processing system will be the facility given traders to electronically transmit SAD data directly from their own premises via a managed network to customs through direct trader input (DTI) rather than presenting documentation at customs offices.  By this means, importers and exporters using the AEP system will have their documentation processed and Customs formalities completed at the earliest possible moment &mdash; the whole purpose of the exercise.  The customs service will, therefore, be to the forefront in using electronic technology to facilitate Irish importers and exporters in meeting the increasingly competitive conditions in the Single European Market and beyond.</P>
    <P>The full impact of automated entry processing on the employment of Customs and Excise staff will not become clear until sometime after 1 January 1991 as this will depend on the level of participation by the trading community in the direct trader input facility.  In the meantime, discussions have commenced between the Revenue Commissioners and staff unions involved on the introduction of the proposed new procedures.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance will be kept fully informed of all developments by the Revenue Commissioners and will assist them in dealing with any particular problems being encountered by the staff as the new computerised system is put in place.  Revenue, the import and export trades and the economy as a whole will benefit from its introduction.</P>
    <P>I have complete faith in the ability of <Col N="1530" /> the staff of the Revenue Commissioners to deliver a satisfactory automatic entry processing system in the proposed time-scale and also to deal with any staffing issues that may arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to again record my appreciation to Senator Doyle for raising this matter.  I reiterate that full information has been given to the unions at all times in relation to the introduction of this facility.  It is in full consultation with the unions and through their industrial relations procedures and the Revenue that this facility and both these schemes will be introduced.</P>
    <P>There has been full consultation with the union with regard to AEP.  It must be remembered that proposals have been made which are open to negotiation.  The Revenue Commissioners are fully aware of the human dimension of the issues involved and know the difficulties of redeployment, redundancies and the impact of new technology.  This is a state of the art technology and should give tremendous benefit to an open economy like ours as people can call to Customs posts rather than having to deal with loads of documents and paperwork.  They will have electronic documentation sorted out for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have given a comprehensive reply to the Senator's concerns on the matter, and if she needs any further information, I will be glad to discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who is regrettably not able to be present tonight.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his personal considerations but with regret I say it is empty rhetoric.  I am no wiser now, having heard the reply, than I was when I stood up at the beginning.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 April, 1990.</P>
