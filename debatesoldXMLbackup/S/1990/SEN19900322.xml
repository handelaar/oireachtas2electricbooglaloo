      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The discontinuation of grants for smokeless heating conversions by virtue of the Government's refusal to make any further special control area orders with particular reference to the Crumlin, Drimnagh and Bluebell areas of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ó Cuív of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Communications to change the charging system for telephone calls particularly in relation to rural areas, so that the charges for calls would bear a relationship to the cost to the Bord of the subscriber making them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ross and Upton as suitable for discussion <Col N="970" /> on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross' matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Upton may give notice another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Ó Cuív is not suitable for discussion on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>Could I suggest to the Committee that, rather than having extra speakers, there should be a relocation of the microphones around the House? That is part of the problem.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House what has happened to the debate on Northern Ireland?  We had agreed to it.  We were moving in that direction and had agreed the issues discussed.  It was a very useful operation. I can project my voice; I did not think I needed to.  I have to be particularly careful not to appear disorderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most manifestly true. I would like to ask if we are going to have a debate on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask two questions of the Leader of the House. The first is; can he give me any information about the present position of the amendments to the Clinical Trials Bill. This has a serious impact on persons in this country living with Aids.  They are prevented from having access to a new drug called DDI.  I have been asked to enquire about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question refers to the motion in the name of myself and a number of other people, including Fine Gael, about the Peace Train, which is a former motion.  I do not have the number of it with me.  I do not have the Supplementary Order Paper with me at the moment, regrettably.  It is a particular proposal.  It has been debated in the European Parliament.  It has been passed by a number of local assemblies North and South.  It would be a very useful, constructive, non-divisive subject.  The Leader himself, through the Chair, indicated that it would be taken last Thursday. Unusual events intervened.  We are <Col N="972" /> back on course.  Could I have an indication that this will be taken at an early date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again ask Senator Lanigan if the Seanad will be meeting in the months of April and June?  I want to thank him, as well, for the information that he gave me yesterday, namely, that the Business of the Dáil is the Dáil's business and that it has nothing to do wth the Seanad.  Actually, I had learned that from some of his earlier interventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also add my voice to what Senator Ryan has said in relation to the debate on Northern Ireland.  I raised this yesterday.  Senator Ryan, unfortunately, was not in the House yesterday. No doubt he would have raised it as well. We have been asking consistently over a long period of time that there would be a full-scale debate on Northern Ireland. I have listed a number of developments that have taken place even during this session.  I wonder would the Leader of the House address the question again? This time he might give us some firm indication about when we might have a full-scale debate.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we debated certain aspects in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  It was pointed out by many speakers that we were talking about specific areas.  We were not able to deal with the totality of the issues that people wanted to raise.  Again, we see the whole question of the 48-hour rule in relation to Northern Ireland.  It has been struck down in relation to Community law.  That is another aspect that must be addressed. Perhaps this time the Leader of the House would give us a firm commitment to a debate on Northern Ireland in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader to consider item No. 89 as a matter of urgency &mdash; that the Government clarifies the position regarding the implications of the Supreme Court decision in <i>Shelly v. District Justice Mahon</i>.  We believe this is a very serious <Col N="973" /> issue and requires clarification urgently because of the situation that has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the requests for a full debate on the whole Northern Ireland question.  At present the British and Irish Inter-Parliamentary Group are meeting, and we could have a debate in a way.  I am suggesting that we do not have to have the debate in a way that we either vote for or against something, or that we revolve it in any hard line way.  We could have a debate that would be informative and very useful to the British and Irish Inter-Parliamentary Group in assessing their own situations. It could be done on an all-party basis. We could play a very useful role in helping this group, particularly if we have regard to the duration of the problems in the North.  The sooner we take up the matter the better.  I urge the Leader of the House to consider it in that context, not in the context of somebody putting a motion down to win or lose, but rather that it would be a full, open debate and that the information would be deliberately used for the benefit of the British and Irish Parliamentary Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the debate on Northern Ireland, I will ask the Whip, Senator McGowan, to discuss this matter with the other Whips at their meeting this morning.  We have had a few debates on aspects of Northern Ireland policy here in the Seanad over the last couple of weeks.  On the question that was raised about the Peace Train issue, I do not see any difficulty there at all. There was a technical difficulty about not having that debate last week.  Unfortunately, business did not allow us to hold it this week.  Again, I will ask the Whip to arrange that that debate take place next week, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Clinical Trials Bill, I accept the points raised by Senator Norris.  I will raise that matter with the relevant Minister immediately after the meeting.  I am addressing myself to the business for today, Senator Upton.  The Whips will be addressing themselves to business for next week.  I am not going to go down <Col N="974" /> the road of discussing business for June, as of yet.  The business of this House is arranged by the Leader of the House in consultation with the Ministers who need to be in the House.</P>
    <P>On item No. 89, which Senator Neville raised, I will raise that matter with the Minister for Justice and get in touch with the Senator.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are related and are being discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We had just started on amendment No. 15 the last day.  Subsection (7) states:</P>
      <P>Where urban land ceases to be derelict at any time during a local financial year, any amounts paid by way of derelict sites levy in relation to that year shall be refunded to the owner...</P>
      <P>What I wish to insert is that in relation to the remainder of that year it shall be refunded to the owner.  In other words, that you do not give back to the owner any money other than what he is owed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is not generous to somebody who has been a cause of dereliction.  What is owed is refunded to the person in question. The subsection concludes: &ldquo;any amounts due or owing in relation to that <Col N="975" /> year shall be waived&rdquo;.  One is not waiving any sum of money that is properly owed by the person who is responsible for the dereliction.  I do not see any reason why we should hold out that carrot.  I do not see any reason why we should be extra-generous to somebody who has committed a fault in the first place.  That is not the way it operates in relation to the law, and particularly the criminal law, anywhere else.  A person is not given a bonus because after a period of time he is doing what he should have done anyway. People are not rewarded, if they have committed an offence, by giving them that extra bonus of waiving a certain amount of what they owe.  It would be appropriate if those two amendments were accepted.  It would be a salutary lesson for anybody who is found guilty of bringing about dereliction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Costello, particularly in the light of the kind of developments that have been happening, and were happening no later than this week, along the Dublin quays.  I would remind the Minister, through the Chair that there was a situation where one of the most valiant defenders of Dublin was arrested for taking a photograph of the illegal destruction of a building at the Linders site about this time last year.  The person, who was protecting Dublin, was arrested for taking a photograph of an illegal activity.  I believe that persons who engage in this kind of nefarious pursuit in search of profit and at the expense of the city of Dublin or other cities all over the country should be penalised.  They should not get a reward from the efforts of other people in a time of their own dereliction.  In other words, if a profit subsequently accrues, not as a result of the efforts of the owners, then I do not think they should benefit from it. I take it that that is the substance of Senator Costello's case.  If it is, I will certainly support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have <Col N="976" /> considered this point during the last couple of days and again this morning in regard to what I would do about this matter.  I am prepared to accept the substance of the amendments.  In order to improve them from a technical point of view, I would prefer if both Senator Costello and Senator Norris would allow me to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to cover the matter.  I would like to have it technically correct.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am delighted that the Minister has agreed to this.  It was not my intention that the exact wording in my amendment would be accepted, but I am delighted that the Minister has accepted the basic principle.  I accept his commitment to introduce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 not moved.</P>
      <P>Section 23, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 24 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16a:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 24 and 25, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Subsection 1 shall not apply in <Col N="977" /> any instance where the urban land consists of or includes a building listed for preservation by the local authority or deemed to be of national importance historically or aesthetically by the competent and relevant bodies such as the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In order to tease the matter out, I would like to suggest that the Minister might kindly give us his justification for this section, without my amendment, which I can then continue to argue for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would prevent the making of bonding arrangements under section 25 in any case where a listed building or a building of national, historic importance was involved in the proposed scheme of development.  The Senator proposing the amendment believed that this would improve the prospects of conserving and maintaining these buildings.  The derelict sites levy has been designed as an efficiency tax to pressure owners into better use of their land.  In keeping with the idea, section 23 (7) remits the levy in full where, within the relevant financial year, the urban land ceases to be derelict.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, it will be right for the derelict sites levy to apply to any dereliction which is continued for more than one year.  There could, however, be situations in which this would be counterproductive. For example, it could be clear that site assembly for major redevelopment or refurbishment, together with the planning application process and possibly other preparatory works, are all likely to take longer than a year.  In this case the prospect of having to pay a levy on a large number of properties could discourage a developer from undertaking a worthwhile major project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could even be, in this kind of case, that the derelict sites levy could be competing negatively with urban renewal incentives designed to stimulate redevelopment in a designated area.  For this reason, section 25 gives local authorities discretion.  It does not oblige them to enter into a bonding arrangement with a developer in certain circumstances.  This will remit payment of the levy if the <Col N="978" /> scheme of development is carried out before the end of the period.  If the scheme is not carried out the bond will require payment of the levies in full.</P>
    <P>The intention of section 25 is that the local authority should be able to judge on the merits of a particular case.  Where immediate application of the levy would do more harm than good to the redevelopment of the derelict land, they will not, of course, be free to offer bonding at will.  Section 25 will only permit this arrangement where a developer has obtained planning permission for a scheme of development of property, or where a planning application or appeal for this purpose is pending and has not been refused.  The amendment would mean that this arrangement could not be operated in any case where a listed or similar building was involved.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns of Members in advancing this amendment.  I accept that local authorities, in operating section 25, would do well to bear in mind some of the difficulties mentioned by the Senators.  I am prepared to ensure that local authorities are briefed to this effect in the administrative guidance which will be issued to them in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <P>I consider it would be too restrictive for us to legislate that section 25 should never be used for any scheme of development affecting a listed building.  For example, a developer might actually have planning permission for the modification or refurbishment of a listed building.  If he has planning permission for this, why should he be discouraged from implementing this permission by the withdrawal of the section 25 facilities?  As I have said I consider that this amendment is unduly restrictive, I ask the Senator to have a look at that because I do not think there is need for that amendment in view of what I have outlined.  The local authorities will be fully briefed on the action they need to take in all of that.  As the Senator realises, in many of our urban areas the assembly of land can be quite drawn out with the legal implications and the planning delays.  I do not want to <Col N="979" /> make too tight a control on that but to leave it in the hands of the local authorities because they will be well briefed on all of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is most helpful and I am taking on board what he says.  In particular, I am heartened by the statement that the local authorities will be briefed.  Perhaps I could explain precisely the nature of my concern.  It specifically relates to the question of buildings judged to be of prominent, historical, architectural and cultural merit. In other words, the kind of buildings that local authorities themselves list.  I accept absolutely the Minister's good intentions and good will in this.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I have to be parochial and speak about the city of Dublin, particularly the north side.  It is a scandal that on the north side there is a phrase in current usage both by officials of the corporation who do not necessarily approve of it at all and certainly by property speculators and it is called &ldquo;north side planning permissions&rdquo;.  They go in and start assembling a site.  There may very well be on that site, a building of the first significance artistically, historically and architecturally.  They gradually undermine that building by allowing the buildings next to it to become derelict, by applying then, on foot of the dereliction, for which they are not directly responsible but responsible by neglect, for permission to demolish the adjoining buildings.  The Minister, I am sure, knows that this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the property speculator, who is a very civilised man in a suit, smoking a cigar, driving a Rolls Royce and all the rest of it, is not directly personally responsible for the poor workmanship of his employees.  If they happen to drive a bulldozer accidentally into the side wall of a listed building and then it becomes a bit more derelict, the process continues.  Then the building has to be pulled down too.  I am really looking for a reassurance that the Minister will be able to &mdash; I believe he has the intention &mdash; stop this process.  My problem is that <Col N="980" /> it says not even the planning permission for the redevelopment has been given. This is a hesitation I have.</P>
    <P>Section 25 as it stands says that planning permission has not been refused.  It does not actually say that it has been given, so we are depending on the absence of a refusal.  In the process of the assembly of sites you have a situation where there is at the moment no refusal but there is also no obligation, that I can detect, that can be enforced and no penalty.  Suppose the owner of the assembled site or the site in process of assembly conspires to, or collaborates in, the dereliction and ultimate destruction of buildings that are part of the national heritage.  It is for that reason that very specifically we are trying to amend the section to make the levy continue to apply to those sites which contain buildings of considerable historical merit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the Senators' concern.  With regard to the knocking of a building, if that is the word to use, the developer or the owner must get permission from the local authority to do that under law.  The relevant Acts are there to do that.  The Senator knows what took place in another part of the country, which I shall not name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Slightly north of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be correct. The Senator knows what happened there with the legal process involved.  I cannot comment any further on that.  When a person is assembling a site, let it be an historical building or any type of development, whatever the case may be, there is a long drawn-out process.  When a planning permission goes in, right to ownership and so on, has to be taken into account.  With the powers under this Bill and the new powers that the local authorites have, I am satisfied with the briefing they will get, the briefing under the Bill and with the regulations, they can take the necessary action where required to put these matters right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also responsible for urban renewal.  It is my main responsibility now. <Col N="981" /> Thankfully, I must say that an enormous amount of work is taking place throughout the country, especially here in the Dublin area.  Some may not like the design.  That is a matter of how people feel about designs.  I am extremely pleased, if I may elaborate a little on that, with improvements that are being carried out in many parts of Dublin especially. Millions of pounds are being spent on that.  Everybody agrees that it is a vast improvement now.</P>
    <P>The problem in the Dublin area in regard to assembly of land is title, the packaging of the land.  All this development causes problems, legal and technical. I do not want to get into the legal field, but if one wanted to get into it, it could be quite complex.  I want to give the authorities discretion to use their judgment.  They will be well briefed on this.  I would be very surprised if local authority officials, not alone here in Dublin but throughout the country are not competent and capable of dealing will all this.</P>
    <P>I understand the Senator's point.  I understand the reservations he has but I am very confident it will be all right.  The drafters of the Bill and the legal people in the Department also say it will, because local authorities will have to use their judgment.  Today a person can make a planning application for a development, especially in the bigger urban areas, and it can take months and months to get through even a corporation or a local authority.  Then there may be a third party objection and it is before An Bord Pleanála.  I do not want to have it too restrictive so that it could, if you like to put it in broader language, deter a development.  I fully respect any building on which there is a preservation order.  I expect every local authority to respect all that as well.  On the quays, where I was involved in a development with the National Building Agency &mdash; beside the Ormond Hotel &mdash; there is splendid architectural work, the design of which is in keeping with the whole area there.  It was done extremely competently.  I would like to see a lot of that type of work taking place.</P>

      <P>I will not be pressing the amendment because I realise, first of all, that it would be totally futile, and I would not win.  The Minister is a reasonable person.  He has heard what I have to say on the matter.  He is correct about certain aspects of the development on the quays. I imagine he may be referring to the development of the Scots Church on Ormond Quay.  It is attractive and shows what can be done.</P>
      <P>I would just like to express one or two small reservations before I formally withdraw the amendment.  When the Minister says that the developers must get permission for the demolition of a building, technically that is true, and has been true for some time but, regrettably, it has not always happened.  There have been instances in the past 12 months of people just going in and demolishing without being penalised.  This has taken place along the quays.  What the Minister has said, although very interesting and extremely helpful, has not entirely addressed the situation of people who deliberately allow buildings to become derelict, then seek a dangerous buildings order and demolish on foot of that order. That legalises a process they have initiated.  At the end of the day, what they do is retrospectively covered by the law, but the intention is malign.  I am very glad to hear the Minister saying that he is taking this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise also &mdash; and I will say this to the Minister &mdash; that perhaps the concerns I am expressing are not most appropriately expressed in this Bill, because this is a Bill concerning derelict sites so the emphasis is on dereliction.  I am politically using this opportunity to sensitise the Minister &mdash; I will not say to soften him up because I doubt that would be likely and to suggest to him that we also need to look at the necessity to put teeth in the positive sides of legislation, in other words, the preservation side.  This is coping with a negative situation.  This is very important and it would be to the immense credit of the Government if <Col N="983" /> they decided to go along the other parallel side, which is the positive preservation of buildings.  Having said that, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16b:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 26, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;The local authority shall be liable to the levy for any occupied dwelling or land owned by a State authority or by the local authority in whose functional area the land is situated or land in relation to which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a compulsory purchase order (other than a vesting order under this Act) has become operative, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a development objective exists for the purpose of reserving the land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963,</P>
      <P>any such levy being abated to zero by virtue of the fact that payment of such levy would amount to a circular payment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This again is not intended to be tendentious but it is an attempt to look once more at a problem that arose during previous discussions.  The intention of the amendment is to adroitly remove the substance of the Minister's argument.  I attempted to insert a similar amendment earlier on in the Bill, in other words, to destroy the special exemptions extended by the Bill to local authorities.  As I recall it, the Minister's argument at that point, which certainly appeared to the House to be a valid one, was that this could <Col N="984" /> not validly be passed by Seanad Éireann because it involved Exchequer expenditure, which we are prevented from imposing in this House.</P>
    <P>I believe I have satisfied that legitimate concern of the Minister by a process with which local authorities will be very familiar. You charge a rent but that rent becomes notional and is abated.  I am aware of this as a positive manoeuvre because I have been involved in attempts to preserve a number of notable buildings in Dublin.  You extract them from the corporation and they have been very helpful sometimes in this regard, but they are required to seek payment.  They charge a full commercial rent and abate it to zero so that the Minister's initial argument on this, I believe, has been met by my technical adjustment &mdash; at least I hope so.</P>
    <P>This allows me, once more, to mention &mdash; I will not develop it at enormous length because I do not want to irritate the House by repetition &mdash; the fact that I am very concerned that this Bill should be as effective as the Minister wishes it to be. I am very worried that by allowing major exemptions for local authorities, on the one hand, and property speculators, on the other, the two principal sources of the devastation of our cities are left untouched by the provisions of the Bill. I say that without intending in any way to impugn the general standards or reputation of local authorities, it is perfectly clear to anybody who looks around this city that the two principal sources of dereliction are: (a) the local authorities with their road widening schemes; and, (b) the site assembly for property development. I began to make a point on a previous amendment with regard to the rights of the very class of people whom Fianna Fáil traditionally sought to represent, and represent very effectively, the small people.</P>

      <P>I am sure they represent some of the ordinary small people of Ireland.  In my own modest way, so do I, and many of my constituents do.  May I remind the Minister that I involve myself in the local politics of Dublin quite extensively, particularly with things like the Clanbrassil Street development.  Last night I was at a meeting called by local representatives and local community groups to deal with the eastern by-pass out in Marino.  One of the concerns expressed is that the rights of ordinary small people are violated by developments involving the dereliction of sites.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have an insidious practice of buying up a scatter of strategic sites along the line of a new road development. They will buy a corner site, they will buy a pub, they will buy a house &mdash; about 4 per cent of the entire area ultimately to be acquired.  They allow them to go derelict over a period of 20 to 30 years.  It has been 30 years in the Clanbrassil Street-Patrick Street case. The value of the property is then diminished by virtue of the dereliction.  The local authority know this and they realise that the increasing dereliction creates political pressure from the residents. Once it gets bad enough they start campaigning to have the road plan implemented.  I would like this kind of thing stopped if possible.  For that reason I want the local authorities brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it may be argued &mdash; it would be impertinent, of course, for me to anticipate the Minister's subtlety of mind &mdash; that this is purposeless.  What is the point in having the right to fine people and then abate it to zero?  The purpose is very simple.  Because there are not only financial penalties available, there is the penalty of public exposure and humiliation. I believe that in some small way, by taking this course of lateral thinking, by retaining the penalty for local authorities, by refusing to exempt them because they are a principal source of dereliction, you leave in the possibility that if they engage in this kind of thing <Col N="986" /> unscrupulously it can all be exposed in the papers and people will know what is happening.  They will be shamed, they will be reproved by public opinion and at the next election those persons on the local authority, who have collaborated in this kind of process, may find it rather more difficult to get back than they supposed. Far from being an impractical suggestion, I believe it is practical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very long discussion on this point in dealing with section 2.  I would like to make a few brief comments on the amendment.  It would always involve circular payments since what it is advocating is under a number of different headings, that the local authorities should pay the levy to themselves. This kind of arrangement is artificial and is obviously wasteful from an administrative point of view.  I do not know about the merit of this amendment.  I will put forward how I see it.  It would more clearly highlight the existence of derelict sites, which are owned by the local authorities, or the State, which result from local authority CPOs or land reservations. My answer to this point is that the existence of these derelict sites will be fully highlighted by the requirement of section 8, that they enter derelict sites on the register.  In addition, section 8 requires that in the case of derelict local authority land, the register should set out particulars of the use, if any, being made of it and any purpose for which the land is intended to be used.</P>
      <P>Section 13 gives power to the Minister to require local authorities to sell off this type of land.  I will try to be helpful on what I would be prepared to do.  If it will allay the Senator's concern, I would be prepared to give an assurance here and now that details regarding land reservations affected by CPO or planning will be required to be entered by local authorities in the register.  This can be done in the context of the regulations which will have to be made to prescribe the form and detail of the register.  I can do it that way.  I hope the Senators will accept my point of view on that.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the debate on the amendment.  I was not sure that the amendment would meet the wishes of the Senator but as he has said, the Minister has gone some way to meet him.  Will the Minister continue to keep an eye on this and improve the situation if possible?  Even section 8 will not prevent local authorities from achieving their long-term aim of acquiring an area, for example, some of the areas mentioned in the city of Dublin. This has been going on for 30 years now. It does not prevent a local authority from moving in and buying business in an area, closing a shop &mdash; that in itself immediately commences the decay &mdash; and buying a second shop.</P>
      <P>That happened in the areas that have already been mentioned here and in other areas of the city where there were long-term plans for road development.  The local authority moved in and having purchased one or two businesses on that street, they then controlled the market because nobody else was interested in going in and purchasing businesses.  The people who live in those areas are now caught in a trap.  Their premises are not marketable except to one customer.  It is time that this was brought to an end. There are a lot of people caught in the Clanbrassil Street and, indeed, in the Parnell Street case where the local authority moved in, bought premises and made their plans known.  Having closed a business or two, or every fifth or seventh business along the street, they created this decay and many business people and others are caught in this trap.  I would like the Minister to keep an eye on that and to see if he can bring in legislation to prevent this kind of thing happening.  I do not know how he can prevent the local authority from doing it.</P>

    <Title>B &amp; I Line Bill, 1990  [  Certified Money Bill]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided to provide B &amp; I Line with up to £6 million in Exchequer equity in 1990. Section 1 of this Bill enables the Minister for Finance to give effect to the Government decision by increasing from 100 million to 106 million the number of ordinary shares of £1 each which the Minister may purchase in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is two years since this House has had an opportunity to discuss comprehensively the affairs of B &amp; I Line.  In 1988, the company was dealing with a major financial crisis.  A short time earlier a plan of action had been adopted by the board of B &amp; I which provided for a major restructuring of company operations. It involved reducing the workforce by 565 from 1,464 to 899, as well as implementing a pay cut of 5 per cent <Col N="991" /> and a pay freeze until July 1989.  The Dublin/Liverpool car ferry service was terminated and the m.v. <i>Connacht</i> and all North Wall properties were sold.  In addition, a major consolidated loan agreement was put in place with the banks on repayment of B &amp; I's borrowings subject to a mortgage on the company's assets.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report to the House that the completion of this difficult restructuring phase has improved the company's trading performance over the past two years.  In both 1988 and 1989, B &amp; I has returned operating profits of £1.8 million and £2.8 million respectively.  Corporate interest charges exceeding £4 million in both years, however, have resulted in net losses being incurred of £2.9 million in 1988 and £1.5 million in 1989.  It is worth noting in that regard that, were it not for the burden of interest charges on historic debt arising from losses accumulated by B &amp; I prior to 1988, the company would at this stage be recording net profits.  The burden of debt, however, is a commercial reality with which, obviously, the company has to continue to cope.</P>
    <P>In parallel with these financial improvements B &amp; I has increased its business in the car, roll-on/roll-off and lift-on/lift-off areas.  In each case B &amp; I carryings grew significantly between 1987 and 1989 and further increases are projected for 1990.  These improved results have no doubt been assisted by the general economic upturn in trade and tourism which this Government has stimulated.  It is also proper to acknowledge, however, the commitment which management and staff in B &amp; I have jointly shown in the restructuring of the company over the past two years.  The across the board support of the workforce was an essential prerequisite of Government assistance for the company at the beginning of 1988 and that continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point to recall that B &amp; I's plan of action, initiated in 1988, envisages Government equity investment of £7 million in B &amp; I over the two years of 1988 and 1989.  In fact, <Col N="992" /> the Exchequer was called on to invest only £1 million in the company over that period, or £6 million less than originally expected.  Notwithstanding these encouraging trends, I have to stress that the company is clearly not out of the woods yet and remains reliant on Government financial support.  It also faces a difficult trading environment, not only as a result of increasing competition from other shipping operators, but also as a result of continuing airline competition for passenger traffic through lower air fares.  I ought to say, however, that the ferry operators have responded well to the competition from airlines through a combination of innovative marketing of package holidays and greater concentration on car traffic.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I's total outstanding capital obligations at the end of 1989 amounted to £37.3 million.  The company is scheduled to discharge almost all of these current obligations by the end of 1995.  Annual capital and interest payments, however, continue to be a major burden and will amount to over £8 million per annum over each of the next few years.  This takes no account of any additional borrowing which may be incurred in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to initiate this Bill and invest up to £6 million in the company this year is a positive response to the progress achieved over the past two years.  Nevertheless, it is vital for the company's own future that it continue on this path of progress during 1990 and beyond.  In that context it must be made clear that the company cannot rely indefinitely on Government support. B &amp; I must prove itself capable of continuing its financial improvement and of competing effectively in the marketplace on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>I already announced in Dáil Éireann last week my intentions to initiate a review of the future trading and development prospects of the B &amp; I Line.  I believe this review to be timely given the company's improved performance over the past two years.  In addition, as we move towards the challenges and opportunities of the Single European Market, <Col N="993" /> it is necessary for the Government to assess how best the needs of our exporters can be met and, in particular, the role of B &amp; I in that context.  The main objective of this review will be to determine how soon B &amp; I's dependence on Exchequer financial support can be ended, the development options for the company over the coming years, the associated costs of these options and B &amp; I's ability to fund such developments from within its own resources.  I must stress that I am not looking at any particular option at the present time.  I will choose the best option in due course, depending on the outcome of the review.</P>
    <P>As I indicated last week, I did receive an unsolicited expression of interest in B &amp; I from a privately owned ferry company late last year.  I have set that expression of interest aside for the time being, pending the outcome of my review of the company.  I am expecting B &amp; I to let me have their own views on the future options for the company shortly.</P>
    <P>In trading terms, the dominant access mode continues to be sea transport, accounting for over 80 per cent of total merchandise trade by volume and 50 per cent of passenger movements.  Ireland's dependence on reliable and frequent shipping services is accordingly very high. Clearly, this consideration will have to be taken into account by the Government in its deliberations on B &amp; I's future role in our economy.</P>
    <P>Having dealt in some detail with the recent history and future prospects from the B &amp; I Line, it is appropriate that I acquaint Senators with the number of other ongoing developments of relevance to the trading environment of the company. Seanad Éireann will already be aware of the thrust of the National Development Plan and the importance which this Government attaches to improving competitiveness throughout the Irish economy.  Leaving aside for the moment the additional trading problems which arise for us due to our geographical position <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European trading partners, it is accepted that the future requirements of Irish industry demand <Col N="994" /> increased investment in transport infrastructure, particularly in shipping services and associated port, rail and road access facilities.  Together with transit delays and poor delivery times, the significant diversion of freight traffic through Northern Ireland ports is a symptom of our existing inadequacies in this area.  The National Development Plan has already pointed out that transport costs for Irish exporters account for between 9 per cent and 10 per cent of export sales values, which is effectively double that borne by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that the future performance of Irish trade and tourism, as well as Irish shipping services, will depend to a large extent on existing infrastructural inadequacies being remedied. This was recognised in the National Development Plan and also in the more recent decision of the European Commission to make available, through the Community support framework for Ireland, EC funding designed to offset the effects of Ireland's peripherality in the Community.  The Commission has indicated that investments in roads, ports, airports and railways will qualify for EC assistance to the extent that they contribute to reducing the effects of peripherality. My Department, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, is preparing a number of investment proposals for consideration by the EC Commission in the context of the operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure.  I am hopeful that negotiations on this integrated programme will be finalised before the summer.  The programme, when implemented, will significantly improve the overall transport network of this country and thereby help to alleviate the cost disadvantages we currently suffer in moving our goods to our main export markets.</P>
    <P>I announced some weeks ago that I had commissioned a consultancy study from Stokes Kennedy Crowley, one of the main objects of which is to recommend and evaluate possible investment strategies <Col N="995" /> appropriate to the development of better sea freight services to our major Community trading partners.  This study, which should be available to me within two months, is being steered by a committee representative of the Departments of Tourism and Transport, Finance and the Marine, as well as the European Commission.  The study will also examine organisational factors in the Irish transport sector which affect the competitive position of Irish exporters <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European trading partners.  Recommendations arising from the consultancy study will be given careful consideration with a view to improving Ireland's freight links with our Community partners.</P>
    <P>The advent of the Single European Market poses major challenges as well as opportunities for Ireland and calls for a fresh appraisal of how the disadvantages of our peripherality can be eliminated or at least alleviated.  It is self-evident that this requires a coherent investment strategy in transport infrastructure and services. The Government's primary objective in that regard is to focus the State's and the European Community's investment resources in a manner which will maximise the benefits to Ireland's trading and tourism industries and thereby help to harness the full potential of our economy.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in my preceding comments with the future environment within which shipping services will operate.  The Bill before the House today has, of course, a much more short term focus.  Its sole purpose is to provide B &amp; I with up to £6 million to assist the company in meeting its scheduled financial commitments during 1990.  Before I conclude, I would like to stress one point in particular.  B &amp; I cannot hope to realise its full development potential until such time as it becomes commercially self-sufficient. While recognising the company's efforts over the past two years &mdash; which have been very good &mdash; in tackling its financial problems, the Government remains anxious that B &amp; I's reliance on Exchequer financial support should be ended at the earliest possible time.  This <Col N="996" /> issue will be a primary focus in examining the future options for the company.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister, I also welcome the Bill and the ideas which he has articulated in relation to the future development of B &amp; I. Obviously, the injection of money is coming at a critical time in the development of the B &amp; I Line.  I am particularly pleased that it has so far been welcomed by all shades of opinion, particularly those who are involved in the export of goods outside this country.  However, it does give me an opportunity, however briefly, to highlight and perhaps propose certain points to the Minister in relation to the overall strategy that seems to be adopted by not only B &amp; I but by the other major ferry operator on the Irish Sea, Sealink.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention, wearing his other hat as Minister for Tourism, to the potentially damaging publicity which has been highlighted in a number of UK publications, especially the major quality English newspaper <i>The Independent</i> of Saturday, 3 February, followed up by an article at the end of February, which, under the heading &ldquo;The world's dearest stretch of water&rdquo;, underlines the difficulties which the ferry operators are facing from a somewhat critical and highly suspicious public, who over the previous decade have not been at all satisfied with the standard of service or the price that has been charged for access to and from Ireland.  At a time when we in Ireland are attempting to attract the highest possible number of tourists to this country publicity of this nature is highly damaging.  I would hope that the Minister would take steps to minimise the potential damage to our tourist industry, especially among the British holidaymaker, who has traditionally been the bulwark of our tourism success over the last 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I talk here about the British holidaymaker as distinct from the ethnic holidaymaker. The article itself makes weary reading.  Admittedly, there have been a <Col N="997" /> great deal of improvements to the B &amp; I service, but it seems to me that one cannot ignore representations that have been made on a continuing basis by such organisations as the Federation of Irish Societies in a report, admittedly in the early 1980s.  The <i>Irish Post</i> newspaper, the voice of the Irish in Britain, has continually highlighted the inadequacies of the service for Irish people.  They refer especially to what they call &ldquo;the chaos&rdquo; at the ports at high peak times.  I was surprised to learn that the Department of Transport has been quoted as saying that they find the service satisfactory.  I would like to think, especially with such a high powered and able Minister as Minister Brennan, that he would never find anything in his Department or any aspect of his Department totally satisfactory since he is someone who always strives higher and higher for an excellence in service.</P>
    <P>It seems also to me from the various comments that have been made by those involved in tourism and industry in this country that more investment is needed. In that regard I welcome the comments the Minister has made in his speech where he talks in terms of his intention to review the future trading and development prospects of the B &amp; I Line.  I might at this juncture also echo the Minister's remarks about the turnaround in the fortunes of B &amp; I.  I, too, welcome the improved results and agree that they have been assisted by the general economic upturn in trade and tourism which this Government have stimulated since coming into office.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be remiss of me also not to pay a particular tribute to the commitment shown by the management and staff in B &amp; I, who have been going through an extremely difficult time over the last few years with the shedding of jobs and general rationalisation.  The fact that they have come out of that particular trauma in a healthier state than they went in is obviously a tribute to their own commitment to maintaining and developing ferry services, both for the tourist sector and the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the review which the <Col N="998" /> Minister has initiated, it is interesting that he makes the comment that he will choose the best option in due course. Obviously, there has been a great deal of comment, both inside and outside the House, since this Bill was circulated as to the possible intentions of the Minister. I sometimes feel that politicians tend to read more into comments made by Ministers in their introduction of a Bill than is really true.  It does not seem to me that the Minister is in any way suggesting that by injecting £6 million into B &amp; I at this time he is setting them up for privatisation. However, I would like to think, in reading the Minister's mind on this, that he is obviously going to go for the option that is in the best interests of the country.  I doubt very much whether he is the sort of person who would be prepared to sell off a valuable State asset. The long-term future of B &amp; I is bound up in some way with State involvement. Perhaps the Minister, in the new climate of liberalisation as distinct from privatisation, might be considering share ownership by the Irish people.  Share ownership has proved to be extremely popular and very successful with our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom. It has broadened the share ownership in the general population.  People who never bought shares before have purchased shares in former State owned companies.  Perhaps there is a halfway house here where the Minister may, in pursuing the best option available, consider making a portion of the equity of B &amp; I available for public share ownership.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I believe, as the Minister has pointed out on a number of occasions that ferry transport, both private, tourist and industrial, is crucial to the future wellbeing of this country. We are alone in Europe in having a higher emphasis on ferry and sea transport than any of our European neighbours.  Perhaps in a sense this is a disadvantage, because it means that our Minister and Government have got to fight harder to convince the other 11 that there should be a higher priority given to sea services, whereas the emphasis seems to be in <Col N="999" /> recent years towards the liberalisation and an emphasis on the air transport infrastructure throughout Europe which, in itself, has also benefitted this country. I know the Minister has taken a keen interest in liberalisation policy within the EC.  Because of our uniqueness in this area obviously we must continue to be vigilant to ensure that the European Commission and our European partners do not downgrade what is for us &mdash; perhaps not for them &mdash; vital to the future prosperity of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers in his speech to Ireland's dependence on reliable and frequent shipping services.  It is extremely high because the dominant access mode continues to be sea transport accounting for over 80 per cent of total merchandise trade by volume and 50 per cent of passenger movement.  The Minister goes on to say &mdash; and again I welcome his comments &mdash; that it is accepted that the future requirements of Irish industry demand increased investment in transport infrastructure particularly in shipping services and associated port, rail and road access facilities.  The Minister talks about the significant diversion of freight traffic through Northern Ireland ports.  It is a symptom of our existing inadequacies in this area.</P>
    <P>Here I would like to draw the House's attention to a report of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce recently headed &ldquo;Corridor to Competitiveness&rdquo;, subheaded &ldquo;Developing Ireland's Primary Sea Route to the Internal Market.&rdquo;  This is an excellent document and the chamber of commerce are to be complimented on having taken the time and resources obviously necessary to produce the document as a useful contribution to the ongoing debate about our developing sea ferry services.</P>
    <P>I would like to put onto the record of the House one or two of the recommendations which the chamber of commerce puts forward in order to improve our viability and our competitiveness, particularly in the industrial area.  They say that the designation by the Government of the central corridor, Dublin to <Col N="1000" /> Holyhead, as the primary Irish export route to the United Kingdom, is vitally important as is the creation of a supranational task force involving Irish, British and EC experts which will plan and coordinate a comprehensive programme for the corridor and a programme that would include improved access to Dublin and Holyhead ports, better port facilities at Dublin and Holyhead, lower port charges, increased shipping capacities at peak hours by introducing larger ferries, lower shipping charges, harmonisation of tax burdens on hauliers on both sides of the Border, even-handed customs procedures at sea and land frontiers and a marketing programme to sell those improvements and win back traffic.  It seems that the diversion of trade out of the Republic of Ireland is so high that it has implications for the national economy. The Dublin Chamber of Commerce indicate that from their survey the loss of revenue to the economy amounts to approximately £56 million a year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the service &mdash; here I would like to respectfully suggest to the Minister that it is an area that should be looked at &mdash; the Minister says that the northern corridor is an area where we are losing out.  Among the reasons for this is that there is an advantage on their side because they have more frequent sailings. They have more capacity.  They have faster access to the ports, speedier unloading unhampered by port customs formalities, and a record of reliability. They clarify &mdash; it is rather interesting for the House to note this in relation to the frequent sailings &mdash; that the northern corridor has 24 sailings a day against the central corridor &mdash; the Dublin/Holyhead route in which B &amp; I operate which has only eight.  Larne alone has 16.  Of the central corridor &mdash; again Dublin/ Holyhead &mdash; delays of 12 hours are normal if a sailing is missed.  I do not believe in this day and age, and particularly going into the nineties, that anyone, whether an industrial exporter or a tourist, should be subjected to the vagaries of this type of service. I know that the Minister is constantly looking at ways of improving access in <Col N="1001" /> and out of this country, wearing both his hats as Tourism and Transport Minister.</P>
    <P>The reference to road access is of particular interest to me, especially the road access out of Holyhead.  Indeed, in making a decision to spend a few days with relatives in England later on around the Easter recess, my wife and I have chosen the southern corridor route, mainly because our relatives live in the Sussex area of England, but also because of the severe frustration that we experienced on a number of occasions going through the central corridor &mdash; Dublin/Holyhead and not just because of any inadequacies that may have arisen on the B &amp; I service.  Here I must confess that my personal experience of B &amp; I has been nothing but good.  There are delays in getting to the trunk roads and the motorways of England.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce report refers to poor access to Holyhead possing problems for shippers.  The narrow winding A5 road through the mountains from Shrewsbury is not suitable for heavy traffic.  I might add that it is not suitable for even small traffic, either.  Anybody who has the experience of getting behind a container or a van on that particular route can say goodbye to any time schedules they may have had.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has had ongoing discussions with the local council representatives in North Wales and, indeed, with his British Transport opposite number.  I am glad to note that the upgrading of the dual carriageway status of the A55 and A5 has been achieved at a cost to the British Government of £500 million, and also that the Government in Britain have decided that the remaining part of the route, from Llangefni to the port of Holyhead, which is a distance of 14 miles, is to be improved to dual carriageway status.  The completion of the dual way to Holyhead port will obviously greatly enhance accessibility to the port.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the Chamber of Commerce report &mdash; perhaps the Minister will have some up-to-date news on this &mdash; that the Government intend to upgrade the rail line to Holyhead from <Col N="1002" /> its present 70 mph to 90 mph.  However, I am disappointed to have learned from other sources that the Government in Britain have no plans to electify this route in order to make it even faster.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to briefly refer to an address made by Mr. Tom Jago, Chairman, Transport Policy Committee of the Confederation of Irish Industry and Managing Director of Irish Fertilisers Industries Limited, to the annual conference of the CII on 23 February, 1990 under the heading &ldquo;Transport Links&rdquo;.  Again, he emphasies the vital importance of the link out of this country.  He says 75 per cent of our total industrial output is exported, 80 per cent of which finds its way to the rest of the EC.  Therefore, an astonishingly high 60 per cent of our total industrial output must be transported by either sea or air.</P>
    <P>The number of passengers in 1989 reached the staggering total of 9.4 million. The most interesting feature of these figures, according to Mr. Jago, is not the scale but the rate at which they are increasing.  The 9.4 million figure for 1989 represented an increase of 14 per cent on the previous year.  It is also interesting to note, says Mr. Jago, that two-thirds travel by air and that 93 per cent of all of these passengers travel between Ireland and the rest of Europe.  He refers to the transport chain and says that it is essential that those responsible for our transport infrastructure realise that all of the elements of that infrastructure are inextricably linked.  For instance, providing the proper types of ships will serve little purpose if the sea ports are not fully equipped to effectively deal with the cargoes or passengers from these ships. Likewise, linked to the sea ports the road and rail system must be designed to cater for exactly the same volume of traffic with equal effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House, but I considered it important to make those points, and to emphasise points which have already been brought up.  I am sure very little of this comes as news to the Minister, who has taken a keen interest in the developing of our air, rail and sea links.  However, it seems to me that at <Col N="1003" /> the end of the day what we are really talking about here is money and more money.  It is in that context that I want to conclude my remaks by once again emphasising that it is vitally important that not only the Government but all those who are involved in discussions with our European partners in the transport and industrial exporting area, should continue to hammer home the point that Ireland is unique.  We are and after 1992 with the opening of the Channel Tunnel, we will be the only member state of the European Community that will not have a fixed land link with another member state.</P>
    <P>The implications of this for Ireland cannot be overstated.  While most of the emphasis in relation to 1992 and beyond has been on tax harmonisation, whether cars will be cheaper or consumer goods will be cheaper, I believe there has not been sufficient, adequate and enough serious debate on the implications for Ireland post-1992, specifically in relation to transport policy.  From the Minister's remarks in the context of this Bill a start obviously has been made.  I hope the Government's commitment to ensuring that our infrastructure will continue to be developed at a fast rate will result in a more competitive service, a more frequent service and a service which can only benefit in the longer term and help to enhance the prosperity of this country.</P>
    <P>I, too, commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Senator Mooney for his very well researched address to the Seanad and for his helpful comments.  In proposing that the Seanad accept the Second Stage of the Bill, I say that this is an island nation and for an island nation not to fully develop its air and sea links in a comprehensive integrated fashion would be a major mistake.  Our air and sea routes are our roads to our export markets and they are our roads for our tourists. We never miss an opportunity at EC level to impress upon our EC colleagues <Col N="1004" /> the philosophy of the Irish Government which is the critical nature of being able to get on and off the island of Ireland of being able to bring goods and tourists in and out of the country efficiently, effectively and safely.  That is our transport policy and we never lose an opportunity to explain it.</P>
      <P>As regards the EC transport programme, we hope to be able to announce substantial transport investment from the EC Structural Fund in the next few weeks.  That is being finalised in co-operation with the Department of the Environment. I hope we will be able to announce that operational programme in a matter of weeks.  This will entail substantial further investment in our transport infrastructure.  I will not say any more about that at this stage but will come back to it when we are ready to make that announcement.</P>
      <P>I want to thank Senator Mooney and join with him in saluting the staff and management of the B &amp; I.  It is a company that is strongly led.  It is a company whose staff have taken a battering, to put it politely.  They have take a wage cut, a wage freeze and seen their staff eroded from 1,400 to 800-odd.  I cannot think of many companies, public or private, that can take that kind of medicine and still be optimistic.  The company are optimistic and they are turning themselves around and they have my support.  I join with the Seanad in conveying my appreciation to the staff, management and the board of the company.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention that the B &amp; I company will not require State funding as soon as possible.  It is aimed to see an end to State subvention of B &amp; I as soon as that is possible and that it become commercially self-reliant.  That is not the same thing as privatisation.  In regard to the Senators' comments in that area, that there are a number of options for the company, options which have to be assessed very carefully and I am looking closely at what those options are.  In particular, I am waiting to hear formally what the B &amp; I board see as their future options.  I expect to hear from them very shortly indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> One of those options is that the company would no longer be in State control. Another option is that the State would continue in some way to be involved.  Let us be clear about it, I believe the company would be the first to acknowledge this: over a ten year period we have invested, in terms of taxpayers' money, something of the order of £70 million in the company. It is quite clear that that cannot and will not continue.  We have to find another route.  I want to assure the workforce, the management and the board that the Government will take no decision without having full and frank consultations with the people who have borne the brunt of the difficulties and who, through their courage and determination, have turned the company around and have effectively saved it, but there is a long way to go.  It is not my intention to come here every year asking for funding for this State company.  We have to find another direction.</P>
    <P>The Holyhead-London road is a major artery for Irish exports and for Irish trade.  That road, ironically, I would argue, is more important to Ireland than many Irish roads because it is our artery and it is critical for the future development of tourism and exports.  The British Government are aware of the Irish Government's full support for their efforts to upgrade that road.  I am told quite a stretch of it is now up to dual carriageway standard and some of it is up to motorway standard.  The intention is that all of it will be upgraded.  I have just told the Dáil that within a matter of days I will be formally writing to the British Transport Minister assuring him of Irish support during our EC Presidency to support any proposals they may put forward to upgrade that road further, and not just stopping at London.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the opening of the Channel Tunnel.  It is critical that we can get our exports quickly and easily from Holyhead to the tunnel and on to export markets on the Continent.  I want to again assure the British Government that their efforts to upgrade that road will have our fullest support, particularly during our Presidency but also long afterwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> The Senator is probably also aware that I recently announced grant aid for the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company.  I want to say quite clearly again today in the Seanad, now that I have an opportunity, that there have been inaccurate comments that this is a once off support for the Cork-Swansea Ferry.  It is an act of faith by me and the Government in the people of Cork, Kerry and the southern region.  I have already told the Seanad that the consultants' report advised me not to grant aid this company; the most independent, financial and economic advice I received suggested the Government should not support the ferry.  Nevertheless, I decided against that advice on the basis of commitments from the people of Cork and Kerry that they would support the ferry and make it work.  I am prepared to put my faith in the business people of that region that they will make it work.  I again say to them today, make it work and it will survive.  The future of the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company depends not on the Government but on the support they receive from the people of the Cork-Kerry area.  That should be crystal clear so that there will be no misunderstanding next year when we look at the results.  I believe my confidence is well placed.  Time will tell.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned briefly the question of tourism.  I would like to thank him and salute him for his long standing interest and support for the tourist industry. It is just starting now on the brink of its most exciting phase in that over the next four years, between public sector investment, private sector investment and EC Structural Funding some £600 million will go into the tourist industry in infrastructure.  That includes business expansion scheme money, for example. If you take that £600 million over a four year period it is more than was invested in the tourist industry in the past 25 years taken together.  In a matter now of a week or so I will be in a position to announce the very first of those grants and supports from the EC to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I believe in properly invested moneys as opposed merely to spending.  It is my <Col N="1007" /> intention that we do not spend the money in that sense but that we invest it for future generations.  If we invest it properly it will change the face of Irish tourism in that we will then be able to offer the products which are offered internationally. There is a myth in regard to tourism which I am keen to dispel, that is that it is based on people wanting to come to Ireland because they wish to meet nice people and see nice scenery.</P>
    <P>My experience from research shows that that is part of it, that it comes from a traditional reputation we have but my research shows also that our target to double tourism in four years is proving difficult.  We have the targets to date but the next two years will be very difficult indeed.  Only by investing in the product and giving people something to do in Ireland when they come here will we be able to attract future tourists.</P>
    <P>Tourism is like any other business.  It is extremely competitive.  The more you travel the more you realise the wide choice of locations people have in regard to motorways.  They can travel to many different countries and have excellent facilities.  Ireland simply has to compete with those other destinations if it wants to get tourism.  It can not rely on the nice image which has taken us this far but which in my view provides us with only a limited capacity to develop the industry. Therefore, we must invest this £600 million of EC money and private money &mdash; business expansion scheme money &mdash; properly and sensibly.</P>
    <P>People want to know the answer to one question in regard to Irish tourism, that is apart from the access costs, which we have been dealing with, what do they do when they get here.  What activities can they take part in, what are the indoor facilities, what facilities of international standards have we to offer.  We need to be able to answer that question by saying here is the list, here are the items and here are the facilities.  My intention is to provide those facilities over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Seanad for their consideration of the Bill on Second <Col N="1008" /> Stage, I commend it to the House.  I will be asking the Seanad, perhaps in a few moments, to give me all stages of the Bill this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apoplogise for my absence during the Second Stage which was unavoidable.  I would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions regarding the Bill which to a large extent is in danger of going through here on the nod, being non-contentious and non-controversial. I fully understand why the Minister is bringing it to this House now, that apparently is a matter of urgency. What he fails to explain in his speech although he may be able to tell me this now, is first, why this Bill is so urgent and secondly, what the money is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very neat operation to produce a Bill of this sort to the layman and say that the Government are going to purchase £6 million of equity capital.  It sounds very grandiose and sensible.  It sounds as if it is a Government investment in a company from which the Government will get some sort of return. My interpretation &mdash; the Minister will no <Col N="1009" /> doubt correct me if I am wrong &mdash; is that this money is extremely urgent and that this Bill is being introduced to bail out B &amp; I once again from an immediate situation which is very difficult for them. Nowhere in the Minister's speech do we get that impression.  The impression that we get is that the Government have made a sensible financial decision that once again they will put what is euphemistically called equity capital into an ailing company. It is no harm to remind the House that the history of B &amp; I over the last ten to 12 years is one of total and utter disaster and that the Government injected in their own language, into the company through the acquisition of share capital from 1978 to 1988 the following amounts: In 1978 £0.841 million, in 1979 £5.449 million, in 1980 £5.5 million, in 1981 £5.6 million, in 1982 £7 million, in 1983 £6.5 million, in 1984 £6 million, in 1985 £5 million, in 1986 £20 million and in 1988 £11 million.  This year we are being asked to put in another £6 million.</P>
    <P>I can remember when the previous Minister appeared before this House with the last B &amp; I Bill and stated that it was his hope that that would be the last time he would be asking the House for more capital.  The Minister today says &mdash; he worded it very carefully &mdash; that it was not his intention to be here every year asking permission from the Seanad and the Dáil to inject more capital into the company. It is right to say that what is happening here again is that the company are in trouble and the Government are bailing them out again.  It may well be &mdash; I do not want to anticipate the Minister's reply &mdash; that they are saying that this is a matter of paying debts and interest charges which have become due.  I would be interested in that but that is another issue. Maybe we could deal with what I have said first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for being gracious in his remarks about my involvement in tourism.  It is a question of being a chip of the old block. I could not have been other than interested in tourism having had for a father one who lived tourism all his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> I want to put a few points to the Minister and to rebut much of what Senator Ross has said in relation to the activities of B &amp; I.  The Minister states that in 1988 and 1989 B &amp; I returned operating profits of £1.8 million and £2.8 million respectively.  I do not think that you can take the difficulties of B &amp; I in isolation. When one compares their position with that of Sealink, their main competitor on the routes in and out of Ireland, one finds that they, too, have gone through enormous financial difficulties even with the backing of the British Government.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to reports in the <i>Irish Independent</i> newspaper, I did not raise some of the comments because they do not apply to the Bill before the House. My interpretation of the remarks by Senator Ross was that he was being derogatory towards the management and staff of B &amp; I and disparaging of the efforts they have made in the past two years to become viable.  It is important that the House should be aware that Sealink had enormous difficulties.  One of the reasons the company are now in profit, according to the information supplied is that they operate the short routes where ships can make two round trips a day.</P>
    <P>At one time Sealink were knocking B &amp; I's Liverpool to Dublin ferry.  In 1984 they said the Liverpool route had one sailing daily and that it took half the night.  Sealink, I might inform Senator Ross, tried to run a service on the long Liverpool/Dún Laoghaire route but abandoned the experiment at the end of last year as it made no money.  There are several other references to the trading difficulties that Sealink had on the Irish Sea.  It is not fair to single out B &amp; I. There are difficulties on the Irish Sea route and they have been there for a long time.  It is important at this stage in the debate &mdash; the Minister has taken a lead on this &mdash; to highlight the positive aspects of the rationalisation programme that B &amp; I have embarked on over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister refer to the fact that he has ongoing discussions with his British counterpart and <Col N="1011" /> that the Irish Government during its Presidency of the EC will be giving full support to any proposals that the British Government have for improving the road and rail links through Britain down to the Channel Tunnel.  Could I suggest to the Minister that he might use the Irish card in his dealings with Mr. Cecil Parkinson, who very recently was quoted in the <i>Irish Post</i> as not only claiming to be Irish but proud to be Irish.  Perhaps it might be a way of getting to a British Minister.  We tend to use the Irish card in our dealings with our American cousins so it might be a pleasant change to have a British Minister, particularly in the transport area, responding not just on purely practical and cold economic grounds but maybe with a little bit of sentimentality attached.</P>
    <P>I might also ask the Minister if there are any proposals in the context of the £6 million that is being given to B &amp; I. Obviously, in giving such a large sum of money the Government have a stake and an input into the management policy of B &amp; I.  Will there be any more frequency of service on the Irish Sea?  It seems that one of the major difficulties facing us, both as a tourist nation and as an industrial and exporting nation, is the lack of frequency of service.  In my comments earlier about the diversion of trade to the Northern ports this point comes across time and time again.  One of the big advantages, apart altogether from the other aspects of the reasons why people go North, is the frequency of service.  If they miss one ferry they will get another one a short time afterwards and there is not a hold up in costs; whereas if one misses the ferry on the Dublin/Holyhead corridor one may have to wait up to 12 hours.  In that context might I welcome both B &amp; I and Sealink's recent investment in new shipping on the Irish Sea.  I hope to have the opportunity of experiencing both of the ferries, Dublin/ Holyhead and Rosslare/Fishguard over the coming weeks.  According to media reports these ferries are up to a very high standard.  I am delighted that the B &amp; I ferry is being <Col N="1012" /> refitted by a Dublin based company.  It is providing much needed employment.</P>

      <P>I have not repeated one thing I have said, but I take the Chair's comments on board.  I would just like to complete my comments to the Minister by again asking, in the context of the £6 million given to B &amp; I and all that implies, whether there are any plans or what steps are being taken to minimise, perhaps reduce and eliminate the diversion of trade to the Northern ports?</P>

      <P>Could I say, in response to Senator Ross, that I share his frustration, I am sure the company also share it.  This is not a simple matter.  It is a complex enough issue.  The Senator will be aware of that.  This is urgent because the cash is required by the company as soon as they physically can get it.  It is important that it is obtained sooner rather than later.  The company have scheduled debt repayments to make. They have to be met.  Clearly, Government funding is required before they can be met.  The urgency is tied in with the scheduling of the repayment of the debt. That is what the cash is largely being used for and that is why it is urgent.</P>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves.  In 1987 the company recorded a loss, before extraordinary items of £10.7 million.  The forecast this year is a loss of something over £1 million.  If that trend continues the company will be in a break even situation very soon.  Since 1983 the company have recorded losses, before extraordinary items, of over £50 million and after extraordinary items of up to £100 million.  It is clear that the investment from the State is required in order to fund those losses.  In short the money is required to fund historic losses because the company are now coming into a situation where they can break even very shortly, hopefully this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I have asked the company <Col N="1013" /> now to sit down and consider that they are half way through this programme, they have taken some very tough decisions losing half their staff, taken a pay cut of 5 per cent, taken a wage freeze for another period.  A quite savage management action programme has reduced the losses from £10 million to £1 million.  I thought it was appropriate that we should support them this year and immediately look at what the options are for their future.  I am not sure if the Senator was here when I was responding.  I said that I am looking very urgently at the future options of this company and I do not rule out any particular option in regard to the future of the company.  The money is required to fund that particular history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Mooney misinterpreted me, I apologise.  It would be wrong not to recognise the great strides made by the management and the company for various reasons in moving into what is called an operating profit.  If I did mislead the House I am sorry.  It does not solve the problem of the £6 million.  I accept the Minister's explanation but it leads on to something more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if this £6 million was anticipated in the budget or in the Exchequer returns at any stage.  If it was not I would like to know why it was not anticipated.  It seems to me that we are being asked to produce this money in a hurry.  I would like to know why we are being asked to produce this money in a hurry.  The second point which I think is the kernel of the problem &mdash; the Minister answered me but not quite fully on this &mdash; is it will actually be used to pay off some of the interest payments on the debt.  First of all, if it was not anticipated we ought to know why.  Secondly, it seems that the problem of the B &amp; I debt is something this House and the Government should be honest about.  I can do lots of things with figures, as can the Minister and his officials.  I can talk about operating profits which sounds very good.  We can talk about extraordinarily items, which is a device &mdash; not necessarily in this case &mdash; for recording different <Col N="1014" /> levels of profit.  We will still be landed with this enormous B &amp; I debt.</P>
    <P>What is important here is whether the Government, by producing this £6 million basically to bail them out of interest payments which are due in a few days' time, will continue treating the B &amp; I debt as through it is guaranteed.  The Minister says &ldquo;The burden of debt, however is a commercial reality with which the company has to continue to cope.&rdquo;  It is exactly the opposite of that. If the company know that the debt which they have incurred over the last ten to 15 years will, every time the interest payments are called on be paid by the Government it is not a commercial reality for the company.  It is, in fact, something they can exclude from their projections in practice because the Government will come to their rescue to pay that debt. I would prefer to have here from the Minister a pledge that B &amp; I will in future stand on their own or a projection of how much of B &amp; I's debt payments we will have to bail them out for in the future.</P>
    <P>At the moment the reason we have this Bill is that the debt has arisen and the Government have once again come to their rescue. It seems to me that we have had this system in several semi-State bodies in the past.  It is something which I would like to avoid in the future.  What I am trying to ask the Minister is how he proposes that the debt will be treated in the future and could he give us an indication that that debt will no longer be regarded as a Government responsibility, which it obviously is here, but will be a B &amp; I responsibility.  It is quite easy to produce an operating profit if the money you have borrowed is something which the company does not have to pay back or if the interest payments do not have to be paid back.  What I would like to see is the Minister giving us an indication of how this is going to be paid for in the future.  We now know this £6 milion is actually being used to pay off debt, or most of it is being used to pay off debt, because there is a cash crisis in B &amp; I once again.  What I would like to know is, if there are future cash crises can they <Col N="1015" /> be avoided and could we have an indication from the Minister of how they will be treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator asked me was the £6 million anticipated.  The precise figure was not, but some investment was anticipated because at the time of the major crisis in the company some three years ago or so the action plan that was then brought forward under a new chairman of the company was an anticipated £35 million action programme.  The Government did not commit themselves to that £35 million but did indicate to the company that it should proceed with the action plan and the Government would look at the progress of that plan on the basis of having an annual look at the progress of the company.  That annual look is now being taken again and the Government have concluded that we should invest or ask the Dáil and Seanad for authority to invest £6 million in the company.  It was anticipated to the extent that the original estimate for bringing the company fully around over a five year period was £35 million.</P>
      <P>The Senator has also asked me about the guarantee of the debt.  The position there is that of the total debt of £37.3 million, which is the B &amp; I debt at the end of December 1989, £16 million is covered by State guarantee.  I can say crisply and frankly that it is not the Government's intention to enter into any further State guarantees in regard to borrowings of the company.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us about interest payments.  Could he be more specific about the £6 million.  If he cannot, I will understand.  This Bill, as I understand it, just gives the Government the option to purchase £6 million. It does not have to do it.  Could he be more specific about what proportion of that is going to pay off B &amp; I's debt or interest payments when they are due and how much of that is going to be used for actually paying off the interest payments and when they are due?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is both, but you can take it that the bulk of the £6 million, most of that money, is being used to fund scheduled repayments.  That is the purpose of the £6 million.  Most of it is going in that area.  It is capital as well as interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has ongoing interest payments of its own, but in regard to the accumulated debt the purpose of the £6 million is for capital and interest on the accumulated debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very helpful.  Thank you very much.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me why the Government continually take the role of investing share capital into B &amp; I.  There are all sorts of other ways of doing it.  I do not know why this is preferable to perhaps guaranteeing £6 million or lending the company money.  It seems to me that this is the easy option as far as the company is concerned because if £6 million in share capital, which sounds very grand but really is not, is injected into the company, the company has very little obligation to that £6 million.  The future of that £6 million depends on the performance of the company.  If the Government were either to guarantee a loan of £6 million or were to lend B &amp; I the money, it would put realistic commercial pressures on B &amp; I to pay this back within a commercially decided time.  At the moment the injection of £6 million, like it or not, puts B &amp; I under absolutely no pressure to perform well.  The Government have got £100 million stuck in there already and another £6 million, which B &amp; I are probably not overconcerned about because it <Col N="1017" /> is all gone, puts B &amp; I under no pressure to perform at all.  To lend it this money would be to put B &amp; I under some pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator lives in the commercial world.  It would not make any sense to have lent up to £100 million over seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not do the balance sheet any justice to inject on to the balance sheet loan capital.  If one thought there was a realistic prospect of having it repaid then one could consider that course of action.  That is not important because, if it goes in as equity and that fresh equity enables the company to be profitable and the State owns the company, then we get the profits at the end of the day anyway.  It would not put any additional pressure on the company; it would only make its balance sheet look slightly more ill and that would not do the company any good.  If it had consequential benefits for the Exchequer you could consider it, but it would not have any consequential effects on the Exchequer, benefits for the Exchequer, because there would not be a reasonable prospect of having a scheduled repayment on this State investment.</P>
      <P>I have to be pragmatic about it: either we support the company through its recovery programme or we do not.  I think the half way house of lending the money in the hope of getting it back, when in fact it is not realistic considering its other commitments, is a far more straightforward and in many ways more courageous approach, because you are making a crisp decision that you will support the company and therefore improve the balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to correct an impression I may have given, Senator, because you are being quite specific with me and I need to be specific in response.  Quite a large share of the £6 million will be in fact capital repayment.  I prefer not to give the figures, but quite a large share of the £6 million will be capital repayment on <Col N="1018" /> the scheduled debt, some of it will be interest but a larger share than I may have given the impression will actually be capital repayment also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I sympathise with what the Minister says about the road they have taken to put more capital in, and it is obviously consistent with what has been done over the last 11 years. I wonder could the Minister give me an estimate of the value of the £106 million worth of shares put in the company, the equity value now of that to the Government, how much it would be worth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a commercial valuation that I can give you, Senator.  If you were to take it down to your stock exchange and ask for a valuation on it, I think its commercial value on paper would depend a lot on the treatment of the historic debt.  It would depend a lot on the future plans of the company in regard to replacing the ships. It would depend on the company's future plans in regard to routes.  To value the company you could not just take a net asset value because that would be very small.  It would be quite negligible.  You would have to take into account all of those items.  They are the very items about which I am waiting to hear from the company board: their plans for future vessels, for future routes and their ideas on how the historic debt could be treated. I am anxious that we bite this bullet and do our best for the company as urgently as possible, but to do that in consultation with the staff and the management because of the fact that they have taken such a savaging in the past few years commercially.  The unions there particularly have been co-operative in recent years in turning the company around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also I think it would be silly for any Minister publicly to put a value on a company when in fact all of the options as to its future are still on the table, including the fact that the State may not continue to own all of it.  That is an option which is not ruled out.  Neither is it ruled out that we would hold on to the company. While it is tempting to be crisp with <Col N="1019" /> an answer to the Senator, it might not be fair to either the company or the Exchequer to do that.  The Senator could draw his own conclusions from those comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me help the Minister and offer him a figure.  I suggest that if the company were to retain its historic debt the figure would be negative rather than positive, the company would be worth a minus amount, and the Government would actually have to pay someone to take it on board.  That is why the £106 million or so which has been put into the company is completely wasted public money in a commercial sense.  If we could go on from there, I ask the Minister whether he would be more positive in considering privatising some of the more commercially viable areas of B &amp; I.  It does seem to me &mdash; and I say this not from an ideological point of view but from a straightforward point of view &mdash; that with the best will in the world B &amp; I under State ownership, State direction and State nursing has been an unsuccessful company commercially, but that if there is a private company, which the Minister either hinted at or stated specifically, that was interested in taking over the company, or parts of the company, then it is a godsend to the Government that it should have such an albatross for the last 12 years removed.  Seeing that the company as it is presently constituted, is worth, not nothing but minus nothing &mdash; because all that happens every year, or every two years is that those who own all the shares have to pay more money to keep owning the shares and keep the company going &mdash; the Minister might consider privatisation of the commercially successful parts as a real runner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe the Minister would be more honest &mdash; I am not accusing him of dishonesty but he might be more clinically clean &mdash; and say, &ldquo;All right.  Let the company go.  They are making an operating profit, but the Government are going to take on the debt&rdquo;, because to me, in effect, that is what is happening. There may be small capital repayments, <Col N="1020" /> and I respect the Minister's wish not to give us the detailed figures, but the Government are paying off the company's debt.  That is what is happening and that is what is going to go on happening, and we will leave it at that.  The Government might even get some of their capital back in selling off the successful parts of B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>At the moment we appear to have the worst of both worlds.  We appear to have a small operating profit and capital repayments and interest repayments being made by the Government.  I think the Government would be very lucky, it would be a godsend to the Government and the people of this island if any private company was prepared to take this company on at its present value, because at its present value it is going to remain a burden on the Government.</P>
    <P>I can see quite clearly from the trend and the figures and from what the Minister says that the Minister &mdash; God forbid, unless he is promoted &mdash; or some future Minister will be back here in two year's time, or maybe one year's time, saying &ldquo;Look, the company is doing terribly well and it has now got an operating profit of XYZ but I am going to have to ask you to pay off their debt again&rdquo;.  I do not think it is unrealistic to say that that is what is going to happen.  The Minister, because he was very careful in his response, said that he does not want that to happen: but I think he realises that unless B &amp; I perform extraordinarily well that is what is going to happen.  The Seanad is going to probably, as it normally does, congratulate the management and the workforce of B &amp; I and let it through on the nod without examining why we are paying off this vast debt and asking should we be doing so.  That is what I would like the Minister to tell us: will he consider saying &ldquo;OK We will sell it off and we will pay off the debt.&rdquo;? That is the honest approach.  The Government's role in this company is actually to pick up the tab.  That is what has been happening and that is what is going to happen again.</P>
    <Col N="1021" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You can sell any company in the country if you pick up the tab for the debt.  You would know that yourself.  There is no difficulty in selling companies if you march in and march off with the debt.  Then every company, private or public, would be a very much more exciting prospect than it is with the debt.  If you marched in and paid off the debt and then sold off some of the good routes, you would be left with the worst of all worlds.</P>
      <P>We are getting to a situation where the company after a very sick time is coming back now to very good health.  The commercial thing to do is to continue to improve the company, get it into profit and, as we have now commenced in recent weeks look very crisply at exactly what the options are.  It would not be fair to all the people who have brought this about &mdash; staff reductions from 1,400 to 800, 5 per cent pay cuts, termination of the Dublin-Liverpool car ferry route, sale of the North Wall properties and a rescheduling and renegotiation of historic debt &mdash; to let some bounty hunter pick up bits and pieces of the company that, given their difficulties, have tried and done their best to serve what is, after all, a very strategic business of developing access to and from the country.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the Senator's sense of urgency and his requirement to move quickly and commercially on it, a much more sensible approach for the Government to take would be to look quickly now at what those options are.  Those options do not exclude some of the suggestions the Senators mentioned.  I have told the Dáil quite bluntly that I am not ruling out any option for the future of the company.  But I am determined about one thing, and that is not to be coming back here year after year looking for State support for the company.  It is most determinedly my intention not to have to go down that road, and to see an end to State subvention of this company as soon as that is physically possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also to be careful here.  We did put in place an action plan some two or three years ago and we had better not lurch around with it.  Hundreds of people <Col N="1022" /> committed themselves to that plan &mdash; staff, board, management, banks, ferry companies, harbour authorities, hundreds of people.  The plan is performing better than anticipated and I want to be careful in the centre of that plan not to flap about and start calling off all the bets when in fact people committed themselves to a plan which is actually working and in which we did anticipate there would be an expense.  Our best chance here of getting our money back, of stopping the subventions, is to stick it out, to study the options &mdash; and I exclude no option &mdash; and then to make mature decisions in full consultation with the staff.  I intend to do that within a matter of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand your sense of urgency, Sir.  I hope I will not keep you for very much longer.  Maybe the Minister could indicate how the debt would be treated in the future?  First of all, what I would like to elicit from him &mdash; but I presume I will not be able to &mdash; is a pledge that he will not come back in the next three, four or five years looking for more money for B &amp; I.  Having failed to elicit that, which I am anticipating in his reply, perhaps he could tell us if the Government have any projections about the B &amp; I debt in the next five years, how much it is going to cost the Government in the next five years and what parameters will be acceptable to the Government in the next five years.  It is not unreasonable that the Minister should say to us, &ldquo;Next year, we anticipate that we will be paying off another £6 million&rdquo;.  I think it is unreasonable, but it is not unreasonable that he should tell us what will be paid off the year after and in the year after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us also in some detail how much is acceptable to the Government or whether we really have a blank cheque again from them for B &amp; I and that we have a blank cheque, too, so to speak, in terms of piecemeal arrivals of the Minister for Tourism and <Col N="1023" /> Transport here every second year or even every year asking for more money for the company.  Perhaps the Minister could specifically say first, &ldquo;I do not think I will be back here&rdquo;&mdash; I do not expect him to promise he will not; it would be unrealistic &mdash; I do not want to be back here; but, secondly, &ldquo;I do not anticipate being back here looking for more than X amount of money.  If more than that amount of money is looked for, it will be unacceptable to the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is fair that that sort of pressure should be put on B &amp; I at least.  They should be told that the Government simply are not going to pay off more than so much of the debt in future years.  My view is that they should not pay off any of the debt for them.  That is obviously politically unacceptable to the Government.  We should be told in public by the Government how much is acceptable to them. Otherwise the B &amp; I management, who are good, honest hard working people, will still have in the back of their minds the notion that, &ldquo;We are doing OK, the action plan is doing all right, the debt is a bit of a problem but we do know really what is going to happen to the debt&rdquo;.  I know what is happening to the debt and the Minister knows what is going to happen to the debt.  We know perfectly well that the debt is going to be paid off by the Government and what we need to know is how much is acceptable to the Government.  Really what is happening here is that we are being told: &ldquo;Sorry, chaps, we have got to pay off another £6 million but things are going very well and we hope not to be looking for any more&rdquo;. What I would like to know is what is acceptable in the future and what is not acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no blank cheque for B &amp; I or any other State company. That has been made quite clear.  Secondly, there are no further State guarantees for borrowings by the company &mdash; I think I have made that clear also.  Thirdly, the Senator has to face a few realities. There are loans to private financial institutions. Secondly, the Government own <Col N="1024" /> the company.  If we own the company and the debts are to private financial institutions, then we have an obligation to meet those debts.  That is not going to go away and therefore we have to meet the scheduled debt.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention, obviously, to increase the debt, that would certainly be unacceptable.  As I said in my opening remarks, by 1995 we should see the end of the debt; but that depends on a whole range of things over which we have little control, like projections on profit in regard to traffic, competition on the sea, costs of vehicles and their replacement and all of that.  I would like to be definite for the Senator because I can sense from listening to him that he is keen to stop the bleeding.  That is also my desired intention: to stop any bleeding that is going on.  In fairness it has come down from a very substantial haemorrhage to what is now only a trickle and hopefully this year &mdash; and, if not, certainly early next year &mdash; we will see a full stopping of the bleeding.  Now that we have got that far it makes sense to look at the options. A couple of years ago we had no options. It was: close the company down or try to rescue it.  We decided to try to rescue it. We are substantially on the way to doing that now, so at least we now have options. Now is the right time to look, in consultation with the company, as to precisely which of those options we should go for.  There are many options and I have mentioned a few already.</P>
      <P>The historic debt is obviously an important negotiating item in dealing with the company and in dealing with those outside the company who might be interested.  I did say already I had an unsolicited expression of interest from one particular privately owned ferry company. I have, in response to an informal request from the B &amp; I, left that to one side while I hear from the board of B &amp; I as to what their own intentions are.  I think, in view of what they have been through, I should certainly give them courtesy of listening very carefully to what their intentions are.  We will take the most commercial sensible option as quickly as we possibly can.</P>

      <P>I do not think I am travelling over the specific ground we have covered already.  Obviously, this Bill is urgent and I accept the urgency of it.  What I do not think we have had is a proper explanation from the Minister and no doubt he did not have to give it on the B &amp; I Line Bill. What we need is a reason this has to be actually done this week.  What are the mechanics?  Where do B &amp; I need the money?  What day is the money due? What day is the interest repayment due <Col N="1026" /> which requires this Bill to be passed so urgently?  This is important.  We understand the principles of the Bill.  We know exactly why the Bill is required.  What I do not understand is why it needs early signature.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I presume that when we are asked for an early signature for a Bill in this House we are entitled to extremely good explicit reasons for the need for an early signature.  That is really all I am asking.  I asked it in a different form under the Bill but what I am asking here now is where is the money going to go and is there a debt due immediately which needs the early signature.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the early signature motion is to have the Bill enacted fully and that requires the Presidential signature because there are scheduled repayments and they are scheduled in a matter of days.  Some of them may already be overdue.  I do not want to be pinned down to days here, but you can take it I would not ask the <Col N="1027" /> President of Ireland to sign a Bill earlier than normal if I did not consider that it was fairly urgent to do so.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Garda Complaints Board.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this topic because of the great dissatisfaction which has been expressed to me by various groups involved in civil liberties and by members of the Garda Complaints Board informally about the delay in processing complaints to the Garda Complaints Board. What I say here should not in any way be taken by the Minister or by the House to denigrate the Garda Síochána or the work they have been doing over the last 20 years since this Garda Complaints Board has obviously become necessary, although it has only been initiated in the last four or five years.  It was in the seventies and eighties, but specifically in the seventies, that some activities of the Garda Síochána in particular caused public concern and necessitated the need for an inquiry into the activities of certain small elements of the Garda.  What was necessary was that a complaints board be set up, which was both independent of the Garda and was as inexpensive as possible and that produced the results of complaints as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in 1986 responded to this need by introducing a Garda Complaints Act, which included two boards, the Garda Complaints Board and the Garda Complaints Appeal Board.  This Act was linked to the 1984 Criminal Justice Act which gave additional powers to the Garda.  The Garda Complaints Act, <Col N="1028" /> 1986, was directly linked to the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in that the additional powers that were being given to the Garda in 1984 under the Criminal Justice Act, which caused such controversy, were directly linked to the setting up of the Garda Complaints Board.  One of them could not come into effect without the other.  This was absolutely necessary in order that the Government and the Garda should retain public confidence.  I raise this question with the Minister in the spirit that the Garda should retain the confidence of the public.  The process of this tribunal which is so badly delayed is reducing the confidence of the public in their civil liberties, and in the Garda as well.  These delays give rise to suspicion &mdash; and wrongly give rise to suspicion &mdash; that the Garda are in some sense delaying the complaints and possibly not investigating things as promptly as might be necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks of the independence of the board was that the Garda were to investigate the issues and the complaints.  That was fairly well answered by the fact that the Garda were always subject to the supervision of the board.  The board, if it did not like what the Garda reported, could send them back to investigate further.  The system that was set up in 1986 was adequate, and was, as my memory recollects, welcomed by all sides of the House in a fairly non-contentious way &mdash; which is rare these days in the Seanad &mdash; in a non-contentious Chamber.  It was the same in the other House.  This system, had it been operated properly, would have worked. It was a safeguard which was greeted with enthusiasm by various civil liberties groups, but what has happened unfortunately since then, partly because this board were set up simultaneously with the cuts in public expenditure, is that the resources for the operation of this board were inadequate for them to fulfil their statutory duties.  It is an unfortunate coincidence for the members of this board and for the complainants that they coincided with the cuts in public expenditure. As a result, the board and many civil liberties groups feel that the board <Col N="1029" /> do not have enough resources.  The danger for a board of this sort is that if they do not have enough resources and they have too many complaints &mdash; which they have &mdash; they will either become a rubber stamp or the delay in the complaints will be totally unacceptable and people will not get justice.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that this board have gone out of their way not to be a rubber stamp and they have gone out of their way not just to process these complaints in such a way that they are disregarded or dealt with in a very short time.  If there is any fault with the board it is simply that they have paid too much attention to the complaints and they have been too conscientious, if that is possible. One of the reasons I bring this up today &mdash; and I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say &mdash; is that when the Garda Complaints Act was introduced it was anticipated by the Minister for Justice at the time that there would only be 400 complaints per annum.  In the first year there were 1,000 complaints and in the second year there were 950.  The allocation of funds by the Minister for Justice at the time was on the basis of 40 per cent only of the number of complaints that have actually been sent to the Garda Complaints Board.  The allocation of funds was based on something which was far smaller than the reality.  That is the first reason it is necessary for the Minister to look at this again and to give the board more money to operate properly.  The board have informed the Minister for Justice about this on many occasions and the response they received has been totally and utterly inadequate.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1988-89 the average complaint was taking 14 months to investigate. That is a ridiculous delay, which is unacceptable not only to the complainant but to the gardaí who are involved.  As a result, 622 complaints were carried forward to 1990 which had not been dealt with.  This is an enormous number for a small staff to deal with.  What is going to happen if the Minister does not rescue this board or help them out, is that the backlog is going to get bigger, the length of time people are having to wait is going <Col N="1030" /> to get longer, and it is going to be harder to investigate things which happened one, two or three years ago.  As a result of this, I understand that many of the complaints which have been made to the board are being withdrawn.  Frustrated complainants are finding that the board are behaving and operating in such an inadequate way that they are throwing their hands in the air and asking: what is the point in going to this board?  Nothing will be processed for two or three years; the complaint will then be irrelevant and he will not get any serious remedy and he will not get justice.  It appears in the last year that many serious, legitimate complaints &mdash; or probably legitimate complaints &mdash; have actually been withdrawn because of the frustration at the process of this particular board.  As a result of this, justice in this country is not being seen to be done properly.  People are losing confidence in the institutions of the State and the impartiality of a board of this sort.</P>
    <P>We should not think just of the complainants. Plenty of cranks will complain &mdash; and people without legitimate grievances will complain to the Garda Complaints Board, as well as those with serious civil liberties being infringed.  I think also, Minister, of the Garda.  When a complaint is made to this board about the behaviour of the Garda, in many cases the garda has a blot on his copybook for two or, maybe, three years.  At least there is a question mark over his head. A serious complaint about the operation and activities of a garda in his behaviour as a special enforcer of law and order is being made.  Because it cannot be investigated for two years, it means presumably that that question mark over the garda will provide some sort of obstruction at least to his promotion.  It is probably unwise for anybody to promote anyone while there is a serious complaint about him.  For the sake of the garda &mdash; of the innocent garda &mdash; it is only right that these things should be investigated immediately.  For the sake of the complainant, it is obviously right that it should be immediate.</P>
    <P>The funding has been based on gross <Col N="1031" /> underestimates, on estimates which are only 40 per cent of reality.  It was also based on the hopes that many of the complaints would go through an informal Garda procedure and would never get to the Garda Complaints Board.  This also has not happened to the extent that was hoped for at the time.  So, we have the additional burden of the estimates: it was hoped that many would go through the informal Garda complaints procedure, but they are not going through that procedure but are going to the Garda Complaints Board.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the Department of Finance apparently carried out a survey of the board's functions.  Certainly up to recently, if my information is correct, the board had not received a copy of that survey.  I think that is a pity.  I think the board is entitled to a copy of that survey. It is only right that it should know whether its own complaints have been found legitimate by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in response to board representations, supplied it with extra staff. I am aware of the fact that the Minister for Justice provided it with four additional staff, but this was totally inadequate to the needs of the board.  The board made a decision which was a controversial one.  It may have been right or it may have been wrong; but the board, in response to the extra staff it was given, decided that it would tackle with that staff all the arrears rather than any of the present and immediate problems.  It seems to me that that was the right decision for the board to make: that those extra staff should concentrate on the arrears.  But it is not adequate that the arrears should be concentrated on and that the present complaints should be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a complaint of this sort is so serious &mdash; some of them will be frivilous and can be dismissed &mdash; if it is a legitimate complaint or has a <i>prima facie</i> case, that in justice it should be investigated immediately.  If people are mistreated, bullied or in any way manhandled physically or mentally by the <Col N="1032" /> Garda, this is a cause for immediate investigation.  I should remind the Minister that overseas we see the investigation once again of the police in the United Kingdom on a very celebrated case.  I am thinking of the Birmingham Six.  It would have been so much better for everybody if that had been properly investigated through the normal procedures at the time.  It is going to be very difficult now to investigate how the police in Birmingham behaved in 1974, 15 years later on.  Had that been investigated &mdash; and I do not wish in any way to predict the result of any such investigation &mdash; in 1974 through a properly constituted tribunal there, we would certainly have had a result which would have been less open to question.  I hope that the result of the unacceptable delays that we are having here into complaints against the Garda is not that there are miscarriages of justice in this country as well.  The possibilities of a cover up become far greater as distance is placed between the happening and the hearing of the complaint.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that now in the last few months complaints to the Garda Complaints Board have fallen from 77 to 60 per month.  I am told that the reason for that is not because there is less reason to complain, but that the complainants are told that the investigation of these complaints could take anything up to two years.  When they realise that it could take anything up to two years, the immediacy and urgency of what they themselves feel are legitimate grievances diminish.  In frustration they go away and say they have no interest in going before a board which really does not regard their complaints as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>This is about justice to the Garda and justice to the complainants.  It seems at the moment that we are in danger of turning a blind eye to miscarriages of justice if we are blandly accepting that the processing of these complaints can take so long.  We might take a lesson from across the water on this.  We do not want a situation to arise here whereby the Garda Síochána are indicted several years later for something that happened only a few <Col N="1033" /> weeks ago.  It seems that it is imperative, if justice is to be done, that the quality of the investigation must be retained and that it must be speedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say that I am aware of the difficulties experienced by the Garda Síochána Complaints Board in relation to the processing of complaints and of the board's decision not to process complaints made to it after 11 August 1989 until an accumulation of complaints on hands had been dealt with.  Prior to that decision the board had kept the Department of Justice informed of its workload and of its request for extra staff.</P>
      <P>Needless to say, the Department have continued to be kept aware of the board's position since that decision.  Since assuming office in July last the Minister for Justice has been made aware of the board's position.  He subsequently took the matter up with the Minister for Finance and as a result obtained agreement to the sanctioning of four extra staff members to the board, thereby increasing its complement from six to ten members.  All of these extra staff were made available by redeployment from elsewhere in the public service and assigned to the board by December last. It is scarcely necessary for me to mention the difficult situation which obtains in relation to procuring extra staff for any area of the public service at present.  I will just say &mdash; and I know the House will appreciate the point &mdash; that the allocation of resources to any particular State funded body must be examined in the context of the constraints which currently apply to all areas of public expenditure. Despite these constraints and with a considerable degree of difficulty, the Minister for Justice succeeded in obtaining agreement to allocate four extra staff to the board.  This was in addition to one extra staff member who had been assigned to the board in late-1988.  I am satisfied that the allocation of this number of extra staff, five in all, should help to ease the board's difficulties very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> Senator Ross has emphasised in particular the board's decision not to process complaints made to them after 11 August 1989 until an improvement of their workload situation had been effected.  The Minister for Justice had, in fact, hoped that the extra staff being made available to the board would have allowed them to carry out their functions without interruption, and suggested to the board that they might consider deferring their decision pending an assessment of the impact of the extra staff on the board's workload.  Unfortunately, the Board did not consider it possible to agree with the Minister's suggestion.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has rightly stated that we projected at the outset that 400 complaints per annum would be received by the board.  This is now running at about 1,000 per annum on average.  We accept that the number of complaints is greater than anticipated.  I fully endorse what Senator Ross has said.  We acknowledge that the board is a very conscientious organisation.  They have taken their job very seriously and have tackled all their tasks in a very thorough manner.  I would suggest that there is no financial difficulty with the board.  The financial resources have been allocated, but the board still maintain that there is a staff shortage. We believe ourselves that when these five staff are fully integrated into the workings of the board they will have a major contribution to make in assessing and analysing these problems and ensuring that complaints are dealt with very quickly and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>We have no evidence whatever of withdrawals of complaints because of delays. I want to assure the House that the Minister for Justice is most concerned to see that members of the public have access to an effective complaints investigation and adjudication system.  None of us would be happy with the situation where there were undue delays in the processing of complaints.  Concern in this regard is, of course, not confined to the position of members of the public.  The Minister is equally concerned from the point of view of members of the Garda Síochána about whom complaints are made and that <Col N="1035" /> these complaints are processed and finalised as expeditiously as possible. Arrangements are in place to have the board's situation monitored and to have the impact of the additional staff on the workload fully assessed.  The board's situation must, of course, continue to be considered in the context of the staff restrictions throughout the public service, which I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like also to mention that the Garda Síochána Complaints Act, 1986 provides for the board keeping the workings of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints under review and making a report thereon to the Minister for Justice within three years of the board's establishment, that is, by 5 April of this year.  That review and report may, of course, have implications for the board's operations and workload.  I can assure the House that it would be fully considered when it is received by the Minister for Justice.  Finally, I too share the Senator's desire to ensure that at all times the Garda have the full support and confidence of our people.</P>

      <P>I notice the Minister said that he had no evidence whatsoever of withdrawal of complaints.  I will present him with that evidence in an address &mdash; and maybe he can comment on it &mdash; by Mr. Séamus McKenna, Chairman of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, in his address at the Annual General Meeting of the Irish Association of Civil Liberties. He is, presumably, the person with authority to make this statement.  He stated exactly that there was evidence of complaints withdrawing.</P>

We will take this matter up with the Department of Justice.  We have no evidence that there is a withdrawal of complaints on account of delays.  That is the point I made but we will investigate this matter more fully.</P>
