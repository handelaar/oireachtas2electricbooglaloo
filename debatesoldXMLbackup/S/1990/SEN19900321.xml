      <P>Item No. 1, motion to rescind resolution of the House of 15 March 1990.  Senator Lanigan, Leader of the House, to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>By special leave of the House, I wish that item No. 1 be taken before the Order of Business.  In order to avoid an unnecessary confrontation with the courts and perhaps precipitate a constitutional crisis I move item No. 1:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders relative to Public Business, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges recommends that the resolution of the House of 15th March, 1990, adopting its Report (T.279) and its recommendation therein be rescinded.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will examine tomorrow the kind of forum under which the allegations made by Senator Norris may be investigated conclusively, either by a committee or sub-committee of the House which will guarantee that the courts will have no role in that process afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the sensitive nature of the situation, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the courts, I suggest that this item be taken without debate. <Col N="874" /> This matter will come up when the appropriate committee reports to the House and the House can have an opportunity for full debate.  I am open to suggestions from the House on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the suggestion of the Leader of the House that this be taken without debate, although my contribution will be brief. We will be supporting the proposal to rescind the suspension imposed last Thursday.  I would like to say at the outset, and make it very clear, that this is not being done because of last Friday's High Court order.  I believe that the constitution guarantees the right of the Houses of the Oireachtas to order our own affairs.  This is a right which I, and I believe everybody else here, would guard and defend very jealously indeed.  I know that some constitutional experts differ on this point but, as a parliamentarian, I am very clear as to where my loyalty and responsibility would lie should this question be put to the test and, under different circumstances, I would certainly have challenged last Friday's court order.  I want to be very clear on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to be equally clear why I support this proposal to rescind last Thursday's decision.  The reason is that when I and other members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges voted last Thursday, we did not have available to us a legal opinion from an eminent senior counsel who was briefed by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and whose briefing note made clear that he was to advise the committee, and whose own understanding was that he was engaged to advise the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  That opinion points out very clearly to us that our procedures were defective and indicated equally clearly how these defects could be remedied. Had that opinion been available last week the report would not have been sustained.  I have no doubt whatsoever about that.  Even though the conclusions of last week's report that there had been a grave breach of privilege might have been sustained eventually, the report <Col N="875" /> itself and the procedures could not be sustained.</P>
    <P>I cannot hide my very deep sense of personal anger over this matter.  I want the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to establish, as a matter of urgency, just why this opinion was withheld from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Unless we can be fully satisfied on this matter our confidence in the Cathaoirleach will have been irretrievably damaged and we will be obliged to act accordingly.  I want this matter examined as a matter of great urgency.  I want the Leader of the House to assure us that there will be a full report and action, if such is necessary, at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this matter over and back over the last month or so and in the intervening period we have lost a number of people from these benches.  We have two people missing at this moment, people who, through the course of the debate and argument, were excluded from the House.</P>
      <P>The position is as outlined by Senator Manning and as I took the trouble to outline to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on many occasions over the last month, and as I outlined in the debate here last Thursday morning.  I want to disagree fundamentally with what Senator Manning has said.  I see no contradiction whatsoever between the court's decision and the constitutional functions of this House.  To me it is quite open and clear-cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution makes it quite clear that any Member of the House is amenable only to the House itself for utterances made in the House.  It is very clear. It goes on further to say that the House shall make its own arrangements for penalising people who are in breach of said privileges.  What is in question here is the procedure which the House set up in order to discharge its constitutional function.  There is no threat to the House's work or the function of the House, it is simply to prove that &ldquo;nobody is above the law&rdquo; and in this case neither <Col N="876" /> are the Houses of Parliament in the way they go about their business.</P>
    <P>It is now quite clear, as I attempted to convince the committee over the last month, that the fundamental problem with the committee in investigating the allegations was that the rôle of the Cathaoirleach as judge in his own case was unacceptable.  It seems extraordinary that that information, which was by way of written opinion from senior counsel, was not made available to the committee.</P>
    <P>I have asked that tomorrow morning's meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges establish, as a matter of urgency, why it was that the information was not made available.  That is being discussed.  I reserve my right to make other demands or proposals arising from that investigation.  It is disgraceful that one of my colleagues, Senator Brendan Ryan, who was excluded from this House last week on the basis that he was fighting what he perceived to be an injustice in this case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It has grave relevance to this group, that on the issue the Senator was discussing he was excluded from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to remind the Senator that it has no relevance to the matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to get involved with the Cathaoirleach in any sideshow on this, so I will not pursue that point any further.  The constitutionality of the legislation passed in this House last Thursday afternoon, following the incorrect suspension of a Member, is also questionable.  I have asked that that matter be considered, particularly when the Members had amendments down to that legislation.  It has been an unhappy <Col N="877" /> month.  I look forward to the investigation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges into why this information did not reach us.  When that report comes back to the House I will have further to say.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House has made it quite clear to us that the allegations made by Senator Norris in the House, to which the Leader took exception, will now be investigated by a newly set up committee. From our side of the House, we see any such investigation to be simply structured as follows: both sides of the argument equally represented and an independent person in the middle.  It is a very simple, fair, well established, well tried and well accepted judicial practice.  That is where we will be going.</P>
      <P>I support the motion, I regret that two of my colleagues are not here to debate it and contribute to it.  I hope the explanations which will be given to us on this matter may clear the air but I think not.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will be supporting item No. 1 on today's Order Paper.  Last week we advised the House against pressing this business to a vote. When the vote came we voted against the exclusion of Senator Norris for a week on the basis that we were unhappy with the way the business was being conducted. We were unhappy that it was not being conducted in a manner which would be in accord with basic principles of justice.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that advice was available, advice which was in broad accord with our view last week.  I will be looking for clarification and an explanation as to why that advice was not made available to the House and why it was not acted upon.  In the meantime we will reserve our position.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I ask the Senator to withdraw that remark.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, I want to make the point that whatever Senator Manning might think about recourse to the High Court and how regrettable that was, nonetheless Senator Norris had recourse to the High Court because of the extremely unsatisfactory nature of these proceedings since the inception of the present Seanad.  The meaning of the High Court decision, it seems to me, is that Senator Norris should be restored instantly to the proceedings of this House, that he should not have to await the outcome of this motion.  I also share the concern over the news reports &mdash; they are all that I have to go on &mdash; that a significant piece of advice was withheld from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The House is entitled to a statement from you, a Chathaoirligh, now, on that matter.  I will not conceal my view on this matter.  Because of everything that has happened, the Independent Senators are justified in putting down the motion which they have just done which in fact calls for your resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we asked for a delay in the suspension of Senator Norris specifically because a judicial review was being sought by him.  The Leader of the House stated that he would not be bulldozed by the courts.  Today, we have a different attitude in which we are talking about our sensitivity to the courts.  I am very glad that that particular issue has been tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I should say is that it would have been far better if the House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had been less hasty.  I should remind those in the House who do not know, that before the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at which it was decided to suspend Senator Norris, Senator Norris wrote them a letter asking them to withhold their proceedings because he was seeking a judicial review.  That was either ignored <Col N="879" /> or dismissed.  If it had not been, we would not be in the situation we are now in.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that <i>prima facie</i> if anybody at that committee had knowledge of or had an opinion from a senior counsel or the State Solicitor's office at that time about what the likely outcome of such recourse to the courts would be, they were guilty of an unforgivable dereliction of duty for not revealing it to the committee at that time.  That is why I have put down, along with other members of the Independent group, under Standing Order 7 a call for your removal from office.  However, that does not go onto the Order Paper until next week.  It is certainly open to us to withdraw that if a satisfactory explanation is given to the House.  I ask you that now, tomorrow morning, or at a very early time, explain to this House why the information which apparently, according to the report in the newspapers, you then possessed, was not revealed at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats will be supporting this motion as well.  I would like to express our very deep sense of dissatisfaction over the way this matter has been handled by all parties involved.  It is extremely worrying and a deep concern that the office of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad should be undermined in such a way.  It is also a great worry to us that the Cathaoirleach should be implicated in that undermining. From our point of view we want to see this matter cleared up as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Procedure and Privileges of the Oireachtas are sacrosanct. It is sad that there has to be recourse to outside areas to deal with matters that I believe should be handled within the confines of where we stand today.  There is a deep sense of dissatisfaction at the way the matter has evolved.  We want to see it cleaned up, we want to see it cleared up and we want to see confidence restored in the position that we are discussing here today, which is the position of the Cathaoirleach in this Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before us today.  In fairness, we cannot lose sight of the fact that Senator Norris has not substantiated the charge that was made against you.  This matter, of course, will be discussed further.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that the suspension was a correct one.  In so far as you are concerned it has to be pointed out that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges gave you full and total approval to investigate the allegations.  Standing Order No. 69 was debated many times.  It clearly sets out your role in this matter, that you should chair all meetings of Seanad sub-committees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, which I am sure the Senator will accept, it is not a full and accurate report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>My sincere apologies.  Certainly Senator O'Toole was alone, perhaps, in saying there was a doubt in this area.  He did say that.  The fact is that Committee on Procedure and Privileges discussed it and we went through Standing Order No. 69 many times.  We were aware of the possible implications because the Cathaoirleach was, as it were, a judge in his own court.  I have to make this point and I had to make the point yesterday, I was disappointed to learn that there was a senior counsel opinion.  I was disappointed that it was not put before us on Wednesday last when we met.  It might well have made a change in direction.  It might have led to a different decision.  Certainly, whatever happened, it would have been preferable and I would have been happier.</P>
      <P>I am on my feet to make the point that we cannot lose sight of the fact that the Senator Norris issue must still be investigated. I support the idea of an amended forum which will probably be discussed in the morning when Committee on Procedure and Privileges meet.  Certainly, from my point of view I would welcome that new initiative because obviously this matter has to be resolved and it has to be resolved correctly in the best interests of everybody in this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a ludicrous situation here today where we are discussing a motion to rescind a resolution <Col N="881" /> that was passed by the vast majority of Members in the House, all on the Government benches and in Fine Gael, all except the Independents and the Labour Party.  While we are discussing it Senator Norris should be in the House arising out of the result of the High Court decision.</P>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with what Senator Manning said in relation to the question of due process.  It is a fact that in this House the Constitution guarantees us the right to make our rules here as a House.  We must operate under due process.  None of us as citizens is above the law.  None of us can be a judge in our own case.  Natural justice does not allow us to abrogate.  Consequently, due processs must be observed.  I do not agree with what the Leader of the House said, that there is a constitutional crisis.  I believe the Constitution is in fact affirming the situation.  We have moved away from the course of natural justice and the Constitution and the High Court is bringing us back onto that course.  That is the nub of the situation.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that if there was advice from the Attorney General the House was not made aware of it prior to the vote being taken.  The Labour benches advised caution, that no precipitate decision should be taken, we should wait for a week to see what the outcome of the court decision was, that we were concerned that due process was not being adhered to and we were concerned that the process of natural justice was not being adhered to.  If our advice had been taken we would not be in this ludicrous situation whereby within a week of that decision being taken we are now seeking to rescind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that bothers me about this discussion is that even from the very start of the allegation we were talking about someone not doing substantial justice to another Member, not giving him honour, not being kindly and not following a golden rule.  Here we are debating the rescinding of a resolution that will facilitate a judicial inquiry.  We are about to get into a debate <Col N="882" /> here that might jeopardise that and say some unkindly things in the process.</P>
      <P>The way I see it is that all that has happened is that the book of life was thrown at us because, according to the courts, we did not follow the proper procedure.  As a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I accept that.  I also believe that there are two sides to everything.  I believe the two sides need an opportunity to state their case.  I was away until late last night.  I did not get <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning and naturally I do not know what is in it. What I am saying now will not jeopardise my attitude to the whole question of dealing with procedure and privileges.  The only way I work is within structures I deal with the events, truths and realities and make a decision on that basis.  That is what has been done.  Apparently it has been proven that it was not correct.  I do not know what all the whinging and bellyaching is about now.  We should just accept that it was not correct, let the rescinding go ahead and the judicial inquiry, and let Senator Norris come in and take his rightful place in the Seanad when the motion is passed.</P>
      <P>There may be some difficulties.  Somebody said that Senator Norris should be in the Chamber at the moment.  I do not think there would have been any fuss if Senator Norris had walked into the Chamber today.  He used his discretion and sat outside the door because he knows we are not on the Order of Business yet.  It is a question of lifting the suspension imposed on him.  Procedurally, it would be difficult to say he should be here until we have disposed of the motion.  It is only a procedural matter, it is not anything against Senator Norris or a belief that he should not take his place here.  If we pass the motion he can take his place here.  Let us take out the crown of thorns now, let it go ahead to the courts and let them make their decision.</P>

      <P>It should be pointed out that Senator Norris was not prevented from coming in here today.  In acknowledgment of that, it is worth <Col N="883" /> noting, too, that Senator Norris contributed in a very special way that has ensured that there would be no conflict or embarrassment either to the House or to himself in the manner of his returning to the House.</P>

At that time I will be giving to the committee my views in relation to any matters that may need clarification or explanation.  It is in that context that I intend to make comment.  I am not prepared to make comment to the press in any of its forms.  I believe it would be in breach of privilege.  Already that has been happening with Members of this House who have engaged in discussion with the media.  That in itself is in breach. I owe it to the House and to the committee not to be in breach as Cathaoirleach, regardless of what other Members may feel or think about that particular aspect of their obligations.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to intervene in the industrial relations dispute, which is threatening the survival of 120 full-time and 180 part-time jobs at the meat plant &mdash; details submitted &mdash; and the need for the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter.</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline immediately the future employment prospects for all our customs officers in the light of the free trade position in the EC from January 1993, and in regard to his recent announcement concerning the introduction of automatic entry processing and direct trades input on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The discontinuation of grants for smokeless heating conversions by virtue of the Government's refusal to make any further special control area orders with particular reference to the Crumlin, Drimnagh and Bluebell areas of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a temporary teacher to Killaloe national school to cover the period September 1990 to 1991.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Neville, Doyle, Upton, Jackman and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Doyle, Upton, Jackman and Ross may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

I note that the Minister for Justice is coming into us shortly.  The Leader of the House has told us on a number of occasions that the Government were about to introduce the Abolition of the Death Penalty Bill.  On that basis, the Leader disallowed an Independent motion late last term dealing precisely with the Abolition of the Death Penalty Bill, in the name of Senator Ross.

      <P>It is an important and appropriate time for us to acknowledge the independence of Namibia, a nation that got its independence last night, and to acknowledge the role that was played by the Irish in many areas over the decades. Seán MacBride was United Nations High Commissioner for many years in the seventies, the Garda Síochána supervised the elections last November and the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement was involved <Col N="886" /> as well.  Seeing that we have, through the Taoiseach, invited Nelson Mandela to visit this country and to address the Oireachtas, it would be appropriate also that we would invite the new President, Sam Nujoma, to do likewise.</P>
      <P>Secondly, might I say that we raised last week with the Leader of the House the question of getting an opportunity to discuss the developments that are taking place in relation to Irish Life, in particular, and the whole area of privatisation, which seems to be part of Government policy at the moment, even though it was not part of their policy when they came to power.  I would like the Leader of the House to give us an indication of when we might have such a debate.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question raised by Senator Upton, the business of the Dáil has nothing to do with us.  On the question raised by Senator Costello, of course we send our greetings to the people of Namibia and congratulate them on attaining their freedom and statehood. We acknowledge, of course, the very many contributions the Irish have made in that area.  The question of Irish Life was again raised by Senator Costello. Over the next number of months there will be, I am sure, plenty of opportunities of discussing the question of Irish Life and privatisation.  If Senator Costello wishes, he can of course bring in a motion in his own time and he can take that as his priority.  You can prioritise your own motions and, if you are that interested, I am sure you can take that one as being of paramount importance.</P>

    <P>Senator Jackman asked a question in conneciton with the extension of the franchise. I am sure she will acknowledge that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have been adjusting themselves to other matters over the past <Col N="887" /> number of days and that we will take this matter on board at an early opportunity. Senator Murphy asked about the Marine Institute Bill.  The Final Stages of that Bill will be taken next Wednesday and the Whips will be discussing the programme for the Abolition of the Death Penalty Bill tomorrow morning, at the Whips meeting.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution in section 21 of &lsquo;Director of Public Prosecutions&rsquo; for &lsquo;Attorney General or in case that office be vacant, of the Solicitor-General&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment dealing with pre-independence legislation, the 1916 Larceny Act.  What it seeks to do is to update the legislation in referring to the person who is responsible for the prosecutions &mdash; namely, the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; and to substitute that for the old British designation of &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; or &ldquo;Solicitor-General&rdquo;.

      <P>This amendment is not necessary.  I direct the Senator's attention to section 3 (1) and 3 (2) of the Prosecution of Offenders Act, <Col N="888" /> 1974, which lays down the function of the Director of Public Prosecutions in these matters.  The relevant subsections of that Act read as follows:</P>
      <P>3. (1)  Subject to the provision of this Act, the Director shall perform all the functions capable of being performed in relation to criminal matters and in relation to election petitions and referendum petitions by the Attorney General immediately before the commencement of this section, and reference to the Attorney General in any statute or statutory instrument in force immediately before such commencement shall be construed accordingly.</P>
      <P>(2)  The functions capable of being performed by the Attorney General immediately before the commencement of this section in or in relation to any criminal matters, or to election petitions or referendum petitions, to which the Attorney General is a party and which have not then been concluded shall, upon such commencement, be performed by the Director, and references to the Attorney General in those proceedings shall be construed as references to the Director, and any act or thing done in step taken by or on behalf of the Attorney General in or in relation to those proceedings shall be deemed to have been done or taken by or on behalf of the Director.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not necessary, since what it purports to achieve is already the law of the land.  On that basis I am sure the Senators will agree to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> In page 3, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  The term &lsquo;appeal&rsquo; in subsection (4) includes an appeal or application to the European Commission or Court of Human Rights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I am seeking to do is to update the old legislation and to refer to what the situation is at present in relation to our membership of the EC and our position in relation to the European Commission and the Court of Human Rights where there are further areas of appeal and that the Act would specifically incorporate that authority and that power of appeal in those specific areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to oppose this amendment.  It is neither necessary nor appropriate to provide in the Act for the order of the domestic court disposing of the offending article or articles to be stayed until such time as an appeal to the Commission on Human Rights or the Court of Human Rights itself is determined.</P>
      <P>We are giving the court a discretion whether or not to order the confiscation of the offending articles and I think that conforms to the principles of the First Protocol of the convention.  In any event, before the provisions of the European Convention can be invoked, the applicant is required under its provisions to invoke all domestic remedies and it would not be appropriate to have such a provision included in the Bill.  No similar provision was put forward in the context of the recently enacted Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, and the Video Recording Act, 1989, where the court has a similar power to the one proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Again, in any event, the amendment would not work because a person complaining to the Commission or court does not appeal against the conviction, so there is no relevant &ldquo;ordinary time&rdquo; limit to which section 28 (4) could apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I am still not satisfied.  I think it is very useful for a citizen to know and have it stated in the legislation the <Col N="890" /> full entitlements that are there.  While it may not have been put into either the Incitement to Hatred Act or the Video Recording Act that does not mean that it is still not a desirable amendment and that this legislation would benefit from having it specifically included.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.  Both this legislation and all future legislation should include references to the rights of appeal and not just within the domestic scene, because the domestic scene is now becoming very much part of the European scene and we are subject to European law as well as being subject to domestic law.  This would be very much the case from 1992 onwards.  I think it is appropriate that all relevant legislation, where a right of appeal is incorporated or is ensconsed, should have it included specifically so that both the person involved and the legal adviser are aware of it and it is easily available and accessible to them.</P>

Before the provisions of the convention can be invoked the applicant is required under the provisions of the convention to invoke all domestic remedies and it would not be appropriate to have such a provision included in this Bill or in other Bills.  I would suggest to the Senator that, while I accept what he is trying to achieve is to inform in terms of the widest possible appeal, really what we are dealing with here is domestic legislation.</P>

    <P>The intention here again is to bring the legislation up to date.  Many provisions like this are outdated and have been superseded by decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, both in the Dudgeon case and in the Norris case.  It would be appropriate here that, while we have not brought into operation legislation to implement the findings of those cases, particularly the Norris case, at the same time when the opportunity does arise we should take it to delete from the relevant legislation specific references which we should now regard as not being the law of the land.  I would advise the Minister to take this opportunity to delete that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is opposed.  The primary aim of the Bill is to replace the existing offence of receiving stolen property with a new offence of handling stolen property.  As such, it follows the approach which the Law Reform Commission took in deliberately selecting this particular aspect of the law of dishonesty for special attention and modernisation in advance of its wider consideration of the changes that might be made in the law of dishonesty generally.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not attempt to deal with other matters in the Larceny Act, 1916, except in that it changes some of the maximum penalties.  The reason for this is simple.  It is because the commission's report on the remaining aspects of the general law of dishonesty is awaited. When that report is received, matters such as the one under discussion and others which are the subject of amendments to the Bill, will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the present amendment <Col N="892" /> there is another reason for not amending the section in question in the manner proposed at this time.  That is because the effect of the Senator's amendment would be to decriminalise the blackmailing of homosexuals.  Section 29 (1) (iii) makes it an offence to extort by threats to accuse the blackmail victim of &ldquo;any crime for which this section applies&rdquo;.  The crimes are listed in subsection (3).  Amending the list of crimes in the way proposed in the amendment would have exactly the opposite effect to that intended by the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that the matter is being looked into and that hopefully legislation will be introduced.  I do not quite accept his reference to blackmailing that could take place if the subsection was deleted; I think that is more of a theoretical point of view and that it would be desirable to decriminalise it.  However I am satisfied with his statement that the matter is subject to investigation.  Do I take it that there is an attempt to introduce legislation which would be enabling legislation in relation to the Norris judgment?.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> In page 3, line 27, after &ldquo;property&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of a value of over five hundred pounds&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I had not intended to dwell on any of these amendments as I was not going to delay the House.  I see a connection between a number of them.  The intent of amendment No. 4 was to provide for a specific value of property, that it would be a value of over £500 &mdash; in other words, that it would be something of a reasonably substantial nature.  We are talking about a person... &ldquo;knowing or believing it to be stolen property shall be guilty of a felony and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.  In other words, it is a colossal penalty and there is no specific value of property.  I would much prefer to see legislation being more defined &mdash; we do not want it too rigid &mdash; but certainly it is very difficult to see a situation where you have property or a quantity of property to an unlimited value and you have a very specific defined period of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Legislation is being taken on board again and again that is imposing prison sentences without any consideration for their merit, in the first instance, for the length of time that is actually specified and that what we have been having are two alternatives &mdash; and they are not really alternatives &mdash; a sentence of imprisonment or the imposition of a fine.  By and large it is people who are subject to imposition of a fine who are unable to pay that fine and end up going to prison. We are filling our prisons and our prisons are becoming very overcrowded.  Last week we had that business about the appalling conditions under which many of our prisoners are being detained.  We are at the same time, increasing the penalties. I am delighted to see that we have done away with some of the more horrendous penalties that existed, penalties like the death penalty &mdash; I do not think we will see it again &mdash; and penalties such as whipping.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not purport to add to those specified in the old legislation. But what it should do is seek to add the <Col N="894" /> variety of possible alternatives that are being explored and are experimented with here to a degree and certainly in other parts of Europe and throughout the world.  For the benefit of the judge who sees before him the alternatives of either a prison sentence, a fine or both, it is our responsibility as legislators to present him or her with a further list of options so that he or she could say, if this were a question of handling stolen property where there is no specified amount or value, say: &ldquo;Well this is a more appropriate one to be sanctioned by a community service order&rdquo;.  He could say that it is a more appropriate one to be sanctioned by compensation and restitution or he could say that it would be probation.  Probation is not written into the legislation.  As legislators why can we not show the way to our judiciary?  If the Judiciary do not know the range of alternatives that is available and we do not specify in the legislation, how can we expect the Judiciary to go out of their way to see what provision is there for community service orders, for example? They are not going to look into it in any great degree because they have not been pointed in the right direction by the legislators.</P>
    <P>What I am seeking to do here in this legislation is, first of all, to point out the rather dangerous extent to which we are specifying increased prison penalties without specifying the exact crime &mdash; and I say this carefully &mdash; the extent of the crime.  We specify the nature of the crime &mdash; it is larceny or handling stolen goods &mdash; but we do not say to what value, how serious the crime is, but we do say how serious the prison penalty is going to be.</P>
    <P>Secondly, what I want to do is to try to direct our legislation into the business of giving advice and giving directions to our Judiciary.  I believe we have a responsibility in this area.  It is time we started initiating this procedure.  It is time we started showing the way to the Judiciary.  I would be very pleased if the Minister would at least accept the principle of what I am saying.  If he accepted the amendments I would be even more pleased.  But if the Minister is prepared <Col N="895" /> to accept the principle underlying these amendments and if he is prepared then to choose different wording that would give effect to the principle of alternatives and, in particular, that they be specified in the legislation, I would be very happy. It is a matter that has to be addressed, that should be addressed and that the Bill would certainly benefit in terms of, its implementation in relation to the Judiciary if these amendments were included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to my amendment No. 7, it is very important that in the whole area of conviction for theft or for receiving or handling of stolen property the court should have the ability to order compensation where appropriate to the victims of the crime.  Many people are left without their life savings while the people involved enjoy the proceeds of their crimes.  This is unfair and should be corrected.  We should use this opportunity to do so.  Many old people have had their small few valuables stolen and they are often highly distressed and frightened for the rest of their lives as a result of the theft.  These people should be compensated where appropriate by the people who perpetrate these crimes. In this way we can reduce the benefit of their evil deeds to the people who steal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only natural justice.  Compensation should be paid both for the loss of the property and for the distress caused to the victims.  It is a very traumatic occurrence to have one's residence broken into and one's personal effects upset.  This is distressing even without a violent act, but at a time when old people are assaulted, tied up and even clergymen killed, we must have a stronger approach to assisting the victims of crime.  Many criminals, godfathers, handlers and receivers are well off from the proceeds of their crimes. Many of these go to jail for a period of time and then return to society and live off their evil deeds for many years &mdash; in other words, the loot is waiting for them when they return from prison.  Such an approach would have a double effect.  It would compensate the victim &mdash; a person <Col N="896" /> should be compensated by the handler of the goods regardless of whether they are the original takers.  I also believe that compensation will be a deterrent, that when people leave prison they will know that they will not live off the profits of their ill gotten gain.</P>
    <P>On an unofficial basis, the courts are applying this in some cases.  I think it should be put on a statutory basis and even extended from the present way it is being approached, that when the courts are dealing with handling and receiving they should have the power to consider compensation for the victims.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 proposes that there should be the same penalty for receiving and handling stolen goods as there is for larceny, that the same penalty should apply to both offences.  The Minister is right to show how serious the offence of handling and receiving goods is in his approach to sentencing.  We should not under-estimate the seriousness of the original crime of taking the property but should equate both offences, depending on how the courts see the seriousness of the individual offence.  Similar sanctions should apply for both the original act of taking the goods and for handling and receiving.  In fact, the Law Reform Commission in their wisdom stated that similar penalties should apply to handling and to the act of larceny.  The seriousness of the offence of larceny should not be understated.  It is often accompanied by violence and threats of violence, which create great distress.  Our abhorrence of this crime should be reflected in adopting a sentence similar to that being applied to receiving and handling.</P>

      <P>I want to support Senator Neville in relation to compensation for victims.  It should become a principle and a practice and a provision in our legal system that where possible victims should be compensated.  Restoration in kind would be a very effective deterrent to the criminal.  From the point of view of the victim, it would be a correct process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville's proposed amendment would greatly enhance the Bill.  It <Col N="897" /> would be in all of our interest to establish the principle of compensation for victims as part of our legal system.  It would reduce crime and reassure the people who over the years have been at the mercy of villains whom we are all anxious to bring to justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the amendments are opposed.  Amendment No. 4, which is related to amendment No. 8, would, if accepted, make the task of the Garda in their operation of the new provision unbelieveably complicated and I have no hesitation in rejecting it for that reason alone.  Suppose, for example, gardaí come across a handler of stolen property.  Under the section as it is proposed to amend it, they would have to perform an exercise in valuation before they could decide which way to proceed. If they can be sure that the value of the property which they suspect is stolen property is less than £500 then they would proceed by way of summons.  If the value of the property is over £500 then they can proceed to arrest the offender on the spot.  The provision of the Bill is specifically designed to render all handling offences felonies so that common law powers of arrest without warrant shall apply to all cases of suspected handling. That is as it should be.  Furthermore, the courts would be able to exercise their discretion within the limits of sentence set in the Bill in arriving at a suitable sentence in each case having regard to all the relevant factors, including the market value of the property in question.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 21 seek to provide a maximum term of imprisonment on a handling charge of seven years.  Amendment No. 22 proposes to increase the maximum term of imprisonment for the other larceny-related offences to 14 years, the same as is proposed in the Bill for handling offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that the same sentence should be provided for larceny and handling offences.  The present maximum sentence for receiving is 14 years imprisonment after conviction on indictment, whereas the maximum sentence for simple larceny <Col N="898" /> is five years.  The commission suggested that a ten-year period might be appropriate for these offences.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to propose that there should be a standard maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment on conviction or indictment for larceny and larceny-related offences.  In doing so they are giving partial effect to the commission's recommendations.  However, the Government consider that the present maximum sentence of 14 years should continue to apply in the case of handling offences.  This differential reflects the more serious view which society takes of the dealer in stolen goods who, by acting as a fence, is responsible for generating many of the primary offences of larceny, burglary and robbery which are committed in order to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>When I originally introduced the Bill I referred to the nightly pillage which is taking place in our homes, factories and industrial estates and I have no doubt that these crimes are committed to order and that particular areas and goods are targeted.  That is why the differential should be maintained as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The object of Senator Neville's amendment No. 22 is to standardise at 14 years the maximum penalty for all larceny-related offences, including handling.  If this is to be the case, how are we to reflect the more serious nature of handling offences?  Are we to increase the term for those offences to 18 or 20 years?  I do not think that would be right.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach is correct, that is, to accept what the commission have recommended for all such offences except the handling offence. The purpose is to send a clear message to the generals of crime that society emphatically rejects their activities and is prepared to single out their nefarious activities as deserving of more severe punishment.</P>
    <P>As regards the reference to community service orders in Senator Costello's amendment, this is not necessary as the legislation providing for such orders as an alternative to imprisonment in suitable <Col N="899" /> cases stands on its own.  There is no need to import a reference to this alternative form of punishment into this Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8, 21 and 23 deal with the question of compensation. The main purpose is to enable a court to order the payment of compensation by the offender, mainly in cases where he is the thief or handler of stolen property, to the victim.  As such, they follow the recommendations made in the Law Reform Commission's report in paragraph 151, page 110.  I have a certain sympathy with the thinking behind these amendments and, as I indicated in the other House when similar amendments were being discussed, the principle underlying them is certainly not opposed. Having had the opportunity of considering the matter again, I must say that I am more convinced than ever that this is something that has to be teased out in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer to deal with the whole question of compensation in criminal cases in one comprehensive Bill.  In my view it is generally preferable to consider the matter as a general issue in the context of all crimes and that I intend to do.  One of the reasons I favour this approach is that the Law Reform Commission have recently produced a discussion paper on the subject of confiscation of the proceeds of crime. This is a matter which is very closely related to the subject matter of these amendments and it illustrates that the question of compensation is just one element of the problem.  The commission document discusses such matters as the relationship between confiscation, restitution and compensation.</P>
    <P>All things considered, pending further examination of the matter, we should be content to allow the present informal system of compensation which operates in the District and Circuit Courts on a purely discretionary basis to continue for the present.  I am referring to the practice where the justice or judge will defer a decision on sentence in suitable cases to give the offender an opportunity to make such recompense to the victim. <Col N="900" /> I have noted the views expressed on the subject in the House today and, indeed, in the other House last December, and I reiterate my intention to have legislative proposals prepared which would deal with this question in a comprehensive way rather than on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>Specifically with regard to Senator Costello's point, I want to make it clear that judges and justices in our courts are well aware of the full range of options available to them in dealing with offenders including community service orders and probation.  I am satisfied that the system of community service orders as a substitute for imprisonment is being used more and more by the courts and I am delighted at the continuing and growing success of the scheme.  I repeat that there is no need to specify this alternative each time imprisonment is mentioned in a statute since that is taken care of in the legislation which set up the community service schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply.  It is certainly not satisfactory simply to say that judges and justices are well aware of the range of alternatives.  What we have are two specific sanctions in legislation and all our legislation has only two types of sanctions &mdash; a fine or a term of imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are directing the Judiciary and in particular the justices in the District Courts, which is where most of this legislation will be dealt with, we must, if we are serious as legislators, direct them where to go.  The Minister says that they are aware of community service orders. I cannot accept that.  We have a very <i>ad hoc</i> system of community service orders, which is operated and administered in a totally inadequate fashion.  There is no good in our saying that it has been established. I believe &mdash; and I hope the Minister can correct me &mdash; that he is saying that it should not be put into the legislation simply because the structure is not adequate if judges on a regular basis were to use that alternative.  There simply would not be the means to do it, because the structures have not been established <Col N="901" /> and the back-up to that sanction has not been provided with the finance, the procedures and the personnel that are deserved.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility as legislators to provide the alternatives.  They are not specified in the legislation.  Why are some specified and others are not?  Can the Minister answer that?  Why is it good enough simply to say the judges can impose a fine or a prison sentence?  What is wrong with mentioning the other range of alternatives if they are real alternatives? If the Minister would answer that perhaps I would be satisfied to a degree.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the Minister's statement that he is looking into the whole area of compensation.  It was a retrograde step virtually to eliminate that system in recent years and not to cater for the victims of crime.  The judicial system caters for them only in so far as it requires them as witnesses, very often in difficult circumstances, but it does not cater for them in terms of financial or any other form of support.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville's amendment in relation to compensation is a very important one and should be accepted.  There is no reason why in this updating of the Larceny Act &mdash; unfortunately the Bill is merely tinkering with the substance of the Act &mdash; we should not seek to improve the Act.  This is one area in respect of which we can improve it.  Another area is the one I have been concentrating on, namely, the specification of a range of alternative sanctions.  I would like the Minister to address those matters to a greater degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister's commitment to look at the area of compensation.  I trust that this will be done as quickly as possible because it is an area that is of growing concern and discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 22, I would like to state that my approach was that the act of larceny should be treated on the same level as that for the the receiving or handling of stolen property.  In many instances the person who commits the larceny may <Col N="902" /> be the receiver also.  Could he not claim in such circumstances to be treated as the person who committed the original act? I did not mean that there should be an increase in sentence from 14 to 18 years for the receiver or handler of stolen property. Both should be put on the same level because the act of larceny often has undertones of violence even though the victims may not be present in the house or wherever the act was committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

      <P>I would ask that the amendments be withdrawn.  Amendment No. 4, in the name of Senator Costello, proposes to insert &ldquo;of a value of over five hundred pounds&rdquo;.  We must not lose sight of the basic principle that whether it is £1 or £10 to bring value into it is dangerous. Many of the people who are committing such crimes start off with stealing £1 or even a bar of chocolate and often move into the bigger bracket.  It is moving away from a basic concept of law to the concept that you might as well be killed for a sheep as for a lamb.  It would be a very dangerous amendment to bring in.  I would ask the Senator to reconsider.</P>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned the filling of prisons.  From my experience, having operated in courts for the last 12 years, the position appears to be that the prisons are not being filled with people who commit minor crimes.  In fairness, the district justices do in their discretion and wisdom &mdash; and I have come across at least six of them in my experience &mdash; now regularly use the alternative methods of community service and other such orders.  The district justices and Circuit Court judges have a wide range of discretions and the alternatives are being used. I would ask that the amendments proposed by my colleagues on the opposite bench be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Donovan very much for that support of the position which I have taken in relation to these amendments.  I very much appreciate it.  As far as Senator Costello's supplementary points are concerned, I had the same experience as Senator O'Donovan that the community service orders <Col N="903" /> are being worked and worked very effectively. It is not my intention to write them into every piece of legislation that I bring before the House, as I mentioned earlier, and consequently I would oppose the amendments.  As far as Senator Neville is concerned, I can assure him that I will bring forward that legislation as I promised.</P>
      <P>On the question of handling and larceny, I refer the House to paragraph 135, page 103 of the Law Reform Commission report on the receiving of stolen property. As we have seen, the courts have frequently asserted that a person cannot at the same time be guilty of both receiving and larceny.  That is covered specifically in the report.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to say, in relation to these amendments.  If there are any further points made on them, I can assure the Senators that my position will not alter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators may have misconstrued my intentions.  The provision that a person who handles stolen property knowing or believing that it is stolen shall be guilty of a felony and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or to a fine or to both is tied up &mdash; and that is the only reason I could accept all those amendments being lumped together &mdash; with the fact that no specific value of property is stated.  It is not good enough to say that somebody might start by stealing something small and then go on to something large.  We can all speculate as to how and why people get involved in crime, what the social factors are and what the greed factors are and where, who and what type of person will get involved in larceny.  What we have is a universal open-ended statement: &ldquo;A person who handles stolen property knowing or believing it to be stolen property&rdquo;. It could be any value of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will see further on in the Bill how difficult it is to specify that a person knows or believes it to be stolen property. We are talking about mind reading if you specify a massive sentence of 14 years <Col N="904" /> and do not specify the value of the property. The larceny of property of insignificant value could result in a charge on indictment and there is only the one penalty.  It is unlikely that the accused will be able to pay the fine.  The Minister refuse to specify alternatives to fines.  The corollary to the Minister's position is that if he is not prepared to specify the value of the goods stolen or handled he should be prepared to specify a greater range of alternatives.  He should do one or the other.  That point I am making has been misconstrued.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister when he says that community service orders are operating well.  They are not.  There is no proper system of community service orders operating in this State.  That is a fact.  The Department of Justice should get their act together and provide a decent structure of community service orders.  It would be preferable if, rather than paying lip service to this alternative system of sanctioning, the Department of Justice got down to the work of providing the alternative.  It would be a useful alternative.  It is extremely useful in the case of some minor crimes.  People normally go to prison for serious offences.  Many people go to prison for less serious offences.  The majority who go to prison go there from the District Courts where the maximum prison sentence is two years.  In that case there is an automatic one-quarter or one-third remission, one-quarter in the case of males and one-third in the case of females.  I do not know how regulations were evolved that discriminate in reverse to the norm.  It would be preferable rather than imposing a financial burden of £100 per day in a prison setting to have a community service order where the person would be doing something useful.</P>
    <P>Seventy per cent or 80 per cent of people in prison have been sentenced in the District Courts and, therefore, on a maximum sentence of two years.  I am not prepared to accept that point either, but I acknowledge that there is very heavy sentencing on indictment.  While in many ways our country is not as bad as other countries in the world in terms <Col N="905" /> of the number of people who go to prison, we have a greatly increasing number of people going to prison for longer periods of time.  That area should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I am seeking here to expand the ranges of alternatives to ensure that we adopt enlightened developments that have <Col N="906" /> taken place and have been experimented with in other countries.  There is no reason why we should not experiment with them.  We have experimented far too long with prisons and with fines.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 5, 9 and 11 are similar and No. 10 is an alternative to No. 11.  They may all be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 28, after &ldquo;property&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or being reckless as to whether such property has been stolen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that this legislation is effective, bearing in mind that it is 75 years since the last relevant legislation was passed and in 1988 £34 million worth of property was stolen and only £3 million was recovered.  An important part of this amendment is to include the concept of recklessness as to whether the property received has been stolen.  This deals with the area of <i>mens rea</i>, the intent of the person who is charged with receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill states that a person who handles stolen property knowing or believing it to be stolen shall be found guilty of the felony.  The element of recklessness as to whether the person knew that the property was stolen, I believe, is an essential part in the definition of handling stolen goods.  This concept will effectively deal with the present situation where it is almost impossible to convict a person of receiving.  If goods are brought off the back of a truck at less than half their value the person purchasing these can well claim that he has checked with the person selling and was informed that the goods were not stolen.  He could claim he <Col N="907" /> did, therefore, not know or believe that the property was stolen but if the concept of recklessness is included in this Bill the receiver, because of the circumstances surrounding the purchase, would be found guilty of recklessness as to whether the property was stolen.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach that the person charged with knowing or believing the goods to be stolen is not much different from that of the 1916 Act which has failed.  In fact, the Law Reform Commission recommended the inclusion of the concept of recklessness and I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment carefully.  In their deliberations they said that the concept of recklessness would ensure that the circumstances around the purchase of the goods would be taken into account.  A person will be reckless if he disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk considering the nature of his conduct and circumstances.  In other words, if he disregards the substantial risk that the property he handles is likely to be stolen bearing in mind the handler's conduct and circumstances known to him.  His disregard of this involves a high degree of culpability. Such an approach will put people on their guard and they will be very careful about such purchases.  This approach would lead to a dramatic reduction in the trade of stolen goods, reduce the figure substantially from the £34 million level at present and dramatically increase the conviction level and recovery level of stolen goods.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on Second Stage, the approach taken by the Minister follows that of the 1968 English Theft Act.  Difficulties have arisen with the interpretation of this.  The same difficulties are likely to arise in our case.  We will have bad and unsatisfactory legislation. The Law Reform Commission, after a lot of deliberations, favoured whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to the source of the property offered for sale.  I would like to ask the Minister to carefully consider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Among these amendments there is one of mine, amendment No. 10.  I also agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Neville that this legislation centres on whether one is able to prove that somebody was aware and believed or thought that an object was stolen property.  Therefore, this legislation is not tight enough to get a conviction. If you look at the particular area of the section I am referring to, which is very loosely construed, it refers to stolen property and somebody who &ldquo;undertakes or assists in its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person or arranges to do any of the things specified in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph ... &ldquo;This is crucial.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that he knew or believed the property to be stolen property, he shall be taken to have so known or believed unless the court or the jury, as the case may be, is satisfied ...</P>
      <P>The final section (c) reads:</P>
      <P>believing property to be stolen property includes thinking that such property was probably stolen property.</P>
      <P>Did you ever hear such airy-fairy legislation? Believing property to be stolen property includes thinking that such property was probably stolen property. A prosecuting garda would have to be something of a mind reader if he were to put a case before the courts on that particular evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is badly worded.  We know the intent of the legislation, to catch those people who are fences, who are handling property and who are responsible in many ways for thefts taking place.  But there is no sense in making provision to deal with something unless it can stand up in law.  The wording of this legislation will not work.  That is why we are looking for the deletion of these words.  It simply is not going to function.  It will be impossible to prove.  It will lead to a situation where it is the garda's word against the citizen's.  We do not want to go very far <Col N="909" /> down that road.  The judge will have no choice on the basis of the evidence that is before him or her but to say the garda believes that he found somebody in such circumstances and that the person probably believed that the property was stolen or that he probably thought that the property was stolen, but that is not grounds for a sound conviction.</P>
    <P>Certainly Senator Neville's amendments have a certain merit in them.  I think that the section is too flawed to be valuable and it is a pretence of introducing legislation that will deal with a serious problem but in effect it is merely a veneer with no substance to it.  I do not believe this Bill and this critical section of the Bill will assist one iota in bringing to justice even one offender who was in receipt of property.  The wording is just not tight enough for it.  There is not much sense in putting legislation on the Statute Book unless that legislation is capable of implementation.  I do not believe this legislation is capable of implementation as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are also opposed.  Amendments Nos. 5, 9 and 11 are an attempt to import the <i>mens rea</i> for the new offence of handling the notion of recklessness.  Not, let it be noted, in substitution for the <i>mens rea</i> provided in the Bill, but as an addition to those provisions.  Thus, if Senator Neville's amendment were to succeed, the jury in a handling case would be faced with a bewildering set of decisions to take in determining whether the accused had the necessary guilty intention which would constitute an offence.  They would have to ask themselves, firstly: &ldquo;Did the accused know that the property in question was stolen property?&rdquo; If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then they can convict without further ado but of course, it rarely will be &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because of the difficulty of satisfying oneself beyond a reasonable doubt that a person had absolute knowledge, the very problem which the Bill is designed to tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the answer to the first question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the jury must then ask: &ldquo;Are we satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that <Col N="910" /> the accused believed that the property in question was stolen?&rdquo; In considering this question, they will be aided by the fact that &ldquo;believing&rdquo; in this context includes &ldquo;thinking that the property was probably stolen property&rdquo;.  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then once again the jury can convict without further consideration.</P>
    <P>If the answer to the second question is &ldquo;no&rdquo; however, what then?  Senator Neville would have it that the jury would then consider a further question: &ldquo;Are we satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was reckless as to whether the property has been stolen?&rdquo; There are a number of views as to what exactly &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; is.  On one view, most commercial transactions at wholesale or retail level are made &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo;, in that when they take place, the notion that the goods might have been stolen never enters the buyer's head; there is a tacit assumption that goods offered for sale in the normal course have an unimpeachable provenance.  Clearly this view of recklessness is far too wide and recklessness in the context of Senator Neville's amendments must have a further particular meaning, akin, no doubt, to the definition suggested by the Law Reform Commission in their report.</P>
    <P>The effect of Senator Neville's amendments is, in fact, to add not one but a whole complex of extra questions which the jury must consider, over and above those which the Bill, as it stands, would require of them.  They must satisfy themselves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the property in question was stolen property; and in deciding whether the risk taken was substantial and unjustifiable they must be satisfied that the risk was of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the conduct of the accused and the circumstances known to him, disregard of the risk involved culpability of a high degree.</P>
    <P>Assuming that juries will always be able to think their way carefully through this extra layer or complexity, what is the likely marginal improvement in the effectiveness of the provision?  By this I <Col N="911" /> mean how many more convictions for handling stolen property would be likely to be secured as compensation for the extra confusion induced in juries' minds by the addition of Senator Neville's amendment?  It is, of course, a matter of opinion, but my considered opinion is that no useful increase in convictions would be secured.  The Government and I are satisfied that the provision as it stands in the Bill is a suitable one which would prove effective in the prosecution of handling offences.</P>
    <P>I have spoken so far of the thought processes which juries would have to go through; what I have said is equally applicable where guilt is determined judically, as for instance, in the District Court, and applies also to the lawyers whose task it is to present the case for prosecution and defence and to elucidate the law for the benefit of judge and jury. In summary, I oppose these amendments as they would place an extra burden on judges, juries, prosecution and defence, which would not result in any measurable increased effectiveness in convicting the guilty.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 would have the effect of deleting a crucial subsection in the section dealing with the proposed new handling offence.  That subsection sets out in clear terms that where a person does anything with stolen property which, if done dishonestly, would constitute handling, in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that he knew or believed that the property in question was stolen, then he shall be taken to have so known or believed.  The exception to this is where the court or the jury is satisfied, on the basis of all the evidence, that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused did know or believe that the property was stolen.  The purpose of this provision is to provide that knowledge or belief, which is a necessary ingredient of the offence of handling, can in appropriate cases be inferred from the accused's actions in receiving stolen goods or in doing any of the other things that would constitute a handling offence. <Col N="912" /> Let me put it another way.  This subsection is designed to meet the situation where the accused is proved to have acquired the stolen property but denies that he knew or believed that it was stolen, and perhaps says he thought it ws smuggled.  It is proposed to place an evidential rather than a persuasive burdern on the accused in such an instance to show that he did not know or believe that the property was stolen.</P>
    <P>In placing the evidential burden on the accused in such cases the section is following the precedent of section 8 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, which inserted a new section 27 (a) in the Firearms Act, 1964, which provides that a person who &ldquo;has a firearm or ammunition in his possession or under his control in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that he has not got it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose shall, unless he has it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  If the prosecution in a handling case proves the possession or control of the stolen property in suspicious circumstances and the accused puts forward an innocent explanation, it will be for him to adduce evidence sufficient to raise an issue fit for consideration as to the innocence of his receipt of the property in question.  If he fails to do so he will be taken to have known or believed that the property was stolen.  &ldquo;Believing&rdquo; will have the extended meaning here of thinking that property was probably stolen.</P>
    <P>As such, the subsection gives effect to the recommendation made by the Law Reform Commission in their report on receiving at paragraph 130, page 100, about restating the law in this matter as laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Oglesby and Melody cases.</P>

      <P>I am rather worried about what the Minister said in relation to section 3, in reference to 33 (2) (b) that what you really have here is a provision that the defendant is now guilty until he proves his innocence.  To back that up he quoted a section from the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976 which I could only describe as a piece of emergency legislation that was introduced to deal with the situation that predated extradition whereby people who might be charged with firearms offences, as the Minister mentioned, and other offences could be brought before the courts.  I do not think that that is what we are dealing with in the context of updating a Larceny Bill.  We do have the common law of the land which gives the benefit of the doubt to a person until he or she is proven guilty.  In other words, they are innocent until proven guilty.  Do we want to go down the road of presuming their guilt until they prove their innocence?  That is all right if you are talking in terms of emergency situations, in terms of emergency legislation.  I do not think it is proper for us to talk about it in terms of the standard law of the land with the body of common law, statutory legislation and constitutional law that has been brought together on the basis of innocence until proven guilty.  If that is the way we are about to implement this legislation then it is an even worse and less desirable piece of legislation that I had hitherto thought.  The manner in which the Minister described how this legislation will operate has caused me grave concern.  I would like the Minister to elucidate further his remarks in relation to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with a lot of Senator Costello's remarks, especially in the area of guilty until proven innocent. As I said earlier, we have recovered £3 million of a £34 million industry in stolen property and the movement of <Col N="914" /> stolen property.  We must bear in mind that most of the property stolen is moved from the original taker.  We must ensure that the legislation after 75 years is capable of dealing with the circumstances now prevailing.  I believe the concept of recklessness will correct this.  It will put people on their guard as to the circumstances in which they are purchasing the property, it will make them inquire in great detail as to the source of the property and even check on the credentials of the people who are selling the property.  If we do not include this concept of recklessness the Bill will barely improve, if it will improve at all, the situation under the 1916 Act which prevails at present.  Would the Minister consider having a look at this with a view to introducing it at a later stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask my colleagues, Senator Neville and Senator Costello, to withdraw these amendments. The Minister has quite clearly in his reply outlined and justified this legislation. My learned friend, Senator Costello, made a point in relation to being guilty until you prove your innocence. We have several examples in the Road Traffic Act, for example, where this has worked quite well.  I see no reason why it cannot work in this situation where strict liability is inserted into the legislation.</P>
      <P>In relation to some of the comments made by Senator Neville one of the criticisms levelled at the courts system and the legislation is that it is too complex. The introduction of the word &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; as to whether goods were stolen or not would create further complications and make the legislation more complex and more difficult to be dealt with by a judge or jury as the case may be.  The legislation proposed is adequate, proper and good and I would ask Senators Neville and Costello to withdraw the amendments and allow the legislation proposed to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Costello, what I am doing is acting on the basis of the Law <Col N="915" /> Reform Commission's report where it says:</P>
      <P>We also consider that, without in any sense altering the present state of the law in relation to the burden of proof, it would be useful to re-state the law as laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Oglesby and Melody in statutory form so as to make it clear that where the accused is charged with handling unlawfully obtained property the jury should be told that they may, in the absence of any reasonable explanation, find the accused guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the question of the Firearms Act, is concerned, section 27 (a) of that <Col N="916" /> Act, as introduced in the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976, is part of the ordinary internal law of the State and it does not apply merely to offences in Northern Ireland.  On the general question of recklessness, recklessness is not a concept that is operated in any jurisdiction where similar type legislation is operating. While it would be simple for me to say to Senator Neville, &ldquo;Yes, I will think about it between this and Report Stage&rdquo;, it would be misleading the House and the Senator and I do not want to say that.  It is not a concept that I can accept.  We debated this at great length in the Dáil, I regret that I have to say that to the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 sought to delete that section.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's statement in relation to the intention of this section. I am worried that it is introducing the concept of guilt first and then innocence to be proven later.  If that is the intention the reference to the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, while it is not Northern Irish legislation, is dealing with a specific problem in relation to Northern Ireland.  I would consider that to be emergency <Col N="917" /> legislation.  I will not press it any further. I want to record very strong my objection to any attempt to shift the enforcement of criminal law from the basic common law and statutory constitutional principles that we have, that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  I am still worried, after what the Minister has said. I hope that is not what is intended and that is not what will happen by this new section.</P>

      <P>The section will then read: &ldquo;Provided that they consent any number of persons may be charged in one indictment, with reference to the same theft, with having at different times or at the same time handled the stolen property or any part of it, and the persons so charged may be tried together.&rdquo;  We want to add to that in amendment No. 13 &ldquo;provided that only one charge may be brought against a person in respect of a single act or omission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am seeking to ensure that it should not be compulsory that a person be charged on incictment with reference to the same theft.  Any number of people could be involved to varying degrees or aspects of the case.  As it is, somebody could be involved to a lesser degree, or allegedly involved, and somebody involved to a greater degree.  I would like to have included the concept that the option rests with the defendant and that it should not be compulsory, as it is stated.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are opposed.  The difference between the subsection and the existing law in the proposed new section is fairly minute and <Col N="918" /> technical.  There is no reason for introducing a new requirement that the accused person should have consented to the joinder of charges as proposed by the amendment.  The proposal would be a remarkable innovation in criminal procedure.  For the Director of Public Prosecutions to have to ask people in advance of charges whether they consent to being charged together would be extraordinary.  In any event, it is always open to any accused persons proposed to be tried together to apply to the trial judge for separate trials and the judge will decide whether the interests of justice require this.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 13, there would be no purpose in introducing a restriction such as that proposed.  There is nothing special about the new offence of handling stolen property that would require the making of any such provision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Both these sections seek to update the <Col N="919" /> legislation, that the Minister should substitute, for example, &ldquo;Judge of the High Court&rdquo; for &ldquo;justice of the peace&rdquo; and, in amendment No. 17, &ldquo;the chief officer of police&rdquo; and references to &ldquo;His Majesty's Dominions&rdquo; be substituted for &ldquo;the State&rdquo;.  The 1916 Larceny Act dealt with a pre-independence State, before the State was established, not to talk about the Republic.  We should at this time use every opportunity to update as much as we can the appropriateness of the legislation. That is the intent here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 42 of the 1916 Act contains important and useful provisions dealing with the issue of search warrants. The references in the section to justice of the peace are now read as references to District Justice as a result of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1822, and to peace commissioners.  Amendment No. 16 would confine this to High Court judges alone.  As the Senator will be well aware, this would be inoperable because most of the High Court judges are in the Dublin area.  It would be totally inoperable and would tie the hands of the Garda outside of the Dublin area.  A similar situation is proposed in amendment No. 17.</P>

      <P>May I just give some clarification on the point?  If it would help the Senator, amendment No. 17 is unnecessary. The changes that it purports to make are already the law of the land.

      <P>In page 5, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;whether the stealing occurred before or after&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;provided that the stealing occurred after&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment because section 7 (1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Principal Act [that is the Larceny Act] and of this Act relating to handling property which has been stolen shall apply whether the property was stolen in the State or <Col N="921" /> elsewhere, and whether the stealing occurred before or after the commencement of this Act,...</P>
    <P>That is what amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are dealing with.  It is not good legislation to apply something retrospectively, which is what is being proposed here.  It should refer to matters that have occurred subsequent to the passage of the legislation. We are already seeing problems in the Supreme Court in relation to the extradition legislation that was passed in 1987, in relation to warrants that were introduced retrospectively.  Now we will have a situation where this legislation will seek to apply the provision, retrospectively, to something that occurred prior to the legislation being passed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The first of the two amendments seems quite unjustifiable.  For example, if we assume that the Act commences on 1 July, the result of section 7, as drafted, will be that if property is stolen in June and disonestly handled in July, the handler will be guilty of the offence of handling stolen property under the new section 33 of the Larceny Act, 1916, as substituted by section 3 of this Bill.  If the amendment were made, the handler would not be guilty of any offence.  I know that is not what the Senator has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment would not change the sense of the Bill as drafted. The effect of subsection (1) of section 7, read with subsection (4), is that the original offence must be one that falls within the definition of stealing, embezzlement, etc., under the Larceny Act, 1916.  These definitions are not being changed by the Bill but it is necessary to provide for a situation where the original act took place outside the State because the laws of other countries may differ as <Col N="922" /> to what constitutes theft or embezzlement. For example, would it not be right to penalise a person who received, say in the State property got in a foreign country in circumstances that did not amount to any offence under the law of that country at the time when the property was got.  It is to avoid this situation that the words &ldquo;provided that the stealing amounted to an offence where and at time when the property was stolen&rdquo; have been included in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I would accept what the Minister has said.  He referred to an offence committed in June and then the other offence of handling occurred in July.  We are really dealing in semantics here.  I am talking about the substance of the law.  We are talking about a Bill that was introduced in 1989 and will be law in 1990.  It would be much better if we started from scratch in 1990 rather than talk about aspects of time where there might be a month or two, or a short period of time, between the events that have taken place.  I am talking about the substance of the law and that it is not good, legislatively, to talk in terms of retrospective legislation even though the offence we are talking about is a separate offence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 17 and 18, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&ndash;)  The Principal Act is hereby amended as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) In section 2, the words &lsquo;with penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years&rsquo;; and the words &lsquo;and the offender, if a male under the age of sixteen years, shall be liable to be once privately whipped in addition to any other punishment to which he may by law be liable&rsquo; are hereby repealed;</P>
      <P>(b) in section 29, the words &lsquo;and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for life, and, if a male under the age of sixteen years, to be once privately whipped in addition to any other punishment to which he may by law be liable&rsquo; in subsection (1) are hereby repealed;</P>
      <P>(c) in section 29, the word &lsquo;imprisonment&rsquo; is hereby substituted for the words &lsquo;death, or penal servitude&rsquo; in subsection (3);</P>
      <P>(d) in section 31, the words &lsquo;without hard labour&rsquo; are hereby substituted for the words &lsquo;with or without hard labour&rsquo;;</P>
      <P>(e) in section 34, the words &lsquo;and on conviction thereof be liable to penal servitude for any term not exceeding seven years, and, if a male under the age of sixteen years, to be once privately whipped in addition to any other punishment to which he may by law be liable&rsquo; are hereby repealed;</P>
      <P>(f) in section 47, the word &lsquo;imprisonment&rsquo; is hereby substituted for the words &lsquo;penal servitude&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with so many sections of this legislation, I am seeking here to update the <Col N="924" /> new Bill and to try to bring it into line with modern thinking and modern developments.  The first section of it:</P>
    <P>In section 2, the words &lsquo;with penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years&rsquo;; and the words &lsquo;and the offender, if a male under the age of sixteen years, shall be liable to be once privately whipped in addition to any other punishment to which he may by law be liable&rsquo; are hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to paragraph (b) &ldquo;privately whipped&rdquo;, and paragraph (c), the word &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo;, to substitute for &ldquo;death or penal servitude&rdquo; and in paragraph (d) &ldquo;without hard labour&rdquo; to substitute for &ldquo;with or without hard labour&rdquo;.  In paragraph (e) and likewise in paragraph (f) &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; for &ldquo;penal servitude.</P>
    <P>I was trying to do two things which are two sides of the same coin, namely, to eliminate the outdated sanctions that were in the original Act and seek to introduce alternatives, new sanctions that have been experimented with and that are coming into reasonably common place usage in this and other countries. I have been very disappointed that the Minister has not been prepared to take on board the range of new sanctions I wish to specify.  I should certainly hope that he is prepared to take on board the elimination of the old style sanctions and specific elimination of them as well from the legislation.  It is a pity we could not do the two together &mdash; eliminate one set of outdated sanctions and introduce, for the judges attention, a new set of alternative options in relation to sanctions other than the two hardy annuals of all legislation: prison sentences or fines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 as it stands already achieves the same effect as this amendment in relation to those sections of the 1916 Act covered by the amendment except as regards sections 34 and 47.  The effect of section 9 is to substitute the penalty provided at column (2) of the table thereto for the penalty provided in <Col N="925" /> all the sections listed at column (1) of the table.</P>
      <P>As regards the reference in sections 34 and 47 to &ldquo;penal servitude&rdquo;, there is no longer any practical distinction between penal servitude and imprisonment.  In any event, such matters can be left to be dealt with when the 1916 Act is being looked at comprehensively after the Law Reform Commission have made their general recommendations on the matter.  I have already confirmed that I am prepared to do that after the Law Reform Commission have looked at it.</P>

I do not think anybody would defend any section of the Vagrancy Act at this point in time and we should have the final repeal of it.  It can be done.

In this report the commission considered the offences in section 4 of 1824 and related Acts and made detailed recommendations in relation to them.  I agree with the Senator that section 4 of that Act should be repealed in its entirety, but I hope that he will appreciate that this will have to wait until other more urgent legislative priorities have been disposed of.  However it is my intention to do so. I have made that commitment to the Dáil and I will make it here again today.

This would occur in the area of search warrants for stolen goods.  The common law offence of larceny should be abolished.  There is no need for it. Under paragraph (c) of the amendment: &ldquo;Larceny shall be deemed to be a statutory offence in accordance with the provision of the Principal Act and this Act.&rdquo; You have it a statutory offence, so why have it an offence under common law which we have imported from Britain?

This arose in a case that took place at a time of similar legislation in Britain, in 1968, and it is to cover for that this particular section is there.  I am opposing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I just want briefly to state that it is a shame that we are not using the opportunity to get rid of some of the undesirable aspects of the old Larceny Act.  The Vagrancy Act is also referred to in section 30.  All of the types of implements that are in possession of the accused or allegedly in the possession &mdash; pick lock key, crow, jack, bit or other implements with intent to feloniously <Col N="929" /> break into a dwelling house, warehouse, coach house, stable or other building &mdash; all of that could be got rid of.  There is no good reason why we just cannot simply get rid of it.  I know the Minister has said that we will have to wait until the Law Reform Commission have had a full look at it but this could be forever.  It is a shame to lose the opportunity to improve a piece of legislation when all you have to do is delete a few unnecessary and irrelevant sections.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 14, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;Within one year from the passing of this Act, the Stationery Office shall publish and make available for sale to the public, a copy of this Act and of the Principal Act (as amended by this Act) together with a translation of such Acts in the national language.</P>
      <P>Again, this is a very modest proposal.  It is very reasonable and it is very necessary. I do not know if many Members of the House are aware that you cannot get a copy of the Larceny Act from our own Stationery Office; you have to apply to Northern Ireland or to Britain because these were pre-1922 pieces of legislation. The least we can do is ensure that all our citizens have access to legislation under which they are going to be accused, or they may be accused, or at least legislation that governs them.  It really is a scandalous affair that our own Stationery Office have not provided us with pre-1922 legislation.  What we are asking is that both this Act and the principal Act to which it refers be provided and, secondly, that they be provided in the national language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this Bill is concerned, the new section proposed is unnecessary because it is part of the normal procedure of promulgation of <Col N="930" /> Acts of the Oireachtas that they are made available together with an Irish translation in the normal course as translation resources permit.</P>
      <P>As far as the Larceny Act, 1916, is concerned, it was a product of the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster, which continued in force here under the 1922 and 1937 Constitutions. Like all other Acts, it has not been translated into Irish, and an Irish version of such an Act would have no standing in our authority whatsoever.  I see no purpose or benefit in engaging in such an exercise, particularly in circumstances where the Larceny Act is likely to be the subject of a Law Reform Commission report recommending its complete replacement.  However, a publication has been brought to my attention here by the Roundhall Press in Dublin, J. Paul McCutcheon, <i>The Larceny Act, 1916,</i> which is apparently a very worthwhile publication which no doubt would be of interest to Senator Costello and others.  I am not in any way promoting it; it just happens to be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if we were to start providing translations of all pre-1922 Acts it would be at enormous expense and very hard to justify?  Instead, it is far better to have the new Acts coming out and then provide them in both official languages.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I neither agree with Senator Conroy's point nor with the Minister's point.  It is not exactly good enough that we have a private publication that is presented to us as the answer to the lack of Stationery Office publication of legislation that governs us.  That is the simple matter.  To whom are we answerable? Whom do we legislate for?  We legislate for the citizens of this country and every citizen who is governed by any piece of our legislation should have access to that legislation and that access should be provided by State publications.  The State makes the laws, the State should provide <Col N="931" /> access.  We do not know when the Law Reform Commission's report is going to come out.  Furthermore, we do not know when their findings or proposals are actualy going to be implemented.  If there was a necessity to provide each and every piece of legislation that has been promulgated prior to 1922 in both official languages, perhaps that would put the skids under both the Law Reform Commission and under various Ministers for Justice and we might have legislation coming through a bit faster.  Certainly, I think it is unacceptable that you cannot get in this State legislation that is published by the British Stationery Office or the Northern Ireland Stationery Office but is not published by our own Stationery Office.  We are the people who are governed by it.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 14, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;As soon as may be after the end of each year beginning with the year in which this Act comes into force the Minister for Justice shall make a report which shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the opertion of the Principal Act and this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I have sought to have this amendment inserted is because of what I regard as the inadequacies of this legislation. I do not think it is operable.  I certainly think it is going to be a grave infringement of the citizens' rights if it does direct towards having people guilty until they prove themselves to be innocent. It is very vague in terms of providing evidence and the manner is which it is specified departs very considerably from the normal set of procedures and rules of evidence for criminal prosecution.  I feel it is appropriate that a report should be made by the Minister for Justice on the operation of both the original Larceny Act and of this, shall we say, child of the <Col N="932" /> old 1916 Larceny Act?  It would certainly be very useful and very appropriate if that were done.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator Costello on this amendment.  I feel that the Bill should be reviewed because of the defects in it, not least the one which I raised earlier in regard to the effectiveness of getting a conviction as to whether a person knew or believed that he was handling stolen property.  The Act is going to be ineffective in producing convictions in this area and the area of recklessness should be introduced.  After 12 months, if we review it, we will see that my prediction, unfortunately, will be correct.  I thank the Minister for his commitment to introducing compensation to victims as a principle and I look forward to early news on that issue from the Department and the Minister concerned.</P>

      <P>This order complies with the EC Fifth Council Directive on summer time.  This is an instrument which seeks to harmonise the summer time period through EC member states.  It is the fifth order of this type. The previous orders were approved by the House on 11 March 1981, 9 March 1983, 12 March 1986 and 2 November 1988.</P>
      <P>This order fixes the summer-winter time arrangements in the State for years 1990, 1991 and 1992.  Summer time will begin on 25 March 1990, 31 March 1991 and 29 March 1992 and it will end on 28 October 1990, 27 October 1991 and 25 October 1992.  The principal effect of the order is that the summer time period will begin one week later in 1990 and 1992 and two weeks later in 1991 than is prescribed in the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 &mdash; No. 17 of 1971.  This means that we will have a similar period of summer time in those years as we have had for the past nine years.  A minor consequence of the order will be that the time of change from winter time to summer time and <i>vice versa</i> will be 1 o'clock in the morning Greenwich Mean Time rather than 2 o'clock as provided for in the 1971 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of those occasions on which I can say I am genuinely glad to have had a few days, nearly a week, for reflection because the House will recall that at the conclusion of this debate the last day I said that persons like myself who took a gradualist approach had been undermined.  On reflection, I do not believe that this is true and I would like to say that I will be pushing for the taking of my own motion at a later date:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Government to hold a referendum with the intention of amending Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution by the addition of the following phrase: &ldquo;that in the promotion of this aspiration towards national unity the use of violence is prohibited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On consideration, it seems to me that recent developments make this absolutely vital and I refer again to important cases, the McGimpsey case and the case involving Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and the extradition cases.  It seems to me that if we put these together we have a very interesting and dangerous scenario.  On the one hand, it has been held by a senior court in this land that the claims in Articles 2 and 3, far from being aspirational, constitute in fact a territorial imperative and that is a phrase which should give all of us pause.  We have coupled with this the statement of Mr. Justice Brian Walsh that, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> In the domestic law we do not recognise the existence of political exemption to offences committed within the State and trials within the State in respect of offences which are politically motivated.  However, the legislative provisions for political exemption do apply in respect of those parts of the national territory which are not within this State.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that by putting these two ideas together we have what amounts, in fact, to an explosive formula almost tantamount to an incitment to violence and certainly constituting a ground for violence on behalf of the Provisional IRA.  I believe that if we do not move towards the amendment at least of the Constitution, if not the dropping of Articles 2 and 3, we here as politicians in the South could well stand accused of being accessories to murder.  I have to say that I will be voting in favour of this motion to drop Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution but I am a realist and I understand the political realities.  I do not believe that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, has the room for manoeuvre to do this.  He does, however, have the room to manoeuvre, I believe, and has the political ingenuity to be able to sell to his own troops the notion that Articles 2 and 3 should be so amended.  I appeal to him to do so.  I remind the House of the words of the Taoiseach in his presidential address to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in 1989 when he said: &ldquo;Political progress may not of itself bring violence to an end, but it would at the very least undermine its base and make it even more meaningless and irrelevant&rdquo;.  That has not happened as a result of the judgments in the Supreme Court.  It requires urgent political initiative.  He says further in the same speech.  &ldquo;We value our place in the Community of law-abiding peace-loving nations too highly to neglect in any way to play our part in defeating international terrorism and crime and to take all reasonable steps to prevent violence and bloodshed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach showed imagination and innovation in nominating to Seanad Éireann the distinguished Northern surgeon John Robb and in the <i>Irish Press</i> of <Col N="936" /> 20 March last, former Senator Robb had a letter which reads in part as follows: &ldquo;If, as a result of the recent judgment in the McGimpsey case, the Supreme Court now infers that Articles 2 and 3 confers a legal right to Northern Ireland, the most serious implications must follow and these must be challenged.  As Dr. Paisley might say, where is the mandate for this assertion?  If it is assumed to derive from the Irish people as a whole, it should be recalled that those living in Northern Ireland were not canvassed for their opinion when the Constitution was being enacted in 1937.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the mandate relates specifically to the 26-county Irish Republic, then we must also recall that in 1937 less than 40% of the population of the Irish Republic voted in favour of the Constitution.  &ldquo;So it is the wish of a minority as expressed at that time.  He urges precisely the kind of amendment that I have been urging myself.</P>
    <P>May I say that the position of Deputy Haughey indicates and suggests a very remarkable development from the old Fianna Fáil position and I would like to quote from an election speech of the late President, Eamon de Valera, in 1939.  It is quoted in <i>Neutral Ireland</i> and <i>The Third Reich</i> by J.P. Duggan, page 49 where President de Valera said:</P>
    <P>I appeal to the young people to get into the ranks and defend what has been won, and if necessary be prepared to secure what has not yet been won.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear I would suggest, what Mr. de Valera meant and implied and insinuated at that stage, and I thank God that Deputy Haughey has the statesmanship to move away from that dangerous position.  I appeal to him to go that step further and consider what is possible in terms of amending the Constitution in this way.</P>
    <P>I regret that so much political manoeuvring has been seen in the ranks of the major political parties and a refusal of all parties, including the Progressive Democrats, to face up to the reality of this issue in a consistent manner.  Let me say also in regard to this proposal that it is not in essence an original proposal of my own, it comes from a distinguished former member of the Oireachtas, Jack <Col N="937" /> McQuillan. Mr. McQuillan has made available to me a complete file, a dossier, in which he wrote an earlier version.  I put some small sophistications into my amendment.  I have here in my hand and I am prepared to make available to the Government, a mass of correspondence which makes it perfectly plain that such a proposed amendment would be welcomed in Unionist circles in the North of Ireland; would be welcomed by leading bishops of the Protestant churches throughout the island on a 32 county basis; would be welcomed by certain specific, named members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; would be welcomed and would be supported by leading figures within the political life in the South of Ireland.  I would like to say in the light of all this evidence, which I am happy to make available, will the Government not give us an indication that they are prepared to move in an situation which has been rendered critical by the two judgments that I mentioned?</P>
    <P>I will end by saying that this is a very wide perception.  It is reflected in a headline in the <i>Observer</i> of Sunday, 18 March 1990: &ldquo;Judges award the Provos a mantle of legitimacy&rdquo;.  It is our responsibility, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, to remove that mantle of legitimacy from the Provisional IRA.  The Government have it in their capacity and I urge them to do so.  I recognise it may not be practical to get rid of Articles 2 and 3 but they can and should amend them.  We have had referenda on much less worthy topics.  I commend this motion to the Government and I will be commending my own amendment later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good subject to talk about.  I have listened on the numerous occasions that we have had outbursts of interest in the North of Ireland and concern expressed for those who live in it.  One would be tempted to laugh.  It is almost amusing to hear the kind of statements that are being made. The statement by the last speaker that a file of information has been given to him from everybody, including the Catholic Church, Paisley and a list of organisations that have furnished information and if only the Government would be wise <Col N="938" /> enough to accept the dossier that the Senator has we could move forward.  I would be tempted to laugh but I respect the House and I will not.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a motion that proposes to change the Constitution.  I may not be as eloquent as some of the people who are speaking on the motion, but I am sincerely committed to a solution.  I have to travel through the North to be here at all.  I have been in the North a thousand times for every once that any Member contributing to the debate has been.  However dumb I might be, I have learned something.  I consult with and work with different organisations and I am part of cross-Border organisations.  I have an intimate knowledge of what they are prepared to do and what they are not prepared to do.  No circus in the Dáil or Seanad will encourage anybody to jump off their seat and come down and be ready to respond and to solve the problems in the North.  That is not the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said numerous times, it is a tragedy that politicians and the media exploit the situation.  Some elected representatives use the troubles in the North to keep themselves in the public eye, especially when they lack ideas.  The media in Dublin and London have very little knowledge of and qualifications to speak about to the North and they distort the events in the North.  The people on the ground are unhappy with the sensationalism with which their problems are discussed, especially in this House, and the outbursts of people who have very little to contribute.  I believe they make a mistake in trying to do it on the backs of those that have to live in the North.  It is a tragedy.  You can change Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  It would be very important for me, as a Senator who lives within 100 yards of the Border, to listen to Senator Norris and to those who put their names to the motion, if I thought for one minute that there was the least possible chance of moving forward one yard or making any contribution to the situation in the North.  However, I am involved in cross-Border projects and I am working with DUP members on organisations and I know at first hand what they will accept <Col N="939" /> and will not accept.  This is sheer eyewash. I believe this country will go forward when it is economically and physically possible for them to do so.</P>
    <P>If, in fact, there are articles in the Constitution that are obstacles, the Constitution itself would be part of negotiations. It could be reviewed and looked at if sensible proposals came forward.  To say: we will remove Articles 2 and 3 and that will remove the obstacles is not on and it was never on.  In fact, it is totally ridiculous.  We have a situation in this country and a similar situation in Britain where parliament is reluctant to get involved in the courts.  If anybody here suggested to the British Government that we were unhappy with a court finding I know the answer we would get.  I could give you a litany of the responses we have got from eminent public people in Britain and in the North to refrain from commenting on judgments that might not have pleased us on events in the North. It is terrible.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years many people in the North of Ireland have sought to express concern and to offer advice, to risk their future and even their lives, to get a solution and we have people here who have a simple solution.  Why did you wait for 20 years while thousands were murdered?  The solution, according to these people is that all we have to do is to remove Articles 2 and 3 and we are on the road to recovery, the road back.  No sane person, North or South on this island, believes that that motion, if carried today, would contribute one iota.</P>
    <P>The two people who went to the Supreme Court were entitled to do so.  I welcome those people who came into the courts and challenged the Articles.  That was right and proper and was a welcome move by those people.  But they went home and accepted the verdict of the court.  People who continue to simplify the problems in the North and to offer simplistic solutions are making no contribution because those who are living in the Bogside, the Falls Road and the Shankill tonight are not listening.  They do not care.  You are miles off the target. You are light years away from the problems in the North.  You are contributing <Col N="940" /> to them by putting forward simplistic solutions. It is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>Why did these people not go up and spend some time there, and not on a guided tour and announce to television and the press that they are coming?  Why do they not get into their cars and drive up unannounced and see for themselves the position on the ground?  It would do them good and it might change their minds about the kind of contributions they are going to make here.  Go up and spend a weekend, unannounced, in the North of Ireland.  They will soon see how important the motion is.</P>
    <P>The Government have been consistent and there are a number of areas where the Government are going forward.  The economic part of the solution is vital because there has not been development in ghettos in the North.  There is neglect. Those are areas where this Government, I believe, now recognise that there has to be a joint input by the British Government and the Irish Government and solutions have to be found on the ground that are acceptable to the people who live there.  I find it amusing to hear Senator Norris mention Dr. Paisley.  I can imagine Dr. Paisley's response.  Whether this motion is passed or not would have very little significance for Dr. Paisley.</P>
    <P>I am talking and thinking about a lot of people, the groundswell of people in the North of Ireland who are concerned about their future, the future of their children, their education, the economy of their homes and their survival in that difficult situation.  Get off their backs. That is all you are doing here by flying kites and debating sensational motions. They do not want it.  I can tell you I am as near to them as any man in this House. I would say you are making no contribution whatsoever.  It is time that you stopped using them.  This is a good subject to talk about but a hard one to deliver on.  Only those who are responsible in Government can tackle the problem. When you are outside you are free to fly your kite as you like.  Nobody ever asks you to deliver on it.</P>
    <P>I think that this motion would certainly do nothing &mdash; even if it were adopted &mdash; to contribute to the solution of the problem in the North of Ireland.  I believe <Col N="941" /> we are going forward and that there is recognition, North and South, that it is not an easy problem and it is one that has to be tackled.  I would see the economic development of the North and South jointly with EC input as the best road forward.  Hopefully down the road there is a generation of people that will see their future in a united Ireland.  Tinkering with the Constitution will contribute nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with my colleague, Senator Costello.  I hope to take ten minutes and Senator Costello hopes to take five.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to say that Irish unity has long been a national aspiration. It is part of our tradition; it is part of our heritage.  We in the Labour Party have supported that aspiration.  It is part of our party's policy and we will continue to support that aspiration as long as it is pursued by peaceful and non-violent means.</P>
      <P>The reality of the situation, as far as opinion polls are concerned, is that there is still a clear majority in favour of Irish unity.  It is my belief that anyone who is in touch with the political realities on the ground would also share that opinion. We are not opposed to constitutional reform.  If a settlement in Northern Ireland is reached by agreement we are not opposed to changing the Constitution so as to facilitate the attainment of that settlement.  What is being proposed in this motion is a once-off business, it is not part of any package, it is not part of any initiative aimed at bringing peace to the North.  It is piecemeal; it is taken in isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete Articles 2 and 3 from the Constitution would require a referendum. Does anybody think that such a referendum would be carried?  I certainly do not.  If a referendum were to take place it would have to take place in an environment which would be preceded by debate.  I believe that debate would be rancorous.  I believe that emotions would be released during that debate which are best left alone.  I believe that such a debate would polarise the country in a manner that would be divisive and <Col N="942" /> acrimonious.  That is the very last thing this country needs at this time.</P>
    <P>We must remember that political parties were set up in this country because of people's strongly held views on the North.  There are still great tensions in some political parties because of the way in which Northern views are held. Indeed, in our party we have had more than our share of problems in this regard. Perhaps we have been more open about them but certainly there are other parties &mdash; the two major parties, particularly Fianna Fáil &mdash; who have had great difficulties as well in relation to accommodating the differing degrees of vigour with which views on the North are held.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a question: suppose a referendum takes place and suppose it is not carried, what will be the effect of that?  What will be the effect of it in relation to peace in Northern Ireland and in relation to Irish unity?  What would be the effect of a referendum defeat on the Unionist community?  What would be the effect on that community which now feels besieged and beleagured?  I certainly think a defeat could not help the opposition and would certainly be entirely counter-productive to any anxiety to attain peace in the North.  The history of referenda in this country, at least their recent history, has been painful and bitter.  The emotions which were aroused during the divorce and the abortion referenda still linger.  The bitterness which was generated has not been fully dissipated. If there was a referendum on the deletion of Articles 2 and 3 what was seen in relation to the referenda on divorce and abortion would be in the ha'penny place compared to the types of emotion that would be released in that type of climate.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repeating myself, I believe that the passions which would be generated would serve nobody's interest. Most of all, they would not serve the interests of the people in Northern Ireland.  If change in the North is to come, and if there has to be change in regard to Articles 2 and 3, then it has to be part of an overall agreement and an overall settlement.  It would be disastrous to hold a referendum now without having that as part of an overall packet for change, for reformation and for a settlement in the <Col N="943" /> North.  It is for those reasons that the Labour Party will be voting against the proposal to change those Articles.</P>

      <P>What we are debating today, if we take it in the context of what we had on the Order Paper last week, namely the discussion on the rail link between Northern Ireland and the Republic, highlights what I and, indeed, Senator Murphy, who has this motion down today as a Private Members' motion, have been looking for for a long time &mdash; that is a full-scale debate on Northern Ireland.  It is a shame that what we have to deal with is a debate on one aspect of it.  We were talking about another aspect of it the other day.  We cannot get the Government side of the House to come forward with a full-scale debate on Northern Ireland, to tease out all the developments that have taken place in recent weeks and months and to put them in the context of what has been taking place in other parts of the world, from South Africa to Eastern Europe. This has already been done in the other House.  I think it is a shame that the Government have been afraid to allow us to have a full-scale debate on all the issues relating to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Upton, has put the Labour position and put it very well. Our position has always been that we have never been a sectarian party.  We have never been tainted with sectarianism in relation to Northern Ireland or any other part of this island.  We have always, at the same time, aspired to the unity of the peoples, North and South. That has been our aspiration and we certainly make no apologies for that.  We have worked to bring about that unity; the unity of workers on both sides of the divide.  We have worked at it through the trade union movement in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and we have always sought to establish a community of interest on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way we see Irish nationhood going; a community of interest that is bonded together by the ordinary men and women of this island coming together in reconciliation and in workers' participation and democracy.  From that <Col N="944" /> point of view, it is extremely important that we emphasise what can be done domestically in terms of industrial contact with Northern Ireland, in terms of the range of services industries that we can establish, such as telecommunications, the area of tourism, where so much work can be done to bring people together, the area of education, where co-operation can be shown across the educational divide between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, not to talk about the whole area of integrated education in Northern Ireland itself.  There is a lot that can be done and that, we in the Labour Party suggest, should be the focus of activity in bringing about this unity of mind and spirit that would be the basis of any true unity.  It is not a question of territorial annexation.  It is a question of unity of people.</P>
    <P>In terms of the wider area, the European Community, there is so much that can be done there and so much work that has to be put into it both in areas of resources and funds that are coming in, in terms of structural funds that can be used in the general framework between both sides of the island and in terms of legislation.  There is a lot that can be done and must be done by the socialist group, which is the largest single group in the EC, to ensure that it is that aspiration to unity which is the one that is represented in legislative measures and to ensure that any legislation that goes through the European Parliament is legislation that considers the partitioned nature of the country at present and seeks to reconcile the divide.</P>
    <P>There is so much that can be done now and that will be possible particularly in 1992.  We should be directing our attention to the domestic area, the internal area, and bringing in what has been described by a certain gentleman as the totality of relationships between these two islands, Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have been working in the area of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It has a tremendous number of flaws and has not been pursued to the fullness it should be.  It was a good structure in terms of potential for developing an umbrella <Col N="945" /> structure to ensure that both sovereign States in the Republic and in Britain ensured that, by and large, the equivalent of a Bill of Rights operated in Northern Ireland and that there was a level of supervision.  The recent development in relation to the inter-parliamentary tier that has been established is another stage in that direction.  The recent call from the British Secretary, Peter Brooke, for round table talks is another move in that direction.</P>
    <P>We have seen in that context the falling of the barriers and the borders in Eastern Europe and the unbelievable happening where President De Klerk and Nelson Mandela are able to sit down and talk about apartheid.  The protagonist of apartheid and the opponents of it are prepared now to come together around the same table and to talk in terms of getting rid of that racial partition there. I believe that the right political ethos is abroad at present.</P>
    <P>In relation to this motion, if we presented a referendum to delete Articles 2 and 3, because that is all that is specified in the McGimpsey judgment, I have no doubt that it would fail.  That constitutional proposal for amendment would be lost.  In the process, we would have that terrible situation re-introduced into this country that we experienced in the earlier eighties when the abortion referendum and the divorce referendum were discussed, when we had that blood drawing of people between people.</P>
    <P>The old antagonisms came to the surface and people who dwell on slogans and shibboleths had their day.  The end result would be that we would have an awful lot more talk and we would have an awful lot more prejudice instilled rather than have real work.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the real work towards reconciliation.</P>
    <P>This motion, because it covers a narrow area &mdash; I appreciate the intention of the proposer &mdash; really diverts attention from the real work of bridge building which is on-going hard work that has to be done over a long period of time.  It gives scope for a lot of that to be taken away because we know that a referendum would bring about all those old prejudices of the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> I would much prefer that we got an opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland, to discuss proposals for advancement of our position in relation to Northern Ireland in the context of the aspiration to unity, and that we would see it in its totality rather than concentrating on one or two individual issues as is the case here.  I believe we are one nation on this island with many traditions.  That is the position I would like to see us reach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing my time with Senator Jackman.  She is taking five minutes of my time.  I would like to compliment my colleague, Senator Murphy, of UCC, for raising this issue.  I do not share many of the reservations expressed by Senator McGowan, Senator Upton and Senator O'Toole.  I have had certain reservations about these two Articles in the Constitution for some time. Certainly since the recent court finding in the McGimpsey case I have the gravest reservations about the two Articles.</P>
      <P>In 1937, when the Constitution was drafted, many people were unhappy about it then.  No less a person that W.T. Cosgrave described the two Articles as make believe.  More importantly, a nonpolitical person, the Secretary at the Department of Finance, Mr. J.J. McElligott, objected strenously to the inclusion of these two Articles.  He described them as fiction, which would give offence to neighbouring countries with which we are constantly protesting our desire to live on terms of friendship. He concluded that these Articles would hinder rather than help our efforts to get national unity.  Can anybody deny that he was wrong?</P>
      <P>I have to admit that I have not been in Northern Ireland as often as Senator McGowan.  At the same time, I want to tell him that I have been there many times and I have done business there with people on both sides of the divide, I have been invited to talk and to lecture there many times.  I have some views which are different from those he expressed on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty years after the Constitution was drafted when people had a chance of <Col N="947" /> looking at the whole situation more dispassionately, an all-party review committee of the Oireachtas suggested that these offensive Articles, particularly Article 3, should be replaced.  The review committee recommended that Article 3 be replaced by a clause saying:</P>
    <P>The Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be reunited in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen.</P>
    <P>How can we have brotherly affection while these two Articles exist in their present form?  Would, for instance, the Taoiseach sit down in brotherly affection with someone who made legal claim to his estate in Kinsealy or his holiday home in Inishvickillane?  He would not.  It is preposterous to expect Unionists to sit in trust with us while we lay claim to their territory.</P>
    <P>The recent judgment in the McGimpsey case vindicated the view of Unionists that we had designs on their territory with scant regard for their will or their rights in the matter.  It, in fact, got rid of the myth that Articles 2 and 3 were an aspiration to unity.  In fact, the court said quite emphatically that Articles 2 and 3 constitute a legal claim which the Government have not only the right but the duty to pursue.  It is a constitutional imperative.  Following that judgment it appears to me that these two Articles constitute a provocation for Unionists and a justification for the IRA terrorists.  Indeed, they tend to contradict and undermine the Anglo-Irish Agreement where the unification would only come about with the consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland. They should be changed; they should be amended.  Let us hope that that can be done, as Senator Upton and Senator Costello said, within the context of an overall political package.  I would be far more confident than Senators Upton and Costello about the wisdom and the generosity of the Irish people if the amendment were put to them in an informed and dispassionate manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>By raising the issue in the Seanad this motion gives us the <Col N="948" /> opportunity for dialogue, debate and discussion. I would like to compliment Senator Murphy for giving us that opportunity. I have to say that we are very much aware of the divisiveness of a referendum and there must be a fair deal of talking done between now and the holding of a referendum.</P>
      <P>I have to agree with Senator Raftery and I too, would have more faith in the Irish people to come to grips with this issue.  I would hope the same emotion that surrounded the divorce referendum would not emerge again.  As a nation the Irish psyche, possibly from a legacy of our colonial domination, are obsessed about territory and property.  While we should have been talking about the real issue within the debate on divorce we ended up talking about the threat and the fear of losing property.</P>
      <P>This motion affords us an opportunity to raise the awareness of the Irish people to the situation as it is.  We would need to distance ourselves from any Supreme Court interpretation which would seem to confer an element of legitimacy on the Provos' campaign.  I have grave doubts about taking things in a piecemeal way. This has to be discussed within a wider agenda.  We have got to accept that moderate Unionists over an over again have stated that these Articles are offensive. It behoves us, if we are honest with ourselves, to work towards the removal of these Articles ending the States' territorial claim to Northern Ireland.  I believe them when they say those Articles restrict the Government's capacity to strive for compromise with the Unionist majority, and that they add a constraint to any future bargaining with the Northern majority.  After all, we are talking about compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot disregard the Presbyterian synod when it puts Articles 2 and 3 as a high priority on the agenda working towards reconciliation.  These are all moderate voices.  Senator Costello referred to unity of hearts and unity of minds, not preoccupation with territory. Surely at this stage we cannot afford any further time to look into our hearts and to thrash out the position again and again right into the next generation.  Why can <Col N="949" /> we not be adults and face up to the situation as it is?</P>
    <P>I support the motion because I feel we cannot be hypocritical, that we must take the views of moderates into account, that we must rid ourselves of the emotion surrounding this.  We are talking about fair-minded people north of the Border. We must be fair minded south of the Border.  We must work towards raising the consciousness of the ordinary men and women and ensure that they are exposed to discussion, dialogue and debate that is unconfrontational, sincere, logical and at the end of the day is open to the views of the moderates in Norther Ireland with whom compromise is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>It is timely now.  We cannot wait forever to do this, or await some new generation for whom the whole concept of a united Ireland at that stage will be within the context of a united Europe.  It is extraordinary that we can produce compromises for every other country but when it comes to our situation we find we are not adult enough to think and to work towards what would be considered compromise for the final solution for this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been mentioned here that this idea would be welcomed by many prominent people &mdash; politicians, ordinary members of the public, the Churches, etc., in the North of Ireland. The very fact that somebody welcomes something with an open mind does not mean that it would make good sense to do it at a certain time or in a certain way. Therefore, that argument does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the removal of Articles 2 and 3 could, without full debate and dialogue on what the outcome of a referendum might be, could give the Nationalist population false hope. Against that we could give the Unionist population a false sense of belief that all our aspirations are over.  The real problem is that we have had no public debate on the whole question of the North of Ireland.  This is what makes it a problem for us.  The Labour Party have discussed the issue with our own members at our annual conference and they voted against <Col N="950" /> it.  That is a Labour Party congress decision.</P>
    <P>Some people said we did not understand the merits of the removal.  If one decided to go out in bad weather without getting a weather forecast beforehand and proceeded to go out without the proper clothing into a woody area it would not be a good idea.  That is a simple analogy.  That is one of the difficulties.  If we went in without reconnoitreing the ground well we could go over a precipice. We do not know what the outcome of a referendum would be.</P>
    <P>There are peculiar decisions on extradition at the moment.  We do not know what the five judges said in the present cases on extradition.  All we know is that they came together.  That could present another difficult problem.  This would relate to the question of the North of Ireland.  I do not mind the moral influence. If you are to have a moral influence it must have the ability to place a power behind it.  I do not think, unless we go into the full ramifications of it, that the power would be behind this moral act. We have a moral obligation to a degree to do that.  The moralising posture alone will not influence controversial politicians or people.  For that reason, it is useless to suppose that we can influence in this way.</P>
    <P>There has been a great reluctance to have a full and wide debate on the Northern problem.  We may be taking a course of action which could result in a painful experience, adjusting from theory to reality.  It could also be interpreted by the people of the North as a move exclusively based on Eire's national interest.  I do not think this would curb the abuse of power in the North because we do not fully understand the problem and we have not got a full grasp of the facts.  We are in enough trouble dealing with problems at the moment; we must understand the full situation before we come to make decisions.  Let us bear that in mind before we embark on this course of action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the comments made in the course of last week's debate. These comments will, of course, be <Col N="951" /> communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as requested by several Senators.</P>
      <P>The Constitution in its 53 year history has served the State well.  In order to ensure that it reflects the sort of society we want, it has been amended on a number of occasions over the years. From time to time there have been suggestions that we should also seek to amend Articles 2 and 3, but this has not been proceeded with and there is no obvious consensus at present for such a move.</P>
      <P>Articles 2 and 3 are central provisions of the Constitution.  As such, and while there are differing views on their appropriateness, as has been brought out in this debate, I do not believe we should amend these provisions except in some entirely new circumstances.  We do not accept that such circumstances exist at present, or that we should seek to move in the direction being suggested outside the context of new political arrangements on this island which may emerge at some stage in the future.</P>
      <P>Any proposal for an amendment to the Constitution would thus have to be very carefully thought out with regard to its content and its purpose.  I have heard it suggested here that there is now a strong tide in the country in favour of radical and urgent change.  I have to say that this is not the sense that we have.  Moreover, I think all serious political observers would accept that, in the absence of political consensus, it would be highly divisive to ask the people to agree to the changes being suggested.</P>
      <P>Before addressing some of the specific points that have arisen, I think it would be as well to examine dispassionately what the Supreme Court said in its judgment.  Some of the key points could perhaps be summarised as saying that:</P>
      <P>Article 2 of the Constitution consists of a declaration of the extent of the national territory as a claim of legal right.</P>
      <P>Article 3 prohibits, pensing the reintegration of the national territory, the enactment of laws applicable in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is not inconsistent with the Constitution and <Col N="952" /> in particular with Articles 2, 3 and 29.</P>
    <P>The Agreement was not concluded in disregard of the interests of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The court was satisfied in particular that there is no incompatability between Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  In this general regard, I would ask Members and, indeed, the wider public, to note in particular the references in the judgment to Article 29, sections 1 and 2, of the Constitution whereby Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation and its adherence to the principles of the specific settlement of disputes.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand, in all the circumstances, why there should now be continuing controversy about Articles 2 and 3.  We believe that such controversy is a serious distraction from our goal of making progress on the North and of operating the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the most effective manner.  Those who seek to make play out of the decision as a means of questioning our bona fides on the Northern issue are misplaced in their criticisms and are obviously intent on making capital out of a judgment to which, in our view, no controversy need attach.</P>
    <P>What is important is that the constitutionality of the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been upheld by the Supreme Court.  The operation of the Agreement and the functioning of the Conference and the Secretariat have allowed the Government to play an important role in achieving progress in Northern Ireland and, in particular, in addressing the needs and the situation of the Nationalist community there.  The decision of the court, having rejected the claim of unconstitutionality, allows the Government to continue their commitment to the operation of the Agreement; and it successfully sees off a threat which was designed to bring the Agreement to an end.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the effect of the Supreme Court's judgment will be to bring about a qualitative change in the Government's policy.  I disagree fundamently with this view.  The Supreme <Col N="953" /> Court decision has affirmed that, within the meaning of Articles 2 and 3, as now interpreted by the court, there is full scope for the Government to pursue and develop their policy in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would also reject categorically the notions that I have heard here that Article 2 is aggressive in its intent, that it is bombastic and unhelpful and that the idea of a national territory is increasingly dubious.  We obviously regret if some wish to see Article 2 in these terms.  We make no apology for stating here and now, as we have always done, that the idea of national unity is deeply cherished and that the need to work for it, and towards it, is as compelling now as it was when the Constitution first came into force.  There is nothing aggressive in this. In operating faithfully in conformity with the terms of the Constitution we will always do so in a manner which is sensitive to the concerns and fears of the Unionist people in Northern Ireland and in a manner which is calculated to be in the best interests of all the people on this island.  We are deeply committed to making progress on this basis.</P>
    <P>We do not have, as one Senator suggested, &ldquo;aggressive territorial intent&rdquo; on the people of Northern Ireland by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution.  The claim of legal right is not a Government one, nor one which is the possession of any one individual political party.  It is a constitutional claim which the Government, any Government of the day, are obliged to uphold or else seek to change by way of constitutional amendment.  In this regard, we do not believe that we should consider changing such fundamental tenets of the Constitution in a vacuum; we are, however, as I said, prepared to examine and review these articles in the context of new political arrangements which may emerge on this island.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach set out our position on this in the Dáil last November when he said that &ldquo;the Forum report made it clear that the New Ireland, to which we aspire, would require a new Constitution designed to ensure that the needs of all traditions on our island would be fully accommodated.&rdquo;  This approach, to <Col N="954" /> quote the words of the Taoiseach, is &ldquo;generous, forward-looking and genuinely intended to chart a way out of the prejudices and divisions of centuries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The sensitivities of Unionists in relation to Articles 2 and 3 have existed ever since the Constitution came into existence.  Last week, one Senator went so far as to suggest that friendly relations with Unionists could not be developed alongside Articles 2 and 3.  We do not believe this to be the case.  There is nothing in Articles 2 and 3, as defined by the Supreme Court, that would inhibit us working with all the parties concerned in pursuit of peace and stability on this island.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has specifically emphasised in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement that:</P>
    <P>A procedure which is likely to lead to peaceable and friendly co-operation at any given time must surely be consistent with the constitutional position of a state that affirms its devotion not only to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation but to that ideal founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>We totally reject the notion that Article 2, as is now interpreted, can give succour to the IRA.  This is an organisation which operates outside of democracy and of the Constitution.  If it wishes to misconstrue the provisions of the Constitution and its ideals, based on peaceful and friendly co-operation, we can only say that it is wrong and very wrong.  If others insist on suggesting that the Constitution does in fact confer rights on this organisation and their methods, then they, too, are equally wrong.  There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution which can in any way justify the campaign that the IRA are conducting; to suggest otherwise is simply a perverted and mischievous reading of a document which is dedicated to peace.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity of this debate to try to address the concerns that have been expressed, arising out of the McGimpsey judgment, and to state that, in my view, these concerns are misplaced. In the light of this, and of the reasons which I have outlined, I call on the House to reject the motion before it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to thank everybody who spoke in this debate and to thank the Minister for his reply.  I am very pleased that the debate has provoked such widespread discussion, and not simply in the House. Indeed, not very much in the House, I regret to add, but it may be an indicator of the gap between Government thinking, Fianna Fáil thinking, on this matter as reflected by the meagreness of their contributions in the House and the large amount of interest the debate has generated outside.  I am very glad that the debate has had that consequence.</P>
      <P>I was not so naive as to expect that the Government would accept this motion, nor, even in the theoretical case that the Government did accept it, I was not expecting that there would not be some kind of a <i>quid pro quo</i>, that a constitutional change would not mean a constitutional replacement.  My main purpose was twofold; to get the House to address the new situation that has arisen from the judgment of the Supreme Court and, secondly, to push out the frontiers of debate.  The fact that the newspapers and the media generally have taken up this motion over the last week is very interesting.  There are very few motions in this House that got such an airing as this one and it cannot but do the Seanad good in a time when the image of the Seanad, perhaps, is not all that it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased enough in general with the consequences and I thank the Senators who spoke and my colleagues Senators Ross and Norris and the Fine Gael contributors particularly.  I must say that I have to compliment Senator Manning on his speech last week, and Senators Raftery and Jackman on their contributions today.  This bears out that whatever limitations Fine Gael have had as a party in the history of this country, they have not been lacking in recent decades in generosity, in imagination, even, <Col N="956" /> I would say, at the risk of the political careers of some of their leading members.  I compliment once again Deputy FitzGerald's intention at any rate to lead a constitutional crusade.  He might have been naive, he might have not estimated fully the cynicism with which he was faced, but at least he was of good heart and he had a good intention.  I am glad that Fine Gael have adopted the attitude they have adopted here.</P>
    <P>I must say I am disappointed with the contribution of the Labour Party.  I had expected better.  But then, who knows, Labour are the victims of their own imperatives and it is important for them from time to time to wrap the green flag a little bit more tightly around them in case there should be some confusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a crime when it is done as expediency &mdash; in case they should be confused with The Workers' Party, perhaps.  I am sorry that their contribution was so negative.  I respect people like Senators Upton, Costello and Harte, but I thought their argument was unconvincing.  My motion pre-supposed that any constitutional steps taken by the Government would mean, of course, all party commitment. In fact, Fianna Fáil are the only bar to an all-party referendum; and that is why a referendum would not necessarily be divisive, unless Fianna Fáil chose to make it so.  So, I do not accept that a referendum would be necessarily divisive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept either, by the way, the point made both by Labour and Fianna Fáil speakers that the people of Ireland are committed to unity and that they deeply cherish it.  That is bunkum; we all know it is bunkum and why do we not say so?  If the referendum would be lost, well then we would know where we stand &mdash; that we were frankly a partitionist, territorial people with no interest in the North except to annex it, if we had the strength to do so.  Of course, as Senator Costello reminds us, there are other things to be done; but that was not what the motion was about.  Could I remind the Labour Party, if I could get their <Col N="957" /> attention for a moment, that their attitude is disappointedly partitionist in respect of the fact that nationalism has divided the working class in the North&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Finally, I must say that I cannot accept &mdash; and I do not really believe that Senator Costello accepts &mdash; that this is one nation with many traditions.  That is a cop-out. There is no one nation inhabiting this island and that is my further objection to the Article 1, 2 and 3.  I must say that I was not disappointed by Fianna Fáil's contribution because it was exactly what I expected.  I thought, however, there might have been more contributions and I did not expect the gutter level of contribution from Senator Lydon in particular. His use of phrases like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was saying, Senator Manning said in his contribution that Fianna Fáil cannot be trusted on the North and that was borne out by their lack of interest in this and by the poor level of their contributions.  The Minister's intervention followed the same dreary mediocrity as the contributions. The Minister's speech is an attempt to rationalise, and I have a kind of feeling that the Minister does not really believe what he had to read out here.  All the Minister was doing was trying to rationalise the attitude of the Taoiseach which is &mdash; and I said it last week and I will not go into it again &mdash; at once stubborn and evasive.  This is what this contribution is all about.  The idea that we are nice people because we have Article 3, which does not enforce the claim, and because we have Article 29 we are devoted to friendly principles, that that makes any difference to the aggressive territoriality of the claim does not convince anybody. The Minister in his speech said:</P>
      <P>We are prepared to examine and review these arguments in the context of new political arrangements which may emerge on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Big deal.  Big deal.  We will get rid of <Col N="959" /> them when the Unionists agree to a united Ireland or to a federal structure. So, I would expect the very least the Government might do in response to the Supreme Court judgment is to say, &ldquo;OK, this claim was made in 1937 in a very different kind of political context.  Now at least we can replace them by a genuine aspiration.&rdquo;  I would enthusiastically campaign for an amendment which wanted to replace these by a real aspiration to unity without reference to the national territory, which I still say is a highly dubious concept.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced, finally, by some of the articles that have been written on the matter during the week, including one today in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; for example, the idea that the Nationalist community in the North would be devastated were we to withdraw these Articles.  Not so. These Articles never gave any protection to the Nationalist community.  What protection the Nationalist community has at all now is the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the existence of the Secretariat and the Conference, not Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>May I say, in conclusion, that I would have hoped &mdash; and there was some hint from the Taoiseach in the Dáil last week <Col N="960" />&mdash; that if there is sufficient pressure in the Oireachtas on these Articles that there may be reference to an all-party committee.  I certainly will settle for that. As I often do, I state matters perhaps more provocatively than I am prepared to fully support; but that is the whole object of debate in the Oireachtas and that is the privilege, I may say, of an Independent Senator and I am very glad to have used it on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have been thinking a lot about John Hume's oft reiterated sentiments that the Unionists must sort out their relations with Dublin, that they must go to Dublin and talk and really decide what their attitude to Dublin is.  I am not sure what he means by that but it is a lesson we should be prepared to take to heart, that we should sort out what our relations with the Unionists are.  The Government's attitude is a stubborn refusal to sort out what our relations with the Unionists are.  All I can do is hope that the debate will go on and on.  I do believe that this one will run; but, if it does, it is not due to any credit on the part of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his presence here tonight for this debate on what I consider an important issue in our area.  It is in connection with the strike in the Goodman plant in Rathkeale, County Limerick. This strike, which has continued over the past seven weeks, has led to a very serious position.  Many attempts have been made to try to settle this.  My information is, however, that the two sides are so far apart at the moment that, even now as a conciliation conference is taking place, the likelihood is that there will not be a solution at the end of this conference.</P>
      <P>The issue is of great concern to the people of Rathkeale.  It is a small town with a population of fewer than 2,000; and an industry with a turnover of £26 million and of wages going into the area of almost £2 million is a vital part of the economy.  The loss of such an industry would have a devastating effect on the town of Rathkeale and of County Limerick in general.  There is a strong possibility and a danger that this industry will be lost to the area.  It will also be a loss to the farmers in the region, who for 38 years have supported this company.  They were instrumental in the setting up of the original factory and have sold their cattle and supported the company over that time.  Now because of this strike it is possible that the company will close for at least a year and a half.  My hope is that the Minister will intervene and try to obtain a settlement.  At this stage it is necessary to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> The factory was established in 1952 by the people of Rathkeale.  The objective at the time was to create employment there.  That remained the objective of the organisation and coloured the industrial relations process of the organisation over the years.  They were always regarded as good employers who treated their employees in a fair fashion, who were progressive in their industrial relations policies, and the natural conflicts that arise in an organisation were always solved through the industrial relations process, through the negotiations, discussion and communications that are general in good employers.</P>
    <P>The company were profitable up to the sale of the company.  In the year the company were sold to the Goodman Group, 1987, they experienced their second biggest profit since 1952.  The company were successful.  They were a public company and the shares were brought from two shareholders which gave the Goodman Group a majority shareholding in the company.  The objectives of the company changed obviously from being one of solely creating employment and improving the economy of the locality, as well as making profit, to one of solely making profit and reducing cost to the minimum, regardless of the consequences to the people and to the locality.</P>
    <P>The issue has got to do with a bonus scheme which was established in 1974.  It was a work study scheme based on work measurement, the establishment of work values and a bonus based on such a scientific approach.  During 1974 to the takeover and up to six months after that there was a work study department in existence which ensured that the bonus scheme was kept up to date, that the scheme was updated to take into account any changes in work practices or in equipment, that new values were installed and that the scheme was maintained.  Any argument that the scheme fell into disrepair over that period is not a viable argument.</P>
    <P>In early 1988 the then work study department was abolished.  The personnel management was also withdrawn from the company and over a period of <Col N="963" /> time, because the scheme was not maintained, the standards slipped somewhat and the company changed their approach.  I believe it was a conscious decision by the company to allow the scheme to go into disarray and to then create the argument that the scheme should be withdrawn.  The purpose of the exercise was to reduce cost and to reduce the level of remuneration to the employees.  This is what has happened and has created the problem.</P>
    <P>The present situation is that the company have unilaterally withdrawn the measured scheme and have proposed the introduction of a piece work scheme.  The company were fully aware that a strike would ensue from this.  It was not news to the company because in October, during the height of the busy season in the meat industry, in the killing period, the company made an attempt to withdraw the scheme and were issued with strike notice.  They decided instead to pick the period of January when the company was best able to take the strike because of the seasonality aspect of the trade.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the new scheme and having known the old scheme intimately because, in fact, I was instrumental in introducing that scheme and in maintaining that scheme for a period of 16 or 17 years, there is no doubt that there is a substantial drop in remuneration to the employees at a time when standards of living and cost of living, etc., are under pressure.  It is difficult at any time to ask employees to take a drop in incomes.</P>
    <P>I believe that change is necessary in any organisation but change must come about by negotiation, by agreement, by the understanding of the employees, and by the understanding of the company that they must get agreement from the employees rather than create conflict and unilaterally change working conditions. Changes have come about prior to this in Shannon Meat in Rathkeale with the agreement of the workers.  The workers were always positive towards change, once they understood the issues involved. They embraced change when they saw it was necessary.  Certainly with the profitable levels of the parent organisation and <Col N="964" /> the profitability levels of the factory itself it is very hard to convince workers that they should take a cut in their standards of living when the same organisation is in the process of buying up various enterprises right throughout Europe. Obviously it is the responsibility of the Goodman group to try to make their operations as cost effective as possible but I believe this is not the issue on which they should do it.  I believe the approach, which I refer to as a macho-management approach, towards the problem and working towards a win lose situation and involving themselves in certain activities which have aggravated the situation there are not conducive to bringing about a settlement to this.  I believe, and I am convinced of this because of other experiences, that the survival of the factory is under threat, if not indefinitely certainly for a period of time.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest, most effective and most successful beef canning facilities is in Rathkeale.  It was built up by the people of Rathkeale.  It was built up by the management in Rathkeale prior to the Goodman takeover.  There is a great worry that if the strike continues this facility will be lost, moved elsewhere, either within this country or abroad.  This is a very successful enterprise and I would be very concerned that this will be lost even if there is a closure for a period of 12 months or a year and a half.</P>
    <P>The sides are very much apart; the company are not prepared to substantially concede their proposals.  The union sees the situation as so far removed from what their objectives are that they are not in a position to consider any change from their position.  I believe that tonight will again prove that there is a very serious situation there and I think it is incumbent on us all to try to find a solution.</P>
    <P>I have done what I could locally to try to obtain a solution, to influence the people involved but to no avail.  The situation is becoming more and more serious and I earnestly ask the Minister to do everything he can by way of intervention or any other way to try to bring about a resolution.  I am also aware, through my contacts in the industrial <Col N="965" /> relations area, that any conciliation conferences that took place so far were of absolutely no help and in fact the position is so serious that the groups did not even meet at those conciliation conferences. Normally at conciliation people sit across the table from each other and have a certain discussion before going into side conferences but the situation is so serious that the groups will not even meet.  I would implore the Minister again to do what he can to intervene in the situation and ensure that this enterprise and this employment is saved for the people of Rathkeale, for the economy of Rathkeale, especially for the employees who are likely to lose their jobs and for the farmers who support it and who require this service in the mid-west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank Senator Neville for the opportunity to discuss this issue for a short time in the Seanad this evening.  I am aware that Senator Neville has been trying for some time to raise the issue on the Adjournment.  From his own experience, he has outlined a great deal of the background to this dispute.  I do not want in any way to disagree or to have any contention about any of those issues. From my understanding, they seem to be more or less a lot of the issues that have built up from the various reports I have got.  I appreciate the Senator has a lot of personal experience as well from being on the ground.  He has listened to all sides and heard all the views.  For the record, the dispute in Anglo-Irish Beef Processors Limited, which includes Shamrock Meats, Rathkeale, commenced on 5 February last.  There are about 120 employed in the operation.  My understanding, from all the discussions and the briefings that we have had in the Department of Labour, with our industrial relations arm in the Labour Court and the conciliation service, and other discussions I have had, both in the other House last Thursday and with people who have directly approached me from the Rathkeale area is that about 24 or so people would be directly affected by this bonus scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not disagree with the Senator either that sums of money in the region <Col N="966" /> of £50 are being lost in the restructuring of the bonus scheme and are, indeed, substantial to put it mildly, and would cause great difficulties to the people involved.</P>
    <P>The company notified the union, SIPTU, that they needed to restructure a bonus scheme which has not been altered for 15 years, as the Senator stated.  When the company were taken over by the present owners they set about correcting outdated practices and procedures in order to make the operation viable and competitive and the bonus scheme, around which the dispute hinges, as again the Senator has mentioned, was intended as an incentive for production achievements but had long lost its effectiveness. I suppose that is not unusual in bonus schemes that have run for a long period of time.  Modern machinery was installed to enable greater production.  This necessitated the restructuring of the bonus scheme and everyone agreed that this was necessary, but to find the acceptable formula has caused all the present difficulties and this dispute.</P>
    <P>On one point of detail, I think the Senator said that the disputes started around August.  As I understand it, at the beginning of last year the management were going to impose what they thought was the new scheme but when there was a willingness to enter into discussions to try to structure a new bonus scheme, there was agreement that the management would not pursue their action in January 1989.  The discussion which, from my information, did not take place was actually around for a year.  I got that from both sides and from my local contacts.  I am not making any great issue but just to show that it was not something that happened quickly.  It simmered, certainly over a period of about 14 months and led to the start of the present dispute.</P>
    <P>Again, when no progress was made at the local negotiations over that period, the Labour Court became involved.  Proposals emerged from the Labour Court conciliation discussion which took place on 7 February 1990.  These proposals were rejected by the workers.  As the Senator states, very little was gained. There was very little progress made at these discussions.  A further conciliation <Col N="967" /> conference took place on 6 March but unfortunately no progress was made on that occasion either.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the dangers attached to a prolonged dispute.  There is nothing I would like to say other than to urge, as I have in the other House and at numerous informal meetings over the last four weeks or so, both sides to see the value of negotiation, consideration, debate and dialogue.  For either management or the union to prolong this dispute or to make it worse will not be in the interest of anybody.  In all disputes, as we who deal with them on a regular basis know, there never is a winner.  There are only losers and the degree of loss is all a matter of debate at the end of it.</P>
    <P>The firm's market share is put at risk with the possible loss of valuable employment. There is no doubt about that.  We have all seen the weekend statements of what could happen and we are aware of the views of both sides on this issue.  I want to assure the Seanad and in particular the Senator who brought this matter to the floor of the Seanad tonight, that I have been keeping in close contact with the dispute since it began early last month.  It has now been in progress for almost two months, which is very serious for such an important industry with an important number of jobs.  However, I am aware that the parties are in communication and I hope this latest attempt to find a solution will be successful.</P>
    <P>There are some grounds for hope no matter how tenuous they may be.  It is incumbent of me, and this is what the Senator is urging, to try to keep in close touch and to use the machinery of the State that is at my disposal to try to come to a resolution of this dispute.  There are <Col N="968" /> a lot of jobs at stake, not only in Anglo-Irish Beef Processors, which includes Shannon Meats, but also in some other industries.  I accept what the Senator has said and his concern, and the concern of his colleagues in the area who have been raising this matter with me, about the importance of trying to maintain this viable employment which has served the area well.  From all I have heard it has been good employment and well paid in the past.</P>
    <P>I would like, a Chathaoirligh, to take this opportunity to wish the talks which are at present going on, well.  A great amount of effort is being put in by both sides.  Just before I came into the Seanad I was in touch with the conciliation service and if there is anything I can do, or if there is any way in which I can be helpful, I can assure the Senator that I will do all I can to assist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his reply.  By way of clarification, it is not correct to say that alterations did not take place to the scheme over 15 years.  In fact new equipment was put in in 1987 and a complete new work measurement was done at that time.  The incentive scheme was kept up to date right through the period and it was as effective in 1987, when I left the organisation, as it was in 1974.  I would like to wish the talks well tonight.  I am personally very concerned about the situation and I hope we will have a good result. I would like to say to the Minister that I hope that if the case is not to our liking we may discuss the situation again in some forum or other with a view to working towards a settlement.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 March 1990.</P>
