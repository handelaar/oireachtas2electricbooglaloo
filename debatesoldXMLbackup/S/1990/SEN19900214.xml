      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>An gá atá ann go méadóidh an tAire Comhshaoil an t-olldeontas bóithre do Ghaillimh ag féachaint do dhrochstaid na mbóithre i gConamara.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately outline the future employment prospects for all our customs officers in the light of the free trade position in the EC from 1 January 1993, and in regard to his recent announcement concerning the introduction of automatic entry processing and direct trades input, on 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health in the light of the recent resignation of the Chairman of the Health Research Board, due to unexpected arbitrary budgetary constraints imposed in the Estimates to look urgently at the possibility of providing future and adequate funding so that this important body can carry out its work in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Health to supply figures of amounts collected and outstanding of the £10 hospital charge for the year ending 31 December 1989, for accidents, emergencies, outpatients, x-rays, laboratory and maintenance for each of the hospitals of the Mid-Western Health Board and including voluntary hospitals in order to ascertain the financial justification of the charge.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that all the necessary preparations are put in order to prepare for the policing implications of open borders post 1992, and if he will make a statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Foighil, Doyle, Norris, Ross, Jackman and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Ó Foighil and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Doyle, Norris, Ross, Jackman and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is item No. 1 and we will take that item until 4.30 p.m.  I know it would be the wish of the House that some statement should be made in the House in connection with the release of Nelson Mandela and we will have a short interruption at 4.30 p.m. of the Marine Institute Bill to allow the leaders of each <Col N="1903" /> group to make a short statement.  I suggest that statements should not be longer than ten minutes.  In deference to the wishes of other Members of the House, we will have an early debate on the whole matter of his release and its consequences, and the current situation in South Africa.  I will attempt to have that debate on Thursday of next week, but I cannot confirm that yet.  We will resume debate on the Marine Institute Bill until 6.30 p.m. and Item No. 65 on the Supplementary Order Paper will be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow it is intended to resume Second Stage of An Bord Glas Bill.  I hope we will have Second Stage concluded by 2 p.m. tomorrow and we will then take the initial Stages of the Horse Breeding Bill, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Leader of the House for having this series of statements today on the release of Nelson Mandela and for agreeing to a fairly full debate on this subject in the near future. One or two points occur on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>First, I was under the impression there was an informal agreement reached last session that Private Members' Business would take place on one evening and be of two hours duration.  In view of the noncontroversial nature of the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion this evening &mdash; and there certainly will not be a vote at the end of it &mdash; would it be possible to have, say, a two hour debate on that subject this evening and bring it to a conclusion?  Could we then move on to have a different Private Members' motion each week for a two hour period? I think there was general agreement from all sides of the House last session that this would be the practice.  Given the small amount of time, I think we are all in agreement on the general drift and contents of the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion this evening.  Certainly it is not divisive.  Perhaps the Leader of the House would consider that change in the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> Last week there was considerable discussion and a certain amount of heat was generated on the question of the role of the Cathaoirleach.  In all of that, the Cathaoirleach behaved properly.  I have since read very carefully the letter which he sent to all Members of the Seanad.  It is the view of my group that it was a reasonable statement of the position of the Cathaoirleach and we certainly do not want to push the matter any further. However, there is a certain absence of total clarity, if that is possible, about the role and functioning of the Cathaoirleach and I would suggest that in its examination of Standing Orders, which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are undertaking at present, an attempt should be made to examine any outstanding matters and to get as clear a position as possible of the role of Cathaoirleach.  I suggest that that be taken on board by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that the matter be allowed rest until then.</P>
    <P>I also hope that in regard to the allegations which were made against the Cathaoirleach last Thursday morning &mdash; allegations which I believe from my own investigations have no foundation whatsoever &mdash; steps be taken to have these allegations dealt with as quickly and speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always supported the idea that Private Members' Business be disposed of at one session. We would certainly be supportive of the idea that tonight's session be extended for a half an hour, or an hour, to include that.  That would allow us to dispose of the business on one evening.  Last week's debate proved that point as did the previous debate in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reiterate, a Chathaoirligh, the point made last week on Wednesday that the letter which issued was not satisfactory to this group, as I outlined to you. It would be our view that the matter should be dealt with at another stage.  I regret the fact that Senator Manning found it necessary to refer to the reported allegations here last Thursday morning. We certainly feel they should be dealt <Col N="1905" /> with in this Chamber if they need to be dealt with anywhere.  Certainly if they are to be dealt with somewhere else they should be raised somewhere else.  We feel the points made can be substantiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear here.  Senator Manning suggested that there would be an additional half hour this evening and that that would conclude the business.  He seemed to imply that from there on Private Members' time would be two hours, and that it would end there.  That might present a problem to the Labour Party because of our numbers. As you know, at the moment we have only an hour and a half.  Is he suggesting that we should equate it all now and that all of us should have two hours? In the hour and a half there is a proposer and time for replying, but generally speaking there is not much scope for debate, whereas if it is included in the other half hour we would be all in favour of the two hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity for the leaders of the different groups to make statements on the release of Nelson Mandela.  I also welcome the fact that there will be an opportunity for the rest of us to make our contributions subsequently.</P>
      <P>Some difficulties about last week's debate have been raised by the leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Maurice Manning.  Although certain elements of the letter that you very courteously distributed to us were interesting, informative and valuable in terms of debate, there were some elements that increased my anxiety, one being the comparison between the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach, because they are actually different and the letter was helpful in highlighting that difference for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given you considerable latitude but you tend to range into uncharted waters as far as I am concerned, so I would ask you to keep to the specifics of the Order of Business, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1906" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly do that in deference to your exalted role.  I would have to say, of course, that the latitude you afford me is significantly less than the latitude afforded to the Leader of the Opposition, but of course he is a more considerable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Discipline is more essential in your case, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that that necessity has been indicated here this afternoon.  I have done my best to remain within the bounds of politeness, courtesy and the rules of the House.  Having accepted your ruling, I will simply have to find other methods of continuing the intellectual part of the debate which I think is very important.  I will, in deference to your ruling and to show that I have the best interests of the House at heart, continue with the principal point that I wish to make at the moment.</P>
      <P>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that item No. 30 be taken first in view of the Government's continuing and flagrant contempt for the European Court of Human Rights in this instance.  The very astonishing fact is that they appear to be in a hurry to amend other legislation in this country as a result of decisions of considerably lower courts, domestically.  We are not prepared to accept international law, but we are prepared to give priority to much lesser matters. Therefore, I propose: &ldquo;That item No. 30 be taken before item No. 1.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is one further point I would like to make.  I intend on every day I come into this House, until I receive a satisfactory reply, to place this item on the Order of Business and call a vote upon it in order to highlight the discrepancies in Government attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may respond to what Senator Harte said by way of clarifying what Senator Manning suggested &mdash; we were hoping that the Leader of the House might consider two hours Private Members' time this evening and then regularise it on a formal basis from there on.  Of course, we would be expecting <Col N="1907" /> reasonable time for all different groups in the Opposition.</P>
      <P>In relation to the brief discussion this afternoon on South Africa, all of us, of course, welcomed the great news over the weekend of the release of Mandela. We will welcome, indeed, a more comprehensive debate next Thursday, if it so happens.  This issue brings to mind again the urgent necessity for an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.  We have had many such issues.  I request, through the Cathaoirleach, that perhaps the Leader of the House would bring that up again with his relevant colleagues in the different parties to see if we could make progress on this most important issue.</P>
      <P>The Horse Breeding Bill was mentioned by the Leader of the House as being likely to be ordered for tomorrow. May I at this stage, before it is formally ordered, in the morning on the Order of Business request the Leader of the House to speak to the powers that be in the Department of Agriculture and Food to see if this Bill could go before the Horse Advisory Committee that was constituted before Christmas?  They know nothing of what we are doing here in the Seanad, or what we propose to do on Wednesday &mdash; which is to abolish the licensing of stallions &mdash; and were quite surprised that this should be coming up without any reference to them.  The Government have set up this group.  Even if we just put a hold on this legislation until they have a chance to look at it, it would be courteous if nothing else.  I would like the Leader to look into that.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to give notice that I hope to raise under Standing Order 29 the critical problems caused to all sectors, rural and urban, by the recent storms on our coastline and inland, the lack of Government response of any kind and the totally inadequate moneys being offered by Brussels by way of emergency funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second Senator Norris's amendment to the Order of Business.  Perhaps the Leader <Col N="1908" /> of the House could help us not to press this by giving us a concrete reply on this particular issue, on what the Government are going to do about the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>For reasons beyond my control I was not here last Thursday, so if I am repeating a question which has already been answered perhaps the House will forgive me and indulge me for one second.  My understanding, in the brief period I was here last Wednesday &mdash; and it was very brief &mdash; was that a question was asked of the Leader of the House and was allowed by you, Sir, about what the Government are doing about the abolition of hanging. My understanding was that the Leader of the House stated when I was here that he would come back with a reply from the Taoiseach the next day.  I do not honestly know whether he did come back with the reply the next day because I was not here, and I have not had a script of what happened, so maybe he could reply to that today.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to touch on the issues which have been raised by others about the role of the Cathaoirleach.  In order to take the sting out of what appeared to be becoming a particularly divisive, and maybe a personal battle in this House, I put down a motion yesterday on the role of the Office of the Cathaoirleach so that it could be fully discussed in this House by all parties in a non-partisan and impersonal manner.  I regret, Sir, that you have sent me a letter stating that that is contrary to Standing Orders.  It is wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you will resume your seat while I explain to you that my letter contains the reason your motion could not be put before the House.  If you wish to discuss the matter in greater detail with me I am giving you an invitation to come to my office after the Order of Business and I will give you further details as to the reason for my judgment.  Otherwise, any continuance by you on this matter will be in contravention of rulings that I will be forced to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1909" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for your invitation to discuss this with you in private. I shall, of course, accept that invitation. It would be churlish of me not to do so, but it raises a larger issue for this House which is that all matters of public interest should be discussed in public&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained why I have taken a decision in relation to that particular motion.  I have offered an invitation to you to discuss it further.  You are persisting in discussing it here in the House in contravention of all the Standing Orders, rulings and precedents that are attached and have been established to ensure good order in this House. I must ask the Senator to desist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly accept your invitation.  I just make the plea that in future we can discuss these things in public.  I welcome the decision by the Leader of the House to launch a debate on the release of Nelson Mandela which, I hope, is an indication of the possibility that this House will be in a position to discuss topical issues immediately.  We should be able on such issues both international and local, to take them on the day and not postpone them.  I welcome the Leader of the House giving us that opportunity to discuss this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the point made by Senator Doyle in calling on the Government to look into the question of setting up a committee on foreign affairs.  I do so for one or two simple reasons.  We have in this House a committee concerned with Secondary Legislation of the European Community. It is not a foreign affairs committee.  It is not a policy-discussing committee.  It is merely a reactive committee, discussing secondary legislation.  Also, today in Europe major events are happening. There are events in central Europe and in eastern Europe that bring a wider dimension to the current debate in Europe than simply the European munity.  We have the eastern European issue: we have the issue of East and West <Col N="1910" /> Germany; we have the Czechoslovak issue as well as the Hungarian situation. We have the Central American issues in which there is Irish Oireachtas concern. We have the African question.  It is past time that the Houses of this Oireachtas formed such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I give notice of raising an urgent matter under section 29 of the Standing Orders, that matter being the widespread hurt and concern expressed by all members of VECs at remarks made in the media by a Member of the other House relating to the appointment of teachers by Vocational Education Committee. As a member of the Standing Council of the Irish Vocational Education Association, as a member of a VEC and, indeed, as a vocational school teacher, I take great exception to the remarks passed.  It is a slur on the system of education that has served this country well down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, you have made your point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the person who made those remarks should have concern in the first instance for the system of education that he went through and tried to do something about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Doyle in drawing to the attention of the House the matter of the storm damage.  It is of very serious proportions and has grave economic implications for the lives of the people in the affected areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We can not allow a discussion on that.  The Senator can put down a motion on that matter.  There is a tendency, even where there is latitude given, for people to wander quite some distance from what we expect of one another here in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion I should like the House to note with regret the premature passing of the late Harold McCusker, MP.  He was a doughty Ulsterman who was beginning to react in a typically realistic way to the dilemma in which he saw his people put and his work in the task force gave some indication of the future that lay ahead.  Those of us who came to know him in the British-Irish Association and elsewhere realised that he would, indeed, make a great contribution to the inevitable task of North-South accommodation and Anglo-Irish reconciliation.  His passing diminishes the parliamentary life in these islands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for making time available at 4 p.m. today to discuss the Nelson Mandela issue.  As you know, many local authorities throughout the country have honoured Nelson Mandela, including Dublin.  It was reported yesterday in the media that he was extremely moved by those honours, and he has said that on his release.  In view of the fact that Ireland has a very crucial role to play in the promotion of peace, justice and human rights particularly at this time, it would be important that we have that extensive debate next Thursday to discuss all these issues.  There are many relevant issues regarding this question which need to be tackled now and it is important that we have that debate on Thursday next and also the statements this evening.  I would like to thank the Leader of the House for taking the statements this evening.</P>

      <P>Tá súil agam nár labhair an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil mar gheall air seo go fóill, inniu.  Is mian liom ceist seo <Col N="1912" /> an chórais aistriúcháin comhaimsearthaigh i d'Teach Laighean a tharraingt anuas arís, go háirithe i dtaca leis an easpa dul chun cinn atá le sonrú ann. Tá an-chuid Ball sa Teach seo a bheadh toilteanach agus sásta labhairt i nGaeilge ach gur feasach dóibh nach dtuigfí a ndéarfadh siad.  Fiafraím arís de Cheannasaí an Tí ar tharla aon ní nó an dtarlóidh aon ní chun an fhadhb seo a réiteach?  Cad atá beartaithe ag an Rialtas a dhéanamh chun freastal ar an éileamh mór seo?</P>
      <P>I am not going to refer to the affairs of last week.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House to consider what appears to be a revolutionary idea in this House which is that instead of perpetually looking for joint committees this House should start setting up its own committees. In terms of the Order of Business it is becoming apparent that the function of Parliament in this democracy is far less vibrant and far less forceful than it is in most of the so-called new democracies of eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House to consider the question of setting up committees of this House to consider, discuss and receive representations from various groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, in respect of what Senator Doyle said about groups who were not <Col N="1913" /> adequately aware of the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is wrong to blame the Oireachtas for that.  There is a tendency not to believe that the Oireachtas does any work.  The Oireachtas does work that affects every single citizen of this land and it would well behove all interests groups to take a lot more interest in the Oireachtas and less interest in what is written in the media about the Oireachtas.  Much important work carried out in the Houses of the Oireachtas goes unreported and uncovered.  Interest groups would be well advised to keep an eye on what happens in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A lot of things happen that ultimately have an enormous effect on people's lives about which they do not know about until they are personally confronted with them.</P>

Beidh mise ag labhairt i nGaeilge ar feadh leathuair a chloig anocht mar gheall ar bhóithre Chonamara agus gan duine ar bith ag tabhairt aird orm, idir iriseoirí agus eile, seachas uimhir bheag daoine ar an dá thaobh.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh siadsan isteach liom.  Is é is cúis imní dom, áfach, ná nach bhfuil mo chearta bunreachtúla á fáil agam, mar a deirim, ag gach cruinniú agus mar a leanfaidh mé orm ag rá, gach seachtain go dtí go dtagann athrú ar an scéal.  Fógraím anois go mbeidh sé ina raic, muna mbíonn córas aistriúcháin ar fáil sa Teach seo faoi Cháisc.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist seo an chórais aistriúcháin dá tarraingt anuas 'chuile sheachtain agus ní thig liom geallúint a thabhairt don Seanadóir ná don Teach go mbeidh an córas aistriúcháin insealbhaithe faoi Cháisc nó ina dhiaidh.  Bhí mé i dteagmháil, maidir leis an gceist, leis an Taoiseach, leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Máire Geoghegan-Quinn agus leis an Teachta David Andrews atá ina chathaoirleach ar an chomhchoiste don <Col N="1914" /> Ghaeilge.  Labhair mé le mó ghrúpa féin, freisin, agus leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Pat &lsquo;The Cope&rsquo; Gallagher, ina thaobh. Beidh an cheist ar chlár an Choiste um Imeachtaí agus Pribhléidí anocht, agus ní thig liom rud ar bith eile a rá ina thaobh inniu.</P>
      <P>It is not my job to make a decision as to whether changes should take place in regard to Committees of this House or Joint Committees; it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I am sure that matter will be raised when the matter of changes in the House is discussed by that committee.</P>
      <P>Senator Staunton asked a question in connection with a foreign affairs committee. This is a matter which has been raised here on numerous occasions.  The Government have not set up a joint foreign affairs committee.  I am sure the matter will be raised again with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I would say, however, we have not balked from having discussions in this House on matter relating to foreign affairs.  There have been more discussions in this House on matters of current interest in foreign affairs than there has been in the other House.  We have had co-operation in this matter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and we are getting a reasonable run at that.</P>
      <P>I meant to answer as a matter of courtesy to the House the question on the Bill relating to the abolition of hanging but, since it was raised as a straight question, I can say that this Bill is very far advanced.  As to the question of whether it will go through in this session of Parliament, I would say that matter will be before the Dáil and Seanad within the next month.  I would not like to say two weeks but I guarantee the matter will be brought before the Oireachtas within the next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item No. 30 will not be ordered for today.  I am afraid I cannot accede to the request for a two hour debate on Private Members' time this evening for a very technical reason in that we had asked the Minister to come in at the end of the debate next Wednesday evening and I cannot suggest that at this stage because I have not discussed with the Minister <Col N="1915" /> whether that would be possible. Obviously, it is not a matter of contention. Of course, there is a very good reason why it would be better for the Opposition side to have this go through because it would cut this side out of debate.  They would get in more often in a longer debate which, I presume, would possibly be anti-Government, or maybe not.  It might not have entered the Opposition's heads, but in principle it is better to have a three hour debate rather than split it into two debates of one-and-a-half hours' duration.  Technically, this evening we will go to 8 p.m.  If we can go on to 8.30 p.m. and conclude it, well and good; but, if it cannot be arranged with the Minister in between, we will have to take that next week.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the Horse Breeding Bill and the request by Senator Doyle that the Horse Advisory Council should have a part to play in this Bill.  We are commencing Second Stage debate on that Bill tomorrow.  I would suggest that, between Second Stage and Committee Stage there will be plenty of time to have discussions with that body.  They have seen the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Second Stage is being moved tomorrow and, obviously, will not be concluded tomorrow evening, so there will be plenty of time.  We are having a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies who are looking into the matter of the horse industry as a whole.  I agree it is a matter into which the Horse Advisory Council should have an input.  I can discuss it with the Minister and I am sure that, between the introduction tomorrow and the conclusion of that, the Horse Advisory Council will have time enough.</P>

    <Title>Marine Institute Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur arís roimh an Aire agus na daoine ó Roinn na Mara.</P>
      <P>I will start where I left off on the last occasion, a Chathaoirligh, and that is that the proposal to establish a Marine Institute is indeed to be welcomed, as well as the obvious requirement for research into fisheries which are of great importance to us at this point, the quality of water, etc., and other research of a scientific nature.  Research is also needed in new materials, machinery and vessel design, in the fishing, commercial and leisure areas.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the leisure side of it for a moment &mdash; even though from what I know of it I would not call it &ldquo;leisure&rdquo; where they are just now &mdash; I would like to place on record my congratulations to Ron Holland and all those involved in <i>NCB Ireland</i> who are carrying the banner and the flag of this small nation around the world.  While other nations have been in the Whitbread around the World Race since its initiation and have gained massive experience from other races, we are relatively new to such an event.  Joe English, the skipper, and all his crew have taken on the world in this event and, as far as I am concerned, even if they finish last, to me they are winners because they have dared and tried and they have given a warning to all that they are a force to be reckoned with in the future.</P>
      <P>The design of yachts and boats is an important part of the industry at which the Institute, when set up, could take a deep look because of a complete lack of knowledge in boat design.  To our credit in Kerry, Tralee Regional Technical College is going some way towards rectifying the latter problem by the provision of a national certificate in boat technology and production.  This certificate course operates over a two year period, with an intake of students every two years.  There are eight graduates from the first intake of students and there are currently eight studying in the second year of the second intake of students.  These students are finishing off the construction of a revolutionary 25-foot yacht designed by the course director, Leonard J. Brewood. Leonard himself is a great ocean-going man, who is also part-time skipper captain of the <i>Asgard.</i>  The students are working on design projects consisting of a 65-foot passenger catamaran, the conversion of a trawler to an &ldquo;emigrant ship&rdquo; which will be used in the Blennerville Cultural Heritage Centre, and a fish farming vessel for mussel harvesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the course content is providing a good mix of subjects, that is, 60 per cent of naval architecture and related subjects and 40 per cent business, finance and office procedure, to suit the needs of the industry, it is difficult without the back-up of a body such as the Institute to make much of an impression on the industry.  The Institute would give authority to the need for technicians with design skills by the organisation of seminars and the dissemmation of literature. In order to make full use of modern materials and modern design for passenger vessels, such as catamarans, it is necessary for the Institute to examine and make recommendations for the enactment of new regulations to replace outdated Acts.  If possible, the Institute should instigate research into the design of small harbours, such as the marina <Col N="1919" /> type, to fully develop the potential of Ireland's coast.  The west coast, for example, is the greatest potential sailing area in Europe and the provision of small harbours of the marina type would greatly assist the sea-angling business on the west coast.  The former and present Ministers for the Marine and the Government have taken great steps towards this end but we are basically groping in the dark without a proper marine institute, so that the necessary research and planning can be carried out well in advance.</P>
    <P>I suppose people would say I was talking through my hat if I said that, historically, we do not have a good record in relation to the sea and fishing, with the notable exception of St. Brendan, the Navigator, who actually started in Brandon Creek in the Dingle Peninsula to go to find a new world&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody ever left Wexford like that.  Of course, there was John Barry.  Saint Brendan started off from Brandon Creek in the Dingle Peninsula to find a new world in a small boat about 30 foot long made of ox hide and tied together with leather thongs.  His little boat was a far cry from the <i>Nina</i>, and the <i>Pinta</i> and the <i>Sancta Maria</i> in which Christopher Columbas set sail in to find a new world.  My point here is that the Spanish, French, and Portuguese were all fishing off the west coast of Ireland three centuries ago while we were still inshore fishermen with small boats like the coracle, the naomhóg, the seine-boat and, I suppose, the Galway hooker.  They seldom ventured out more than 20 or 30 miles from the shore, while other countries were developing and going further and further afield and were venturing possibly 400 or 500 miles from their own shores. As a result they have over the centuries gained a knowledge of the west coast of Ireland, a knowledge which is still very new to us.  To illustrate my point I would like to quote from Tomás Ó Criothain's book <i>An tOileánach</i>, and I am sure you are all familiar with this.  At the time <Col N="1920" /> Tomás was writing his book lobsters were unknown to the people of the Blasket Islands.  To prove this I will quote from <i>The Island Man</i> on page 153:</P>
      <P>A day or two after this I went up the hill to fetch a load of turf and what should I see but this very canoe, I thought, down below me, full of some objects which they were throwing into the sea.  The things I had seen them throwing into the sea were pots to catch lobsters.  The Blasket people were as strange to that sort of fishing tackle as any bank clerk at that time.  Not much of the year had gone before there were four Dingle canoes fishing lobsters around the Blasket Islands after this fashion.  The Dingle fisherman took hundreds of pounds worth of lobsters from the waters around the island before we had any notion how to make a shilling out of them.  They fetched one pound a dozen and, to make the story better, the dozen was easily got.</P>
      <P>My father used to say: Slán beo leis an sean aimsir.  Things have definitely changed since then.  If you were to fish around the Blasket Islands today in the same manner as the islanders fished, the number of lobster and crawfish would be few and far between.</P>
      <P>Crawfish are another species of shellfish around the west and the south-west coast, which, again, was relatively unknown until the late 1940s when French fishermen were seen fishing for them off the west coast of Ireland.  We then made an attempt at copying the French people and to this very day the actual pot being used for catching crawfish &mdash; I am saying &ldquo;crawfish&rdquo; because there is a subtle difference between a crawfish and a crayfish, a crawfish is a salt water shellfish, whereas a crayfish is a fresh water shellfish &mdash; is still called the French barrel pot, because the first crawfish pots that were fished around the Dingle Peninsula were got from French boats who were fishing there at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to today's world, the number of lobsters and crawfish to be got in the south coast and west coast of Ireland today has greatly dwindled.  This <Col N="1921" /> is where research is now needed.  The recent discovery that the Continental Shelf is extending out to 700 kilometers west of our coast, that is directly off the west coast of Ireland, has opened up a great ocean of wealth to the Irish fishermen providing proper research is carried out.  Fishermen from time to time have found while fishing in the Porcupine Bank a large number of crawfish in depths of water in excess of 100 fathoms or more but they have neither the resources nor the time to exploit these fisheries.  Again, this is where the Marine Institute and research could be of immense value not alone to the fishermen but to this country.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of other migratory shoaling fish, off the west coast of Ireland in summer time within easy reach of Irish fishermen.  In recent times the fishermen have turned their eyes towards tuna fishing. As of yet I do not know of any Irish fishing boats that have gone out on a full-scale to try and catch tuna.  Only last year the shoals of tuna came so close to our shores that there was an excess of 50 foreign tuna boats sheltering in Castle-townbere during bad weather.  This must only mean that within 50 to 100 miles off our shores they were fishing for tuna fish. The big advantage of tuna fishing is that it is a non-quota species.  It is also a very large fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they catch any dolphins with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we keep the dolphins in Dingle.  It is a very big fish.  It is not unlike the dolphin as a matter of fact; it is a distant relation maybe.  It fetches a very high price.  The tuna fish weighs anything from 700 or 800 pound up to 1,200 or 1,300 pounds weight so that, in effect, from a monetary point of view a fisherman who can catch 15 or 20 tuna fish in the week would have a good week's fishing.  Very little is known in Ireland about the tuna fish other than the stories I have heard from fishermen who go out to the Continental Shelf from the Porcupine Bank to fish for prawns in summer time.  There they see the large fleets of foreign boats fishing for tuna.  I believe <Col N="1922" /> the tuna fish stop shoaling as far down as the Azores and they follow the Gulf Stream right up past our coast.  If we had proper fisheries for tuna our fishermen would have a good three months in the summer; with proper methods and knowhow they would have a very lucrative industry indeed.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many Senators have read cowboy books written by the famous author, Zane Grey.  He spent his life studying the tuna fish and he has written many books about the matter.  The person who gave me that information was none other than Derek Davis, the RTE presenter.  Derek spent about three weeks off the Dingle Peninsula trying to catch tuna as a game fish.  I have yet to find the book but I hope to trace it.  Tuna fishing would be one of the most exciting fisheries for exploitation in the future by our Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, many other non-quota species of fish like the argentine, blue whiting, scad or horse mackerel, which is a very coarse fish.  It is a very bony fish but in the Japanese market it is a very expensive item.  On the Japanse table it is a delicacy.  Last year fishermen off the north-west coast of Ireland, landed something in the region of 36,000 tonnes of scad.  That fish or the horse mackerel is still a non-quota species in Ireland but I am afraid the day will come when quotas will be brought in for these fish.</P>
      <P>It is time now to urge our fishermen to fish for and land as much as they possibly can of scad so that when quotas are brought in on scad our quota will be based on our catches of the previous year or years.  If we happen to have a low catch in the previous year then there is no chance of expanding this fisheries because we will again be caught in the quota system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blue whiting is another species which is non-quota.  Large tonnages of blue whiting have been and are being caught but, unfortunately, the price of blue whiting is very low because it goes mainly for fishmeal.  With proper market and research these fish could be exported to countries where they are treated as an <Col N="1923" /> edible species.  There are two countries I know of whose people eat blue whiting on a regular basis and where the price is far higher than the fishermen get for it here for fishmeal.</P>
    <P>The argentine is another non-quota fish that has been caught in hundreds of tonnes on the Continental Shelf and the Porcupine Bank.  This has been done successfully over the past two years but, unfortunately, the fishermen had not got the back-up service or the proper research.  The argentine is a fish that is found in very deep water and that species shoal much the same as mackerel.  Argentines shoal in depths in excess of 100 fathoms.  In their body there is a little sack of air and when they are caught in such huge numbers, anything up to 600 or 700 tonnes at a time in a net, and if they are brought to the surface too quickly two things can happen.  When the fish come up from the bottom too fast the sack of air expands so the volume of fish in the net expands on reaching the surface and they just burst the nets and destroy the gear.  If a fisherman is successful in getting the fish to the surface the sack of air within the body of the fish bursts.  The quantity of fish he would have in his net would be 600, 700, 800 or maybe even a 1,000 tonne of fish.  These fish then become absolute deadweight the same as lead and they sink.  This happened in one of the fishing boats in Killybegs and the boat began to capsize.  The weight of fish was so great that the wires holding the nets pulled the winches out of the boat. The fishermen were very lucky this happened because if it did not the boat would have turned over and lives would have been lost.  There is a clear need for research.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has put the first cog in the wheel by introducing this Bill here.  Hopefully the Bill will get a reasonably speedy passage through this House and through the Dáil and in a couple of months people with proper knowledge of what I am talking about will be on these boards.  Then we will go places with our fishing industry.  We know very little about that industry, about the <Col N="1924" /> species of fish and about the processing of fish.  Senators will probably laugh again at this, but what people buy in cans such as sardines, kippers and so on, are put into these cans in a raw state and it is only when the can is sealed that they are cooked in the can.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For this reason the quality of the fish that goes into the can must be of top quality.  All during the summer around our coasts there are hundreds of thousands of tonnes of sprat, the same thing as kippers, sardines and so on, and there is a big market for them.  I know one buyer who can get an order as high as 50,000 tonnes in one country for sprat.</P>
      <P>The problem is that when the sprat comes around our coast in the summer and the weather is fine to catch them there is a problem because they are feeding and their stomachs are full.  In other countries they have developed a method whereby they go out to fish spart with a ring net.  They ring their nets around the shoal of sprat and leave them there for a few days.  The fish can swim freely within the net but they cannot feed.  After one or two days their stomachs are empty and they can be caught live from the net, brought inshore and sold as top quality fish ready for canning.  If the fish had been caught with the food in their stomachs and were sent off to the canning factory, canned and then cooked, I am afraid they would not be nice tasty fish to eat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know nothing about the processing of fish and the methods other countries use.  Since about 1950 the State has put large sums of money into the fishing industry.  They provided grants for boats for fishermen, they provided finance for <Col N="1926" /> boats by way of loans, but then the fishermen were left to make their own way. The fishermen who were initially grant-aided and funded by the State for boats at that time, probably 40 to 50 foot boats, had only graduated from the currach, the naomhóg or the half-decker.  They knew the sea and they knew how to fish, but they knew very little else.</P>
    <P>In the early days they took on investments, possibly £18,000 to £50,000 and immediately they had to become not alone a fisherman but they had to become navigators and they had to understand charts without any education whatsoever. They had to be engineers to look after the boat engine, they had to be able to operate radios, they had to learn to use radar and all the other electronics that are installed in boats.  They had to learn all these skills to become good fishermen. But then there was another problem. When they landed their fish they then had to become marketing managers to try to find a proper market for their fish and, as well as that, they had to become accountants, and in a lot of cases it was the wife at home who was the accountant and manager.  It is fair to say that the bulk of fishermen &mdash; I am not in any way downgrading them; I am one of them &mdash; never had anything better than second level education simply because those were the times that were in it.  I know they have changed now and things are different.  They left school at an early age, they went fishing with their fathers, uncles or neighbours and they graduated from that to the bigger boats.</P>
    <P>These people are a very hardy, rate breed.  It is all right when you are on dry land.  Those of you who have never gone out for a week's fishing or for even a day's fishing, except when the weather was fine and you went out to do a bit of angling, do not realise what fishermen have to contend with.  When fishermen fish off the Blasket Island or the west coast of Ireland in the middle of winter, with anything up to gale force winds blowing, you would be quite comfortable inside your homes and perhaps have not a thought for the fishermen who are out there trying to make a living.  The criticism that has <Col N="1927" /> been levelled on fishermen over the years for getting so-called handouts from the State is unfair and untrue.  The powers that be on shore are doing their best, but unfortunately finance is missing and, what we are talking about here today, proper research.</P>
    <P>When we compare agriculture and fishing, we find in nearly every small village or town in Ireland there is an agricultural adviser.  Within 30 or 40 miles of where you live you can go to ACOT or, in the past, to the country committee of agriculture and you can get all the advice you want, but a fisherman is out there on the west coast of Ireland and he has nowhere close to him to turn to for advice.  He can get in contact with Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the Department of the Marine, but they are miles away and no structure is set up whereby a fisherman can be advised on what to do.  On his own boat he has to be the engineer, he has to see that the engine of his boat is all right and he has to be able to look after a whole lot of expensive complicated equipment. This has changed slightly in recent times.</P>
    <P>As the years progressed the National Fisheries School was opened in Green-castle. There is no doubt that the young fishermen who went there got a great education and knowledge of fishing.  They came out from that school with certificates of competency on all aspects of fishing, nautical education, vessel maintenance, net mending and so on, but they were not taught management skills.  When they left the National Fisheries School they were then quite competent to get their own boats, but they had no financial backup to buy those boats.  I am talking about young men aged 21 to 25.  They are not rich people; they have not got hundreds of thousands of pounds in the bank.</P>
    <P>This is one place where we have failed and where other countries in Europe have come up trumps.  In Scotland, for instance, fish buyers and the fish catchers co-ordinate in one catching unit.  The fish buyers put up the money in a special arrangement for the boats and the fishermen fish the boats.  This is a great <Col N="1928" /> arrangement because, from the fisher-man's side of it, if the price is too low he can hit his partner and say &ldquo;You are not doing enough&rdquo; and &ldquo;you are not getting the proper market&rdquo;.  From the fish buyers side of it, he can hit the fishermen and say, &ldquo;You are tied to the pier all day. Why do you not get out there?  You are not bringing in enough fish&rdquo;.  This is one of the best partnerships that I can see in the fishing industry.  Why should fish buyers not invest in fishing boats and why do we not attract them?  If that were to happen here the unfortunate thing about it is that, to my knowledge, we would not recognise them for grant aid.  I might be wrong, but I do not think I am.</P>
    <P>In Spain companies are formed by the fishermen.  I have gone to Spain and checked it out.  They then go to the bank to borrow money.  One of the stipulations of the bank giving them money is that a high ranking person in the bank will then be nominated as a paid director in that company to ensure that the boats are out fishing, that the accounts are right and that everything is in order.</P>
    <P>In spite of all my criticism there have been many successful fishermen most notably a Mayo man &mdash; I am sure the House will have heard of him &mdash; Kevin McHugh &mdash; who is the proud owner of the <i>Veronica</i> and more recently the <i>Genesus.</i> The <i>Veronica</i>, a factory fishing boat, employs up to 50 people.  To my knowledge she is the biggest privately-owned factory fishing boat in Europe.  I remember Kevin McHugh when he started out at about 21 years of age&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He is without doubt an example to all of us.  He is not alone, as there are several others.  When the Marine Institute is formed it must take a long hard look at the financing of the fishing industry and must look to onshore investors to invest money in fishing.  That investment is there at the moment in mariculture, in salmon and in mussel farming.  I must strike a small word of warning here.  We should not go too far <Col N="1929" /> too fast in mariculture without doing a lot more research.  Weather such as that experienced in the past few weeks could wipe out mariculture overnight.  In my own area &mdash; is docha go bhfuil aithne ag an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil agus an Seanadóir Murphy ar an áit &mdash; in Ventry mussel farming started about two years ago but storms over the past few weeks have left them with practically nothing. They are almost wiped out.  This is the reason we should tread carefully with mariculture.  If I were to advise on fisheries at this point I would bring in and enforce &mdash; I really mean enforce and I am hitting myself and my friends in this &mdash; stricter quality control measures because it is a fact that even though we have the best fish around our coasts we are at the bottom of the list in European markets both in quality and price.</P>
      <P>The other investment I would make is in fish processing and added value to our fish export trade, thereby creating jobs and getting our employment figures down.  To do this and to be competitive in foreign markets we must have two essential ingredients.  The first I have stated already, that is quality, proper care and proper handling of fish.  The second is continuity of supply.  If we have not continuity it is no good setting up a processing factory somewhere, where you have a supply of fish coming in for three months of the summer and for the rest of the year you have nothing.  We must have continuity of supply.  I maintain that at this point perhaps in Killybegs or Castle-townbere you might get continuity but around the rest of the coast I do not think that is the case.  The reason is our boats are too small.  They are still inshore boats which are not capable of fishing in inclement weather and most of them are only day trippers.  They leave in the morning at four or five o'clock and they are back in the evening at 10 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need another 100 boats up to 100 feet in length.  I do not know how this can be brought about but other countries have decommissioned the small boats and the obsolete boats.  Perhaps it can be brought about in this way, but it is for the Department of the Marine and the <Col N="1930" /> Institute when set up to look into this because we are going down a blind alley if we start building processing plants and we have not the supply to keep these processing plants going.  We need a good fleet of an extra 100 boats in the 100 foot range capable of fishing for at least 40 to 45 weeks of the year &mdash; the average trawler of 45, 50 or 60 feet is limited to fishing for only about 32 to 35 weeks of the year. These boats I am referring to must be capable of staying out for six to ten days at a time until they have their boats filled. Only when we build up the fleet in that way can the processing of fish be a success.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there is a vast ocean out there and we should now make a fresh start to tap that wealth.  The wealth we can get from the sea is absolutely limitless.  With modern technology we can and will in the future be able to harness the sea to give us energy through wave power.  The United States has a very big problem with inhabited islands that come under their jurisdiction and there is no available fresh water on these islands.  The US has to deliver tanker boats with fresh water to these islands on a regular basis.  Only recently have they installed desalination pumps on these islands where they can now extract salt from the water.  It comes out in a proportion of 40 per cent pure fresh water full of all the vitamins &mdash; it is far fresher and far cleaner than anything we can get on land &mdash; and 60 per cent salt.  If we run out of fresh water and we pollute our inland waterways we can turn to the sea.</P>
    <P>We must be forever watchful of the way we treat the seas.  In our modern world pollution of the seas is a great threat.  I said before in this House, and I will say again today, we are very lucky that oil floats on the surface of the sea because if it sank to the ocean bed all sea-life would be dead now.  We must also embark on educating our school-going population.  Perhaps our treatment of the seas should be brought in as part of the school curriculum.  We are an island nation and there is nothing taught in our national, secondary or third level schools about the sea around us.  Students know <Col N="1931" /> where it is but they are not told about the wealth that can be got from the sea, they are not told about fishing, how the fishing industry works, how it should work.  They hardly know where the sea is, other than to look out at it.  We need to educate our young people on matters relating to the seas.  We are an island nation and we will have to educate the young population accordingly.</P>
    <P>I must give a special word of praise to the Central Fisheries Board who have produced some beautiful films and videos on fish life. They show the harm pollution is doing and how it can be prevented. They show the life cycle of the Atlantic salmon from the time it leaves our rivers until it returns again.  It is an amazing story the way the salmon leaves our rivers, travels thousands of miles through oceans, returns a couple of years later to the very same stream and starts the whole process all over again.  I got videos from the Central Fisheries Board and gave them to the two secondary schools in Dingle and within a week I had a request whether I could find more of these films.  They generated great interest and I recommend them to Senators.  Full marks to everybody involved in the making of these videos and to the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again the need for strict quality control.  The trouble is that, unlike meat, from the time fish is caught it starts to deteriorate, the value decreases and it starts to go bad.  The story is different with meat; in fact, it is the reverse.  Meat can improve over a period of time.  There are ice plants in most of the fishing ports around Ireland but up to a couple of years ago those ice plants were not profitable.  The reason was that my friends, the fishermen, were not taking ice on board and were not looking after their fish in the proper way. This is where I must emphasise to the Minister and to the Institute the importance of having the laws enforced.  If they were enforced tomorrow morning and there was a regular check-up of the boats to make sure the right amount of ice was <Col N="1932" /> on board and that fish were being handled properly, I would guarantee that the price of Irish fish would almost double the next morning.</P>
    <P>There are exciting times ahead in the fishing industry.  I always regarded the fishing industry as being the poor relation of agriculture.  Everything seemed to be put into agriculture.  As I said before, they had advice centres and every facility. Fishermen were given their boats and that was the end of it.  However, in the past two or three years there has been a complete change and a different emphasis. The Department of the Marine was set up and over the past two or three years the Department have a new enthusiasm towards the fishing industry.  They have shaken the cobwebs and the dust off the old Department of Fisheries.  There are good, sound, solid young people in the Department of the Marine and we are going places.  With the new Department of the Marine, the Minister and the Minister of State and the proper people in the Marine Institute, in the next two or three years great things will happen in the fishing industry.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to believe Senator Fitzgerald's optimism in his concluding sentences will be justified in the course of time.  I have to say, first, that if this is a welcomed Bill, and I welcome it with a lot of reservations, it is about high time it was brought into the House.  The phrase &ldquo;más maith is mithid&rdquo; was never more appropriate in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is very late in coming before us.  It is late in the long-term historical perspective when you think that long before Independence our nationalist philosophers and economists believed an independent Ireland would be a prosperous Ireland and would be a prosperous Ireland because it would be in charge of its own resources and among those resources were foremost the land and the sea.  This was a basic article of faith stretching back as far as the early 18th century because the lineage of economic nationalism goes back to Bishop <Col N="1933" /> Berkeley in his Querist in 1752 and, indeed, to his contemporary, Dean Swift. All of them believed in one of Berkeley's famous phrases that you could build a wall of brass around this island and it would prosper on its internal resources. Down to Arthur Griffith expounding the need for economic independence, we had this doctrine that a free Ireland would maximise its potential in terms of its agriculture and its fisheries.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless a free Ireland was very slow in paying any attention to these vital resources.  It is an extraordinary thing that with a resource like forests, the afforestation of the country was again retarded.  It could have been undertaken in the early years of the State.  In fact, it was not so undertaken, as we know, until, let us say, the 1940s and the 1950s.  Fisheries and the whole marine resource is an even more delayed area, in spite of the fact that in our own time a distinguished authority such as John de Courcy Ireland has been reminding us for decades now of how neglected are our marine dimensions.</P>
    <P>We should have moved much earlier on this and on related matters.  We should have moved to develop, protect and encourage research in our marine resources when we had the power to do so, when we had the sovereignty over the sea which, alas, we no longer have.  I am not so sure that we have made a good deal in that respect.  We are now moving at the 11th hour, when we no longer control our seas.</P>
    <P>In the long term, this Bill is a very belated measure set against the large historical context but in the short term that is also true.  The Government and the Department have been very slow to move on this Bill since it was first mooted. Although Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Ó Foighil spoke from first-hand experience, there is another whole range of genuine interest in this Bill apart from the very worthy and primary interest of the fishermen and that is the interest of scientists, marine engineers, geologists and so on, all of whom are waiting for a long time for this Bill.  They are disappointed it has taken so long in coming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> From time to time we hear about how delays in certain enterprises might jeopardise our chance of Community funding and I am afraid this may be the case here as well, that there are opportunities waiting for us in Community terms, that we will not be able to avail of until this institute is up and running.  Under Community auspices, the Marine Science Research Programme, MAST, has recently awarded research contracts under its first phase.  There is an amount of funding available under the heading &ldquo;Supporting Initiatives&rdquo; to this programme which is earmarked for a number of tasks.  We are missing out as a member State on this potential funding and we will do so as long as the Marine Institute is not put in place.</P>

      <P>The critical problems caused to all sectors, rural and urban by recent storms on our coastline and inland, the lack of Government response, the totally inadequate emergency moneys offered by Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to move this motion because of the constant battering this country has taken from storms since 16 December 1989 to date.  I urge that my motion be allowed for discussion today.  I accept that the Government announced an action plan or an interdepartmental committee, but we are always an action plan away from <Col N="1935" /> action.  Local authorities need money. They are no longer financially autonomous; they are funded from the central Exchequer.  Maritime local authorities get no extra funding for protecting the coastline, over and above inland local authorities.  This type of coastal defence work must be made a national charge, to protect the great natural resource that is our coastline.  The whole issue of flooding needs discussing in this House.  With farmers' livelihoods at risk and lives at risk generally because of storm damage and flooding, we must devote time to debate this matter here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the MAST programme, there is also under Community auspices the STRIDE programme which will give support for science and technology infrastructure under the Regional Structural Fund.  This will be looking for proposals later this year.  Ireland has been pushing the case in Brussels that support for a marine programme is essential.  The Marine Institute stands to benefit from substantial funds under the STRIDE programme.  Once again it is necessary that there be the shortest delay in implementing all this. The second phase of the MAST research programme will come on stream in late 1992 with a funding which is doubled.  If <Col N="1936" /> we are to gain significant research contracts then the Marine Institute and its support would need to be well in place prior to this.</P>
      <P>The urgency of setting up the Institute is obvious, certainly if we are to be anywhere in the post-1992 situation.  Many people with expertise in marine matters are getting very despondent after nearly 20 years of promises since the document <i>Ireland</i>&mdash;<i>Science in the Sea</i> first laid out the scenario.  The Minister, Deputy Daly, expressed the hope in May 1986 that the Institute would be in place by the end of that year and the present Minister for the Marine has promised that it will be in place early this year.  A very dominant reaction of the research community is one of disappointment that we are so slow to move in this area.  After this length of time and after the frequent urgings from these people and the long deliberations that have taken place, to those who have seen it, the Bill does not seem to be one that will set up an institute of major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken about the long deliberations that took place before the Bill had seen the light of day.  As the Minister acknowledges the original group set up under ministerial directive in November 1985, was the Marine, Science and Technology Task Force under the direction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time.  Their task was to consider the need for an institute for marine resources and fisheries research and technology and they reported in March 1987. Having read their report, and the Minister's speech as printed in the record of Seanad Éireann in December, it seems to me that the Minister draws quite substantially on that report and it appears he draws on it without acknowledging it, which, as a teacher, I deplore.  We rap our students over the wrist for doing that kind of thing.  That task force was the basis on which this Bill was built.  Some of the phrases in the Minister's speech are to be found in the task force report, such as the importance of the Continental Shelf and the fact that Ireland's investment in marine research and technology is tiny in European terms and that a very <Col N="1937" /> practical and unfortunate consequence of this is that other European countries know more about Irish waters than we do ourselves and, as Irish fishermen know to their cost, that is a very unfortunate thing, indeed.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of the delay in setting up the Marine Institute is that apart from fishing &mdash; and naturally fishing is in the forefront if not the exclusive subject of the speeches of Senators Ó Foighil and Fitzgerald &mdash; the delay means that we are not applying the proper expertise.  We are not able to advise on the most appropriate methods to monitor and control hazardous incidents before they get out of hand, for example, the episode of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> in Bantry Bay and of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, and so on. A Marine Institute would already have developed and prepared the expertise for incidents of this kind.  That is another consequence of the delay in setting up the institute.</P>
    <P>Before long I hope we will have the opportunity in this House of discussing the current and sometimes bitter controversy about fish farming and whether its effects on the wild salmon and sea trout industries are deleterious and whether Government have any supervision over this business, whether licences are granted properly, whether people are proceeding without licences and so on. There is a whole area there of public debate which is currently filling the pages of our newspapers.  If we had a Marine Institute in place this is one of the areas which would have already been prepared, clarified and applied.  We are losing out again on that particular matter.</P>
    <P>The task force also draws our attention to the fact that our European partners are streets ahead of us in setting up institutions, such as in France where a body with the acronym IFREMER combines these various areas of activity, oceanology, marine environment, offshore engineering and so on.  As always, perhaps, the best model for us is not one of the larger European partners but the one nearest to ourselves in terms of resources and economy.  The Danish performance, as in other areas, is extremely <Col N="1938" /> impressive for the tremendous range of technological supports which it provides to the marine and fisheries sector.  That is an impressive example for a small country similar in size to ourselves.  The Canadian Government, large in size but nearer to ourselves in its style of doing things, have integrated in an effective way fisheries research with other marine research.  The task force emphasised that the fundamental problem is that the work of the various organisations in this area is unco-ordinated.  I have been sounding out opinion among my academic colleagues on what they see &mdash; apart from the fact that they are disappointed by the delay in bringing out the Bill &mdash; as the single greatest need to which the Marine Institute should address itself.  Without consultation with one another, individuals have said the same thing to me, that the overwhelming need is co-ordination of the work of existing departments.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Ó Foighil's disappointment that neither the Bill itself nor the Minister's speech recognises the work done by Údarás na Gaeltachta nor, indeed, does the Bill or the Minister's speech recognise in any significant way the work done by universities and the third level institutes generally.  In passing, I thank Senator Ó Foighil who paused in the interval of singing the Connemara Boat Song to pay tribute to UCC.  I am glad he did that.  The academic opinion is that the most important thing for the Marine Institute to do is to pull together existing areas of expertise, fill in the gaps that exist at the moment and avoid overlaps rather than attempt to start off from a whole green fields situation in areas of staffing, facilities and so on.  The expertise is already there; the work is already impressive in third level research centres and in the universities and regional colleges there are the pools of researchers, the feedback between teaching and research, the maximum availability of equipment and, perhaps as well, the avoidance of ageing &mdash; that is to say, you have a continual input of young researchers coming into the various departments that are involved in this.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies in the course of <Col N="1939" /> my contribution here for drawing attention to the work in this whole area that is being done in University College, Cork, because apart from pardonable local pride it illustrates the fact that the institute must build on existing foundations. If a lot of the work is already being done in Cork or Galway the institute should pull together what is going on there. Much of the work being done in UCC is being done on minimum financial resources.  It is proper that I should put on record here that there is an overall group called the Marine and Coastal Resources Group in University College, Cork, under whose general umbrella there are perhaps as many as 11 departments in college providing a whole range of services apart from their own research. For example, the aquatic services unit in zoology provides disease diagnostic services and environmental analysis to fish and shellfish farms.  All of the departments work through the resource and environmental management unit, REMU, which is playing a very important role in the general area of environmental problems in the Cork area.  Its intervention and opinion on the controversial Sandoz plant at Ringaskiddy may well in the end be very decisive.</P>
    <P>Particularly notable is UCC's record in marine research in Lough Ine in Skibbereen.  The work there has an international reputation.  The research lab has been rebuilt there recently and as a result of the work being done in Lough Ine it has now been declared the European Community's first marine reserve.  I would like to quote from a publicity leaflet published by UCC by this marine and coastal research group in which they state:</P>
    <P>The aims of the group are the documentation and evaluation of marine and coastal resources and their management, conservation and development for maximum benefit regionally and nationally.</P>
    <P>That is an aim not very different indeed from the aim put forward in the Bill itself. The department of zoology is particularly <Col N="1940" /> notable in all this area and the whole work on aquaculture coordinated by the zoology department.  They have postgraduate courses in aquaculture which already are supplying managers, pathologists, biologists and so on to the whole fish industry.</P>
    <P>The zoology department is by no means the only one; there is also, entirely distinct from that, the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Laboratory which was set up in 1978 and whose facilities are unique in Ireland and have attracted research funding from Eolas, the EC, Government agencies and so on.  Here there is basic research going on leading to doctorates and masters' degrees in such areas as wave energy devices, work for Wexford harbour, model testing of wave action, investigation of dredging effects in Dingle harbour and so on.  So let us not once again confine our deliberations. One hopes that the Marine Institute will not confine its work to the matter of fishing in itself.  Even the department of geography, which at first sight one would expect to be engaged in fairly non-practical work as it were, has done very practical work such as the economic implications of people's lives at the coastline and the impact which coastal changes have on people, on tourism development and so on.  All those engaged in these areas in my own university will be very interested in this Bill and have already expressed an interest in it but they will be disappointed by many things in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I rise with a feeling of joy to welcome very much on my own behalf, and I am sure on behalf of the House, the fact that Nelson Mandela has been released from custody after 27 years.  He was the longest serving political prisoner that I know of.  To put it in perspective, I got married in 1961 and Nelson Mandela has been incarcerated for most of that time.  Indeed, a son of mine won a national essay competition in 1978, when he was 15 years of age and the title of the essay was &ldquo;Apartheid is a crime against humanity&rdquo;.  In that essay he mentioned the fact that at that stage Mandela had been incarcerated.</P>
      <P>A lot of things have changed since 1978.  There is now hope on the horizon that there can be political change in South Africa which would be of benefit not alone to the African National Congress but indeed to everybody in that country which has been buffeted over the past number of years because of the racist policies of the ruling white minority there.  I think we can hope that in the coming months there can be a reconciliation between people of different political viewpoints and different colours in that beautiful land of South Africa. &ldquo;Reconciliation&rdquo; is the word that has been used by Mandela since his release after many years in custody.  In welcoming the release of Mandela, a leading member of the majority political grouping, we must not forget that it took unbelievable courage on behalf of De Klerk to release him.  Since Mandela has come out of prison, he has shown that he is willing to work with his people to ensure that South Africa becomes a place of reconciliation and that the South African economy can benefit not alone one section of society but that there can be a reconciliation of minds so that the economic situation for the majority black population can be improved to the point that their standards equal those which the white minority groupings have enjoyed for the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, people on both sides of the political spectrum in South <Col N="1942" /> Africa who will use the release of Nelson Mandela for their own ends.  There is within that country a desire for peace, a peace which will give hope to people there, irrespective of their colour or religion, and that a community will emerge which will be of benefit to everybody. There are huge problems to be confronted &mdash; social, educational, commercial, and also in the field of transportation. These problems might seem to be at this stage insurmountable, but, if both sides work together, it will give hope to what is a beautiful country.</P>
    <P>Nelson Mandela epitomised a struggle and the need to continue a struggle for what he believed in.  There were times when he could have possibly got out of jail if he had bowed down to the demands being made by Governments in South Africa, but he did not do so because he believed in the right of his people to play a major part in their own country. Politically speaking it is a time of hope throughout the world.  I am sure that events in South Africa and Eastern Europe will be looked at very carefully by people closer to home, people on our own island, who will ponder the fact that in South Africa a political, economic and social system can emerge which accommodates people from every part of the political spectrum and of all colours.</P>
    <P>I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela and I pray that the extremists will realise that his release is not going to have the enormous devastating effect on the economy of South Africa that a lot of white supremists would like to see.  To his wife, Winnie, who has stood by him through all the trauma of his incarceration, and to his family, we send our good wishes.  The case of Nelson Mandela will not be forgotten by those who want to see peace and reconciliation in the world.  I would again like to place on record the fact that this House welcomes the release of Nelson Mandela and hopes that it results in a peaceful future for South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group of Senators, I am happy to join with the Leader of the House in <Col N="1943" /> welcoming the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela.  I would take this opportunity of wishing him, and indeed all the peoples of South Africa, peace, happiness and success.  President De Klerk deserves appreciation and support in what he has started &mdash; the democratisation of his country.  I believe the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, spoke for all of us when he said that Ireland rejoices that Nelson Mandela is free at last and that by his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that the human spirit cannot be vanquished.  This has been a tremendous year for freedom and democracy.  Our only hope is that people who gain some freedom, and the rights and privileges that go with it, would also be fearful of the responsibilities that are so closely bound up with democracy.</P>
      <P>I hope the action taken by President De Klerk will encourage his Government to move rapidly ahead with reforms to dismantle that barbaric system of apartheid. I do not for a minute underestimate this problem.  There is a huge problem in bringing about deep-rooted changes in any country.  For the last year and a half our Government had great difficulties with the fishing licence legislation.  We do not have to contend with racism or xenophobia.  We do not have to contend with five different races, as the Leader of the House outlined.  The President of South Africa has huge problems and a huge task.  We must wish him success and congratulate him in taking those first difficult steps.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of South Africa is grossly underestimated.  I had the opportunity of passing through a portion of that country on two occasions while attending development and aid meetings in Lesotho. It is a fine country with a special climate, rich not just in mineral resources but also in people.  Nowhere in the world would one see such tremendous specimens of manhood as the Zulu tribe.  I have for many years admired the work of Chief Buthelezi and his efforts in his difficult fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the FitzGerald Government Ireland took a unilateral stand on fruit <Col N="1944" /> and vegetables produced by the prison population or by prison labour.  We took that step as an act of solidarity and Europe as a whole should adopt the same policy.  From that point of view I was very glad to hear the Taoiseach, as President of the European Community, outline the unanimous policy of the European Community on this issue.</P>
    <P>The courage displayed by Nelson Mandela during his long imprisonment and the example shown by him must have convinced many members of the white minority in South Africa that they could no longer oppose the forces of democracy. I hope there will be no delay in the discussions between the majority and the minority which would help bring peace to that troubled, but beautiful land.  What we want now is a continuation of the process which started with the unbanning of the ANC and the freeing of Mr. Mandela. The next stage is the lifting of the state of emergency and then the long difficult task that will bring about the dismantling of apartheid and the introduction of true democracy in South Africa.  In the struggle still to come, Mr. Mandela must have the support of all democratic-minded peoples in the world.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on the record of the House a statement from the Association of West European Parliamentarians for Action against Apartheid on the release of Nelson Mandela, and I quote:</P>
    <P>AWEPAA welcomes the actual release of Nelson Mandela, 9 days after the announcement by South African President de Klerk, as a major success in the struggle for the final dismantling of apartheid and a positive step in the process of creating a suitable climate for fruitful negotiations on the abolition of apartheid.</P>
    <P>It is still necessary that the South African Government takes some further steps in accordance with the demands, repeatedly put forward by both the South African opposition and by the international community, like the European Community (in its 1986 statement) and the General Assembly <Col N="1945" /> of the United Nations, (in its unanimously adopted resolution of December 14, 1989).  This means amongst others:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the release of all political prisoners and detainees, without imposing any restrictions on them after their release.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the complete lifting of the State of Emergency in all its aspects, and the repeal of all other legislation, circumscribing political activity, such as the Internal Security Act;</P>
    <P>&mdash;allowing political activities without further restrictions by all organisations and persons proscribed/ restricted thus far;</P>
    <P>&mdash;removal of all troops from the townships;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the abolition of the practice of detention without trial;</P>
    <P>&mdash;full abolition of media restrictions, including the ban on pictures of &ldquo;unrest situtations&rdquo; on TV;</P>
    <P>&mdash;abolition of the &ldquo;homelands&rdquo; policy, including forced removals of people to and forced incorporation of areas into &ldquo;homelands&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>&mdash;abolition of the Group Areas Act, the Population Registration Act and the Land Act.</P>
    <P>Consistent pressure on South Africa by the world community, in the diplomatic, military, economic, sports and cultural fields has contributed to the current achievements, which are primarily the result of the resistance of the South African population against apartheid.</P>
    <P>AWEPAA fully agrees with Mr. Mandela's call on the international community to continue the campaign to isolate the apartheid regime because by lifting sanctions now we would run the risk of aborting the process towards the complete eradication of apartheid.</P>
    <P>The past ten months has been a very <Col N="1946" /> hopeful period for freedom and democracy not just in eastern Europe but also in South Africa.  My hope is that this particular movement would spread to Central and South America.  As the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, so rightly said, let us hope that this new era of hope will extend to the problems in our own island as well.  The time is right for politicians of both sides in Northern Ireland to find areas of common ground. On behalf of my colleagues, I want to wholeheartedly support the proposal.</P>

      <P>Thank you acting chairman for recognising the Progressive Democrats as being a separate party from Fianna Fáil.  I would like to join with the Leader of the House and indeed the other speakers in welcoming on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, the release of Nelson Mandela.  If he stands for one thing, it is the indomitability of the human spirit.  He is, without question, a man of great dignity and enormous courage to have withstood the past 27 years and to re-emerge into the world a free man.  The courage and leadership qualities which he still possesses, after 27 years in prison, are very encouraging, not alone from the point of view of black Africa but also of white Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role that Nelson Mandela may play in the weeks, months and years ahead is obviously an extremely pivotal role and a very important one.  As somebody who lived in Africa for a number of years in what was then Rhodesia under UDI and <Col N="1947" /> who has seen the transformation of that country, perhaps I feel a little closer to the situation than other people.  I got to know the Africans as they are in reality as opposed to our impressions of them in the hallowed halls of Parliament.  Indeed, there can be a great difference between impressions and reality.  I look forward with great hope to the total abolition of apartheid.  The system is disintegrating and the total capitulation of the apartheid system itself is only a matter of time.</P>
    <P>It was very heartening to witness the other night not just the release of Nelson Mandela but also the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme on BBC on which we saw Pik Botha, the Foreign Minister in South Africa, sitting down with members of the ANC, the UDF, the PAC and Inkatha, discussing in a forum of political debate the future of that country.  That was an extraordinary sight to behold and already one can see areas of apartheid disappearing. Obviously, not all of what we want to see disappear overnight has disappeared, but the state of emergency in South Africa must disappear immediately &mdash; there is no question about that &mdash; as indeed must all of the other restrictive practices of the apartheid régime.  It is understandable, in the euphoria that surrounds the release of such a world figure as Nelson Mandela, that one tends to get carried away perhaps and over-excited and begins to imagine that Utopia may have somehow arrived in that country particularly for the black Africans but also inded for the white Africans.  That is not the case because there is an enormous amount of work still to be done, and I am looking to the Irish Presidency and to our Taoiseach, as President of the EC, in this regard.  Never has any country assumed the Presidency at a time of such unbelievable turmoil in international affairs, considering events in Eastern Europe and South Africa at present.  I hope our Taoiseach will become an active participant on the international scene rather than play a passive, defensive rôle. With the risks that President De Klerk has taken in South Africa, I am deeply concerned that he is on extremely thin <Col N="1948" /> ice, so to speak, and may not at this point have the full support of the white African population.  He needs that support to continue as quickly as possible down the road to reform.  There is a very definitive rôle for the international community to play in that regard.</P>
    <P>One matter that is being spoken about at the moment is the question of sanctions. While it is correct to say there should be no movement in the area of sanctions until such time as changes begin to take place in South Africa, it behoves the EC and indeed other countries &mdash; I will speak specifically because the Taoiseach is President &mdash; to give some indication as to what might be the outcome if certain conditions were met in South Africa.  We should support the movement forward which President De Klerk is trying to bring about.  Not alone is he trying to bring the Nationalist Party down the road to reform but also other white dominated parties in South Africa.  I know that as I speak here this evening the fear among the white African community is absolutely enormous &mdash; one could not begin to describe it in this Chamber.  I imagine it could only be described by the people who live there. It is not a fear of being dominated by black Africa; it is a fear generated by what the outcome of these changes will be and what the future will be for those people who are five and six generation African.  They are looking, indeed grasping, for signals from the international community that they are not going to be forgotten in the rush to democracy.  They should be encouraged to dismantle the abhorrent régime of apartheid, but there should be a reward for it.</P>
    <P>While it would perhaps be easy for me and other Senators to stand here and be bitter over what has happened in the last 20, 30 or 40 years &mdash; and nobody can justify it &mdash; we must look to the future. That is why I am asking that Ireland, during the Presidency, play an active rôle in the encouragement of the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa.  I believe the Taoiseach, as President, should set out some criteria as to how he sees Europe move, given certain changes <Col N="1949" /> which are occurring simultaneously within South Africa.  I do not think it is enough to simply say we will do nothing with regard to sanctions or indeed in any other area until such time as a whole range of conditions are met in South Africa.  The reason I say that is out of fear that the position of President De Klerk would be weakened and the opportunity for rapid change lost.  I have no doubt, in reading between the lines and looking at the reports on television, that there is a relationship in existence between Nelson Mandela and President De Klerk.  President de Klerk said he trusts Nelson Mandela and I think that trust is reciprocated.  The international community must build on that trust. Therefore, it is only by playing an active rôle, rather than a passively defensive rôle, that such change can be brought about.</P>
    <P>In the past I have met Oliver Tambo, the recognised leader of the ANC for the last number of years, and indeed many other members of the ANC.  I would say to them, as I would to everybody, to get involved, to become part of the future of South Africa, to be constructive in the debate and to recognise the genuine fears of a large section of the population &mdash; black, white, coloured and Indian &mdash; all of whom are represented in South Africa. Everybody should work together for a democratic country in the interest of all the peoples there.  In conclusion, I look forward to the debate here next week on South Africa when we will have more time for an exchange of views.  Again, I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela and encourage the Taoiseach, as President of the EC, to play an active role, a leadership role, which I believe is required from the international community, in supporting President De Klerk and Nelson Mandela in their efforts to bring about peace, harmony and a democratic society in South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the University Senators and I trust that nothing I am about to say will command dissent from any one of them.  I speak <Col N="1950" /> because I represented to them that I might not be in a position to contribute to the debate next week, I also exploited my seniority and finally there was a toss of a coin.  I know that Senator Brendan Ryan would like to have spoken also on this occasion, and I very freely yield the palm to him in terms of his involvement with the anti-apartheid movement.  It has not been one of my fields of activity; I am at best only a passive supporter of that movement.  Therefore, I want to thank him and my colleagues for giving me this privilege today.</P>
      <P>My first reaction would be to support those who have said they are prompted once again in this matter to stress the need to have an Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This matter comes up again and again.  It simply is not enough to say, as I think the Leader said earlier, that we have many opportunities in this House to debate foreign affairs, many more than the Dáil perhaps.  That is true. But there is a stature and a prestige about an Oireachtas Joint Committee that is unique in our structures in the Oireachtas and I would once again lend my voice to those who are demanding that such a committee be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my first reactions to the release of Nelson Mandela was that simply I was glad he was out of jail.  More and more I am coming around to the view that locking up people for long periods for whatever crimes, no matter how heinous, is somehow obscene.  If at this stage of civilisation we cannot handle our trouble makers in other more civilised ways, then we really have not progressed at all.  I regret the confusion a while ago, but it was quite genuine.  For a moment I thought you were going back to Fianna Fáil, a Chathaoirligh, and I regret the identity mistake I made in regard to Senator Cullen.  I would like to say how much I relished his contribution and the constructive proposals he made about where we go from here.  I think the average television viewer was struck most of all by the extraordinary serenity and mobility of a man who has been locked up in jail for a large portion, nearly half <Col N="1951" /> of his life.  There is a remarkable lack of rancour or bitterness on his part &mdash; no hint of vengefulness whatsoever.  After all those years it is truly remarkable that his vision of liberation for his own people remains steadfast.  That was to be expected but what is almost breathtaking is the fact that he is equally resolute in his bright vision of a harmonious and peaceful future for his beloved South Africa.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I was anxious to speak here on behalf of my group today was that we in Ireland have a particular historical interest in the situation now facing the peoples of South Africa.  In the early 1790s, nearly 200 years ago, we had a situation in this country which was in some respects uncannily similar to the position now in South Africa.  We had an entrenched and privileged minority, a disaffected and discriminated against majority, because the Penal Laws were our apartheid in this country.  Senator Cullen used the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo;.  The Protestant ascendancy in the early 1790s were a frightened minority.  The best of them wanted to give civil rights to Catholics but not to the extent of losing their Protestant ascendancy.  Even the noble sounding Henry Grattan said: &ldquo;I urge the need to liberate my Catholic fellow-countrymen but not to the detriment of the Protestant ascendancy&rdquo;, although he went on to say other very noble things such as, &ldquo;the Protestant can never be free until the Catholic has ceased to be a slave.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Today in Pretoria in the apartheid regime you have the liberal-minded whites who do want to give Nelson Mandela's people their freedom but, at the same time, they are up against the conundrum that majority rights might well mean majority rule and minority deprivation.  That was the awful dilemma facing our peoples in Ireland in the early 1790s.  They were unable to resolve it peacefully.  There was no De Klerk on the Protestant ascendancy side.  Henry Grattan, for all his periwigged posturing, was no De Klerk and there was no Nelson Mandela on the Catholic majority side. What resulted was the bloodbath of 1798 <Col N="1952" /> and what still exists is the alienation of Protestant from Catholic in this country.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of interest in what is happening in South Africa.  Much of the problem in South Africa is still our problem in that regard.  That is why we must wish them well in a way, perhaps, few other peoples in the western world have reason to wish them well.  Let us hope then that President De Klerk will continue to be far-seeing and generous. Let us hope that Nelson Mandela and his colleagues will maintain that high level of statesmanship and generosity that we have seen in recent times.  Last night listening at random to one of his other colleagues, I was struck again by the extraordinary largeness of mind which, I think, bodes well for South Africa.  I am referring in this case to Mr. Murphy Marobe &mdash; as far as I know he is not one of our Murphys but that does not take in the slightest from his stature.  I believe it is a moment of hope.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I want to say. In this House not so long ago on a proposition involving the imprisoned Nelson Mandela I expressed some reservations about the African National Congress. The phrase &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo; for me has sinister connotations and I am still uneasy at the phrase &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo;.  I hope it does not become necessary for the black, oppressed majority to have to resume armed struggle.  As far as I can see there has been an intermission in this regard, thankfully, for some time past.  It is obscene that the same phrase &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo; should be used by the Provisional IRA who are a tiny minority having no mandate and who have access to parliamentary representation in a relatively liberal political culture.  It is obscene that their armed struggle should be invoked in the same breath and in the same phrase.</P>

      <P>Their armed struggle is no struggle at all.  It is the bloody bludgeoning of their Unionist fellow-Irishmen into submission in a united Ireland.  I want to sound that note as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> Senator Cullen referred to the example of Zimbabwe and what has happened in Zimbabwe.  Without knowing a great deal about it, I would suggest again that Zimbabwe is a beacon of hope in this situation.  I hope it will be possible for black and white to learn to resolve their problems and to live together.  Some way must be found out of this situation.  &ldquo;One man, one vote&rdquo; in a common electoral role must not destroy the white settlers in South Africa who, after all, have been there a very long time and whose claim to have contributed to the building of that marvellous country has a great deal of substance.</P>
    <P>On that note then I share the sentiments of my colleagues.  This afternoon at least, before we get into any more complex discussion, this must only be a time for jubilation.  Hallelujah, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my delight and pleasure at the release of Nelson Mandela.  It certainly provides hope that we are on our way to seeing real progress taking place in South Africa.  It is just one step, but it is an important step in the right direction.  I should say that our party, the Labour Party, will not be satisfied until every single aspect of apartheid is removed.  That removal will always remain for our party a fundamental key priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still a very long way to go in South Africa.  Senator Charlie McDonald read into the record of the House a fairly grizzly list.  I will not repeat them all but it might be no harm just to remind the House of one or two of the problems which still exist in South Africa, which he named.  The state of emergency exists. There is the question of political prisoners. There is the question of detention without trial.  There is the question of the restriction of reporting.  Until these items are removed I think sanctions have to remain in place.  The isolation of South Africa must continue and I sincerely hope the line will be held within Europe in seeing that that happens and that the Taoiseach will play a key role in seeing <Col N="1954" /> that that occurs.  I also hope, and reecho what Senator Cullen said, that the Taoiseach will avail of the great opportunity which now exist to try to accelerate progress towards full equality in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The release of Nelson Mandela is to a very important degree related to the use of sanctions and to the isolation of South Africa.  His release must come as a great source of encouragement and, indeed, consolation to many people in this country.  It must be a great source of encouragement that after all the years the work of those honourable people who have made up the Anti-Apartheid Movement in this country &mdash; and they are people who come from a variety of different shades of view in all the different spectra of views in this country &mdash; has to some small extent contributed to the release of Nelson Mandela.  His release must also be a matter of great encouragement and consolation to the other honourable elements in this country, to those fine people who involved themselves on a point of principle and who got very little thanks for it.  I am talking about those people who ran Dunnes Stores' strike over whatever dreadful length of time it went on.  It must be a consolation to those people now to feel that to some extent their efforts are now bearing fruit in the release of Nelson Mandela.  His release must also be a source of encouragement to those people who turned their backs on the opportunities to make large amounts of money in South Africa.  They must have a feeling of having done something which was truly worth while.  I am talking about those rugby players who turned down very inviting financial opportunities, to have a good time and a pleasant trip to South Africa which would have benefited their rugby prospects as well as benefiting them financially later on.  I certainly hope that those people now feel a sense of reward.  What they did was honourable and worth while.  I hope it will be seen in the long run to have been the case.</P>
    <P>Nelson Mandela is a Freeman of this city.  His statue stands in Merrion Square. I had the wonderful experience of being <Col N="1955" /> there at the celebrations which took place last Monday afternoon.  I certainly hope that Nelson Mandela will get an opportunity to come to Dublin so that he can sign the roll as a Freeman of this city. The members of the Dublin City Council who extended that honour to him must also feel a certain sense of pleasure and delight at his release.  I hope that Nelson Mandela will get the opportunity of coming into this House or in to a joint meeting of the Oireachtas and that he will get the opportunity of addressing us.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I agree with Senator Cullen &mdash; apartheid is beginning to fall apart.  What happened in Zimbabwe presents a considerable degree of hope.  The transition there was relatively peaceful.  It was as peaceful as many people could hope for.  It was not anything like what the prophets of doom forecast.  It is great to see the end of this awful system beginning to take place before our eyes.  It has not taken place nearly soon enough and the speed at which it is going is not nearly fast enough for me.</P>

    <Title>Marine Institute Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that it has been rather irritating to have had so many interruptions in this debate.  I realise that important business had to be done, not least the last item on the Order Paper.  Nonetheless, I find my train of thought has been very much fragmented in the course of the last hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the idea of the Bill is very welcome, it is belated and many things in it will disappoint.  I will be hoping for ministerial reassurance on these matters. My impression of the Bill is borne out by people to whom I have shown the Bill.  It is that it is a kind of &ldquo;Let us get this out of the way Bill&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Let us set up this institute and get shut of it&rdquo;.  There is that impression about the Bill.  There is not <Col N="1956" /> an impression of setting up a major semi-State body to embark on major reform of a vital part of our economy but rather of the setting up of a tame committee. There is no obligation in the Bill on the Minister to take note of the expertise already existing or of the prestige attaching to any particular individuals or institutes. He can, in effect, set up his own committee.  It looks like an <i>ad hoc</i> response to the work of the task force of some years ago.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the scope of the Bill seems to me disproportionate to the various interests I have talked about and the various interests of all the scientists involved in research in this country.  Admittedly, I must concede that the Minister's own speech enlarges on the Bill itself &mdash; his speech is more comprehensive than the Bill.  Nonetheless, the Bill seems to concentrate fairly shortsightedly on immediate economic development.  There is no great environmental awareness in the Bill.  Nothing is excluded, but there is no great harping on ecology, on the environment or on the wider awareness of marine usage.</P>
    <P>Another disappointment is that the importance of the coastal zone is not stressed.  In section 1 there is a coastal reference, but there is no particular emphasis on it.  There is no specific development of it.  As Senators Fitzgerald and Ó Foighil will acknowledge, there is much more important research going on in the coastal zone than in the open sea.</P>
    <P>But my main concern with the Bill is that it does not recognise the work being done by bodies like Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the universities and so on.  They should have been included in the Bill and provision made for their representation in the Institute. Like many another Bill we have addressed in this House, it suffers from the usual Government caution about putting everything under ministerial control and the reluctance to commit the Minister to any wider consultation.  There is disappointingly little reference to the existing state of research, to which I referred in some detail.  The task force is <Col N="1957" /> not acknowledged very much except in the Minister's speech, but not in the Bill itself.  I would have to differ also with a passage in the Minister's speech in which he talks about the undersirability of locating the Institute in any single campus.  He talks about a waste of resources by setting up a physical centre for the Institute.  At the same time the Minister must balance that with the need for decentralisation. The Cork area, for example, is particularly well equipped to head up a marine research institute with the developments in UCC, in Lough Inagh, in Matt Murphy's work in the Sherkin Island research station in, the hydraulics research laboratory and so on.  All these extensive programmes, along with the fisheries development in Bantry Bay and on Béara peninsula, surely suggest that consideration should be given to locating some of the work of the institute in that area.</P>
    <P>Under the auspices of the European Community, the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions recommended that a marine research centre should be located in Cork.  The Minister will already know of all this, because in June 1987 a combination of Cork bodies, including the corporation, the county council, the harbour commissioners, UCC and the regional technical college, submitted a memorandum to the Government on the proposed location of Roinn na Mara, including the Marine Research and Technology Institute, as it was called at that time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have become very interested in this Bill.  One of the times a University Senator feels most useful is when he or she is representing the expert opinion of his colleagues, who really are seeking a voice in this matter and who want their views expressed in Seanad Éireann.  Bills like this remind us that this House has a particular role to play in legislation and that the vocational dimension comes into play very much.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as far as it goes but it falls short of expectations generally.  I hope above all that the Marine Institute will not go the way of the Agricultural Institute and that it will not die for lack <Col N="1958" /> of funding for research.  I always like to welcome Bills wholeheartedly.  I have grave reservations on this one but I welcome it to that extent and I await the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome this Bill and I would like to compliment the Department of the Marine and the Minister.  I agree with some of the remarks made by previous speakers that it is overdue but it has come at last.  I would like to support a few remarks made by Senator Murphy, in particular his concluding remarks about the suitability of Cork as a proper and fit location for this new Institute.  I would also like to join with Senator Murphy in the complimentary remarks he paid to University College, Cork, and the work they are doing in this area.  Similarly, I would like to compliment the Marine Research Station in Sherkin Island, headed by Matt Murphy, who works with me in the coastal management committee which is a sub-committee of Cork County Council.  Matt Murphy is a pioneer in research and had done excellent work, together with his family in Sherkin Island, over the past decade or more.  In particular, he has held a number of international conferences in Cork which focused attention in the right direction as far as this Institute is concerned.</P>
      <P>I would also like to compliment our own coastal management committee in their endeavours to provide some finance, little though it is, for the provision of an educational facility to be commenced throughout the coastal towns in Cork for the promotion and education of students to make them aware of the benefits of mariculture and aquaculture in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was born on the shores of Bantry Bay, the son of a fisherman.  With the development of the mussel industry and the provision of salmon cages Bantry Bay has become the mariculture capital of Ireland.  The position with the fishing industry in general is that it was for many years, at least three decades, the poor <Col N="1959" /> relation of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This was unfortunate. If we look at statistics we see that we have 25 per cent of EC waters and yet we get 4 per cent of its catch.  It is an astonishing fact that an island with major potential has been neglected by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>This institute can be of particular benefit. I will be parochial in view of the problems in the Cork region.  We have had on a regular basis the rape of our waters and fishing stocks by large international trawlers for many years.  In many instances these trawlers are not from EC countries.  Vessels of Spanish ownership are being apprehended by our protection vessels and are brought ashore.  The reality is that the numbers of foreign trawlers brought into our ports and that have to face the rigours of the law for the breach of our national waters represent just the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>All around the coast the new institute has a role to play.  I refer to the situation with regard to the salmon industry.  I am particularly concerned that there is an ongoing clash and that serious incidents have occurred off our coastline when salmon fishermen have been brought to the notice of patrol vessels.  A solution must be found to this problem.  On one side there are the inland fishery people who feel there are not enough wild salmon coming up the rivers.  They are concerned, and rightly so, about the possible adverse effect this can have on our tourism and on the economy.  It is internationally recognised that except for Scotland there are few, if any, rivers or clear waters in Europe where salmon are still available.  We are fortunate in Ireland that we have many such rivers and this is something that we must preserve.  The proper scientific and technological approach by this new institute can only enhance and encourage the development of our estuaries and rivers.  It is a known fact that there is massive potential, particularly for the tourist industry, in ensuring that rivers are properly stocked and keep pollution free.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling fact that over the past <Col N="1960" /> decade or so we have had a number of serious instances of pollution in our rivers from industrial sources.  Sometimes farmers are responsible for the discharge of effluent, such as silage and in other instances local authorities have been guilty of polluting our rivers and harbours. This must be curtailed.  I welcome the efforts of the Department of the Environment who are currently ensuring that pollution is kept to the minimum. Much of this pollution was due to lack of knowledge and lack of scientific back-up. In this respect I believe that the new institute will have a vital role to play. I would congratulate the environmental department of Cork County Council on their efforts in this regard.  We have an excellent environmental officer, Brian McCutcheon, backed up by a team of 18 or 19 people, and they are currently embarking on efforts to try to minimise the pollution of our rivers, etc.</P>
    <P>Again I may be a little parochial, but I am concerned that over the last two or three years we had this famous &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the River Lee.  There seems to be conflicting views about the causes and effects of such greening.  The reality is that it is a relatively new phenomenon and it is one that the new institute will have a role to play in ensuring, possibly in co-operation with the local authority, that this is properly investigated.  We are assured by the environmental experts that so far as the fish stocks and indeed the water from the River Lee, the drinking water etc., are concerned, there is no adverse effect revealed by the greening, but it is an area that must be looked at.  This is one of the most important waterways in Europe.  By proper research and pinpointing the source, this greening can be eliminated and overcome.</P>
    <P>In regard to salmon, there is the ongoing conflict about whether or not monofiliment nets should be legalised.  I accept that as the law stands the monofilament net is illegal.  But the reality is that in my area &mdash; and I speak for most of the coast of County Cork and parts of Kerry &mdash; and from my experience and knowledge of the fishermen concerned, <Col N="1961" /> no other net is used.  I have great sympathy for the genuine onshore fisherman with a vessel of possibly 30 or 40 ft., half deckers and, possibly, open boats, who have licences and who are trying to eke out a decent living.  The problem arises with the big vessels &mdash; indeed, in some instances they are not Irish vessels &mdash; eight, ten, 15 or 20 miles off our shores with seven and eight miles of monofilament net catching thousands of salmon.  It is they who are really doing the damage.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect that must be addressed.  In fact, if we take the argument further, I believe that we must learn from the endeavours of people like the Canadians and, the Norwegians, who have made great efforts to preserve the salmon stocks and have done a lot of scientific and technological research into the development of the salmon industry in their areas.  In this respect I believe that the new institute has an important role to play, because I am convinced that there is not sufficient research into the pattern of the salmon.  We know a lot about that species, but one puzzling feature I could never obtain an explanation of was this.  In 1986 and 1987 we had two relatively bad years off our coastline for the fishing of salmon.  We had poor catches, resulting in enormous prices per pound being paid for salmon.  Yet in 1988 &mdash; and this has baffled the scientists as well &mdash; we had record catches for that year around our coastline resulting in salmon prices falling as low as £1.60p per lb., probably less than half what was paid the previous year.</P>
    <P>More research can and must be done to preserve our salmon stocks.  The simple banning of the monofilament net and the disabling of approximately 80 genuine salmon fishermen along the Cork coastline, the largest in Ireland, will not in itself solve the problem.  There is a view among the bona fide fishermen who eke out a living from salmon fishing that they are prepared to work a five day week and observe the law of the land, so to speak, providing they are allowed to use a certain limited amount of monofilament net, limited in length to the extent of not more <Col N="1962" /> than 800 metres and in depth to not more than 30 meshes.  This was a proposal put forward by the coastal management committee of County Cork.  It was a genuine proposal.  Unfortunately, it is these people, these bona fide inland fishermen, who in most cases are, I will use the word &ldquo;harassed&rdquo; by the patrol vessels, and this, unfortunately has resulted in some relatively serious incidents around our coastline. I stress that the problem is not near the shore.  It is not caused by the small fisherman who has been traditionally fishing the salmon, but it is caused by the larger vessels fishing with miles of net off our coastline.</P>
    <P>Another problem I believe this new Institute can focus attention on, and hopefully remedy, is a new phenomenon occurring around our coastline and, I believe, not heard of until the last decade of the 1980s.  I refer to the problem of wrecks along our shoreline.  I will instance the <i>Ranga</i>, which came ashore off Slea Head and has lain there for many years on a nice sandy beach.  It is a deplorable sight to the eye.  One wonders where are we going in this regard.  I will next instance the case of the <i>Bardini Reefer</i>, which in my view was scuttled in the harbour between Bere Island and Castletownbere, the second largest fishing port in Ireland.  It is sticking up there.  The mast is over water.  It is partly submerged and is creating problems of access to and from the island for the island people and for tourists.  It is also creating problems for the fishermen seeking to gain access to the port of Castlebownbere.  This is a disgrace.  It has been lying there for about six or seven years.  Here is a case where this vessel came in, was abandoned and sank in the harbour.  This should not be allowed to happen.  The Institute has a role to play in the monitoring of traffic along our shoreline.  Off the south-west coastline we have one of the busiest shipping lanes.  There was the unfortunate tragedy of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> which claimed the lives of 50 people at the jetty of Whiddy Island on the night of 8 January 1979.  That vessel was refused access to a European port and yet we allowed this vessel to dock.  Apart from claiming 50 <Col N="1963" /> lives it crippled the whole industry of oil storage in Whiddy and was to sound its death knell.</P>
    <P>Next I will come to the famous or infamous <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, which arrived at my own bay of Bantry Bay.  People may say I am being parochial, but Bantry Bay is the second best bay in the world.  The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> was granted shelter there.  The massive vessel, carrying a cargo of semi-refined iron ore, lay in the bay for two or three days.  It then took to sea and, fearing its floundering, the crew were airlifted from this vessel.  The vessel was then careering around the Atlantic off our coastline and eventually took up residence on the Stags Head off Castletownsend. This vessel is no longer an eyesore; it is now totally submerged.  But it lies adjacent to one of the richest herring spawning grounds around our coastline.</P>
    <P>To come to more current matters, at the moment we have the unfortunate situation, again in Bantry Bay that adjacent to the lighthouse there is a huge Spanish trawler lying on the rocks.  I wonder what is to become of it.  I would urge the Department, the Minister and the new institute to consider policies for the patrolling of our waters.  One of our seamen lost his life going to the aid of this trawler.</P>
    <P>On the question of wrecks, we come to the current question of the <i>Tribulus</i> now anchored in Bantry Bay.  Here again there is a conflict about what one does in a situation like this.  The Minister was correct in his decision in allowing this vessel safe anchorage in Bantry Bay. There was no other bay or harbour around our coastline that could provide suitable anchorage for this vessel.  Just to go back on the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, nobody seemed to know who owned that vessel. It cost the ratepayers of this country approximately £1 million.  There is a lack of policy here.  In this current situation we are a little more fortunate in so far as the <i>Tribulus</i> is owned by a reputable company, Shell, who have co-operated since its anchorage in Bantry Bay, with the Department of the Marine Officials, <Col N="1964" /> with the Department of the Environment, with the Cork County Council and with the local fishermen.  They are doing everything possible to ensure that the vessel will be repaired and that it will leave Bantry Bay safely without the loss of lives and so on.</P>
    <P>In Bantry Bay there is a very important mariculture industry, a multi-million pound industry, and there are other types of activities.  Apart from scalloping, there is an excellent herring bed, and there is the salmon farming around Bear Island. There is a conflict here.  Is Bantry Bay going to be continuously used as a haven, having regard to the fact that in every given instance there is every chance that the local indigenous industries will be jeopardised?  Again, the <i>Tribulus</i> is a huge vessel containing as far as I am aware, raw ore.  There was the fear for a number of days in Bantry &mdash; I lived with it also &mdash; that this vessel could have broken up.  Luckily, it has not.  The weather seems to be improving.  If the vessel does break up we will have a serious problem.  As I said, I think the Minister was right in his decision.  The <i>Tribulus</i> was not in the same category as the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  It was a vessel that, due to adverse weather conditions, was allowed into Bantry Bay.</P>
    <P>For the future, the Marine Institute and the Department must look at this policy.  If there was major oil pollution in Bantry Bay it would wipe out the mariculture and aquaculture developments to date.  I would hope that a set of policies and a set of criteria would be set down. It would be on the lines of the current situation.  Shell immediately set up offices in Bantry and assured the county council and the Department that any damage caused would be fully indemnified by them.  That was not the case with the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> nor the <i>Bardini Reefer.</i> They assured the local fishermen, that in the event of any loss being sustained by them, they would be adequately and properly compensated.  They assured the local community concerned with tourism and the ecology generally that any loss would be monitored.  They brought in international experts who, together with <Col N="1965" /> the Department of the Marine officials, have ensured that any pollution to date &mdash; and, thankfully, it has been minimal &mdash; has been quickly mopped up.  The problem posed by the abandonment of oil tankers or other large vessels in Bantry Bay, which might constitute serious pollution problems, must be addressed.</P>
    <P>On the question of aquaculture and mariculture generally, the institute can play a role in the proper development of this futuristic and economically important industry for the State.  After the Gulf-Chevron pull out in Bantry a few local people, by trial and error, decided to experiment with the farming of mussels.  In the first two or three years they learned by their mistakes.  If they had had the back-up of the Marine Institute, with experts who could help them with research and scientific data and knowledge, many of the mistakes would not have been made.  In the first instance they put out rafts.  Unwittingly, they did not realise that, because of the effect of the Gulf Stream and the warm waters coming off the mouth of Bantry Bay and so on, the mussels would grow to maturity and to a state for processing in so short a time.  It was generally believed that this would take somewhere in the region of 15 to 18 months.  The pioneers in mussel development in Bantry Bay learned to their surprise &mdash; and, I suppose, initially to their loss &mdash; that this was to cause problems, because most of the rafts sank with the weight of the mussels.  They then moved on to the long line system, which has proved enormously successful.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Department of the Marine on their efforts over the past number of years in helping and supporting the mussel industry in the Bantry Bay area, My view is that there are still some teething problems, possibly due to overintensification of farming causing a poor meat content in the mussel and a slower growth.  This can be resolved by proper research and scientific knowledge. Along our coastline from Malin Head to Mizen Head there are opportunities for development.  I am using the mussel industry by way of example rather than regarding it as being the exclusive <Col N="1966" /> type of industry there.  There is potential also for scallop farming, clams, oysters, etc.</P>
    <P>The value of these industries to our economy is that they look to 1990 and the next century.  There is great potential, and the new institute will have a significant role to play in the back-up of such industries.  Going back four or five years ago, the mussels coming from Bantry Bay alone kept a factory in Scotland who processed them, and employed 40 people, going almost 12 months of the year.  We have since then come a step forward in that we are now, thankfully, processing a certain percentage of these mussels locally.</P>
    <P>That is the type of thing &mdash; and it was touched upon earlier by Senator Fitzgerald &mdash; we should also have a fresh look at &mdash; the bringing ashore of our natural indigenous products.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to other species of fish.  For many years &mdash; and it is still the case &mdash; about 80 per cent of the catches coming into Castletownbere were taken by lorry out of the country and processed abroad. That is an unfortunate situation which must be remedied.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, in many instances, through lack of knowledge or scientific back-up, a lot of the fish that came ashore deteriorated and left our country in less than satisfactory condition.  These fish should be processed here.  We should look to the improvement of the quality of the fish being landed.  In the mussel industry at present we have a problem of crustaceans on the mussels.  This is a sort of growth. It does no harm to the actual food of the mussel, but from a presentation and marketing point of view it is unsightly and has created problems.  It will continue to create problems until it is resolved. With proper scientific research and back-up this can be overcome.</P>
    <P>On the question of competing with our European partners, the French have designed and pioneered another type of mussel farming.  In Bantry Bay our mussels are mainly long line; in Wexford we have the dredging of mussels, which is a different system; but the French have gone a step forward in so far as they now <Col N="1967" /> have developed and pioneered a system whereby long line mussels can be anchored and submerged about 30 feet under the sea surface.  The advantage of that is that one can farm mussels in deeper and less sheltered waters than, say, the inner harbour of Bantry Bay. The whole purpose of the submerging of these lines is, I understand, to minimise the effect of wave power and swell, because, apparently, the higher you are on the water the more friction is caused and the more damage to mussels.  There is potential for the development of new techniques, and this is where this new institute has an important role to play. The important thing about mariculture, aquaculture and mussel farming is that there are no &ldquo;mussel mountains&rdquo;.  There is a potential market in France and throughout Britain for the mussel grown off our coastline because of its quality etc.  We must research this area because in the future there is potential there for job creation and economic development off our coastline.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier by Senator Murphy, there is an ongoing debate, which has not yet been resolved, about the problems being created by the farming in cages of salmon and sea trout, particularly in regard to what effect the farm salmon would have on the wild salmon population if they got loose.  The argument stems from the fact that the salmon naturally finds its way up the river, whereas the farm salmon lacks this basic impulse.  There is an argument that if the wild salmon were to mix with the fresh salmon it would create a deficient breed of salmon and would cause problems for the future.  The institute will have a role to play here in trying to ascertain what the proper approach is.  There are a lot of myths about at the moment. Next door to my own bay in Kenmare Bay there is an ongoing battle between, on one hand, the local fishermen who want to promote and establish salmon and trout farms in the bay and certain other interests, who also may have a valid point and who feel that that would be <Col N="1968" /> undesirable in a scenic area such as Kenmare Bay.  Both sides put forward very compelling arguments.  However, I think that this new institute, with proper scientific research, could help to resolve that problem &mdash; a problem which, I feel, is just the tip of the iceberg.  I believe it will escalate, but I hope a balanced debate can resolve the problem.  Interestingly enough, I read that the Canadians, in relation to their fish farming, have devised a method whereby they do a lot of the farming of salmon upriver.  They are released from the cages after a year or a year and half.  They go down the river but eventually &mdash; and hopefully for the Canadians &mdash; find their way back into the cages.  However, the success or failure of this remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the problem of wrecks along our coastline which seems to be concentrated along the south-west coast.  I fear it will become a long term problem.  I would like to pay particular tribute to the Department of the Marine and the Minister for the handling of the vessel, the <i>Tribulus</i>, in Bantry Bay.  I omitted to do that in my earlier remarks.</P>
    <P>In relation to salmon farming, trout farming etc., I had the privilege of visiting the western isles of Scotland, where they are more advanced in their technology, know-how and experience than we are. If you go further afield, the Norwegians and the Canadians are indeed very advanced.  The proportion of farmed salmon that is provided from Ireland is very tiny in comparison to what the Norwegians supply to the European market.  Of course, in Scotland and the western isles, they have one very important fact in their favour.  They had direct access to European funds over the last decade which enabled them to develop that industry.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in the Minister's speech, we lack the scientific and technological advantage that the Norwegians, Canadians and Scots have.  This is where this new institute has an important role to play.  This applies across the board not alone to the mariculture and aquaculture scene.  I may have concentrated on those, <Col N="1969" /> but I did not want to overlap points made by my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, with regard to other species of fish.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be learned about the movement of the shoals of herring and so on.  The Canadians, in particular, are continuing their research into this.  That is another area, where, because of the lack of a marine institute over the last number of years, we have been at a loss.</P>
    <P>Another area of importance under the umbrella of the Department of the Marine in which the institute can have a positive rôle to play is the whole question of coastal erosion.  It particularly effects counties like my own, east Cork, and Waterford.  This has been going on for two or three decades and successive Governments, in my view, have been inclined to ignore the problem.  Research is required to establish methods to prevent or curtail the damage caused by coastal erosion.  It is a problem which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The new institute and this Bill must be welcomed.  I urge Senators on both sides of the House to realise the importance and necessity of the establishment of this institute.  As I said earlier &mdash; previous speakers have referred to it &mdash; it is possibly overdue but now it is at hand I feel that this new institute will enhance the value of our entire fishing industry &mdash; and it is not entirely confined to the fishing industry.  As Senator Murphy pointed out, there are several other aspects of it, but this new institute can go a long way towards redressing the imbalance that has existed because of the lack of technology and research.</P>
    <P>I have confined my remarks to some areas in which I have particular knowledge, such as the mariculture and aquaculture industries.  There is a great future for the entire fishing industry.  I welcome the establishment of this institute.  I feel that it can only do good for the entire coastal area, for the entire fishing industry and for the benefit of the economy in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Donovan, I too, would like to welcome this Bill to establish a marine institute.  The potential <Col N="1970" /> of the marine is enormous.  Its full potential becomes apparent with each passing day.  The amount of research and development expenditure on the marine in this country is very small indeed.  One might go so far as to say it is almost harmless.  One estimate I have is that it is of the order of perhaps £1 million to £2 million being spent on research and development in all of this area.  The establishment of the institute will certainly provide a focus for that expenditure and for the badly needed to be made case for much greater investment in research and development on the marine.  I also think that the establishment of the institute, and to co-ordination of effort which will, of necessity, follow from its establishment, will result in much better value for money being obtained from what will be invested.</P>
      <P>The idea of a marine institute is not new in this country.  I understand that the idea was first tossed around in the seventies.  It was suggested in a report published by the OECD as long ago as 1975.  There has been a variety of reasons why it has not become a reality in the meantime.  It is fair to say there was a considerable degree of in-fighting about who would have control of it.  When the institute is established it is very important that we learn the lessons which are to be drawn from the in-fighting and from the anxiety of various groups to become, as it were, dominant in this area and that concerted effort is made to prevent that recurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that one of the most important ways in which that can be done is by defining as a fundamental the functions of the institute.  I believe when those functions are defined the establishment of the structures will follow from that definition rather than having things the other way around.  My view is that the structures should be loose to some extent. I do not know that it is highly desirable that one big marine research centre as it were be established.  Rather the institute might work more effectively if it acts to co-ordinate and focus the efforts of research and development which are at present being made rather than that it <Col N="1971" /> should be located as some type of prize in some centre or another.</P>
    <P>Another vital aspect of the development and proper functioning of the Institute will be the board.  There will be a great responsibility on the board and I certainly wish the Minister well when he appoints the members because in the appointment of the board he will lay the foundations either for success or failure. If he gets the proper levels of expertise, people of vision, then there will be a great opportunity to reach full potential.  If, on the other hand, the Minister gets things wrong it will be a false start and in many ways it will be very very difficult to correct the loss of the important initial impetus.</P>
    <P>At present there is not, as far as I am aware, any national programme in marine research.  The potential is great. One indicator of the extent of the potential is the fact that perhaps in 1975 the potential of aquaculture was still in its infancy. Now it is a considerable industry, as the Senators from those parts of the country where it is important have made very clear during this debate.  I am seeking to emphasise the fact that that development has taken place in a very short period of time.  In the 1960s the idea of aquaculture would have been laughed at.  It certainly would not have been a realistic possibility. Now in the 1990s it is a reality. The fact that we have seen those great changes in aquaculture can be used to illustrate the potential for further great changes down the line in the wonderful natural resource which this country is blessed with in the form of its marine resources.  There is an enormous Continental Shelf around this country and that provides us with a tremendous potential for a whole variety of developments.</P>
    <P>There is a question of the minerals which may be available in that marine shelf.  There is the question of exploiting the fisheries, the exploitation of aquaculture, there is the question of the development of marine technology.  A whole industry could be based around developing technology which can be used <Col N="1972" /> in exploiting the marine resources.  It would be very worthwhile for the institute to look at the possibilities and seek to exploit whatever opportunities are available to us.</P>
    <P>Another reason I am very happy to support this Bill is that it will provide us with a means by which we can fully exploit the enormous opportunities in the area of the marine in Europe.  At present I understand there is quite good co-operation between Irish marine scientists and the Germans.  Now we have a great opportunity with the establishment of this institute to shape the direction in which European research development in the area of the marine develops.  If we do that, it should provide us with a very worthwhile resource: in other words, that we push the direction of European research and development into those areas which will most benefit us.  If we stand back from it and if the Marine Institute does not develop properly, then our influence in Europe will remain marginal. That would represent a great loss of opportunity.  The future here in this area is by means of co-operation with our European partners.  We need to be involved in establishing and developing these research and development programmes. The potential there is really very significant.</P>
    <P>On some points of this Bill there are aspects which I would like to see clarified. For example, I would like clarification on what the nature of the relationship will be between the universities and the institute. In particular I would like clarification on where the research centre for Carna will finish up.  That centre has, in my view, done tremendous work over the years but in the recent past it has had a very troubled history and has had great difficulty obtaining funding for its research work.  It is very important that such a centre be located wherever it can best serve the interests of the whole marine industry.  I do not want to pretend I know the answer.  It is very important that consideration be given to what the role for Carna will be, how the centre will be funded and what its relationship will be with the institute and with the <Col N="1973" /> universities.  On a point of detail I understand that marine research is not defined in the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>In relation to the institute, when it is established I would be in favour of something along the lines of a five to ten years research programme.  It is very important that we make the investment in terms of developing excellence in those areas of research which are most relevant to the marine industry.  Of course, when you come down to the essentials, it is very important that we have a clear view of where the marine industry is going because, research and development for the most part will have to serve the needs of the marine industry.  It is very important that we put the horse in front of the cart rather than, as happened in some instances in this country in the past, have it the other way around.  It is very important that the institute be involved with the industry and that clear objectives be defined in relation to where the industry is going.  Then the research and development back-up should be provided, given that the objectives for the industry have been established.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the range of activities covered by the Bill involve many areas of the marine and in particular the recreational aspects.  I am glad to see it has within its ambit considerations that relate to social as well as economic factors, factors which relate to infrastructural support, that relate to the development of technology.  I am pleased, as someone who was born quite close to the town of Kilrush in County Clare, that the Marine Institute has the capacity to contribute research and development support for projects such as the marina which is at present being established there.  I am very pleased that its scope will cover the various social and economic considerations, factors that relate to the infrastructure which will be absolutely essential if projects such as the marina in Kilrush are to reach their full potential.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé an-áthas orm fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo faoin a bhfuil sé i gceist institiúid mara a <Col N="1974" /> bhunú.  Is dócha, nuair a smaoinítear gur mó na farraigí atá timpeall orainn ná an t-oileán seo, go bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith anois ag baint le forbairt ar ár nacmhainní mara.  San mBille seo tá béim ar dhá rud, ar thaighde agus ar fhorbairt.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a very important Bill particularly when we consider the scope of our marine resources.  Most areas and aspects of marine life and development have been covered by the various speakers.  I would like to concentrate in the first place on the question of research and of standards.  There is a need in the greenfield context for pure research, for research that would be totally independent in its funding of any commercial organisations.  In setting up this institute it is very important that resources are given to it so that it can set standards for the industry.  With the development of mariculture &mdash; it is a welcome development and we all look forward to progress in this area in the years to come &mdash; many questions have arisen particularly in relation to standards. It is very important that there is an independent agency there whose function is to set the standard for this industry to do the research so that these standards can be set.</P>
      <P>In regard to licensing, it will also be important that independent research and information are available so that the issuing of licences can be done in an organised and an informed way.  As we are all aware the use of chemicals in the fishing industry has grown dramatically since aquaculture was developed.  Therefore, it is very important that independent research be carried out, that it be totally independent either of the companies producing these chemicals or the end users, to monitor these chemicals and to assess the effects they have on various species of marine life and on the quality of water. Similarly, it is also important that the effects of various types of fishing on each other are monitored independently so that we have available independent evidence when making our decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I see a second role for the institute, a role I have no problem with, namely, accepting and charging fees, that <Col N="1975" /> is on an agency basis doing work for the various interests involved in marine development.  I see it providing information and data, whether it is for people involved in aquaculture or fishing, in dealing with the problems that arise from time to time.  I can also see it playing a role in the development of various types of products and in monitoring the performance of these products.</P>
    <P>The scope of this Bill is immense when we look at the total resource we have in the sea.  As is mentioned in the Bill, there are matters such as fisheries, aquaculture, the non-living resources, marine engineering electronics, amenity recreation and so on.  I do not intend going into detail into all these things but it is quite obvious that if developed properly this Marine Institute could have a great bearing on the future development of this country, particularly of the coastal areas, which are so urgently in need of development. Our knowledge of the sea we would have to admit is very small.  For example, we do not know completely the effects of tides and ocean currents.  This has become a matter of very urgent information with the development of the aquaculture industry.  Therefore, the general sphere of oceanography will become a much greater part of the whole fishing and marine scene in the years to come than it has been heretofore.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton mentioned the question of the universities.  I see their role as one complementing that of the role envisaged for the Marine Institute, particularly as I understand that in principle it has been decided that the headquarters of this institute will be in Galway.  That is fitting in view of the fact that Galway also has a very strong marine biology department in the University where a lot of very useful research has been carried on.  I hope when this institute is developed that the marine research station in Carna will not only be retained but will be developed because on the west coast, particularly on the coast of Connemara, some of the most potentially rich resources are located.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody living on <Col N="1976" /> the west coast could speak on this subject of fishing and fishermen without saying a few general words regarding the fishing scene in the west of Ireland particularly. We have had the introduction of quotas in the past few years and, therefore, as was pointed out by Senator Fitzgerald it is very important that the continuing exploration for new species and the development of those species is pursued. You then have the whole question of the development of shellfish farming and of fin fish farming and the debate that is very much a live issue as to the counter or interdependent effect on each other. There are people in the west who are very concerned about the effects of the explosion of fin fish farming in that area and they are conerned about its effect on natural marine life.</P>

      <P>I was speaking about the effect of aquaculture and fin fish farming on marine life in general.  It is very important that urgent research is carried out on the effects of one type of fish farming and one type of aquaculture on general marine life in the bays.  This is a problem that will not go away.  It is in the interests of the fin fish farmers that this research be carried out.  It is in their interest that the possible pollution problems that are believed to be there be solved, that any damage that might be caused by chemicals be addressed and rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great belief in the ability of mankind when faced with problems to find solutions to them.  Too often when <Col N="1977" /> we encounter problems we think that rather than finding a way around them we give up a particular type of development. I would not see it in that light at all but I think there are several issues that have to be addressed urgently.  One of those is, obviously the effect of chemicals that are used in aquaculture.  A second matter that is causing concern is the effect of the residue from these fish farms on the seabed and their effect on the indigenous species of fish in the sea.  The third problem we face is the problem of disease on fish farms themselves.  I have no doubt that if tackled in a positive way this can be overcome.  We have seen it happen in other spheres but it is very important at this stage since there has been such an explosion in the volume of fin fish farmed on the coast, that we take stock of the position and that the problems be addressed before further major development takes place.</P>
    <P>I would also be concerned that too much development not co-ordinated with this research and with market development and added-value product development could also harm in the long-term the fish farms that already exist by causing a glut of a standard product on the market which the market could not take.  It is important on this issue that all the interests be consulted and, again, this is one of the very important rôles that this Marine Institute will play.  In particular, it is very important that where this type of development is taking place the views of the community, their fears and their hopes will be taken into account and given the priority they deserve.</P>
    <P>As I have said before in this House, on the west coast shellfish and shellfish farming have tended to be the poor relation when it came to aquacultural development.  This indigenous resource is totally under-exploited, under-funded and under-developed.  We have to ensure that the full value is achieved from this source.  It has the advantage that it is totally reliant on the indigenous feed from the sea and, therefore, the added value for it is greater than in other forms of fish farming.  It also has the advantage that it is a non-pollutant.  However, this <Col N="1978" /> type of fish farming needs considerable development and I hope the necessary resources will be made available for this purpose.  We must recognise in this rôle that we will not get a return overnight but I look with considerable interest at the development, for example, of the mussel fisheries in Killery harbour.  I know in that small project itself there is a huge possibility of development and of creating downstream activities.</P>
    <P>Most people in this country do not associate Ireland as a place where we do our own development of technical resources but rather import most of our technical equipment.  One thing I welcome in this Bill and in the Minister's speech is the emphasis on marine engineering and the development of electronics to do with marine resources.  I saw a very good example of what a small country can do in this regard in connection with the timber industry when I had the opportunity to visit Finland and look at the tremendous technical developments they had made in providing their own timber milling equipment which is now being exported worldwide.  They did that from a very low base 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>With our own high technical skills based on all types of marine activity and on our reputed skills in electronics, there is no reason we could not be a net exporter of this type of equipment if we put our mind to it but in this context we have to face up to our own lack of self-confidence in these fields.  It seems to me a tragedy that the performance of our graduates who are doing this work worldwide is not concentrated in getting this development within this country.  I would see the Marine Institute playing a leading role in encouraging people to get involved in this sphere of activity because more and more the employment potential of every type of industry is not in basic farming or in basic fishing but in the spin-off industries, in the provision of equipment, of added-value products, of processing, and the provision of services. I would see a huge role for the Institute in developing a much broader vision of the whole marine industry than is generally accepted at the moment.  At <Col N="1979" /> present most people see fishing as the fishermen in the boats, as the aquaculture people involved and maybe processing.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the sea there is one thing that perhaps merits more research than has been given to it over the years in the line of marine biology and that is the whole question of seaweed and the potential resource we have in the sea.  I would hope that this Marine Institute will carry out significant further research into the possible economic exploitation of this resource that is so abundant around our coasts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the potential for developing Tourism on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister.  I would inform the House that by the year 2000 tourism will be the world's biggest industry.  As Europe will attract the greatest number of visitors, Ireland must have overcome impediments and be ready to achieve its proper share of the market.  In this context it is salutary to remind the House that while tourism has grown substantially in <Col N="1980" /> the 1980s, some 21.3 per cent of growth is recorded particularly in Europe &mdash; in real terms Ireland's share of the market has declined by minus 5 per cent.  Compare this against some of our European neighbours such as Turkey where tourism has increased by 123 per cent in less time, in four years, and Iceland is up 70 per cent.  We are heavily dependent on the friends and relatives market, with 31.8 per cent of the total coming into Ireland. So it is obvious that we need an overall strategy to increase our share of the tourism market which worldwide is worth a staggering $100 billion.</P>
    <P>The Government in 1987 decided to give tourism a higher emphasis than ever before by appointing a tourism Minister with full Cabinet rank charged with getting our tourism industry on a proper footing going into the nineties.  That decision has already begun to pay dividends, as the operational programme for tourism in the National Development Plan indicates.</P>
    <P>The subject matter of this motion is that we should be encouraging the promotion and marketing of Ireland on an all-Ireland basis.  I am sure all sides of the House will agree with the sentiments expressed there.  In the context of a wider Europe it is imperative that Ireland does have a joint approach to attracting overseas visitors.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry in this part of Ireland has been set the target of doubling tourism in the five years 1988-93.  The implications are that we must operate it at an entirely different level.  It will be and is a highly challenging aspiration. Bord Fáilte, who are the main outlet for developing, promoting and marketing tourism in this country, have adopted stragegies &mdash; four in particular &mdash; which are interdependent.  The first is product strategy.  They are introducing and selling a range of tourist products that will open new markets for us.  I am thinking here of the specialised holidays, such as golfing holidays, walking trails, equestrian, angling.  They will also continue, of course, to sell the existing product based on scenery, people and relaxed atmosphere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> The second strategy is competitiveness. They are currently developing a number of approaches designed to either reduce price, improve quality or add value and a decision has been taken, which I am sure will be welcomed, to promote only the best as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>The third part of their strategy is market penetration and promotion.  Bord Fáilte's approach is designed to take business from the competition by providing more and better reasons for visiting Ireland, securing a greater customer loyalty, thereby obtaining repeat business and entering new geographic market areas.  Bord Fáilte have, of course, stepped up their promotion and reorganised themselves for greater effectiveness and efficiency in this area.</P>
    <P>The fourth part of their strategy is distribution. Central to securing the growth that we require in Ireland is the need to ensure that our product is available at a point of purchase in the form that the consumer requires and Bord Fáilte have put in place the trade network required and also have introduced an international computerised reservation system.</P>
    <P>Looking at it in specific terms and at the question of how one can attract some people to the island of Ireland, transport capacity from Europe is a concern, with the ferry services in particular not expanding in line with the anticipated growth in demand.  On that point I hope the Government will take note of a recent report which indicated that the Dublin-Holyhead gateway to Europe was not receiving the investment and attention that perhaps it should in the context of the opening of the Channel tunnel and the wider implications of Europe post-1992. It is imperative that we as a nation and the island of Ireland should quickly accommodate ourselves to the new situation that we will find ourselves in after 1992.  There is no doubt that there will be an immediate and significant increase in traffic, both commercial and tourist, into Great Britain post-1992.  It would be tragic in a tourist context if Ireland were not to gear itself now for the changes that will take place from that period onwards.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the economic significance of tourism is something that most of us <Col N="1982" /> are aware of, but for the record it is important to note that the contribution that tourism makes to the national economy includes, for example, earning foreign exchange and this is particularly important in a small open economy like Ireland's.  It is all the more important when one considers the extremely low import content of the tourism product. Tourism by its nature is based on indigenous resources, both natural and manmade. Earnings from foreign tourism on average represent 6 to 6.5 per cent of total export earnings.  In the last 12 months tourism was the second most important foreign revenue earning sector after the computer industry.  Tourism also yields substantial income to the Government through indirect taxation.  It is estimated that in 1988 the Exchequer earnings were just over £410 million in tax revenue exclusively from tourism activity within Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the most important contributions, of course, which tourism makes to the economy is in the area of employment.  Approximately 69,000 jobs were created in 1988.  Of these just over 44,000 were supported by out of State expenditure, the remainder by the domestic market.  This represents 7.5 per cent of non-agricultural employment and 11 per cent of service sector employment. In 1988 over 69,000 jobs were supported by tourism activity.  I repeat that figure because it is significant.  On average, it takes about £18,000 of export tourism revenue to support one job in this country.  The comparable figure for domestic tourism revenue is £20,000.  To put this in context for the House, it means that on average we need about 40 US tourists, 85 French tourists or 65 German tourists to support just one job.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties facing the development of tourism.  In the context of the motion, unfortunately, not least among those problems are the ongoing difficulties in Northern Ireland.  The continuing political and military confrontations in that part of our country have seriously impeded Ireland's image as an island and have hampered the efforts of those in tourism to condition people to consider Ireland as a holiday destination.  Bord Fáilte over the past <Col N="1983" /> 12 months have launched new television campaigns in certain key markets, such as the United States and Britain, to try to overcome his problem.</P>
    <P>But, the Northern Ireland problem is but one of many that need to be addressed.  The abuse of our environment is a serious difficulty and I am glad to say that in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Community the Green Presidency of Ireland will go some considerable way to reducing and eventually eliminating many of the environmental problems that have come with our relative affluence in the last two decades.</P>
    <P>Also, for many years tourism lobbies have been making representations to successive Governments about the rate of VAT and excise duties, particularly applying to car hire and coach hire.  I am particularly pleased that in the recent budget a start has at last been made in reducing punitive taxes particularly in VAT and excise rates.  This is bound to have a spin-off advantage in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>Problems relating to crimes against tourists, particularly in the Dublin area, have given this country a bad image in recent years.  It is a problem that all emerging or highly developed countries have had to face and I do not think that Ireland is any different from many of the countries in the developed world in having to combat this type of urban violence which is so indiscriminate in its execution.  It is unfortunate for Ireland, which has a huge dependence on tourism. But these are isolated incidents.  Taking Dublin out of the picture, on a national basis incidents of muggings of tourists are isolated.  It is unfortunate, because it has not been our tradition to abuse tourists in this way, that the media, obviously, will highlight these cases, more in a strange, wondering way rather than in attempting to damage the image of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another issue in recent years which obviously hampered our development, particularly in the angling area, was the ongoing rod licence dispute.  While as I speak there are yet to be important meetings held in the west to make a decision on the recent initiatives of the Minister for the Marine, it is heartening <Col N="1984" /> to note that as of this time a number of the associations representing fishing interests have already met and have welcomed the Minister's initiative.  I would like to go on the record of the House in congratulating the Minister for the Marine in what has been a difficult and protracted dispute.  I admire him for his negotiating and diplomatic skills in bringing this problem to a speedy and happy conclusion, as now seems to be the case.</P>
    <P>The cost of access transport from some of our overseas markets has also been a problem in inhibiting tourism development here, especially from countries such as Italy, Scandinavia and Spain.  The recent decision of the European Community to resolve finally the difficulties that Aer Lingus had faced with fifth freedom rights operating on their Dublin/Manchester/Milan route is to be welcomed as it obviously will mean that there will be better opportunities for growth in the Italian tourist sector and more Italians visiting this country.  In regard to Ireland's participation in the forthcoming World Cup in Italy many Irish people will be visiting Italy.  Considering the tremendous positive contribution that Irish football fans made to the image of Ireland when we participated in the European championships, if the same level of behaviour is repeated in Italy, and I have absolutely no reason to doubt it, it is bound to have spin-off benefits and advantages for Ireland as a country.</P>
    <P>Prices across the board cause difficulties for us as a tourist nation but there is one other problem.  I touched on this in a previous debate but I feel it bears repeating in the context of this motion. It is the ongoing problem of unapproved accommodation which is not subject to meeting the requirements of any statutory authority and does not have to satisfy fire, health, VAT or rates obligations. This is something which needs to be addressed by the Government.  Under the Tourist Traffic Acts, Bord Fáilte have statutory responsibility for the registration and approval of tourist accommodation. The registration and approval system is however voluntary in that proprietors of accommodation may or may <Col N="1985" /> not choose to have their premises registered with and approved by Bord Fáilte. For many years, indeed going back to 1975, Bord Fáilte have been seeking legislation to license all tourist accommodation. Many detailed submissions have been made to successive Governments and these have had the full support and backing of the tourist industry.  I believe it is essential that the visitor to this country is accorded statutory protection, particularly in the area of basic needs such as accommodation and food. While the unapproved sector is precluded from all Bord Fáilte marketing, promotional and development activities, it inevitably benefits from the spin-off effect of Bord Fáilte's national advertising. Yet it does not contribute in any way to the cost of this, unlike the approved sector.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte estimate, by sample surveying, that the ratio of unapproved accommodation in this country is three to one.  This implies that the total number of units of unapproved accommodation available to visitors totals approximately 7,000.  I believe, and I repeat, that the only effective way to deal with the problem posed by the unapproved bed and breakfast establishments is to enact comprehensive and effective legislation, imposing severe penalties for breach.  We are dealing with an extremely important market in relation to the economy.  When one considers that there are upwards of 7,000 bed and breakfast units operating outside the constraints and the registration procedure of Bord Fáilte, the body charged with maintaining standards in our industry, it is past time that legislation was considered in that area.</P>
    <P>Tourism, as I said at the outset, is now a priority area for investment.  The Government recognise the economic benefits that will arise from the doubling of tourist numbers over the next five years.  In order to achieve the targets set by the Government for the industry, Bord Fáilte have formulated an exciting product development strategy which will shape the tourism industry over the next few years so that it will meet the challenge of accommodating an additional two million visitors by 1992.  The target set for <Col N="1986" /> tourism cannot be achieved by a marketing drive only but must be accompanied by substantial and sustained investment.  It is evident that potential for investment exists and currently Bord Fáilte are aware of proposed investments in this country to the scale of over £1 billion.  The task of Bord Fáilte is to bring this investment to fruition so that it can impact on the tourism targets and generate economic benefits both in terms of employment generated and export revenue earnings.</P>
    <P>Various investment incentives are now available to anyone who wishes to invest in and contribute to the development of Irish tourism.  Here again the Minister for Tourism and Transport is to be commended on being among the first of his Government colleagues actually to bring forward a plan to the public based on our recent allocation of Structural Fund money.  I am aware, of course, that other Government Departments will be presenting plans in their own areas.  The following incentives and interventions are currently available; business expansion schemes, which are already beginning to bear fruit around the country, especially in the area of hotel development, and the International Fund for Ireland.  Of course Bord Fáilte, as consultants to the IFI, administer two schemes on behalf of the fund under the tourism programmes &mdash; the accommodation amenity scheme and the tourism amenity scheme.  The purpose of the schemes is to encourage the provision of recreational and leisure facilities at hotels and other accommodation and to improve the range of tourism facilities in order to attract increased tourism to both parts of Ireland but in particular to the Border area.  Grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost are available towards the provision of a wide range of facilities and amenities.  The grant schemes under the IFI have achieved major investment in the Border counties.  Naturally, coming from a Border county, I welcome this initiative and pray that it continues because for the first time since the foundation of the State, or certainly since tourism became a major factor in our economy, the input of private investment money for the development of tourist <Col N="1987" /> amenities and accommodation is very significant and on-going.</P>
    <P>In the context of the International Fund for Ireland I would also welcome the recent decision of the Government to include in their operational programme for tourism development to 1993 the decision that work on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal will go ahead.  This project which will cost between £15 million and £20 million, made up of Irish, IFI and European Structural Fund money, will be one of the biggest economic inputs into the life of my part of the country since the foundation of the State.  I can only recommend to the Minister and to the Government that they initiate the scheme.  The ESB, who have the contract for this development, should be given every assistance to get it up and running so that the first boats will start coming through the Leitrim lock within the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>In addition, the IFI have also indicated their support in principle for a national reservations and tourism information system and an all-Ireland computerised genealogy system, two matters which, in an all-Ireland context, can only help to improve the tourist numbers into Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the area of incentives Bord Fáilte have opened an investment advice centre at their Baggot Street head office in Dublin.  This facility enables the general public to obtain advice and information on all aspects of tourism investment.  The centre is open full time and provides information on incentives, tax concessions, services provided by Bord Fáilte, general information on legislation relative to the tourism industry and details of investment opportunities on a broad range of tourism activities.</P>
    <P>We are living in exciting times for Irish tourism.  With the input of Structural Fund money, the International Fund for Ireland money and private investment coming from various sectors on an on-going basis, it looks like the targets which the Government have set for the tourism industry will not only be met but will be exceeded.  In that context it would benefit all of Ireland if all the various component parts of the tourism industry helping to attract the visitor to this island were encouraged to ensure that, when the next <Col N="1988" /> set of statistics on tourism growth into the early nineties are published, Ireland will not be showing a net decline but a net increase.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  It is timely that the motion comes before this House because at present the EC are spending a substantial amount of money encouraging the development of our tourist industry.  We cannot continue to isolate ourselves and develop the tourist industry without recognising that the North and South together make up a very small patch in the world.  There is a readiness in the North to recognise that by joining together we can do a very good promotional job, eliminate waste and be much more effective in our marketing campaign.  We should now respond in a positive way to the signs from the North that they are prepared to accept a joint approach.</P>
      <P>I think the EC will be ready to match funding of any programme we put forward. We have a duty to identify areas where it is possible to promote industry and provide jobs.  There are areas North and South, where the potential for providing additional jobs is restricted. Money can be spent usefully in the promotion of tourism and worthwhile jobs will be created from the development of the tourism industry.  It behoves all of us to recognise the job potential of the tourist industry.  Money cannot be spent without having consideration for the overall development plan of the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Every village in Ireland wants to produce coloured brochures because they feel that their area will be left out if they do not have as good a brochure as the bigger town or village.  It has to be recog-nised that this kind of piecemeal marketing is not getting us anywhere.  There are about six brochures on County Donegal and perhaps six on Galway and Kerry also.  This has to be confusing for tourists. There is a very expensive brochure on cruising holidays in County Fermanagh, while further up in Enniskillen, there is more massive advertising.  It has become apparent that there is a need for co-ordination and a joint approach in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> The EC will not provide grant funding continuously for the next ten years and it would be a tragedy if we miss the opportunity of the structural fund support we are now getting.  This country may have to join with the authorities in the North in putting new structures in place to jointly promote tourism.  But there is no point in paying lip service to it.  If the head of the tourist board in the North expresses the wish that we market the island jointly, and the head of Bord Fáilte expresses the same wish in Dublin, that is all right while we are watching television back home; but really we have to move to market the nation here because at the end of the day we are still a very small island with a very small population when compared with the European scene.  I would therefore urge the Minister to press the Government to take some positive steps to organise a joint marketing campaign.  I have met many groups across the Border who are prepared to enter into a joint venture.</P>
    <P>In the area from Bundoran to Limavady we have had no difficulties in forming a new tourism structure called NorthWest of Ireland, but even this is only piecemeal.  It is only tackling the overall problem in a small way.  Even people who differ from us politically are prepared to join with us to market the island as a unit. There is a little part in my own county of Donegal where there are about 130 lakes. How many people in Europe know that there are 130 lakes to be found within a radius of a couples of miles, all of them stocked and ready for fishing?  This is what makes me enthusiastic about supporting the calls for a joint marketing venture with our friends across the Border, who have exactly the same problem. The political scene is changing to the point where we must recognise that, whether we like it or not, we are going to have to join together to work for the common good.  I would strongly urge the Minister to continue to press the Government in this regard.  I know there is no lack of commitment or enthusiasm in getting better value for money in the promotion of the tourist industry.  I hope that this motion in the Seanad will receive unanimous support and that it will be recognised as our attempt to highlight <Col N="1990" /> something that is long overdue and crying out to be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no problem with this motion before the House today.  I am glad the Government party have tabled the motion and given us an opportunity of discussing the possiblities that lie on both sides of the Border with regard to tourism.  We are now entering an era of great potential and promise for tourism in the whole island of Ireland.  While there has been much talk and a genuine drive by the present Minister, Bord Fáilte and many others interested in tourism, I often wonder if we are making the desired progress.  I have always felt that tourism was the poor relation when it came to Government decisions.  I am old enough to remember the time when few tourists came to this country.  The war in the forties interfered with the arrival of the first tourists but thereafter there was a great influx from the Continent and from other parts of the world.  It would appear that we needed to do little or nothing to encourage the foreigner to visit our shores.  However, I do not think this was a good thing for us because it made us lazy and in many instances it made those who were benefiting from the visitor greedy and there was a lot of overcharging.  The fifties and sixties were a great period for tourism in Ireland until the start of the troubles in the North.  That put a black cloud over the entire island as far as foreign visitors were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the sixties and seventies a lot of money was spent on roads and major grants were given to Bord Fáilte and local authorities to improve the roads to facilitate the tourist in getting from one town to another; but little else was done and I regret that.  Every town in Ireland has a great heritage, one that we need not be ashamed of, and information on these towns is sought by people from every corner of the earth.  We did not do enough in past years; we probably concentrated on the wrong aspects.  While road improvements were very welcome, not only for tourists but for the natives, it was not enough to attract tourists.  In many instances in recent times tourists have told me that it is not the wide and <Col N="1991" /> improved roads in the west that attract tourists &mdash; I know the Senator on my immediate right might not like to hear me say that &mdash; but rather it is the narrow roads that attract them.</P>
    <P>We need to put a new emphasis on tourism.  While I do not disagree with some of the figures that have been mentioned here this evening regarding the increase in tourism over the last couple of years, I believe we have not reached anything near the potential that is there and has been there over the last few years.  Let us remember that the weather played a very significant part in bringing new tourists to our shores.</P>
    <P>I believe the Irish people generally have not appreciated the value of tourism. The Government over the last few years have been putting extra emphasis on tourism.  There have been a lot of fanfares and trumpet blowing, but how many people have taken notice?  How many people today would be able to tell you that this is the European Year of Tourism?  A special launching took place in Dublin Castle in the last week of January, but it got very little publicity.  It merely got mention in the papers but how many people took any notice of it?  We have to devise a programme to educate the public on the great value of the tourist trade.  We are entering an era now where it could be our greatest industry.  Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations are doing quite a good job and are bringing to the notice of more and more people each year the value of tourism, but the rate is not fast enough.</P>
    <P>Too little attention has been paid to tourism by many local authorities and by the general public.  There needs to be far greater co-operation between local authorities and the regional tourism organisations and it is of the utmost importance that we get this co-operation. When Bord Fáilte set up the regional tourist organisations many local authorities felt that if they appointed members, that was their share in so far as tourism was concerned and that is a great pity.  Even in my own local authority I find it very difficult to get the members to realise the value of tourism. It should be easier for local authorities in <Col N="1992" /> other places of the country, but in the Dublin area we are inclined to leave it to Bord Fáilte.  Indeed, recently when I sought an increase of £2,000 in the allocation to Bord Fáilte I could not even get it on the agenda, and that is to be deplored.  It shows a lack of interest from the other members of the local authority. However, that is a matter I will take up in that body on another day.</P>
    <P>The general public have a far greater role to play in attracting tourists to this country.  I disagree somewhat with what the previous speaker has said about there being too many brochures around.  I have always found in my travels in the past in different countries that every town had published a booklet or leaflet.  I do not think all that information can be put into one comprehensive booklet.  Each town is an individual place and, even if the information is put into a comprehensive booklet, it is inclined to be lost.  With due deference to Senator McGowan, I think it is important that every town should have its own booklet.  In Dublin county we have started such projects.  We had the launching of the Balbriggan heritage project last week and, with the assistance of Dublin County Council and a local heritage committee we issued three booklets.  We are doing the same in Tallaght. I am all in favour of that.  These places are referred to in a comprehensive brochure from Bord Fáilte, but let each town have its own promotion.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking &mdash; I forget whether it was in this House or the other House when I was there &mdash; about a town in the Minister's own county which I believe has tremendous potential.  It is off the beaten track, but if there was a committee working in that town it would attract far more visitors.  The visitor is inclined to want to go off the beaten track but he is not encouraged to do so because we do not have this type of publication. The town I refer to is Athenry, which I believe has great potential and a great history.  It is a most interesting place but has far too few visitors, even native visitors. I am not talking so much about the foreign visitor as the native visitor, but it would attract foreigners as well.</P>
    <P>We have got to educate the general <Col N="1993" /> public to avoid littering.  Despite legislation being passed by the Oireachtas, quite an amount of littering is still going on.  A short distance from this capital city you can still see abandoned cars, washing machines, fridges, television sets &mdash; all sorts of household appliances which are just carted out by individuals and dumped on the mountainside or in ditches along the roads in Dublin county and adjacent counties.  We have to educate the public not to do that, because no matter what laws are passed &mdash; and stiff fines have been imposed in a number of cases which have been brought to the courts in my own county &mdash; the problem seems to be increasing and there is no slacking off of this kind of dumping.  Domestic appliances not made to last as long now and, if one gets a new washing machine, there is a difficulty in getting rid of the old one.  Thankfully, in Dublin county we have a programme whereby our tipheads are open to the general public for a minimal charge of 50p and that alleviates the problem somewhat.  But there are some people who will not pay even that 50p and will not go as far as the tiphead. This is destroying the appearance of our countryside and affecting the environment. A few short years ago our environment played a vital part in attracting people to our shores but I am afraid that is not the case now.  Unless steps are taken to correct the situation the tourist trade will no doubt suffer.</P>
    <P>One problem that dissuades visitors from abroad is the fact that the IDA attract chemical firms to this country.  I firmly believe there is a great future for our country with regard to tourism.  As I said earlier, I can see it becoming our greatest industry if we harness it correctly. I believe there are hundreds of thousands of Europeans and people further afield in America and Australia waiting to come to our land because of our clean environment.  I hope the Government will pay attention to this and to try to keep our environment clean.  I would like to see co-operation and discussions between Bord Fáilte and the IDA in this regard.  I have the figures for the increase in the activities of the chemical industry in Ireland over the past few years and it <Col N="1994" /> is quite frightening.  I hope there will be that co-operation between those two bodies.</P>

      <P>Is trua liom nach bhfuil an tAire Stáit Oideachais, An Teachta Fahey, ag fanacht linn mar ba mhaith liom píosa cainte a dhéanamh leis faoi bhóithre Chonamara agus thuigfeadh sé go maith é.  Tá sclaigeanna sna bóithre. Ní gnáth scéal é seo.  Is finnscéal é.  Tá amhráin cumtha faoi; tá ailt scríofa faoi i ngach páipéar sa tír seo.  Tá sé scríofa go laethúil, go seachtainiúil.  Fiú amháin tá gluaiseacht pholaitiúil ann.  Is é an chloch is mó ar a bpaidrín é, ceist na mbóithre i gConamara.  Taispeánann sé sin agus léiríonn sé dúinn cé chomh dona is cé chomh práinneach is atá ceist na mbóithre i gConamara.  Go deimhin, tá sé ráite go hoifigiúil ag an innealtoir contae i nGaillimh go dteastódh uaidh £15 mhilliún le caoi éigin a chur ar bhóithre an chontae.  Tá a fhios ag chuile dhuine anseo gurb é an seanscéal é an chaint sin, mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar.</P>
      <P>Níl seans dá laghad go mbeadh an méid sin airgid ar fáil i mbliana nó an bhliain seo chugainn, agus, idir an dá linn, tá leatrom mór á dhéanamh ar mhuintir Chonamara, ó thuaidh agus ó dheas, Gaeltacht agus Galltacht, ón chladach ó thuaidh go dtí an Cheathrú Rua ó dheas, ón Chlochán thiar go dtí an Bearna thoir. Sin í an áit, dar liomsa, agus sin é an ceantar a bhfuil leatrom uafásach déanta air ó thaobh bhóithre agus ó thaobh smacht agus slacht a chur ar bhóithre Chonamara.  Tá na bóithre seo siúlta arís agus arís eile agamsa agus ag mo leithéidse agus tá a fhios agaibh nár dhúirt mé gur i ngluaisteán a bhí mé, gur siúlta a bhí siad, mar is beag bealach go bhféadfadh duine ar bith eile dhul ar chuid mhaith de na bóithre seo ach de shiúl na gcos.</P>
      <P>An té a thabharfadh gluaisteán nó cairt ar chuid de na bóithre seo, ní amháin go mbeadh an carr i gcontúirt, ach bheadh a anam féin i gcontúirt chomh maith céanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> Tosóidh muid thiar i gCarna, an áit thiar, tiocfaidh muid aniar bealach Charna, na fobhailte amach uaidh, na bóithre bailte síos go Ros Muc, Camus, ceantair na n-oileán, Ceathrú Rua, Cois Fharraige, Cnoc Aduaidh &mdash; sin iad na bóithre a bhfuilimid ag caint futhu, agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil an rún seo agam anocht anseo.  Níl aon cheantar de na ceantair sin atá luaite agam nach bhfuil fíor dhroch bhóithre ann.  Tá dallamullóg, geáitsíocht agus cur i gcéill ag an Rialtas seo i leith bhóithre Chonamara.  Cheapfadh daoine gur ábhar spraoi é, gur ábhar magaidh é, agus gur gáire é.</P>
    <P>Tá an tír siúlta agamsa, nuair a bhí mé ag dul thart ag iarraidh vótaí a chruinniú le chéile le haghaidh an tSeanaid agus d'fhéadfainn a rá gan fhaitíos nach bhfuil ceantar bóithre in aon chuid den tír seo atá inchurtha le bóithre Chonamara ó thaobh alltacht agus donas bóithre de. Agus ní i gConamara féin, agus an fáth gur trua liom nach raibh an tAire Stáit Fahey anseo nuair a bhí mé ag caint. Bhí sé féin agus mé féin ag cruinniú oíche Dé Luain seo caite in áit ar a dtugtar Orán Mór agus bhí an cheantair sin ag rá go raibh bóithre thart ar Orán Mór níos measa fós ná aon bhóthar i gConamara.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, is é an sean scéal céanna é agus is é an finscéal céanna é gur labhair mé ó thús air: is cuma cén áit a dtiocfaidh tú i gContae na Gaillimhe, níl bóthar le dul ann.  Is iad na bóithre is mó atá buailte go dona ná na bóithre bailte; na bóithre ag dul síos sna bailte, chuig an trá, na bóithre ag dul ó thuaidh sna bailte, áit a bhfuil cúig, sé nó seacht gcinn de thithe, áit a bhfuil sclaigeanna bóthair chomh mór sin anois ann go bhfuil tearmann le fáil ag an iasc féin ann.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfadh an t-iasc a dhul ann agus fanacht ann agus gan a bheith in ann teacht air.  Tá an scéal chomh dona sin go bhfuil comhairleoir contae ó Fhianna Fáil fiú, an comhairleoir contae, Nioclás Ó Conchubhair, a bhí ina Sheanadóir sa Teach seo, tá moladh aigesean os comhair Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe go gcaithfidh chuile phingin bheo a bheidh le fáil ag Comhairle Contae na Gaillimhe an bhliain seo a chaitheamh thiar i gConamara. Caithfidh sé go bhfuil an scéal an-dona go deo nuair atá comhairleoir <Col N="1996" /> Fianna Fáileach á rá sin, ach tá muidne á rá ar an dtaobh seo den Teach, sách minic, sách fada, agus ba dheas liom éisteacht leis an Aire á rá sin, agus tá súil agam, nuair a bheas an deis aige, agus an deis ag muintir Fhianna Fáil sa chomhairle, nuair a thiocfaidh sé sin in aois le hairgead na mbóithre a chaitheamh, go dtabharfaidh siad uilig tacaíocht dá gcomhairleoir féin, Nioclás Ó Conchubhair san áit sin.</P>
    <P>Nach aisteach go leor freisin é, go bhfuil an scéal chomh dona sin go dtagann muintir Chonamara isteach ar phicéid go dtí Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, picéidí anois agus arís, picéidí ar lucht cumhachta, picéidí a d'eagraigh me féin, caithfidh mé a rá, agus picéidí a d'eagraigh daoine eile.  Is crua é sin ar an gcomhairle chontae.  D'éirigh leis na picéidí sin rudaí a bhaint amach ó am go chéile, sin é an chaoi, dar ndóigh, ar cuireadh feabhas ar bhóthar thiar i gCarna.  Sin é an chaoi ar cuireadh feabhas ar bhóthar Bhaile na mBroc atá á déanamh an tseachtain seo, de bharr brú agus picéide.  Nach aisteach go bhuil an bainisteoir contae ag rá, &ldquo;is dócha go bhféadfadh drochstaid bhóithre Chonamara a bheith ina ábhar toghcháin sa chontae seo&rdquo;.  Sé sin, go dtroidfear an chéad toghchán contae eile ar bhóithre Chonamara, go huile is go hiomlán.  Ní mise atá ag rá sin, sin atá ráite ag an mbainisteoir contae, go bhféadfadh sé bheith ann, agus, m'anam féin, más mar sin a bheidh, is mar sin a bheidh muidne freisin ag troid.  Mar níl aon aird á tabhairt ar na rudaí éagsúla agus ar na feachtais éagsúla atá curtha ar fáil ag muintir Chonamara le cur ar a súile don chomhairle chontae teacht i gcabhair orainn.  Is ábhar toghcháin é cinnte.  Ba ábhar toghcháin an tslat iascaigh sa toghchán deireannach agus tá a fhios ag Fianna Fáil gur íoc siad go daor as sin.  M'anam go n-íocfaidh siad go daor as ceist na mbóithre freisin nuair a thiocfas an chéad toghchán chomhairle chontae aníos.  Agus tá mé ag rá sin, agus a fhios agam, tar éis mo chuid cainte anseo inniu, nach mbeidh an t-airgead atá ag teastáil, le caoi a chur ar bhóithre Chonamara ar fáil ar éigean.  Beidh sop in áit na scuaibe, agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh a fhios againn, agus go mbeadh a fhios ag an <Col N="1997" /> Teach seo, agus go mbeadh a fhios ag muintir Bhaile Atha Cliath agus an taobh thoir den tír seo, na hiarrachtaí ata déanta againn féin le leas na mbóithre a chur ina cheart.</P>
    <P>Mar shampla, bhí pobal Thír an Fhia ann, bhí mé ag cruinniú poiblí ann agus bhíodar uilig sásta a n-ainmneacha a shíniú le cáipéis a thabharfadh cead don chomhairle chontae an bóthar a thréigean thiar ansin.  Níl a fhios agamsa an dtuigeann Seanadóirí anseo anocht céard is ciall leis sin.  Tá Acht Rialtais Áitiúil, 1925 ann agus deir fo-alt (6) den Acht sin go soiléir go bhféadfaí-bóithre a thréigean &mdash;&ldquo;abandon&rdquo; an focal Béarla atá air &mdash; go bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh.  Ach, bhí muintir Chonamara choimh lagmhisniúil sin faoin méid atá déanta dóibh, go ndeachadar síos an bóthar sin ag iarraidh go dtréigfí bóithre i gConamara mar nach raibh sé ar chumas Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe é a dhéananh dóibh.</P>
    <P>Le bóthar a thréigean, caithfear é a fhoilsiú go poiblí ar na páipéir agus caithfidh na comhairleoirí contae rún a rith ag tacú leis an tréigean seo, agus ansin caithfidh an tAire Comhshaoil fiosrú áitiúil poiblí a chur ar bun le míniú ceart a fháil ar cén fáth go raibh an bóthar á thréigean.  Cuireadh é sin os comhair Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, agus, fainic anois, ar an rud atá mé ag rá: tá na bóithre chomh dona sin go raibh na daoine féin ag iarraidh ar an gcomhairle chontae iad a thréigean, sa chaoi go bhféadfadh na daoine féin dul amach agus sluasaid bheith acu agus rud éigin a dhéanamh leis na bóithre.  Bhíodar sásta sluasaid, gaineamh, tarra a thógail amach agus caoi a chur ar na bóithre.  Agus níl aon bhealach dlíthiúil ann é a dhéanamh, ach go ndéanfadh an chomhairle chontae iad a thréigean.  Mar a dúirt an bainisteoir leo, má leagann tú sluasaid ar an sclaig bhóthair sin nó an pothole sin, tá tú ag briseadh an dlí agus cuirfear go Luimneach nó Mountjoy thú.  Sin a dúradh linn agus a dúradh leo.  Ach, dar m'anam féin, go mb'fhearr do chuid againn tamall a chaitheamh i Mountjoy ná bheith ag dul thart ag breathnú ar na bóithre sa chaoi ina bhfuil siad.  Ar aon nós, chuir an bainisteoir contae faoi ndeara do na comhairleoirí gan ghlacadh leis an <Col N="1998" /> moladh sin, mar dúirt sé nach mbeadh sé feidhmiúil de réir an dlí.</P>
    <P>Tháinig daoine anuas le scéal eile agus dúradar: déanfaidh muidne anois é, tá comhlacht ar aithne agamsa, tá mé bainteach leis, aisteach go leor, go bhféadfaí 120 míle de bhóithre, sin fad bóthair ó Ghaillimh go Baile Atha Cliath, agus gach poll bóthair, na sclaigeanna go léir, fad aistear 120 míle a líonadh gan chomhairle, ar chonraitheoireacht, i gcomhair £46,000, nuair atá sé ag cosaint breis is £1 mhilliún punt le míle bóthar a dhéanamh ar an ngnáthbhealach.  Níor glacadh leis sin, níor tugadh aon aird air sin. Dúradh nach bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh. Anois tá muintir na háite, muintir na Gaeltachta, muintir Chonamara sásta, agus tá droim láimhe tugtha do chuile shórt, agus gan cheart nó gan chead é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, tá na gasúir ag iarraidh dul ar scoil ar bhóithre nach féidir siúl orthu. Tá dochtúir ag iarraidh theacht ar othar in áiteanna nach féidir le carr a dhul. Othar, sin duine a bhíonn tinn.  Tá mise, mar shampla, bainteach le CathaoirRoth Chonamara, Wheelchair Association, agus le daoine a bhailiú sna bailte, nach féidir leis an mbus dul síos ann le hiad a bhailiú.  Mar sin obair thionsclaíochta, fheilméireachta éisc agus chuile shórt eile, agus bhí muid ag caint ansin sular thosaigh an díospóireacht seo, faoi thurasóireacht.  Cén chaoi, in ainm Dé, a bhféadfadh turasóireacht bheith ann mura bhfuil bóithre le dul orthu. Cén chaoi a bhfeicfidh na turasóirí seo Conamara mura bhfuil bóithre acu le dul orthu.</P>
    <P>Sé an rud a tharla, agus atá ráite, go gceapann siad go mbeidh £800,000, nó mar sin, breise le fáil do bhóithre Chonamara. Feicfimid an tAire ag rá rud iontach faoi sin, go mbeidh suim éigin suas le £800,000.</P>
    <P>Líonfadh sin na deich gceantar i nGaillimh, sin £80,000 in aghaidh an cheantair. Tá an £800,000 sin caite ar dhá bhóthar agus níl tada déanta do bhóithre Chonamara, agus beidh siad fós gan tada tar éis go raibh muid sásta £260 milliún a chaitheamh ar DART ó Howth síos go Delgany agus cuarbhóthar a dhéanamh timpeall ar an chathair seo ar chostas £10 milliún.  Nílimid in ann caoi a chur ar <Col N="1999" /> bhóithre Chonamara, nílimid in ann airgead a chur ar fáil ach sop in áit na scuaibe.  Tá súil agam nuair a bheas an tAire mo fhreagairt go mbeidh sé in ann a rá linn anois go bhfuil neart airgid aige le haghaidh bhóithre Chonamara agus go gcuirfear caoi orthu dá réir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit my Irish is not sufficent to enable me to give the Senator the very comprehensive reply, I would like to give. However, I was able to follow much of what he had to say on this subject.</P>
      <P>The Senator is aware that the primary responsibility for funding works on nonnational roads, including county roads, rests with the individual local authorities concerned.  Traditionally, work on these roads was financed from local resources, with limited State road grant assistance. In 1985 Galway County Council received in discretionary grants £915,500.  These are from my Department.  In 1986 they received £1.769 million.  When we came into office in 1987 they received £2.553 million and the same in 1988.  In 1989 this was increased to £3.312 million.  This year, 1990, they will receive £4.711 million. The Senator quite rightly pointed out in his remarks that £15 million will be needed for local roads.  The grants from my Department will amount to £4.711 million.  From their own resources this year the contribution will be £2.3 million.  That brings the total to £7.011 million.  I have gone half the way in one year but the Senator does not thank me for it.  I am surprised at him.</P>
      <P>The Senator was critical of some of my former colleagues but they had brought this matter to the attention of the Minister and to my attention.  That is why we brought in a three year programme to look after the county roads network, which was neglected totally when his party was in office.  I do not want to give an outline of the grants at that time.  I would be wasting the time of the House because they were so petty and so small. We changed all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the local authority in question will receive grants from the Department of the Environment to the value of £9.131 million.  What did we do last year? <Col N="2000" /> We changed the method in the discretionary grants, giving the local authority members more authority with their engineering staff to spend the money. This evening the county engineer of the local authority in question tells us that £15 million would put the county roads in County Galway in good shape.  This year, as I stated, between the grants they received from the Department of the Environment, which were sent to the council last week, and their own resources they will be able to do a lot of work.  I know the officials and management in Galway are very pleased because they did not think they would do so well.</P>
    <P>I come from a rural area where there is only 11 miles of major primary roads and the rest is bog.  We do not qualify for any major grant aid, such as the EC funding.  All of it has to come by State aid and by our own resources but we are able to manage quite well, and do very good work.  I do not begrudge Galway or any other county the very substantial funding they are getting here.</P>
    <P>Some people said: &ldquo;What about inflation?&rdquo;  It does not arise, because the increases we are giving will represent something in the region of 42 per cent over the last two years.  The Fianna Fáil Government understand the situation. The Minister, being from the west, is very conscious of the needs of the west and, coming from a neighbouring county, I fully understand it as well.  We did not tell Galway County Council how they should spend the money.  We left it to the executives of the council and the members to decide all that.</P>
    <P>The Senator picked the wrong motion tonight.  I accept that his intentions were good but I think he should go back and have a talk with the county engineer and the officials about the roads in Connemara and Oughterard.  I have no doubt my own colleagues down there will be very keenly interested to have the roads in good condition for the tourist season.</P>
