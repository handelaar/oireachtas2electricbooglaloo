      <P>I have notice from Senator Paddy McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious situation caused by the closure of a meat factory (details supplied) in County Donegal and the need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to try to resolve this matter with AIBP and his Department.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senators Tom Raftery and Liam Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the damage being caused to the economy both locally and nationally by the dispute at Waterford Glass, the need for the Minister for <Col N="2" /> Labour to make every effort to resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Government to take all possible steps to prevent the spread of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) to animals and humans.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the construction of a community school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to request that industry advises third level colleges in advance as to their possible needs for recruitment of graduates in that year, thereby eliminating the unnecessary cost and efforts of students submitting application forms to which they invariably do not get acknowledgement.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan, Raftery and Cosgrave, Upton and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Raftery and Cosgrave, Upton and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Jackman as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of Ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1988, from the conclusion of the Order of Business until 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. the continuation of the Fine Gael motion.  That will go on until 8 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I refer the Leader of the House to Item No. 30 on the Supplementary Order Paper.  This matter has been raised persistently over the past number of months in an effort to get some indication of the mind of the Government on the matter and the Government's intentions on it.  I am not asking for an answer today but I would like to ask the Leader if he could come back to the House with some definite information for the House on this matter at the latest by next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer to Item <Col N="4" /> No. 6 on the Order Paper, the amendment to the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1878.  I have been raising in this manner consistently for the past number of months and I would like the Leader of the House to establish the view of the Minister for Education on the matter and whether she is prepared to take the Bill.  It does retain a discriminatory subsection regarding the education of girls.  I do not require an answer right now but through you, a Chathaoirligh, I request that we get a clear position on Item No. 6 on the Order Paper in the next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the fact that we are sitting for three days. That is a sign, I hope, of good intentions for the working of the Seanad in the days and weeks and months to come.  I would like to refer specifically to a number of motions on the Supplementary Order Paper in relation to prisons.  Now with some more time for discussion perhaps the suggestion that was offered earlier and seemed to be taken up, namely, that some of those motions could be taken together and dealt with, might be adopted.  I would have three at least in relation to prisons.</P>
      <P>In relation to Northern Ireland, the Leader of the House might take upon himself, if there is now more time, to give them space on the Order Paper for a debate.  We have been raising the problems in the prisons for a long time, and we have not yet had a full debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we can get some definite information on motion 30 on the Supplementary Order Paper.  I am glad Senator Manning raised it.  May I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible for us, either by way of a debate or by way of short statements at least, to record what I would know to be the revulsion of the House at recent events in Palestine.  We are getting very close to what can only be described as genocide and I think, given the collective views of most of the political parties and indeed of the Government, that it would be very <Col N="5" /> appropriate that we should record our views on the matter.  I request that we should either have a debate or at least a short period for formal statements because the position has got to the stage where one's revulsion is almost indescribable at what is being done.  It is being done in the name of western democracy, let us remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Manning said about Item No. 30 on the Supplementary Order Paper.  I will not be pressing today for an alteration in the Order of Business but the request for information made by Senator Manning is fully supported by me.  I realise we are sitting three days this week.  Unfortunately, for two of those days I will be in Copenhagen speaking to an international meeting of the European Convention on Human Rights and I very much wish I had been able to report some progress in this matter to that body. Regrettably I will not be able to do so but I would like some information and I will continue my efforts, with the support of other people around the House for which I am very grateful.</P>
      <P>I may point out that Item No. 2 also refers.  Would the Leader be kind enough to draw that to the attention of the Minister because the Minister, speaking on this subject, referred to the Law Reform Commission, there has been a major section of the Law Reform Commission report mentioned in Item No. 2 which recommends certain alterations in the law.  Perhaps we could have a view on that as well.</P>
      <P>I would like also to ask if we could have some information on Item No. 32. Perhaps, with the agreement of the Whips, this matter could be raised next week so that people would have sufficient notice of it.  It deals with the deliberate disruption of rail services between Belfast and Dublin.  Previously I got an undertaking that this matter would be taken and if, perhaps with the agreement of the Whips, we could have a date, possibly even next week, it would be very much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to matters on the Order <Col N="6" /> Paper for today, I would like at some stage to have an indication from the Leader of the House with regard to the current status of Item No. 5, the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1989 and whether it will be permissible for this Bill to be introduced from the Independent benches.  This I think, would be a good and co-operative move forward because it is 30 years since an item of legislation has progressed from this side of the House and it would be very welcome.  It would be an encouragement for us here to be constructive and co-operative in our approach to the Government.</P>
    <P>On the Order Paper today there is item No. 8.  I have raised this before and I have been promised some information. If I could have some information I would be grateful because I have a constituent who is personally interested and keeps pressing me on this matter.  He is a lawyer and has supplied me with information so that the Bill can be processed.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I comment on what Senator Ryan said with regard to the Middle East situation and the fate of the Palestinian people.  No person of conscience could deny that a debate on these lamentable events is timely.  I would disagree in the matter of degree.  I do not call is genocide but I think there is serious abuse of civil rights, about which many people in Israel and Palestine are concerned and I would certainly welcome a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, if I may, to draw attention to motion No. 97 on the Order Paper.  This is a matter of considerable urgency and concern.  I say this in a personal capacity, as a Senator and indeed as Chairman of the Tallaght Hospital Board.  The Minister and the <Col N="7" /> Taoiseach have given a number of assurances, as have Governments down through the years, regarding the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital and the relationship in due course that should exist, and I believe will exist, in the new Tallaght Hospital.  It is a matter of very considerable concern at the moment and I would like, therefore, if I may, to urge the Leader of the House, subject to agreement between the Whips and the movers of the motion, to take this item as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  I support Senator Ryan's views that something should be done in this House concerning that issue.  I do not think statements are sufficient; I believe a debate should take place.  The timing is very appropriate in that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is meeting Mr. Arafat next Saturday.  May I propose, a Chathaoirligh, that we have a debate on the Middle East and that we invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the proposals which have been made that we should have a debate or statements on the very dangerous situation that is occurring in Palestine and now inside Israel itself because there has been an escalation in Nazareth over the past number <Col N="8" /> of days in the Christian Arab section.  I think it is important that this House should debate this matter.  Whether it should be by way of statements or a debate we should leave to the Leader of the House to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I urge the Leader of the House to make time available under item No. 98 on the Order Paper in relation to BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.  It would be very useful if this House were to debate this matter because we have had such irresponsible statements in the press and elsewhere over the past few weeks.  Whatever about the risks to human health, it is unquestionable that many farmers in the country are suffering disproportionately because of this matter and you only have to look at this week's beef prices.  Whatever we can do to bring sanity into this debate would be welcome and I urge that we make time available for it.</P>

      <P>Having found the views of Bishop Newman on the content of motion 97 on the Order Paper unnecessarily provocative, I support the case that is being made here by several Senators that this matter be dealt with in this House as a matter of urgency.  There is particular sensitivity involved in this and I request, through the Chair, that the Leader of the House try to arrange that this motion is dealt with very quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question raised by Senator Manning I will endeavour to <Col N="9" /> get the information for him and that also applies to Senator Norris.  Senator O'Toole raised a question on Item No. 6 and I will make inquiries on that matter. The Senator asked last week if I could give some idea of the business for the weeks ahead.  This week we have the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill and the Finance Bill. I expect next week we will have the Turf Development Bill, followed in quick order by the Industrial Relations Bill, the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, the Shannon Navigation Bill and the Fóir Teoranta Bill.  They are all at a very advanced stage in the Dáil.  Senator Norris mentioned some time ago the Control of Clinical Trials Bill.  I think Senator Brendan Ryan will agree that both he and I had a particular interest in this Bill when we had it in the Seanad some time ago.  My information is that the parliamentary draftsman is almost ready to come forward with that so we may have it in the next two or three weeks.  Also debate on the Teachers' Superannuation Bill is nearing completion in the Dáil and I am hopeful we will have the Pensions Bill and the Criminal Justice Bill dealing with the removal of the death penalty before the end of this session.  Then, of course, we will have the usual motions which have been referred to by other speakers.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello mentioned the Prisons Bill and the Northern Ireland issue. There are no plans for debate of these matters on the Government side.  If the prison issue is something he feels strongly about, he might consider it for Private Members' time.  Senator Ryan referred also to Item No. 30.  I have mentioned that.  He also asked about recent events in Palestine and in the Middle East generally. It is something I will ask the Whips to consider.  I would not be opposed to statements where we would not have a Minister available and statements might be appropriate.  It is something I will ask the Whips to consider, maybe for next week.  I have no proposals for Item 8 or Item 5.  Item No. 2 is with us and I hope it will be taken as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Conroy asked, as did other <Col N="10" /> Members, about motion No. 97.  In view of the concern expressed, I am sure it is something I can arrange and I will endeavour to have it for next Thursday, tomorrow week.  Senator Staunton spoke about the Middle East and Senator Lanigan mentioned the same matter.  Senator Harte dealt with Item No. 97 which I have touched on.  The question of BSE as in motion 98 obviously is a topical and important matter and is something I will ask the Whips to consider.  Senator Avril Doyle also referred to motion 97 and I have agreed we will try to take that tomorrow week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before Senators. There has been a long and constructive debate on it in the Dáil, as a result of which a number of important amendments have been made.  In order to reflect these changes fully, and so as to avoid possible confusion, I have had a revised Explanatory and Financial Memorandum circulated for the Seanad discussion of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Physical planning exists to regulate the development and use of land in the public interest.  This central purpose is reflected in the Long Title of the Planning Act, 1963, which speaks of making provisions, in the interests of the common good, for the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the United Kingdom, where development rights have been nationalised since 1948, development rights in this country belong in principle to the owner or other entitled person concerned and, as is well known, our Constitution gives qualified protection to such private property rights.  Article 40.3.2 provides that the State shall by its laws protect as <Col N="11" /> best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the property rights of every citizen.  Article 43 guarantees that the State will pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership.  It provides, however, that the State may as the occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of this right with a view to reconciling its exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>These constitutional provisions both anticipate the regulation of private property rights involved in the planning system and set important limits to this but it would be wrong to imagine that planning compensation, within the meaning of the Planning Acts and the present Bill, arises solely from the requirements of the 1937 Constitution.  The Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, provided extensively for compensation of this kind, even though the Constitution of the Irish Free State, then in force, referred only in passing to rights of private property. Irish planning legislation has, accordingly, provided at all times for the possibility of compensation in certain circumstances where an adverse planning decision, or a planning scheme under earlier legislation, reduced the value of a person's interest in land.  This principle, as I have said, arises as much from ordinary considerations of equity as from constitutional requirements.</P>
    <P>The law on planning compensation has generally been guided by the rule, consistent with the polluter pays principle of more recent region, that compensation should not be payable for refusal of development which would clearly harm the public.  On the other hand, planning compensation may be warranted in circumstances where development is refused or restricted in a way which amounts to forcing a particular landowner to subsidise a desirable community facility which should be the responsibility of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have already made it clear that planning compensation for the purposes of this Bill relates not to any taking or <Col N="12" /> appropriation of land by a planning authority but to the depreciation of the value of land which may result from an adverse decision on a planning application.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation. The Bill also amends certain provisions of the sanitary services code so as to regulate connection of premises to public sewers and water supplies in a manner more consistent with the modern planning process.  The major thrust of the Bill's new provisions is to give greater weight to the common interest in the determination of planning issues and greater protection to planning authorities in face of compensation claims.</P>
    <P>Statistics on planning compensation claims have been systematically compiled only since 1982.  In the period to 1987, these indicate that nationally an average of some 25 claims were made each year, with payment being made on average in two cases per year.  The corresponding average number of planning applications was some 30,000 per year.  There is a striking contrast between the amount of compensation claims over the past six years, which runs to many millions, and actual payments of compensation by planning authorities, which up to 1987 amounted only to some £90,000.</P>
    <P>This bare presentation of statistics might appear to suggest that planning compensation poses relatively minor problems for planning authorities.  The reality, however, is different.  A well publicised compensation award of some £1.8 million was finally concluded against Dublin County Council in March, 1989 and this, and an earlier award against Dún Laoghaire Corporation, have focused the compensation issue very sharply.  There is also the widespread perception that the threat of incurring heavy compensation liabilities may be inhibiting the proper exercise of planning judgment in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Against this problematic background, there is now a substantial consensus on the need to strengthen the community bias, if I may call it that, of planning compensation law.  In other words, there is seen to be scope for extending the range <Col N="13" /> of non-compensatable circumstances and providing a workable mechanism for avoiding compensation by way of alternative development consent.</P>
    <P>To address the Bill as it is drafted, I have already said that it will consolidate all of the law on planning compensation into one text. I regard this as a matter of some importance.  The format of the 1963 Act provisions on planning compensation was quite obscure, associated as it was with provisions about the detail of development plans and with issues of compulsory purchase of land.  There is no doubt that, at least partly due to these difficulties, a considerable number of compensation cases have arisen out of failure properly to understand and apply the law.  In that sense, the much clearer presentation of the law which this Bill achieves should benefit all concerned with administering it and working with it.</P>
    <P>The Bill breaks new ground in widening the circumstances for non-compensation; establishing new rules for assessing the amount of any compensation; providing a new procedure for alternative development consent, and regulating rights of connection to public sewers and water mains.</P>
    <P>As regards widening the grounds for non-compensation, the Bill's major new provisions, effected for section 12 and the Third Schedule, can be summarised as follows: development may be refused without liability to compensation not just where water supplies, sewerage facilities or the road network are actually deficient, but also where their capacity is required for prospective other development; development may also be refused without liability to compensation if it is premature by reference to any order of priority for development indicated in a development plan; development may be refused without liability to compensation if the proposed development, by itself or by the precedent it would set, would adversely affect the use of a national road or other major road by traffic; refusal of planning permission will be non-compensatable for development which would <Col N="14" /> cause serious air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution or vibration or pollution connected with the disposal of waste; compensation will be excluded where planning permission is refused because the proposed development would injure or interfere with a historic monument or an archaeological area, and compensation will be excluded also, except in narrowly defined circumstances, where planning permission is refused because the development would materially contravene an objective of the development plan.</P>
    <P>In addition, refusal of permission will be non-compensatable by virtue of section 12 and the Second Schedule where the development would involve demolition of a so-called listed building, that is, a building of artistic, architectural or historical interest which it is a development objective of the development plan to preserve.</P>
    <P>Section 12 and the Fourth Schedule add a number of new classes of conditions to those which may already be attached to a planning permission without liability to compensation.  Finally, section 21 provides that three preservation orders may embody conditions, without compensation, requiring a proportion of woodlands to be preserved or the felling of trees to be phased.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains an important procedural innovation in section 13, designed to replace the &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; procedure of section 57 of the 1963 Act, which has been found unsatisfactory by the courts.  This new procedure will allow a planning authority to rebut a compensation claim by a notice stating that in their opinion alternative development ought to attract planning permission. This notice can only be defeated if planning permission is subsequently refused or conditioned in a manner inconsistent with the permissive statement.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill will implement a number of provisions arising from the report of the Joint Committee on Building Land (Pl. 3232).  The rules for determining the amount of compensation have been fully revised by section 11 and the First Schedule and will now stand <Col N="15" /> independently of the compensation rules applying to CPOs.  I will return to these new valuation rules in a moment.</P>
    <P>The question of connection to public sewers and water supplies was also addressed by the Joint Committee.  Sections 25 and 26 of the Bill deal with this issue.  Under section 25 connection to public sewers will no longer obtain as a right of the person connecting but will be subject to the consent of the sanitary authority concerned.  Under section 26 the right of a supply of water for domestic purposes will no longer obtain in the case of unauthorised development.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed by this Bill have already attracted considerable comment. Most of this has been directed at the new approach to assessment of compensation embodied in the First Schedule and at the provisions of the Third Schedule whereby in general compensation will be excluded where proposed development would materially contravene the zoning of land.</P>
    <P>To deal first with the assessment of compensation, the Bill of course severely limits the right to planning compensation, but in cases where planning compensation should still be payable, the measure of it should be the reduction in the value of a person's land which is directly attributable to the adverse planning decision.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, the valuation rules of the 1963 Act seemed to encourage a maximalist approach to assessing compensation. In practice, compensation tended to be based on the difference between the value of land following the adverse planning decision and its notional value had the planning permission been granted, albeit subject to suitable conditions. In other words, the top line for valuation purposes tended to be set by the landowner's own aspirations for development of his land in the form of his planning application.</P>
    <P>The most important and radical provision of the First Schedule is to do away with this maximalist assumption.  The top line which it fixes for valuation purposes is simply the realistic market value of <Col N="16" /> the land immediately before the adverse planning decision, but the new rules make it absolutely clear that only reasonable prospects for developing the land are to be embraced in this assessment.  In particular, regard must be had to the fact that the land might not, at the relevant time, have carried any substantial planning permission and that its prospects of obtaining such permission would have to be viewed by the market as uncertain. The new rules categorically disallow any automatic presumption in favour of the kind of planning permission which the owner was seeking.</P>
    <P>The valuation framework proposed in the new First Schedule is clearly structured around the difference between the antecedent and the subsequent realistic market values of the land, subject to all of the qualifications provided by the previous rules.  As well as making the fundamental change which I have mentioned, the new First Schedule also reorganises and refines most of these previous rules.</P>
    <P>The second major policy issue addressed by the Bill is the general rule established by paragraph 11 of the Third Schedule that refusal of development which would materially contravene a current zoning objective will be non-compensatable.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this principle is in general a correct one.  However, its application would create a situation where planning authorities could, in theory at least, arbitrarily change the zoning of land without any regard to the financial implications for landowners who might have made a recent investment on the basis of a different zoning.  I do not believe for a moment that planning authorities would wish to procure such unjust consequences but, equally, I do not think that the legislation should even leave open the possibility of such consequences.</P>
    <P>For this reason, paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Third Schedule embody the safeguard that compensation will not be excluded on zoning grounds where the land had a zoning in the previous five <Col N="17" /> years with which the development proposal would have been compatible, and the person claiming compensation acquired his land interest before the new restrictive zoning came into operation or was formally notified in draft by the planning authority.  Both of these conditions have, of course, to obtain together.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, upholds the general principle that developers should not be able to press for compensation where development would contravene current zoning.  It makes exception only for landowners whose lands have been &ldquo;down-zoned&rdquo;, that is, from development to non-development zoning.</P>
    <P>These new measures will provide a very substantial and comprehensive defence for planning authorities against compensation claims.  Taken together with the improved provisions which the Bill is making in many other areas, they will greatly strengthen the position of planning authorities in administering planning control.</P>
    <P>Given that a revised and comprehensive Explanatory and Financial Memorandum has been circulated, I propose to deal briefly and selectively with the detail of the Bill.  Part I makes a number of standard provisions regarding interpretation and commencement.  Section 3 repeals all of Part VI of the Planning Act, 1963, which is being replaced by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill sets out common provisions, mainly procedural, for different kinds of compensation claims.  In general, claims for compensation must be made within six months of the relevant planning decision, and there is provision for regulations regarding the detail of claims.  Double compensation, that is under this Bill and any other enactment in respect of the same land, is prohibited by section 7, and section 10 provides for the clawback of compensation by a planning authority in any case where development is carried out on land on which compensation has been paid.</P>
    <P>The most important provision of Part II is section 5.  This continues the arrangement whereby, in default of agreement, the amount of planning compensation <Col N="18" /> must be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  As I have explained, a new set of rules, contained in the First Schedule, will guide the assessment of compensation.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with planning compensation in the context of decisions under Part VI of the 1963 Act.  In layman's language, this means decisions on applications for permission to develop land or to retain structures, or what is normally referred to as planning permission. Revocation or modification of planning permission is also included.</P>
    <P>Section 11 continues the basic principle of planning compensation whereby a person is entitled to be paid compensation by a planning authority if the value of his interest in land is reduced by a refusal or a conditioning of planning permission.  This entitlement is, however, heavily qualified by sections 12 and 13.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is the key section of the Bill. Through the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the Bill respectively, section 12 lays down classes of development which, in themselves, will not attract compensation, reasons for the refusal of planning permission which exclude compensation, and conditions which may be imposed on planning permission, without compensation.  All non-compensatable circumstances from the 1963 Act are preserved. Further important non-compensatable circumstances are added, and these I have already described in some detail.</P>
    <P>Section 13, as I have already explained, is intended to replace the so-called &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; provisions of section 57 of the 1963 Act, which have been found unsatisfactory by the courts, with a different procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives an exceptional power to the Minister for the Environment, in limited circumstances, to order the payment of compensation where this would otherwise be excluded by the strict application of the compensation provisions of sections 12 and 13.  This power of waiver, which parallels section 58 of the 1963 Act, is desirable so that the constitutionality of the Bill will not <Col N="19" /> necessarily be threatened by hard cases arising in the operation of its normal provisions.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with compensation in relation to a range of possible decisions by planning authorities which in practice arise much less frequently than decisions on planning permissions. The matters involved include discontinuance of an authorised use of land, removal or alteration of a hedge, compulsory creation of a right of way, and damage arising from cabling or pipeline work.  The Bill merely re-enacts existing law on all of these matters.</P>
    <P>However, section 21 considerably extends the provisions of section 45 (2) of the 1963 Act so as to give greater protection from compensation to planning authorities in the context of tree preservation orders.  While I do not believe that planning legislation is competent to handle all of the difficulties which have emerged in this area &mdash; its perspective is necessarily that of amenity rather than of specialised botany or silviculture &mdash; nevertheless, I think that improved planning provisions can make a contribution to this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 21 contains two new provisions: first, that felling consents may from now on, without compensation, attach conditions requiring the preservation of up to 20 per cent of trees in woodlands, where considerations of special amenity value or interest obtain; and secondly, in the same circumstances, that felling consents may, without compensation, require the felling of trees in woodlands to be phased over a period of up to 20 years.  These measures strike a balance between reasonable amenity interests, on the one hand, and the requirements of commercial forestry on the other.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill is designed to modify certain long-standing rights of connection of premises to public sewers and water supplies which are established in sanitary services legislation so as to make these more consistent with the overall control of development by planning authorities envisaged by the planning system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> Under section 23 of the Public Health Act, 1878, owners and occupiers of land are entitled to connect their drains to existing sewers within the district of a sanitary authority subject to complying with any regulation which the authority has made concerning the mode of connection, but regardless of the capacity of the sewer to cope with additional connections.  Section 24 of the 1878 Act enables owners and occupiers of premises outside the sanitary district to connect drains or sewers to the sewerage system of the sanitary authority &mdash; on terms to be agreed by the parties or settled by arbitration.  Accordingly, it is not at present possible for a sanitary authority to refuse a connection to a premises after it has been built inside or outside the sanitary district, regardless of the position under planning law.</P>
    <P>A similar right to connection to water supplies exists under section 53 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847.  These rights, as they stand, could undermine the other provisions of this Bill allowing planning authorities, without compensation, to refuse development on grounds of deficiency in water or sewerage services.  Accordingly, section 25 provides that, in future, premises shall require the consent of the sanitary authority &mdash; through planning permission or a special form of approval &mdash; for connection to a public sewer.  Section 26 provides that the right to a supply of water for domestic purposes shall only extend to dwelling houses which are authorised under planning law.  Section 24 of the Public Health Act, 1878, is being repealed under section 3.  This particular right is inappropriate from a planning control viewpoint and in future, if connections to a sewer are required from outside the sanitary district, they should be arranged by agreement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems of planning compensation as well as being one of the measures targeted for enactment under the Government's Environment Action Programme.  It will enable planning authorities to deal with the vast majority of planning cases free <Col N="21" /> of any threat of compensation and to act more resolutely in the public interest. At the same time, limited and necessary provision for planning compensation is being retained for cases where a property owner is required to accept an exceptional degree of restraint on his development rights in the common interest.</P>
    <P>I have given Senators a very comprehensive statement and outline of the provisions of this very complex Bill.  It has received a great deal of debate in the Dáil and I have no doubt it will here as well.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am glad that we finally have legislation before the House that can deal with some of the major problems in the planning area.  It would be naive of me not to recognise that there are some very worthwhile provisions in this Bill.  However, I regret that it has not gone further in dealing with the many problems that have arisen in the planning area, particularly regarding the zoning of land and payments arising out of this.</P>
      <P>The present situation regarding compensation has caused much public concern. The whole question of the abuse of compensation by certain individuals in certain circumstances left a lot to be desired and it is only right and proper that a Bill of this nature should be brought before the House to prevent that type of development.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses a number of other worthwhile projects, such as tree preservation and the provision and control of water and sanitary services.  Local authorities around the country had much difficulty in this regard.  Most local authorities had a provision in their estimates for claims &mdash; though they may have been small sums &mdash; under the heading of planning compensation.  This Bill goes some way towards dealing with this problem. Unfortunately, there are areas where the Bill could have gone further but it has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned with sections 13 and 14 which give the Minister authority <Col N="22" /> to decide on cases for compensation.  This is regrettable, because it is bringing the Minister for the Environment of the day, whoever he may be, back into the whole area of compensation.  He may very well be accused &mdash; perhaps wrongly &mdash; of taking a particular decision because of a vested political interest.  I regret that provision is in the Bill.  An Bord Pleanála, or a board of that nature, would be better to deal with that aspect.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for his detailed document and the updated Explanatory Memorandum.  We all welcome the planning that has taken place over the past number of years.  Any of us who had the opportunity to visit countries whose planning regulations were not as stringent as ours over the past 30 years recognise the difficulties that have arisen in those areas.  We also recognise that certain amendments were needed to cater for expanding towns and urban areas and certain adjustments were needed.  We must accept that under the Constitution property owners have certain rights and they must always be recognised. Very often some people were aware, sooner than others, of changes in the county development plan or changes in regulations which would allow planning permissions on certain properties and they were in fast to buy up those properties or take an option on them and, therefore, they made a killing.  That was not unusual.  It happened in many towns throughout the country but more so in Dublin than anywhere else.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the right of private ownership but we also recognise that private property must always be used in the interests of the common good.  I do not believe that any individual can have the right to hold up progress.  If property is bought under compulsory purchase powers, we all know that has happened in the past, people are entitled to be adequately compensated.  However, one of the areas that always gives me a certain amount of concern is how this compensation is arrived at.  I feel that this is one area where certain questions arise on this Bill.  Very often we see different guidelines used when assessing the value <Col N="23" /> of property which has been bought by compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach, will be aware that in our county when land was purchased some years ago different criteria were used in the purchase of different parcels of land, sometimes to the advantage of the landowner and indeed sometimes to his detriment.  I believe there should be a comprehensive policy with regard to compensation under that heading.  We must recoginse the rights of property owners but we must also recognise that certain property owners become landowners not for love of the land but rather for the potential they see in the future because of amendment to county development plans.  While land may be purchased as agricultural land, very often some years later we have seen compensation paid because it was rezoned.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects which the Bill deals with with regard to decisions on planning applications.  I believe these could be much more detailed.  With regard to the criteria for planning permission from different local authorities, frequently very stringent regulations are applied by one local authority and much more flexible regulations are applied by another authority.  When we come into the area of deciding on the rezoning of land and compensation, I sincerely hope we will have the same procedure throughout the whole country. I know some local authorities are much more flexible in their attitude to developments on national primaries and national secondaries than others.  I regret there is not something in this Bill which would streamline that type of development.</P>
    <P>With regard to connection to water mains and public sewers the local authority should have the right to decide who should and who should not have the opportunity of availing of those services. Very often when one person or a group of people who demand a service get the service they find that it is at the expense of others.  This occurs most often in the case of a water supply where people tap into that supply.  The result is that nobody has a satisfactory water supply.  It is only <Col N="24" /> right and proper that the local authority should have the final say and that it is viewed in the light of the common good, that the best interests, particularly of those people who had previously had the service, are taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister said that in the period from 1982 to 1987 the national average was 25 claims each year with payments being made on average in two cases per year.  The corresponding average number of planning applications was some 30,000 and the total amount of compensation up to 1987 amounted to £90,000.  That, is a surprising figure for many of us.  From the publicity that planning compensations have gained one would get the impression that the amount of compensation was far greater.  Of course, we have had that much publicised case of the £2 million compensation which Dublin County Council were found liable for, which I understand is still before the courts.  It would be unfortunate if a situation like that was allowed to continue.  This Bill should have come before the House much sooner.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech that only in the event of the planning authority dezoning a particular portion of land would a developer or a landowner be entitled to compensation.  That is right because it would prevent people purchasing land and hoping to make a killing out of it in future years.  Very often the cost of developed sites, which in my view is exorbitant, is caused by ruthless developers moving in, purchasing land, waiting for the planning laws to be changed and them making a killing.  We should try to prevent that type of situation arising.  The Minister has spelled out the areas for non-compensation.  It is right that they should be clearly specified in the Bill because I believe very often people were compensated or undesirable arrangements were made.  The Minister pointed out clearly that development may be refused without liability for compensation. If it is premature by reference to any order of priority of development indicated in the development plan it is very important that we emphasise the importance of the county devlopment plans or <Col N="25" /> city development plan.  That should be the guideline for development and the basis for compensation.  That cannot be over-emphasised because I believe it is important that we restrict the areas where compensation can be paid.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives exceptional power to the Minister for the Environment in limited circumstances in respect of the payment of compensation where this would otherwise be excluded by strict application for the compensation provision of sections 12 and 13.  That is unfortunate. I believe this is one area which will cause major difficulties in the years ahead for whatever Minister for the Environment is in power.  If there is a dispute, inevitably, the Minister will be dragged into it and will be pressured into deciding in favour of the applicant against the local authority.  It is regrettable that in this Bill the Minister for the Environment will be dragged into making a decision on whether compensation is paid.  It will be open to allegations, rightly or wrongly, of political influence.  Undoubtedly, in situations where the circumstances may appear to be equal one particular developer will get compensation and the other one will not.  It does not matter what Minister for the Environment is in power he or she will be under tremendous pressure because of that section.</P>
    <P>I take grave exception to that section because I believe it is a retrograde step to have that clause there.  It is dragging the Minister for the Environment into a situation where he will have to decide who gets compensation and I appeal to him &mdash; indeed I will be pressing this on Committee Stage &mdash; to alter that section. There are other and better ways of deciding on compensation or when people are entitled to it.  I very much regret that provision.  Time will show that grave difficulties will arise because of it.  I appeal to the Minister to examine that section and to be prepared to accept amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to tree preservation, I have no doubt that that is a very worthy motive but we would need to be a little careful not to go overboard.  I know of situations where local authorities issued <Col N="26" /> tree preservation orders on agricultural land where the trees were causing major obstruction to the landowner.  In some cases one could very well question whether they are safe.  In one case they are adjacent to a national secondary route.  There has to be a balance in all of this.  While there is no doubt that difficulties have arisen in certain cases we should be careful that we do not find ourselves issuing orders for the sake of issuing orders.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that section with a view to having some flexibility in the matter.  I take exception to section 14 and I appeal to the Minister to accept amendments to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for the Environment and also the Minister of State on the tremendous work they have put into the Bill.  At the outset I would like to compliment Senator Naughten on his very worthwhile contribution.  He made some very valid points but I do not agree with all of them.</P>
      <P>A major bone of contention by local authorities for a number of years has been the question of compensation arising under the planning code.  This Bill deals with it in a very positive manner. We have seen over a long period of time that claims for compensation arise under a number of headings.  A major public concern relates to claims arising as a result of the refusal of planning permission or arising out of conditions attached to a permission granted. Senator Naughten referred to compensation which is a cause of concern and I accept that.  I also accept the fact that property owners have certain rights and they must be protected.  However, no individual has the right to hold up progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of such compensation claims on planning authorities and in the manner in which they have been able to exercise their powers and functions under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act has been considerable. This impact has been increased <Col N="27" /> by a number of court decisions on the interpretation of provisions in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act as they stand at present.  A major local authority, Dublin County Council, in recent times have been forced to pay a sum of about £1.9 million in compensation largely as a result of decisions in both the High Court and the Supreme Court which effectively preserved earlier High Court decisions as to the interpretation of the existing provisions. I am satisfied that this Bill has gone a long way to satisfy local authorities such as Dublin County Council.  I also understand that Dublin County Council have before them claims amounting to a sum in excess of £25 million for compensation arising out of planning decisions.</P>
    <P>The reason I mentioned Dublin County Council is that it is the largest local authority in this country and their problem today could be the problem of local authorities in rural areas tomorrow. While not all of these claims will result in payment and while the amount of money involved in the cases processed to finality, that is arbitration, has been considerably less than that originally claimed there were sums quoted which illustrate the difficulties which planning authorities experience.  May I add that this is of major concern to many local authorities throughout the country.  If they were faced with this court decision they would certainly not be in a position to meet the cost.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that physical planning exists to regulate the development of land in the public interest.  This central purpose is reflected in the Long Title which the Minister has referred to in the Planning Act 1963, which speaks of making provision in the interests of the common good for the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the United Kingdom where development rights have been categorised since 1948. Development rights in this country belong in principle to the owner or other <Col N="28" /> entitled persons concerned.  As is well known, our Constitution gives qualified protection such as private property rights.  Article 40.3.2 provides that the State shall by its law protect the right of private ownership as best it may from unjust attack.  However, we have ruthless developers moving in and taking advantage of the planning laws to make a financial killing.  The Article of the Constitution guarantees that the State will pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership.  It provides, however, that the State may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of this right with a view to reconciling its exercise with that of the common good.</P>
    <P>It has to be stated that some claim for compensation will arise out of situations where landowners are seeking to manoeuvre the local authority into a position to seek settlement of such matters as road proposals which affect their land.  Those which cause most concern are where permissions are refused on a zoning basis.  When this Bill was originally circulated it contained a number of provisions which caused concern to many local authorities but since then there have been a number of amendments to the Bill which it is agreed have addressed the concerns expressed.  In particular section 10 of the Bill, formerly section 11, no longer contains a limit of 14 years.  It is now provided that before development can take place on land which has been the subject of a compensation payment, the compensation must be repaid or else repayment secured.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the sections referred to in the Minister's statement.  He has no doubt that there is a general welcome for it throughout the various local authorities and here I agree. It sets out to deal first with the assessment of compensation.  The Bill severely limits the right to planning compensation but in cases where planning compensation is still payable the extent of it should be the reduction in the value of a person's land which is directly attributed to the adverse planning decision.  This is open to question and I wonder if this would stand <Col N="29" /> up in law.  I have no doubt it will be contested.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the compensation relating to a range of possible decisions by planning authorities which, in practice, arise much less frequently than decisions on planning permissions. The matters involved include discontinuance of unauthorised use of land, removal or alteration of a hedge, compulsory creation of a right-of-way and damage arising from cabling or pipeline work.  This is of concern to the local authorities in rural Ireland because these are problems they are facing every day.  The Bill merely re-enacts existing law on all these matters.  I would like to refer to section 21 which contains two new provisions; first, that felling consents may from now on without compensation attach conditions requiring the preservation of up to 20 per cent of trees and woodlands where a conservation of special amenity value or interest obtain, secondly, in the same circumstances that felling consents may without compensation require the felling of trees and woodlands be phased over a period of up to 20 years.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill is most important.  It is designed to modify certain long-standing rights of connection of premises to public sewers and water supplies which are established in sanitary services legislation so as to make these more consistent with the overall control of development by planning authorities envisaged by the planning system.  The Minister goes on to refer to section 23 with regard to the Public Health Act 1878, dealing with owners and occupiers of land who are now entitled to connect their drains to existing sewers within the district of a sanitary authority subject, of course, to complying with any regulations which the authority have made concerning the mode of connection, with regard to the capacity of the sewer to cope with additional connections.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that in future premises shall require the consent of a sanitary authority, through planning permission or a special form of approval, for connection to a public sewer.  This is most <Col N="30" /> important because we have cases throughout the country where unauthorised connections have been taking place. Section 26 provides that the right to a supply of water for domestic purposes shall only extend to dwelling houses which are authorised under the planning law.  What will the Minister do with illegal connections?  Will there be a fine imposed?  Will any provision be made for that?</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive and it deals with many problems that have existed over a number of years.  As already stated, I welcome the Bill, I have no doubt there is a general welcome for it in the various local authorities.  It sets out to deal with the assessment of compensation. The Bill, of course, merely limits the right to planning compensation but in cases where planning compensation should still be payable the measure of it should be the reduction in the value of a person's land which is directly attributed to the adverse planning decisions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill also.  As somebody who has been a member of a local authority for the past 16 years I have been very much aware at first hand of the considerable problems which have accrued for local authorities not only in Dublin but all around the country, and particularly in the county council area with having to pay very excessive compensation claims.  As was stated by the Minister these may appear small in relation to the number of planning appeals.  In fact, the number of claims that have been paid is small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real bugbear for local authorities has been the threat of compensation claims, which is a very real threat, for the officials trying to safeguard the meagre funds of the local authority and indeed for the members themselves.  The very first case I became aware of in Dublin Corporation was a problem down in my own area, in Londonbridge Road.  It was many years ago and we have had in the intervening years a great number of similar compensation problems.  There is no <Col N="31" /> doubt that when members are faced with the possibility of having to pay these outrageous compensation claims they have had little alternative except to cave in. We have had some successes.  Red Rock might be one of them where we stood firm and we were relatively successful.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be greatly welcomed in that in many aspects it will improve the situation.  It will strengthen the capacity of local authorities to deal with these cases in the common interest and, as the Minister said strengthen the community bias.  A great deal of damage has been done already.  Many green areas which are vitally needed in and around the capital city have been gobbled up because of the problems which have not been dealt with.  There has also been a great deal of erosion of the green belt, as a result of section 4 cases, many of which have been rather unscrupulously entered into.  They have been and still continue to be a very serious problem and one which I hope will be looked at in a realistic and responsible way by the local authorities.  I am not and never have been in favour of curtailing the restriction of the meagre powers of local authorities.  I am very much in favour of the opposite.  I appeal to local authorities to look seriously at their use of section 4 motions.  We are not here today to speak about that, we are here to speak about this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the things which will continue to be a serious problem for us &mdash; I do not know to what extent the Minister can assist with this &mdash; is that we will be left with a very heavy burden with regard to retrospective claims.  I do not know to what extent retrospective claims could be inserted into this Bill.  There is very clearly a considerable backlog and if we have to cave in or we have to pay compensation we are in a bad way.  This Bill will probably be the last chance we will get for a very long time to deal with this difficult situation.  I hope, therefore, as a result of amendments which will come from this House that it will be a successful Bill when it is finally enacted.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I would like to make.  One of them which was already <Col N="32" /> mentioned by Senator Naughten concerns section 14 where the Minister can decide if compensation should be paid. While it sounds on the surface quite reasonable without doubt, it will lead to problems in the future.  We should have a clearer understanding of the circumstances, why that section has to be left in and why it has to be left to the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another question I would like to ask, which, as far as I can see in my perusal of the Bill, does not seem to have been dealt with adequately.  One of the big problems as the Minister knows has been that where a local authority refuses permission and inserts non-compensatable reasons for the refusal, when An Bord Pleanála deal with the appeal and refuse permission they do not always include those non-compensatable reasons for refusal.  Does the Bill impose any obligation on the local authorities and on An Bord Pleanála to state non-compensatable reasons when giving their decision?</P>
    <P>The other question which I would like to ask is on the matter of arbitration.  Will there continue to be a single property arbitrator or is this to be replaced with a committee representing a range of expertise including, perhaps, bodies such as An Taisce and others whose input would represent what might be considerd to be the public good?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that some 25 claims were made each year in the period 1982 to 1987 and that in the corresponding period the average number of planning applications was some 30,000 per year.  He also said that there is a striking contrast between the amount of compensation claims over the past six years, which runs to many millions of pounds, and actual payments of compensation by planning authorities which up to 1987 amounted only to some £90,000.  We all know the reason for that very paltry figure was that local authorities simply caved in in the face of pressure and they gave undertakings.  I know that that is now dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The threat of heavy compensation or indeed when it had to be paid, very <Col N="33" /> seriously inhibited local authorities in carrying out their functions and I hope that the Bill will rectify that.</P>
    <P>The section which provides that development may be refused without liability to compensation not just where water supplies, sewerage facilities or the road network are actually deficient but also where their capacity is required for other prospective development is greatly to be welcomed.  There is a serious situation in the part of the City of Dublin which I represent with regard to inadequate water supply and I wonder if it would come under the Bill.  I understand that local authorities are not entitled to refuse permission for say, a mews development or bed and breakfast accommodation or whatever on the ground that the water supply is inadequate. There is very grave hardship already on many householders in that area who for large parts of the day do not get any water.  This is caused by the fact that many houses on Pembroke Road and Raglan Road, are very high buildings and when the water pressure is turned down the water cannot get to the attic tanks and the householders are left without water all day.  Yet, while they are suffering from that, they know there are further applications being granted.  I wonder if that is something which could be dealt with under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision which makes possible the refusal of planning permission for development which would cause serious air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution or vibration, is it necessary to insert the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in regard to air pollution.  There will, of course, be a great deal of discussion and argument as to what constitutes serious air pollution.  Having regard to ecology and environment, we have reached a stage where we should be talking not only about trying to eliminate serious air pollution or water pollution but about improving our standards generally.  The Taoiseach has chosen as his special theme for his Presidency of the EC a &ldquo;Green Presidency&rdquo; and that is something which I greatly welcome.  Having regard to the <Col N="34" /> image of Ireland which we hope is promoted abroad as a clean and green environment we should not be satisfied with eliminating serious pollution.  We should go a little further and I will put down an amendment that that word be deleted.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the section which deals with the question of compensation being excluded where planning permission is refused because there would be interference with an historic monument or an archaeological area.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 12 and the Second Schedule which refer to development which would involve the demolition of a so-called listed building, I was wondering what &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; in that context meant. A building is either a listed building or it is not a listed building.  I wonder also whether buildings which were only on List 1 would be included or would buildings which are on List 2 fall under that provision?</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill, is designed to replace the undertakings which could be given in the past by local authorities when they were faced with a compensation claim.  The new procedure will apparently allow a planning authority to deal with a compensation claim by a notice stating that in their opinion alternative development ought to attract planning permission. Is this largely the same thing? Are we going to find ourselves in very much the same situation as we were in heretofore?  Will it be sufficient to say to a developer: &ldquo;We think you will be able to get an alternative type of planning permission&rdquo; or will we be back to square one on that?</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to raise under section 26.  It says that the right of the supply of water for domestic purposes will no longer obtain in the case of unauthorised development.  Is there any reason why that should relate only to domestic purposes?  Is there any reason why we should not be able to deny a right of supply to an unauthorised office, for instance?  That would be a very quick and efficient way of getting rid of the many unauthorised offices which there are in my area, for instance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> On the whole question of compensation, if the local authority by its provision of services to a site has increased the value of that land, can that be taken into account when the question of possible compensation is being considered? That point was made in relation to a compensation claim in Kilkenny against the county council or Dun Laoghaire Borough, that in some instances a considerable increase in value comes about because the local authority has spent money out of the public purse in bringing services to the area and the developer then can seek higher compensation as a result.</P>
    <P>I generally welcome the Bill.  I will be putting down a few amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the Seanad.  There has been much public debate and disquiet over the past number of years regarding compensation. The Bill is an answer to the problems that have been experienced by local authorities.  As members of local authorities none of us could continue to have any standing in our community if the existing situation was allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we all welcome and support development in our areas.  We support builders and all types of people who add to the infrastructure and daily life in so far as they enhance and develop areas.  We all have an abhorrence of people who would abuse or speculate against the public interest. Basically I see this Bill as an answer to the problem.  It is to be welcomed and the Minister is to be complimented.  It shows an enlightened aproach by the Minister by his Department and by Government.  The Bill was necessary in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be public confidence in the planning laws.  Otherwise people become sceptical and cynical about the activities of local authorities, their members and the Oireachtas in so far as the Oireachtas <Col N="36" /> enacts the laws and it is for local authorities to apply them.  This Bill is a response to public demand.  None of us, as public representatives, could condone some of the claims we have seen over the last number of years.  The situation would have become worse over the next couple of years if the Bill had not been introduced.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned here today that at this moment there may be over £20 million worth of claims facing Dublin County Council alone.  That is an extraordinary figure.  This type of thing would bring down the whole system of local government.  It would make a mockery of our planning laws and of our developments.  It was imperative to bring such a Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas to clarify and extend the reasons whereby local authorities may refuse planning permission without fear of having to pay compensation at a later stage.  That is part and parcel of the Bill. It is very clear to me that under the Bill local authorities may refuse planning permission and not have the worry or, indeed, the liability of having to pay compensation to speculators who, as far as I am concerned, in many cases moved in a certain direction knowing that they could at some stage avail of what I would consider to be loopholes.</P>
    <P>There is also in the Bill a protection which everyone in this House would wish to have in it, that is, protection for private ownership of property.  We have a responsiblity and a duty as elected representatives to ensure that that protection is given.  The right to private ownership is part of our Constitution, part of the rights of citizens.  The Government are to be complimented on their enlightened approach that takes into consideration the rights of citizens.  Those rights are not interfered with or undermined. They are protected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There will be situations where compensation will have to be paid.  That is a fact of life.  There may be complications in regard to payment.  To some extent I could understand the worries of Senator Naughten that the Minister may be put in an awkward situation.  That may prove <Col N="37" /> to be the case at a later stage.  When the Minister has to make a decision regarding compensation, he may feel he is being put under pressure or somebody else may insinuate he has been put under pressure. That can apply to any Minister for the Environment.  Senator Naughten mentioned that aspect and it is, to some extent at least, a valid worry.  The Minister may have a further explanation on that at a later stage and he may give valid reasons as to why that provision is there.</P>
    <P>There is a balance in the Bill between private ownership and the public interest. That is very important.  That was necessary for the Bill to have credibility and public support.  I have no doubt that compensation will be curtailed.  There is provision for the Minister to have a say.  I do not visualise any Minister going overboard and paying enormous sums in a situation where compensation has to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment have given much consideration to the matter over the past couple of years. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, who was here earlier, have shown an enlightened approach in that Department.  This Bill reflects the activity in that Department.  It is very much in line with the Environmental Action Programme.  It is all part and parcel of an overall development and thinking by the Minister, his Department and by Government.</P>
    <P>The House should support the Bill. It is a wonderfully enlightened piece of legislation and is an answer to the problems we have had.  I hope the Bill has an easy passage through the House and at the end of the day will prove to be what many people have been looking for over the years, an answer to a situation where people, for one reason or another, were in a position to avail of loopholes and to line their pockets a little too well as far as some of us are concerned.  The Bill maintains protection for private ownership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, as many speakers have said, many sections of the Bill which we would like to support but <Col N="38" /> there are many sections we are not very happy with.  First, there is the length of time it has taken to get to this Stage; I would have to go back quite a number of years to get to the First Stage of the Bill. It is almost two years since the publication of the Bill and, of course, each day you will find further claims being lodged against local authorities.</P>
      <P>Under section 2 of the Bill, the Minister &mdash; and I would like clarification from him on this &mdash; intends to bring different parts of the legislation into force at different times.  I hope the Bill will come into force one calendar month after its enactment by the Oireachtas.  In the Dáil Fine Gael pushed very hard for this.  It is very important that it would come into force then.  An alternative was given of, perhaps, 21 days or one calendar month following the signing of the Bill by the President.  The reason is, first, many of the parts of the Bill are interrelated so that there would be difficulties if different parts were brought into force at different times.  I would not be happy that people who seek to abuse the provisions in the Planning Acts by claiming unjustifable compensation in circumstances that, from a social policy perspective, are indefensible should be given any particular consideration.  They have notice of what is happening and, no doubt about it they are working hard to ensure that their claims can be met before this Bill will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very important Bill and obviously the Dublin sector have pushed very hard to highlight the various claims.  The general public have been alerted to this over the past number of months.  However, there are accumulations of compensation amounting to approximately £18 million. I am not saying they will succeed but they are there and that is quite frightening. Knowing how local authorities are starved of necessary funding &mdash; they are not able to raise their own, as was discussed previously; they are still dependent on central Government &mdash; I shudder to think where local authorities are going to get money to pay even the most minute claims.  The situation is very serious and <Col N="39" /> each day's delay in the implementation of this Bill is serious.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are under threat.  It is not just the Dublin authority.  Obviously, Cork &mdash; not so much Limerick thankfully &mdash; as well as Dublin are under threat.  I have here a sizeable document which is our own county development plan and which is just a provisional draft.  That has cost a lot even to this stage, not just in terms of printing and research but in terms of the amount of time taken by officials and councillors in drawing up that draft plan.  When you think of what is in that plan and the consequences of contravening the development plans, that is a very worrying as well.</P>
    <P>Threats of compensation claims from developers seeking to put housing estates or industrial developments on lands zoned for agriculture and amenity use are around the corner all the time.  As a result, local authorities who do not have the funds or the capacity &mdash; I doubt if there is a local authority in the country which has the funds or the capacity &mdash; to pay compensation claims have succumbed, and there is evidence to show they have succumbed, to granting planning permission which materially contravenes their development plans.  There plans have taken a tremendous amount of thought, work, energy and money and what is happening makes the development plan review process largely futile. That saddens me.  We know that our functions as councillors are limited enough but when you find that a claim can actually contravene a development plan and you have a local authority succumbing because they are so starved of funds it makes local government a complete farce.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have referred to the Grange Developers and the £2 million that had to be paid by Dublin County Council to them.  They were given planning permission for their lands materially contravening the plan.  The decision was not, I believe, based on the best interests of the people of County Dublin or the planning of County Dublin.  I would consider it financial blackmail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> I would also refer to a more subtle type of blackmail in relation to my own local authority, Limerick County Council, where they had to buy sites in connection with a ring road because if they were to pay out compensation claims, after 14 years when that runs out they might have to face further claims.  They had no alternative but to hand out moneys that they could not afford in buying up sites in order to prevent this sort of thing.  Fortunately, we do not have the problems of Dublin County Council but, certainly, that was one case where sites had to be bought.  That is subtle blackmail.  After 14 years the term runs out and they had to buy rather than face further claims after that length of time.  The particular and very substantial claims against Dublin Corporation by Grange Development showed that it was no longer supportable to have a situation where the taxpayer had to fork out large sums of money simply to compensate somebody who had been refused planning permission. Likewise, I am concerned about the piecemeal implementation of the Bill. I would like if the Minister could enlighten us as to whether he intends to bring in all sections together or whether the section relating to sewers and the water supply will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I will have to update that but I thank the Minister very much for the correction.  I am glad the Minister saw fit to implement the amendments and I hope that when we press our amendments on Committee State he will be as open and as positive towards the various amendments that we will be putting forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to the positive aspects in relation to connections to public sewers and I give a local example.  I support this provision very strongly particularly in relation to the Castletroy area where instead of having piecemeal development the Castletroy area with a £6 million investment in a sewerage plan, will be developed as an entity.  That means that when that is done we can move on to other areas.  The Minister has told us <Col N="42" /> that planning permission will have to be sought in future for connection to a public sewer.  That is very much to be welcomed and will tidy up the extremely <i>ad hoc</i> developments that are taking place in surburban areas of cities like Limerick, areas that are developing very quickly. That is a very positive aspect.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect I had hoped the Minister would take on board and that is in relation to fly-by-night builders.  I know local authorities have implemented a bonding and that permissions are now being granted on a phased basis, which means that somebody who puts in an application for 1,000 houses will certainly not get <i>carte blanche</i> for 1,000 houses but will, for example, be monitored on 100 houses, 200 houses or whatever to ensure that the builder is not going to take off after completing 499 houses because he has not the money or capacity to complete such huge building areas.  However, it is interesting that it is the market that is making the selectivity in this area.  It shows what happens when the consumer decides what he or she wants; the trend has moved from the huge housing estate complex to the rather small tidy estate where there is a certain element of social identity.  It is really the people who have changed to the small cluster developments which, possibly, will mean that the builder will complete an estate and the taxpayer will not be left liable to clean up a mess such as has been left in so many estates throughout the country at inordinate cost to local authorities.</P>
    <P>There are some grey areas on which I would have liked clarification by the Minister.  One relates particularly to what I would have liked in the Bill, a definition of office development or of property development in relation to residential areas.  I would like to know what that definition entails, what constitutes office development.  It is something which is coming up over and over again in relation to suburban areas which are no longer residential and where there is a lenient attitude towards services needed in a specific area.  It might be a small corner shop, a launderette, a post office, a bank <Col N="43" /> or whatever, but I am speaking specifically about office development.  Is it a five-storey office or can it be a tiny office built on to a suburban home which might be necessary for a particular individual? There are grey areas there that worry me very much in relation to the actual scope of the local authority in the zoning of a suburban area and it is very difficult to decide where the commercial aspect ends and the residential aspect begins.  In fact, it is often very difficult to focus on that point.</P>
    <P>One section which I viewed with particular interest, and I am sure Senator Honan will be supportive of what I am asking here, is section 12, where development may be refused without liability to compensation.  The various cases are listed.  National roads are one.  There is one relating to sewerage facilities.  There is one, which we would agree, relating to air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, vibration or pollution connected with the disposal of waste.  There is an exclusion for developments which would injure or interfere with an historical monument or an archaeological area, but I am very surprised, in view of the controversy over the boglands of Connemara and the environs and wetlands throughout the country, that areas of scientific interest have been excluded, particularly when the Minister is from County Clare.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Burren is of archaeological interest but it is also of scientific interest, when one thinks of the flora and fauna there, and the extraordinary beauty of those rare plants.  I know it may qualify under &ldquo;archaeological&rdquo; but I wonder whether &ldquo;archaeological&rdquo; would cover every inch of the Burren.  I would have been far happier if that had been stitched into the Bill and made far tighter with the inclusion of areas of scientific interest.  I would extend that to Lough Gur.  These are areas which are open for development under Structural Funds, hopefully, but I would be worried, particularly with 1992 zooming before us, that other interests, without our feeling for our environment who would prevail.  The <Col N="44" /> scientific aspect of these should be included.  I would like clarification on that aspect.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this Bill which are exceptionally good.  I can understand why it took so long to reach fruition.  I would agree with the points made by my colleague about the woodland areas and the various other sections. I feel that an independent body for compensatory factors would have been a far better idea, and it would have been far better for the Minister because that will be a very thorny issue in the future.  We would have preferred if the compensation was independent.  On Committee Stage we will reinforce the various amendments which we hope will make the Bill tighter and we hope the Minister will follow on with the same positiveness as he showed in the Dáil debates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation regarding compensation for refusal of planning has, over the last few years, reached the stage of being a public scandal. It is literally something over which the general public feel a sense of outrage and scandal and this feeling is shared by all of us who serve on county councils and, I suppose, particularly to someone like myself who is a member of both Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  We have had horrific claims made against us, £25 million at present in Dublin County Council, a multi-million pound claims which has recently come in to Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  Already Dublin County Council have paid out £1.9 million. This is really a shocking situation.  It is uncalled for; it is unintended and is a public scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has brought this Bill before us.  It deals in a very detailed and very equitable manner with the question of genuine compensation when development plans are deserving of such compensation but tightens the various loopholes which are effectively being used to make outrageous claims and even to gain outrageous sums of money at the expense of <Col N="45" /> the taxpayers, the ratepayers and people generally.</P>
    <P>This is a very complicated Bill, dealing with a matter which is extremely complicated. It is complicated by the legal subtleties of this entire process.  It is complicated again by the fact that we have a written Constitution and, as the Minister mentioned, we are governed by Articles 40 and 43 of that Constitution.  I do not know whether we are unfortunate or fortunate at times to have a written Constitution when it comes to planning permission.  One sometimes has one's reservations.  Certainly in the United Kingdom, which, I think, apart from Albania is the only country in Europe which does not have a written Constitution, in regard to planning they seem to be able to avoid the payment of the sort of appalling amounts of money which we have been faced with at council level in this country.  It is fortunate that this Bill has been brought in because we would have an explosion of outrageous claims following the success of the recent ones in the Dublin area, claims which the county councils cannot pay.  We just do not have the funds to meet them.</P>
    <P>This is far from suggesting that one should be against development.  This country badly needs development and it is part of the process of improving the whole standard of living, the whole environment in which we live.  An essential part of that is that there should be a degree of sensible planning and planning which allows for an improvement of the environment and not a disimprovement. By and large, most of these outrageous claims have related to a situation in which a developer was going to do something which the council rightly considered would have very deleterious effects on the environment.  I do think that where there is a reasonable development and where a council capriciously decides not to allow that development to go ahead, the owner of the property should be able to seek compensation and he or she will still be able to do so under this Bill, not just by making use of loopholes which are totally inappropriate and unintended.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred a number of <Col N="46" /> times to the common interest and quite rightly so.  We have the balance here between the common interest and the individual's rights.  Perhaps in previous years we used to emphasise people's personal property rights too much and hence some of these difficulties which face us today, property rights at the expense of the common interest of people living in an area or county, and perhaps people did not pay enough attention to human rights and environmental rights.  It is very good to see that the Minister is addressing this.</P>
    <P>Again, as a member of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation, I am very happy indeed to see greater protection being given to the planning authorities.  Planning authorities will be placed in a impossible position under the law as it stands.  Let us face the fact, if there is a law in the land, then that law has to be obeyed. Hence the necessity for this Bill into which an enormous amount of work has gone.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of amendments made to the Bill in the Lower House and we must welcome those amendments.  They are very beneficial amendments and have tightened up a number of areas which those of us on local authorities are particularly concerned about.  These are applicable to sections 10, 11 and 12 and perhaps tomorrow, we will be looking at them in more detail.  Paragraph 11 of the Third Schedule is particularly relevant.</P>
    <P>There is one area which needs to be emphasised and that is the area of development plans.  Most if not all counties now have development plans and we have a series of them in Dublin.  With the rapid changes that are taking place it is inevitable that we tend to revise and update these plans.  We will have to note the question of the five year limit which will be very important from a legal point of view because if there is the slightest loophole one can be quite sure some smart people are going to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>Another major improvement from the point of view of the authorities and of the <Col N="47" /> general common good is that we have moved away from the idea of maxi-malisation whereby effectively the developer was claiming, and to some extent gaining, compensation on the basis of what he said would be the maximal development or most optimistic development, most beneficial, most financially advantageous.  The county council or planning authority was put in the very difficult position of trying to argue against that.  That has been reduced at least somewhat by the present debt.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the emphasis on such matters as tree preservation, archaeology and so on.  It is very good that these have been included in this Bill. Such additions were very much overdue. Another aspect which I would also like to welcome because this was a most unsatisfactory area, is the public health proposals on public sewers and water supplies. I am pleased the Minister has taken the opportunity to tighten up these areas. By and large a scandalous situation is being addressed and all of us on every side of the House will welcome this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It clears up the present disastrous situation. People were finding more and more ways of circumventing the approach they should have been taking towards planning. While saying that, we have to assert the right to private ownership, as does the Constitution.  What was developing was a misuse and abuse of the Constitution. This cannot be tolerated and rightly this Bill addresses the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill which I welcome, and I have some experience of this with a local authority, is in relation to the threat of compensation.  Compensation has been mentioned more and more in looking at the implications of planning decisions.  This Bill removes to a large extent the threat of compensation which was inhibiting planning authorities in a proper approach to planning decisions. In a certain case with which I am familiar it is quite apparent that the decision <Col N="48" /> should be to reject the planning permission. The local authority are very concerned about the whole area of compensation and the implications involved.  It is an overriding factor in their approach to the decision and influencing them too much.  At the end of the day I believe they will make the right decision but they should not have to go through this trauma of wondering about the compensatory implications of the decision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the approach of the Bill in making the law more clear to enable people who have not a legal background to interpret the law.  Most of our planners are not legal people; they are officials of councils who have to try to interpret a complex law.  I welcome the Minister's statement and the demystifying of many of the aspects of the planning legislation in the area.  This will make the interpretation of the Acts much easier for planning officials who are not legal people.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 12 in particular which widens the ground for non-compensation, including where the development is immature, in the order of priority.  The development of any area should be planned and should be in order of priority.  Development plans are drawn up very carefully.  Because of difficulties with planning people should not be allowed to run a coach and four through the development plan, which in many areas is flouted but in other areas is held to quite rigidly.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned in the Bill that the effect on national and major roads of increased traffic can be taken into consideration without qualification.  We have seen in many areas where the roads have been wrecked because of developments which have been allowed and local authorities, and in some instances the national coffers, have had to expend large amounts of money to correct the situation. We have become more aware of the environmental factors over the past five to ten years.  Perhaps in some instances people have become a little fanatical about it.  For the purpose of this Bill a wise approach is taken on the seriousness of air pollution, water pollution, noise, <Col N="49" /> which was not an issue at one stage but is now more of a consideration and the whole environmental area.  These areas should be non-compensatory and we must welcome that aspect in the Bill.  We do not want to wipe away all the rights that are there; we want to remove the abuses of those rights.  This Bill will remove abuses of the right to private property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this legislation.  The new provisions are very important and are long overdue. The legislation is largely about growth areas.  Most of the matter contained in the new legislation is not a problem in rural areas to any great extent.  I accept this is a major question and one that is not all black and white.  Development in itself is necessary and important.  Most members of local authorities know that it is very easy to abuse the system.  When a development area is being planned a large number of people are aware of the plans.  I have a keen interest in this, because allegations are made against elected representatives all the time.  I established many years ago that the planners themselves, be they engineers, forward planners or whatever, generally decide what is best for the area.  There could be cases where the planners and developers are influenced by certain commercial interests and by the possibility of a development which is in the pipeline or is offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly believe that the public representatives who have consistently come in for a lot of flak and criticism are not the first to know of the intentions to develop.  I have many years experience of this.  This is very unfair and it does not look good for Dublin Corporation or any other authority of a major built-up area to level allegations on a party basis.  It usually comes across like this.  Usually the criticism is levelled and insinuations and allegations are made that the development is taking place to make some party colleague rich.  It is possible that is sometimes the case but in general there is no foundation and no justification <Col N="50" /> for these allegations.  If this legislation just clears up the area where it is possible to insinuate that party colleagues, of whatever party, are going to benefit from a development, then that in itself will be a good day's work.  This legislation is important and has a useful part to play.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some of the problems in my county which made it necessary to introduce this legislation.  These would be healthy, growth problems.  I do not know what one could do to eliminate them completely, though this legislation will go a long way towards doing that.  If tomorrow any body of public representatives, whether in Dingle, County Kerry, Donegal, Sligo, Dún Laoghaire or wherever, get together and put a proposal to their local authority that a certain area should be developed &mdash; they see the need as it is their job to be aware of and to plan to the best advantage of the district or area they represent &mdash; they automatically come in for criticism from a section who will to oppose it.  There is a rash of new organisations because today you could not put up a dog kennel in any part of Ireland without encountering these professional people.  One wonders where they get the titles as experts on pollution, the environment, and so on. They do not really need to have qualifications at all.  They can acquire the qualifications overnight.  One is subject to every kind of allegation, every kind of pressure, every kind of statement from people whose qualifications to make such statements in the first place might be questioned.</P>
    <P>This legislation sets down useful ground rules and it calls for a fairly clear approach to development.  It closes many loopholes and it makes a useful contribution to the planning laws.  Much more legislation is necessary.  The whole planning and development Act is something that has to be looked at continually. I contend there are many areas we could look at again which would cover the whole of the country.  There is planning and development, there are decisions on industries and on residential areas and built-up areas.  This is a wide subject and one would need much more than ten <Col N="51" /> minutes to make a contribution on it here.  It is very hard to legislate to cover every single aspect necessary for the development of a country.  It is good to have this kind of legislation.  It is healthy. If you have to impose certain controls on development, how can you say that there is no development taking place and that it is not necessary?  I think it is a good day for the country when we are setting down useful ground rules and legislating for the development that we hope will take place, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We will never prevent certain people from making allegations that development decisions are being taken just to make a colleague rich, but I believe this will go part of the way towards eliminating it.  I hope this legislation will close some of the loopholes, will remove some of the dangers and will prevent those who are prepared to plan development which they may never intend to carry out and to force the State into paying very substantial sums of compensation.  I hope that aspect will be eliminated by the new legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his response and on the introduction of this Bill.  I hope he will continue to monitor the development.  The biggest danger I see is that our future in Europe creates the potential for development by people outside the country.  A major danger is from multinationals who are not on the scene at the moment.  I see this legislation as a safeguard and a very useful guideline and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill dealing with planning compensation and related matters. It is a problem that is probably more prevalent in certain areas and it is a problem with which we have been faced in Dublin and particularly in Dún Laoghaire.  It is a problem which has become very emotive and about which at times there has been misleading comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developers have availed of a section of the law and have used it to their advantage. It is fair to say that the major <Col N="52" /> part of it has had nothing to do with councillors or politicians.  Developers have seen the loophole in the law.  It has not been an easy matter to solve because, as the Minister stated, there are conflicting demands between the rights of private property and the rights of the common good.  Somewhere in between you have development and questions arise as to how it takes place in relation to development plans, in relation to material contraventions and what is the ideal planning for an area.  It is a whole question that, being fair to the present Minister and to previous Ministers, cannot be easily controlled or easily tackled.  What we have to do is to see are we getting the balance right.  In certain areas, I think there is quite an amount of merit in this Bill.  In regard to other areas I will certainly be looking for clarification in relation to some points, because I am not entirely satisfied that the approach is the correct one.</P>
    <P>We have had in County Dublin and in Dún Laoghaire a few well known cases where large sums were looked for.  One comes to mind concerning the area of my good friend and colleague from the borough, Senator Conroy, and that is the whole question of Roches Hill.  Here I would like to pay tribute to the work of the officials in Dún Laoghaire in arriving at an award which was realistic in comparison to what was initially being claimed.  The legislation goes some way towards addressing this problem.  In other words, there should be a reduction in values rather than those figures going into millions just pulled out of the sky, apparently on the basis of the bigger, the better the claim.</P>
    <P>We have seen recently, in relation to a development in Booterstown, where the developers put in a £6 million claim for a halting site.  By no stretch of the imagination could such a claim be maintained. An Bord Pleanála have, in their wisdom, acted correctly.  It is an area where I do not think it was appropriate to have a halting site.  If there is to be compensation payable &mdash; and there are obviously cases where it should be &mdash; it should not be <Col N="53" /> more than accident claims or whatever. There should be no sort of &ldquo;the sky's the limit&rdquo; attitude in relation to whatever amount is awarded.  There has to be a degree of rationality in it.  If claims come in, questions have to be asked, the background examined and also an examination of whatever development is proposed.</P>
    <P>I certainly think that some of the matters contained in the Bill which will put a bar on compensation are very worth while.  I would just like to go through a couple of them.  Take the case where a development plan has provided for a certain type of development in an area and an application comes in which is contrary to that.  Take the case of a person who initially, or subsequent to the development plan, bought property in order to fabricate a claim.  Certainly, we have seen that in areas of Dún Laoghaire and Dublin County Council where, in fact, if you told them that they were getting the planning permission, the developers would run a mile.  What they wanted was a refusal; then they could suddenly swoop in with this massive claim, which bears no reality to what is involved.  If the development is contrary to the development plan, it obviously has to be ruled out.</P>
    <P>Also, where for example, there is a development for a national roadway and the line of the proposed road is well known, then normal compensation, in relation to CPOs, arbitration and so on, would be payable.  However, you cannot suddenly say: &ldquo;Well, I would have put up a couple of hundred houses in the middle of the roadway&rdquo;.  That is another aspect we have got to examine.</P>
    <P>People cannot suddenly buy areas of special archaeological interest, containing national monuments, hoping to put in a multi-million compensation claim.  In areas where there are trees where the environment is going to be materially affected, we cannot pay out compensation willy-nilly.  I would ask the Minister, in relation to tree preservation orders, that the legislation should be given more teeth, and that there should <Col N="54" /> be a certain process to back up the preservation order.  It is great putting on tree preservation orders all over the place, but then suddenly a couple of bulldozers move in and that is the end of the trees, and the tree preservation order goes by the board as well.  It is a case where planning authorities should enforce such orders much more strictly.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 14 of the Bill, where compensation may be payable at the Minister's discretion, if he is satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the particular circumstances, payment or compensation should be prevented.  I would ask the Minister to indicate, when he is replying later, what criteria he is going to use here because, with the greatest respect to the Minister present in the House, he or other Ministers could possibly have been accused of looking after their mates or their friends at some time &mdash; and I am sure he or other Ministers who might be there would certainly not like that charge to be unfairly levelled against them.  There is a danger in this that a Minister in such a position, given the normal representations that may be made to him, if he has a way of granting a few bob to this fellow or that fellow, possibly may not stick entirely to the law.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister should consider having some sort of a tribunal, not necessarily An Bord Pleanála.  There is a danger here, when it is left to one individual, that special circumstances can be claimed to facilitate the granting of compensation where perhaps it would not be totally justified.  I would ask the Minister to outline in full exactly how he sees the operation of this section.  It is a section which could cause certain difficulties.  It is a section that could be open to abuse; and I use the word &ldquo;could&rdquo; prudently, because I certainly hope it will not happen.  I ask the Minister to outline the circumstances and how he sees this section operating.</P>
    <P>What is important &mdash; and I suppose some of this is akin to what we were discussing last week in relation to local government reform &mdash; is how the whole planning process is perceived.  Obviously, part and parcel of local government <Col N="55" /> reforms is how an authority is developing an area, how it is perceived as improving an area, the whole question of how councillors decide in relation to a development plan and whether they should stick to it.  A lot of work goes into preparing development plans but no sooner are they made and agreed upon than material contraventions or sections 4 motions come in to make exceptions.  It is very difficult to lay down guidelines for maybe ten years' hence without taking into account whatever changes may come about.</P>
    <P>I certainly think that any large-scale compensation claims have to be looked at in detail and have to be challenged if they are seen as being totally over the top.  There is no point in allowing developers who are just in it for a quick buck to get away with it.  We have to look at the different situations, where a person has property going back a long time as distinct from people who buy property literally with a view to possibly getting a refusal and with a view to squeezing as much money as possible out of a local authority.  I ask the Minister to look particularly at the section dealing with his own ministerial decisions.</P>
    <P>Another item which I would like to look at is the whole question of agreement between developers and authorities and how the arbitration works.  You cannot have a situation where massive claims are coming in and where people are getting money for nothing.  It is important, if these multi-million pound claims are coming in, that certain rules are adhered to and certain guidelines introduced.  An open-ended cheque book should not be available.</P>
    <P>It is a thorny question.  At times politicians come in for a lot of scrutiny, and, I think for a lot of unfair criticism.  Perhaps at times they have deserved some of the criticism which has been levelled at them.  Many people think that, apart from section 4 motions, it is the manager, on the advice of the planning officer, who makes the decision.  Obviously, matters come up and we get representations in relation to various matters that have to be looked at, that have to satisfy a range <Col N="56" /> of planning criteria.  At times you have to have a kind of a half-way house, because if the planners were totally rigid they could turn down a lot of things.  To be fair, by and large many developers are prepared to accommodate and the planners are prepared to adjust their plans but we have to deal with the few cases where compensation claims are, in a way, being manufactured.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when he is replying to consider if he is going to make any changes in relation to the status or effect of tree preservation orders.  I would also ask him to outline precisely how he sees section 14 operating in relation to the Minister making decisions.  We can go on from there and, if necessary, our spokesman will be bringing in amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I hope the Minister will take on board what I have said.  It is a problem which those of us who are in this House and have served on local authorities are probably particularly aware of &mdash; we are aware of the problems which have arisen and of the abuses which have taken place.  That said, the developers have certain rights and, within certain guidelines, hopefully we can arrive at what will be a satisfactory solution of some of the planning difficulties that have occurred in the past, particularly in the Dublin area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1988.  I think this Bill represents a timely initiative in the context of amending the current unsatisfactory position regarding the payment of exorbitant planning compensation. In the past few years we have witnessed local authorities assuming paralysing liabilities on foot of significant court decisions.  I refer, of course, to the well documented judgment in the XJS case in 1986 and the Grange Development case three years later where the courts awarded outrageous damages, leaving the relevant local authorities to bear the brunt of massive compensation awards.  These worrying trends underline <Col N="57" /> the problem with the 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act and have galvanised action to amend the law.  Part III of the 1963 Act provides for compensation awards where particular kinds of adverse decisions were taken against the supposed interest of the prospective developer.  Subsequent court decisions brought into sharp focus the deficiencies of the legislation and the implications for the common public interest.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Bill seeks to repeal the existing unsatisfactory provisions.  Equally, it vigorously restates, in a more coherent fashion, the instances where compensation may not be payable.  In particular, I welcome the clarification of the extension of the grounds on which planning authorities may refuse or attach certain conditions to any planning permission without securing any liability for compensation.  This, in effect, affords greater latitude to the planning authority in the discharge of its statutory functions and particularly in its duty to apply stringent regulations in the necessary process of proper planning and development. The concept of the common good must always be of paramount consideration.  I believe this Bill expands that concept and will ultimately result in more regulated and systematic development of the physical environment, compatible with the interests of all.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out to regulate the right of connection to sewers and water supplies. The planning authority is now empowered to issue a refusal, not only in circumstances where water supplies or sewerage facilities are inadequate but, in addition, where their respective capacities are required for other prospective developments.  Liability for compensation will not occur if it is premature by reference to any order of priority for development indicated in the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased public awareness of environmental concerns has gathered momentum in the past few years, and indeed not before time.  In my view, this provision in the Bill in relation to developments not attracting compensation, where such <Col N="58" /> a permission would cause serious air or water pollution, or any pollution connected with the dispersal of water, lends impetus to this movement and provides increased safeguards in respect of pollutants. It is surely a nonsense and an absurdity that moneys would be paid to prospective developers if the proposed development is likely to have adverse environmental implications.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the exclusion of compensation where planning permission is refused on the grounds of a material contravention of any objective contained in the development plan obtaining at the time the developer acquired an interest in the land.  This will also apply to land acquisition arising after the date of publication of this Bill.  There is much merit in allowing conditions to attach where the preservation of particular buildings or features of their interiors are concerned.  The preservation of structures with intrinsic artistic, archtitectural or historical interest is imperative.</P>
    <P>Section 14 sets out an entirely new procedure permitting a planning authority to rebut a compensation claim by a notice stating that in its opinion an alternative development ought to attract planning permission.  This notice can only be defeated if planning permission is subsequently refused or conditioned in a manner inconsistent with the permissive statement.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the most significant features of this Bill are the rules for computing the amount of planning compensation. These rules are independent of those currently attached to compulsory acquisition of land.  The new rules incorporate a number of additions designed to elucidate the concept of the market value and to discount benefit of public subsidiaries and taxation/rating allowances. The new valuation rules for assessment of compensation essentially comprise the notion of any reduction in value of an interest in land arising from a decision of the planning authority to be calculated on the basis of the difference between the antecedent and subsequent values of the land.  The decision in Onenabue <i>v.</i><Col N="59" /> Dublin County Council in 1982 again highlighted the appalling current legislative deficiencies which give rise to compensation. This case established that payment was not restricted to the probable value of the land if the permission refused had actually been forthcoming. The compensation is determined by the value of the land if permission was granted for optimum development, less the value before refusal, on the assumption that no permission is ever granted.</P>
    <P>Section 25 removes the entitlement of an owner or occupier to connect to a public sewer.  This right will not be subject to consent by the relevant sanitary authority.  It also removes the threat to the local authority of incurring a compensation claim if permission is refused by reason of deficiency in the existing or prospective sewerage or water supplies. This rectifies the current position as spelled out in Short <i>v</i>.  Dublin County Council in 1983 where it was decided, under existing legislation, that a planning authority is not entitled to refuse planning permission without incurring a compensation claim, on the grounds that existing drainage has been pre-empted by development yet to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>There are a number of observations I would like to make, about which I know my own local authority, Dublin Corporation, have registered some concern. Section 13 deals with the notice preventing compensation.  A planning authority may serve a notice within three months of receipt of claims which states that the land in question is, in the opinion of the planning authority, capable of other development for which permission ought to be granted.  This notice may be served irrespective of an earlier refusal or conditioned permission which gives rise to a compensation claim.  Some reservation has been expressed regarding the lack of precision in the text.  It is not exactly clear from the wording whether other developments can be of a nature which would materially contravence the development plan.  I would ask the Minister to refer to this later.</P>
    <P>With reference to paragraph 11, this <Col N="60" /> provision renders material contravention of the development plan a non-compensatable reason for refusal.  However, this is qualified by paragraph 12, which excludes the operation of paragraph 11 in circumstances where a development objective applies to the land at any time within five years prior to the application and the development now proposed would not have materially violated the earlier development objective.  This raises the issue of down zoning which is likely to move the focus of compensation from the development control area to the stage of preparing and adopting the development plan.  Potentially, this scenario could occasion compensation claims in instances where probably no development is intended but would be triggered by the zoning change.</P>
    <P>Purchase notices are dealt with in section 29 of the 1963 Act.  This process enables an owner of land affected by an adverse planning decision to claim that the land has become incapable of, and cannot be rendered capable of, reasonable beneficial use.  The owner may serve notice on the planning authority requiring it to purchase the interest of the land. As is stands, under section 29, an undertaking can be given for other forms of development considered appropriate by the planning authority.  This circumvents the purchase notice and its financial implications.  In section 13 (7) of the Bill before us the proposal is to delete the words &ldquo;or for which the planning authority have undertaken to grant such permission&rdquo; from section 29 (1) (b) of the 1963 Act.  It appears that this proposal will certainly circumscribe the planning authority's flexibility or response to a purchase notice.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate my welcome for this Bill which I believe is a genuinely comprehensive endeavour to tackle once and for all the ridiculous inadequacies contained in the Act with regard to compensation on the grounds for same.  This Bill represents a seriousness on the part of the Government to resolve what was previously a very serious situation where extraordinary compensation awards were made.  In my view, these awards were <Col N="61" /> abominable and placed local authorities already strapped for cash in an extremely dangerous financial position.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, the proposed legislation now before us now redeems the situation by removing imminent claims on foot of specious grounds which were inherent in the original legislation.  The Bill will undoubtedly reinforce the position of the planning authorities in giving greater latitude in refusing undesirable developments without the fear of incurring a subsequent crippling compensation claim.</P>
    <P>In the main, I wish to fully endorse the letter and spirit of this Bill.  It will do much to enhance the regulatory procedures already in place and, in its overall context, will augment the planning procedures in this country.  Local authorities will welcome this initiative and I, too, am happy to be associated with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has a very long history.  It started life back in 1988 and now, in the middle of 1990, it has finally made its way to the Seanad.  I understand it has been fairly comprehensively amended, along the way.  As Senator Ryan said, the Bill itself is primarily born of the inadequacies of the 1963 Planning Act and some of the absolutely extraordinary and grossly excessive levels of compensation which were paid to people.  To the extent that this Bill tightens up the law in the whole planning area it certainly is very much to be welcomed.  However, there are a number of inadequacies in it and certainly one would have hoped that it would have gone rather further.  I understand that it primarily deals with the new green areas and that it is not that directly relevant to inner city areas and so on.  Certainly that is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, many welcome aspects of the Bill.  It certainly is welcome that it would put some curb on the extent to which speculators can quite simply rip off the local authorities and so on and, ultimately of course, rip of the public &mdash; that money which speculators can accumulate or, alternatively, the sort of environment which they can creat for <Col N="62" /> themselves, a licence to print money because of the fact that local authorities are not able to confront them because of the risks of enormous compensation involved.  The tab ultimately has to be picked up by the public either in the form of taxpayers in one form or another or in the form of services foregone by the general public.  Many times the tab has to be picked up by a very vulnerable element of society, mainly the newly married who are struggling to find themselves a home in very difficult circumstances, greatly overburdened with mortgage payments and so on.</P>
    <P>In many ways this Bill is a symptom of the inadequacies of this country's capacity to face up to the changing nature of society.  At the foundation of the State this country was 75 per cent rural, 25 per cent urban.  As we reach the end of the 20th Century this has been turned the other way about.  It is now rapidly approaching the order of 75 per cent urban and 25 per cent rural.  We have made a very poor hand of trying to manage that change by way of getting a planning system in place which serves the interest of everybody.  Many of the things which happened, of course, were quite simply derived from the same principles as the lottery, various planning decisions which, when made, simply made people millionaires overnight without any reference at all to contributing anything meaningful beyond the fact that they were either lucky or, alternatively, were opportunists who happened to be in the right place at the right time or who had the ability to get themselves into the right place at the right time.</P>
    <P>One fundamental problem in all of this is the question of the rights of private property as defined in the Constitution. Speaking as somebody who is certainly not an expert on the Constitution, or indeed on constitutional law, I think the Constitution is effectively double-edged in this.  On the one hand, it talks about the rights of private property; on the other hand, it talks about factors which relate to the common good.  The trouble is that the Supreme Court, or the courts, have never, as I understand it, properly <Col N="63" /> adjudicated as to where the rights of private property end and where the rights of the common good or principles which relate to the common good begin.  That is a great pity because if that whole area of constitutional law were clarified then it would make life considerably easier for many people.  People like myself on the left regret that that clarification has not been made because I honestly believe if it were made given the way the courts have developed and so on the decisions would certainly be to the benefit of the average person and against the vested interests of private property.  I very much regret that such a clarification has not taken place.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to clarify the basis on which compensation can be made.  That is very welcome.  I would, of course, have liked it to have gone a bit further.  The area mentioned by Senator Cosgrave referred to compensation being payable at the Minister's discretion.  I, too, share his alarm at that type of item in a Bill.  It is in everybody's interest that there be clear guidelines and indeed perhaps a tribunal established on some system of appeals and so on so that Ministers would not be at risk of charges of political bias, cronyism and all the rest of that kind of thing which inevitably arise sometimes when the Minister has acted in good faith and indeed has acted in a manner which is fair.  The nature of political life in this country is that those kind of accusations stick.  Inevitably some of them will stick even when the Minister is perfectly in order, which is not to say that Ministers are always perfectly in order.</P>

      <P>I am letting the full meaning of Senator Honan's remarks sink in. That is why I have paused for such a long period of time and I am, as it were, consulting all the little items which are in my head, the way the computer goes <Col N="64" /> through data, to see if I can find an exception. Then, as a second sort of test I have said to myself &ldquo;If there were those exceptions, would it be a good idea that I should mention them?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of a tribunal to adjudicate on the amounts of money which would be payable.  That is very much in everybody's interest.  Planning is a very difficult area all over the place.  It is a very big problem in Dublin.  There is the whole section 4 matter going through the Dublin County Council and all that entails.  I do not want to reiterate what I said here last week but some of what is happening is simply turning millionaires into billionaires.  It is not in the public interest.  It is also a very important public issue now.  In the outskirts of Dublin quite a large number of people are absolutely disgusted at what they see happening before them and the way business is being conducted by contravention of development plans and so on.  It is a latterday scandal which I suppose is a new development of some of the earlier scandals which went on in this whole planning area.</P>
      <P>While I reiterate some of my reservations I welcome this Bill which is certainly a step forward.  It does not go quite as far as I would like but I welcome it to the extent that it curbs some of the abuses and it does, to some extent, put a stop in some types of vexatious claims which really have no basis at all in planning. They are simply money-making stunts which were drummed up by people to fatten themselves up in a manner which is disgraceful because ultimately it is the community which has to pickup the tab for that type of thing.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which marks a major turning point in Irish planning law.  After 20 years of controversy in this area it is a relief to see the Oireachtas finally taking its courage in its hands and taking decisive action to tackle what has long been an intolerable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of this legislation is its provisions putting a halt to the scandalous abuse of our planning laws by speculators. It marks the first time that a clear <Col N="65" /> legislative statement has been made that the property rights guaranteed in the Constitution are not an absolute licence to destroy the environment in which we live.  The Progressive Democrats have long fought to see these changes implemented.  In 1989 our party tabled a Private Member's Bill specifically aimed at preventing such abuse.  Unfortunately the Government of the day failed to support that legislation and so ensured its failure.  In the course of the July 1989 negotiations for the formation of the Government, however, we insisted that the abolition of compensation where the proposed development conflicted with the development plan was quite compatible with the provisions of the Constitution. This Bill today honours the commitment reached in those negotiations to recognise the situation and to prevent the payment of such compensation. Now at last the rights of the community are being given new constitutional weight.  When this Bill becomes law, compensation claims by speculative developers will not be possible where the proposer has been in breach of the development plan area. The only exception will be where the zoning of the area has been changed against the owner's interests in the five years prior to the planning application.</P>
    <P>An equally important aspect of this legislation is its provisions for the imposition of planning conditions to dictate the sequence and timescale of works with the objective, if feasible, of restricting the occupation of structures until the overall development is completed.  This is an issue of major importance.  The scandal of unfinished housing estates has caused severe financial and social hardship across the country and has created eyesores throughout our towns and suburbs. Again, this provision in the Bill honours a specific commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are concerned, however, that this legislation will mark only the first step in a concerted campaign to improve our built environment. The delay by the Oireachtas in moving this Bill demonstrates the extent <Col N="66" /> to which we, as legislators, lag behind public opinion on this vital issue.  In particular, the whole question of urban renewal demands our urgent attention. Despite the best efforts of our local authorities, streets throughout our country have been turned into ghost sites.</P>
    <P>I believe we now urgently need a change of attitude on this problem.  In particular we should move towards the assignment of powers to local authorities and other bodies, to apply to the courts to appoint planning receivers to conserve threatened buildings and lands listed for preservation.  We should examine the possibility of imposing on the owners and occupiers a positive duty to preserve listed buildings and structures.  I believe we need a clear statement of the right of the community to end dereliction and the under-use of urban property.</P>
    <P>In many cases the development plans of our towns and cities are more noted for the extent to which they have been ignored than honoured.  That must end. I hope this Bill will mark the beginnings of a refreshed and determined attitude by us as legislators in particular to encourage the revitalisation of our environment and the rejuvenation of our cities and suburbs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As most of us are aware, this is legislation which has been promised for many years. I am very pleased the Government have brought this Bill forward.  I also want to pay tribute to the Ministers dealing with the Bill from its initiation in the Dáil. Many amendments have been taken on board which have imported the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill generally deals with the amount of compensation arising under the planning code.  While claims for compensation can arise under a number of headings, the principal which is of greatest public concern relates to claims arising as a result of refusal of permission or arising out of conditions attached to permission.  The impact of such compensation claims on planning authorities and the manner in which they have been <Col N="67" /> able to exercise their powers and functions under a Local Government (Planning and Development) Act has been considerable.  This impact has been increased by a number of judicial decisions on the interpretation of the compensation provisions in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts as they stand at present.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that Dublin County Council have within recent times been forced to pay a sum of about £1.9 million in compensation largely as a result of judicial decisions both in the High Court and Supreme Court which effectively reversed earlier High Court decisions as to the interpretation of existing statutory provisions.  At present Dublin County Council have before them claims amounting to some £25 million for compensation arising out of planning decisions.  While not all of these claims will result in payment and while the amount of money involved in these cases, which are processed to finality, that is arbitration, will probably he considerably less than they originally claimed, nevertheless, the sums quoted illustrate the difficulties which planning authorities experience.</P>
    <P>It has to be argued that some claims for compensation will arise out of the situations where landowners are seeking to manoeuvre the local authority into a position where they can expedite the settlement of such matters as road proposals which affect their lands.  Those which cause most concern are where permission is refused on zoning grounds. When the Bill which is currently before this House was originally circulated, because it contained a number of provisions which caused concern to the planning authorities Senators will recall that at that time members of the council and of the Oireachtas were concerned with some of the provisions and suggested amendments.  These were taken on board and I believe have improved the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would particularly like to mention the following.  Section 10, formerly section 11, no longer contains a time limit of 14 years.  It is now provided that before <Col N="68" /> development can take place on land which has been subject to a compensation payment, the compensation must be repaid or its repayment secured.  Sections 11 and 12, together with the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules set out the circumstances in which a refusal of permission or a granted permission with conditions will not attract the liability for compensation.  These sections and schedules incorporate a number of amendments to meet objections raised to the original Bill.  In particular, paragraph 11 of the Third Schedule appears to confer a higher degree of protection in the event of the planning authority refusing permission on the grounds that the proposal would be a material contravention of a development plan than the earlier proposal. It is important, however, to realise that this protection is modified by the provisions of paragraph 12 which restrict protection in cases where a development plan may have changed within the previous five years.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that it is generally agreed outside the House that many of the amendments taken have been most welcome.  My local authority in our discussions on this Bill have raised some areas of difficulties for a planning authority, in particular section 13 dealing with notices preventing compensation. Perhaps at a later Stage of the Bill the Minister might comment on these.  They seem to present a grey area there for the authorities as the Bill stands at the moment.</P>
    <P>Under section 13, notwithstanding the earlier refusal or conditioned permission which gives rise to a compensation claim, a planning authority may serve a notice within three months of receipt of a claim to state that the land in question is, in their opinion, capable of other development for which permission ought to be granted.  A point being made is that it is not clear from the text of the Bill whether other development can be of a type which would materially contravene the development plan.</P>
    <P>Under the Third Schedule paragraph 11 makes material contravention of a development plan a non-compensatable <Col N="69" /> reason for refusal.  This is qualified by paragraph 12 which excludes the operation of paragraph 11 in cases where a development objective applied to the land at any time within five years prior to the application and the development now proposed would not have materially contravened the earlier development objective. This raises the issue of down zoning, which is likely to move the focus of compensation from the development controlled area to the stage of preparing and adopting the development plan, giving rise potentially to compensation claims where probably no development is intended but which would be triggered by the zoning change.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the 1963 Act deals with purchase notice.  This is a process where an owner of land affected by an adverse planning decision may claim that the land has become incapable of, and cannot be rendered capable of, reasonable beneficial use and serves notice on the planning authority requiring them to purchase his interest in the land.  Under section 29 an undertaking can be given for other forms of development considered suitable by the planning authority thus circumventing the purchase notice and its amended financial implications.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (7) proposes to delete the words, &ldquo;or for which the planning authority have undertaken to grant such permission&rdquo; from section 29 (1) (b) of the 1963 Act.  This would circumscribe the planning authorities flexibility of response to a purchase notice.  These points have been raised at planning meetings that we have been attending and perhaps on Committee Stage or later on the Minister may comment on them.</P>
    <P>This legislation has been promised for many years.  It has been required to deal with a problem that has faced local authorities for a long time.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank all the Senators who have spoken on the Bill.  I will deal with all the relevant matters that have been raised on <Col N="70" /> Committee Stage.  I hope to be able to give a comprehensive reply.</P>
      <P>Senators will realise that during the long debate in the Dáil &mdash; this Bill came in in 1988 &mdash; there was a great deal of discussion on it.  The Chairman and I, being rural Members, do not come up with the very complicated planning applications that are now being made, as often as people in the metropolitan areas or larger towns.  We have seen also that these larger developments that are taking place in many areas throughout the country are putting a major demand on our sanitary services.  That is why we will be spending £1,000 million in the next ten years to augment existing supplies and to bring forward new schemes.</P>
      <P>The main concern of everybody here was with regard to ministerial power. That was in the 1963 Act but it was only used to my knowledge, on two occasions, the last being in 1984.  In case Senators may be concerned I should be the person who would say that the compensation provision should be in this new Bill, any Minister of the day would be very careful before implementing that part of the Act. The good thing about it also is that the Minister of the day shall not decide the amount.  That is important.  It will be by agreement or by arbitration.  The amount could be large or it could be a token amount.  The Minister of the day does not decide that.  That was in the 1963 Act. We are not being unreasonable.  The Minister of the day who was not a member of my party in 1984 revoked it.  He saw fit to make an order to that effect when, in his opinion, he saw an injustice and I do not recollect anyone at the time saying he was wrong in that.  If he feels it is not being dealt with in a fair manner, it will be done by agreement or arbitration.  I shall elaborate more on the circumstances on Committee Stage because all the Members seem to have a reservation in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On some Bills we put through, we are accused of giving too much control to the public service and then when we give control to ourselves there is a reservation about that as well.  Sometimes when we have the power we do not want to use it; <Col N="71" /> we take easy options and we run away when it suits.  That is across the political divide.</P>
    <P>In regard to a matter of this nature any Minister of the day, with all due respects, would be very careful and would be advised very much by his senior officials in the Department of the Environment before he would take that course of action.  This Bill before us, with the best advice given to us by the Attorney General, by the parliamentary draftsmen who prepared the Bill and after full and detailed discussion, is an amended Bill which was first introduced in the Dáil. That is why I decided to send out to Senators a few days ago an explanatory memorandum to make it as clear as possible. I understand there will be a very detailed debate here on Committee Stage, when we will take the Bill section by section and, subject to the agreement of the House, I will be as helpful as possible.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Senators' support for <Col N="72" /> the Bill.  I have no doubt it has gone a long way towards the tidying up of the Planning Acts.  The Planning Act, 1963, was the first measure we brought in and we have come a long way since then as regards development of services.  There has been an upturn in the economy especially since we came into office three years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying last week that the Irish language is on the point of death.  On that I would like to quote some statistics from a book called <i>The Death of the Irish Language &mdash; A Qualified Obituary,</i> by R. Hindley of the University of Bradford, published this year, in which he used figures from the census of population, together with the Minister's own Department's figures on the deontaisí.  He concluded that the number of habitual Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht areas were less than 10,000 and that 10,000 were distributed as follows: in Donegal, 1,944 habitual Irish speakers; in the Connemara Gaeltacht, 5,691; in the Kerry Gaeltacht, 1,689.</P>
      <P>This is perhaps the most comprehensive survey carried out on the state of the Irish language.  We have the astonishing, frightening and utterly depressing figure of fewer than 10,000 habitual Irish speakers.  Let us not attack the man.  I would like to hear the basis for his figures challenged if they are incorrect.  He did it on the basis of the official statistics put together by two different independent organs of the Irish State, one the census of population and the other the Department of the Gaeltacht grants that were available.  It is a frightening and depressing spectacle.  It is worth asking why it is that Údarás na Gaeltachta, the Department of the Gaeltacht and so on have failed in such a spectacular fashion to arrest the decline of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible to argue that spectacular television campaigns from time to time funded by the national lottery do a lot to gloss over the problem but they do not solve it.  Only a concerted programme involving the people of the Gaeltacht can arrest this almost decline unto death of the Gaeltachtaí.  For that Teilifís na Gaeltachta is an absolutely unequivocal necessity.  It is not longer a question of argument.  It is easier to bring up children in the French language in this country than it is to bring up children through Irish, because there is a French language television service available via satellite. It is easier to bring up children speaking Spanish, Italian, German or, indeed, Welsh, because in large parts of the <Col N="75" /> country children can be offered the availability of comprehensive television services in those languages.  The one language in which we cannot offer our children a decent television service is our own.  That is an outrageous and disgraceful position.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is the incessant delay.  RTÉ have provided an outline of a cheap transmission service.  Udarás have shown there are people in the Gaeltachtaí ready, willing and able to provide the programmes.  The problem is the political will at Government level, and perhaps at Government advisory level, because all the political parties are officially in favour.  One of the unfortunate facts that the records show is that the Minister of State, who is present, has been less than enthusiastic about the idea of some of the studies that have been done.  In particular, he has from time to time been less than enthusiastic about the feasibility study of Údarás na Gaeltachta when answering questions in the Dáil.  On 7 February in the Dáil he gave the impression that the Údarás report was just one of many being examined.  He cast some doubts on that.  He suggested that it was in some way equivalent to the interdepartmental working party on television broadcasting in Irish.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at what is in those two reports.  Both reports recommended two hours of Irish language programming per night.  The 1987 report recommended that the two hours be broadcast on RTE's existing channel.  Údarás recommended that a separate channel be established so as not to alienate English speakers by eliminating some of their chosen programmes in English and in the process perhaps do more harm than good, and also so as not to inhibit possible extension of Irish language broadcasting by having to continuously to cut back at the English-speaking community's choice of programmes.</P>
    <P>The total capital cost of setting up a separate transmission frequency, building three main studios and linking them into the RTE network of regional studios, would be £5.1 million according <Col N="76" /> to the Údarás report.  According to the 1987 report the capital cost of building and equipping extra studios and facilities in RTE so as to be able to make and broadcast two hours per night in Irish would be £8.45 million.  To do this by RTE would cost £3 million more than to do it as a separate channel in terms of capital investment in studios etc.  According to Údarás, the total running cost of Teilifís na Gaeltachta would be £9.6 million. Many think that that is too high a figure but that is the figure Údarás have worked out.  It would still be cheaper to run that service in the way that Údarás provided even with what many people believe to be an inflated Údarás figure, than to do it the way that RTE have suggested via two hours per night on Network 2.  The estimated cost of two hours per night Irish language broadcasting via RTE is over £10 million and that does not include the lost revenue from advertising which could be as high as £5 million.</P>
    <P>There is the ludicrous position of a service being proposed which is not the one the people in the Gaeltacht want, and which is going to cost more than the one the people in the Gaeltacht want.  In whose interest is that proposal?  I do not know if it is in the interest of the Irish language community or Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is féidir an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil.  An Irish language service based in the Gaeltachtaí could be run for less money than a service based on RTE's existing transmission network.  For instance, there would be the enormous problem of travelling to and from Dublin to produce programmes, many of which would emanate from the Gaeltachtaí but which would be broadcast from studios in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in the Dáil on 7 February and 14 March, the Minister gave the impression that Telefís na Gaeltachta would only be available to 80 per cent of the Gaeltachtaí and 50 per cent of the rest of the households and that he would <Col N="77" /> not be happy with that.  That is a gross misrepresentation of the Údarás report. All that Údarás was asking was what would be available in the first phase of a planned development.  It is a gross misrepresentation of the report to say that is the limit.  There is no reason in the wide world why this service should not be available to all Gaeltacht households. RTE estimate that the system they are recommending, a system of rebroadcast links, would make the signal available initially to at least 80 per cent of Gaeltacht households.  The system must be set up first, because of the sort of system that is involved, before one could be sure of the precise figures but it would be at least 80 per cent and that could be extended in Phase 2.</P>
    <P>We are also leaving out, and so far the Minister has left out, the future developments. Phase 2, as referred to in these reports, which will provide nationwide coverage on MMDS and on the other 45 or so cable systems outside Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Unfortunately, what we are getting from the Minister, who is supposed to be defending the Gaeltacht, are selective reporting and selective commentary on the reports and particularly on the technical side of the reports.  The fundamental question then remains as to what is going to happen?</P>
    <P>Níl aon bhac theicniúil ann maidir le soláthar sheirbhís teilifíse sna Gaeltachtaí.

Bheadh sé níos oiriúnaí freisin ó thaobh meath na nGaeltachtaí de.  Maidir le ceist cheannais, b'fhearr an tseirbhís a bheith lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht, leis.

      <P>Is mian liom cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an rún seo.  Tá brón orm nach bhfuil a lán Gaeilge agamsa.  I hope the House will forgive me if I make the points I want to make, as briefly as possible, in the second language of the country and with respect to my colleague, Senator Ó Foighil, who framed the motion in the first language.</P>
      <P>I am always very amused when I hear Senator Ryan and his colleagues making contributions in this House.  I give the Senator first prize for over-use of adjectives, such as &ldquo;outrageously awful&rdquo;, &ldquo;appallingly bad&rdquo;, &ldquo;disgracefully this and disgracefully that&rdquo;.  The Senator certainly gives food for thought in his flowery use of the English language and, indeed, in what I can understand of the Irish language as well.</P>
      <P>However, I found it a little disingenuous and perhaps even more unfair that the Senator should direct criticism at the Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht who, unlike himself, lives in a Gaeltacht area and is a native Irish speaker and whose credentials in this area certainly should not be questioned, least of all by a University Senator who takes it upon himself to come up with issues and whose response to the issue today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is something like the flavour of the month.  Is it Teilifís Ghaeltachta that is now in flavour of the month in Cork University?  I am delighted if it is.  I do not want to give the impression that I am running to the defence of a defenceless Minister because I am sure the Minister will be more than capable of responding to some of the outrageous points that the Senator brought up in the <Col N="79" /> course of his contribution.  Suffice to say that there is general agreement within Government, and I would say in the country, that there should be a recognition of the existence of the Irish language as a living language and that this acknowledgement should and would be best expressed through the provision of an Irish language service on one of the most up-to-date mediums that people now associate with television as distinct from radio.</P>
      <P>This gives me an opportunity to compliment the Radio na Gaeltacht service on bringing a cohesiveness to the Gaeltacht that was lacking.  It shows that communications can bring cohesiveness to disparate communities.  The Gaeltacht is becoming an increasingly disparate geographical entity.  From that point of view, it should be put on the record that there is no opposition in principle to the provision of a suitable or adequate Irish language service.  Many of the points raised by my esteemed colleague, Senator Ryan, and others who have contributed to this debate, show the complexities involved in providing a service that would be acceptable to the widest number of people.  There must be borne in mind the various aspects of providing such a service, the technical aspect, the commercial aspect, whether it is to be a commercially-oriented channel that is to provide the service, all of which require careful and orderly deliberation by Government.  I believe that this what the Government, the Minister of State and the Department of the Gaeltacht are about: careful, orderly deliberation of what is a complex problem.  There are no easy solutions.  The references that were made to Údarás na Gaeltachta sum this up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Senator Ryan, as in a lot of cases, is very selective in his use of the Údarás na Gaeltachta report and he glosses over an important part of it, namely, the cost factor.  Television is costly.  One has to look no further than the delay in setting up the third independent commercially-run channel in this country, TV3.  They are still waiting for <Col N="80" /> the &ldquo;off&rdquo;, one of the main reasons being money.  They want to be sure of the market and that the technology is in place that will enable them to maximise their signal nationwide.  That is only fair and proper.  However, I concede that people will argue &mdash; and I would have sympathy with the argument &mdash; that the Irish language is separate, is sacred, is something that if we profess to be Irish, we should have a commitment to, and commercial considerations should not arise where the future of the language is concerned.  I would have sympathy for that point of view.</P>
    <P>To suggest, as Senator Ryan and others have suggested, that the only viable option under actual consideration is that two hours be set aside in Network 2 for Irish language programmes is a gross misrepresentation of reality.  It is but an option.  It is one of several options being discussed and deliberated on by Government and, indeed, by all of those who have an interest in setting up an Irish television language service.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with Senator Ryan's premise that two hours of programmes in Irish on Network 2, presumably in prime time, would disrupt and discomfit those who have no interest in the language and would perhaps do more harm than good. I readily concede that that option is not one that should immediately be accepted as being the only one.  Of course, I fully accept it but I want to emphasis the point that it is but one of several options, and it may not even be a runner at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>Time will tell.  As has been pointed out, the Údarás report stated that it would cost £9 million to set up and approximately £10 million a year to run.  It may surprise critics of my contribution today to realise I would be somewhat dubious about those figures. The pace of advancement in technology, especially in television technology, is such that it is becoming more and more accessible to programme markers and television stations around the world.  If <Col N="81" /> one can parallel the development of sound technology, it is not all that long ago that having a cassette recorder in one's house was a unique phenomenon. Today it is commonplace.  Now video cameras are in many households around the country.  I will not go so far as to say they are commonplace because they are a very expensive piece of technology, but the point I am making is that it is accessible technology to the masses. Therefore, the cost of running television programmes should be lower than it was some years ago and I would cast doubt on the figures Údarás na Gaeltachta have come up with.</P>
      <P>I also believe that the Government have, to some degree, cast doubt on the figures put forward by Údarás na Gaeltachta because they submitted this report to the Department of Communications, to the Department of the Gaeltacht and to RTE for evaluation.  It is my understanding that this report has come back and is on the Minister's desk.  Perhaps this debate might give the House an opportunity to hear from the Minister the conclusions of that report or some indication of the thinking of the Government in relation to the cost factor and to RTE's evaluation of the Údarás na Gaeltachta report and indeed as to the view of the Department of Communications who, of course, are vitally involved in this also.</P>
      <P>There are complex issues, as I said earlier and one of them must be the technical issues.  Most of the Gaeltacht areas are in pretty rough terrain, and I do not mean that in any disrespect.  There are mountains in County Leitrim as big as the Twelve Pins and the Bluestacks.  It is a reality that in Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry and West Cork there is difficult terrain from a technological point of view.  I know the West Cork-South Kerry area very well; my wife comes from the Beara Penninsula.  It is a source of great frustration to many people in that part of the world that they cannot always pick up even RTE radio signals because of the difficult terrain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, to establish an adequate transmitter service that would bring a <Col N="82" /> separate language service, first, to the people of the Gaeltacht and, secondly, to the wider area, to Irish language speakers throughout the country as a whole, is a complex technical problem and one that has to be addressed not only on the technical side but on the cost side also.  We have to consider the kind of programmes such a service would provide.  I know the argument to date has been on forcing or encouraging the Government to agree that there should be a service at all.</P>
    <P>I have already, I think, established that the Government are not in principle against the idea of an Irish language service. I believe that is the case and perhaps it will be explored and expanded on by the Minister in his reply.  Having said that, we have to look at the kind of service, and that too must be a serious factor, before coming to a decision in relation to the motion before us.</P>
    <P>Do we have programmes of a bilingual nature such as the very successful &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo;?  Do we have programmes which are produced within the Gaeltacht areas that are of the Gaeltacht that portray this unique culture in our society, that will give people who are non-Irish speakers or who have no real interest in or knowledge of the language on opportunity to see life in the Gaeltacht area, and, most importantly, give to the Gaeltacht people what I talked about earlier, cohesiveness, an identity to cherish?  Or, &mdash; and here perhaps the Minister might be prepared to take it on board &mdash; should there be dubbing of existing programmes? It is a well-known fact that English language television programmes are among the most popular in the world. Those of you who have travelled on continental Europe will know that &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; is as popular in France and Germany as it is in America or in this country, yet it is not in Americanese, it is dubbed in the language of the county concerned, be it France or Germany.  It is a very cheap form of programming.  It requires actors and actresses reading a script before a film screen which is taped and then transmitted.</P>
    <P>Would it be worth contemplating dubbing in the Irish language programmes <Col N="83" /> that are popular or creating programmes of that genre with an Irish setting using the Irish language?  There is an immediacy about such programmes and people will watch them.  The soap operas I am talking about, even in English, use very basic English.  They are not very complicated programmes to follow.  Take the Kylie Minogue phenomenon; &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo; which has been proven by surveys to be most popular among pre-teens and nearly pre-school children.  It is a point and there might be some merit in exploring the argument for dubbing existing programmes.</P>
    <P>It is important also to note that when we talk about an Irish language service we are not talking exclusively about the Gaeltacht.  I appreciate that Senator Ó Foighil among others, has always made the point he does not wish Irish to be compartmentalised or categorised as being something separate within Ireland. The Gaeltacht is as much part of Irish society as O'Connell Street.  It is important in the deliberations of Government, when contemplating the type of service that should be put in place, to keep in mind who it is being aimed at in the programmes.  It is important to think not only of the Gaeltacht but of Irish speakers nationwide and the rest of the population &mdash; I put myself in that category &mdash; who have a smattering of the language and would like to have more.</P>
    <P>Is it under consideration to put an Irish language service on the MMDS network? This has been touched on by a number of speakers.  As the House is aware, TV3 will be transmitted on the MMDS network nationwide and, in fact, it is a legislative obligation.  It is on a must-have, must-carry basis.  The franchise holders when installing multichannels must carry TV3.  Is there an argument for having an Irish language service which would be independently run or for which the facilities could be provided by RTE for independent film makers, as happens with Channel 4 in England where there would be private money involved but the important thing would be that it must be carried on the MMDS service.  Could RTE, by <Col N="84" /> way of levy, be able to make a financial contribution to that?  Could the European dimension be brought into play here because of the cultural aspect?  These, and many other questions, need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to harp too much on Senator Ryan's contribution.  Generally speaking, when talking about an Irish language service there seems to be a certain glib, simplistic approach as if it is something that can be manufactured out of the air.  All I will say, and I say it to Senator Ryan, is that there was a very successful movie a few years ago which was called &ldquo;ET&rdquo;.  He was an extra-terrestrial. He lived up there.</P>

Is páirt thábhachtach dár gcultúr í an Ghaeilge agus tá sé riachtanach go dtabharfadh Oireachtas Éireann cabhair ar gach bealach lena chinntiú go mbeidh tacaíocht láidir ann dár neamhspleáchas agus dár náisiúnachas.  Iarraim sa rún seo an seans céanna a thabhairt dár dteanga fanacht beo, dála an Bhéarla.  Is meán cumarsáide an-chumhachtach í an teilifís, a bhfuil tionchar mór aici ar dhaoine óga. Tá iarracht den saol sa 21ú aois ann, saol nach bhfuil réadúil.  Cuireann easpa theilifís Gaeilge i gceantair Ghaeltachta as go mór do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus cuireann sé seo brú ar an teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní féidir leis an teanga coinneáil beo mura mbíonn sí le feiceáil ar na meáin chumarsáide is nua-aimseartha.  Mura ndéantar é seo beidh tuairim láidir ann go bhfuil an teanga as dáta agus nach mbeadh fiúntas ar bith inti ach mar theanga chultúrtha agus stairiúil.  Ceapaim nach mbeidh an teanga beo amach anseo mura mbíonn sí le cloisteáil ar an teilifís, go mion agus go minic.  Tá an rún <Col N="85" /> seo ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas stop a chur le meath na Gaeilge, go mórmhór i measc na hóige.  Gan teilifís na Gaeltachta beidh ár dteanga uasal ársa ar an dé deiridh agus beidh sí chomh marbh le hart taobh istigh de ghlún eile.  Ní féidir linn tubaist mar seo a cheadú.</P>
    <P>I cannot overestimate the importance of the Irish language to our national identity.  We are very proud of our independence. It is an independence that was hard fought and the one thing that reflects our independence, both our national independence and our independence as a culture in a united Europe, is surely our language.  This is why I think this motion is important.</P>
    <P>As a person from the Gaeltacht I would like to criticise our educational system which to date has failed our Irish language. The compulsory element in the educational system when I was learning Irish at school killed it for many of us.  I have a great love for the Irish language and travel to the Gaeltacht regularly.  I have what I believe is a good conversational knowledge of Irish but I almost dry up when I have to speak formal Irish because of the way I was forced to learn it.  The emphasis which was placed on grammar has caused this. When one broke loose from that, mixed with the Gaeltacht people and spoke their language one saw a different aspect and I am pleased I had that experience.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that television is a great means of communication.  Our young people look at it constantly and it is a great influence.  If we are determined to keep our language alive, we must be in a position to give programmes to our young people, programmes to which they can relate, programmes in which our young people can see the worth of the language; a language that is live, a language that will last.  This is not unusual. In Wales there is a television station.  It is ironic that Margaret Thatcher is prepared to allocate £12 million to keep the Scots Gallic alive through the involvement of television in Scotland.  A similar situation arose in Spain as I already said and I will not repeat my remarks.</P>
    <P>There are three areas I believe which <Col N="86" /> identifies our cultural uniqueness, which identifies our difference from our European colleagues and indeed from the rest of the world.  They are, first, our language, second, our music and third, our sport.  Our sport is alive and well and from the heart of hurling country it is well served by the GAA.  Our music is flourishing but it was at one stage on the way out.  It was similar to the Irish language today but it was saved and brought back to life by that great man, Seán Ó Riada.  He went to the same school in Adare as I did, though at a different time.  Our language is now in danger of dying because of the speed and influences of communication.  I believe that Teilifís na Gaeltachta will do for the Irish language what Ó Riada did for Irish music and I would ask the Government to give the language that opportunity.</P>

      <P>Sílim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh stáisiún teilifíse Gaeilge againn.  Nuair a bhí mé óg níor fhoghlaim mé oiread is focal amháin Gaeilge, mo bhrón.

Ach nuair a tháining sé isteach i mo aigne gur mhaith liom bheith i mo Sheanadóir thosaigh mé ag foghlaim na Gaeilge arís le fonn.

      <P>I am not quite as depressed as my colleague, who gave very depressing figures for the Irish language and I am sure his figures are correct. It is depressing to hear that there are fewer than 10,000 people using the <Col N="87" /> language at present.  This national survey carried out by Micheál McGreal, the survey of the national language, 1988-89, does not seem to paint such a depressing picture.</P>
      <P>One of the important points touched on by Senator Neville was that there is less compulsion nowadays in relation to the language.  There is a new and changed impetus.  I think the language is proving to be more attractive to young people. There is a certain goodwill towards it that simply was not there in the past when there was that very compulsive element. Nowadays we have the sad fact of emigration, of young people going abroad to work.  Somehow or other, the further away they are from Ireland the more attractive the country becomes and the more important to them their native tongue and their native culture.  I think those young people return to the country they realise how important our native culture is if we are to keep our national identity and we are not to be subsumed into the great mass of Europe.  When we consider that our country has three million out of a population of 320 million young people realise how important that identity is and the important role of our culture and language.</P>
      <P>I believe many Gaeltacht areas now realise they have something special, something important, and something they do not want to lose and they do not feel the country should lose.  There is a new sense of pride.  Last year I was down in Dingle.  It was my first visit to that Gaeltacht area.  I was told there that ten or 15 years ago people in the shops in Dingle were very reluctant to speak Irish if an English-speaking person came in but that is completely changed now.  There is something they are proud of and they know it is something important.  If there is a tourist element attached to it, so be it.  Why should they not take advantage of it?  These Gaeltacht areas know they have something unique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE have done and are doing a good job as far as they can.  Any of the programmes in the Irish language or Irish cultural programmes have been of a high <Col N="88" /> standard as has been said, our Irish music will perhaps be what will most help to revive our national culture and our language. I do not think the suggestion that we should reduce the amount of programmes in English on RTE and replace them with Irish programmes is the answer.  What we do need is a new television channel and it is imperative that it be based in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>An bhliain seo caite chuaigh mé go Corca Dhuibhne, go dtí Dún Chaoin, agus chuir mé fúm ansin le clann a raibh mórán páistí ann, clann a raibh an Ghaeilge go líofa acu.  I láthair na huaire, ó tharla nach bhfuil ach cúpla clár as Gaeilge ar an teilifís, caithfidh na páistí éisteacht le cláir as Béarla agus níl sé sin sásúil do éinne, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta nó do mhuintir na hÉireann a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu.</P>
    <P>We need a separate Irish television station.  We need it to help learners such as myself who are trying to make the first faltering beginnings in the language.  We need to encourage people who had good Irish at school and who want to keep that competence.  We want, above all, to have it so that children growing up in these Gaeltacht areas do not regard speaking Irish as something strange but that Irish which comes across on television helps them to realise it is part of their daily life. I think we also need it as a separate entity to counterbalance the weight of the Anglo-American culture which we have bombarding us at all times.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is another element to this, that we might look to see to what extent such an Irish television station could become part of a Celtic culture within the European Community.  We might look to see to what extent we could co-operate with the Scots, the Welsh and the Bretons, cabhrú le chéile chun an cultúr Ceilteach a chothú.</P>
    <P>That is something which would be enormously beneficial to all the Celtic people in the European Community.  I would like to lend my voice to those who are pressing for an Irish television station firmly based in the Gaeltacht.</P>

    <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir Ó Foighil agus na Seanadóirí eile as ucht an seans a fháil an t-ábhar seo a phlé, ábhar atá an-tábhachtach ar fad, agus os rud é go bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach sin, tá mise ag cuidiú leis an leasú.</P>

I mo thuairimse, níl an teanga ag fáil bháis, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Foighil agus na Seanadóirí eile le linn díospóireacht na hoíche anocht agus na seachtaine seo caite.  Caithfimid a admháil go bhfuil a lán rudaí á ndéanamh faoi láthair chun an teanga a spreagadh go toilteanach ar fud na tíre.  Tá dul chun cinn mór déanta, dar liomsa, go dtí seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an scéal níos fearr sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá thart ar 80,000 duine sna Gaeltachtaí éagsúla faoi láthair agus ní ceart na daoine seo a &ldquo;ghettoise&rdquo;, mar a déarfá, agus teilifís Ghaeltachta a chur ar bun dóibh siúd amháin.  Ní réiteodh sé sin an scéal in aonchor.  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr cláir Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil ar an teilfís náisiúnta.  Sa tslí sin bheadh seans ag gach duine laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht na cláir a fheiceáil agus foghlaim uathu.  Sin an tslí leis an teanga a choimeád beo agus a leathnú ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman said she did not think it was right that we should have programmes in Irish on national television. I wonder why?  Is it because the people who would be watching national television would not like to have Irish programmes on the national television? <Col N="90" /> I would see it as an opportunity for everybody to learn Irish.  We must remember that there are more people interested in speaking Irish and promoting the use of the Irish language than the people who live in the Gaeltacht.  The people of the Gaeltacht themselves would be the first to admit that fact.  If you provide essentially for a television service just for people who are living in the Gaeltacht and speaking Irish in the Gaeltacht, what do you do with the rest of the community? How do you provide a facility for those people to learn?  Surely it should be a two-way process, that you provide a service where everybody would have access to that medium and then encourage the people in the Gaeltacht to mingle with those people learning Irish in the rest of the country.  That is the way we should promote the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I happen to have had the good fortune to get my second level education in an all-Irish speaking school, St. Flannan's College in Ennis.  It is not in a Gaeltacht area, and there are quite a number of other Irish-speaking schools in other parts of the country that are not within the Gaeltacht either.  Unfortunately, and to my regret and my shame, when I left St. Flannan's to a very large extent I turned my back on the use of the Irish language, mainly because there was no need for me at that particular time to use the language in any way.  So, like many other people, because I got lazy it never occurred to me that it was so important I should keep the language beo.  I forgot it.  Dhein mé dearmad air, mar a déarfá. It was after quite a considerable number of years I realised the error of my ways and I set about trying to get back to where I was before.  I have to admit I am still at that process at the moment, trying to get back to where I was before.</P>
    <P>I realise how important language is as a part of our culture and heritage and there are many other people like me in the country.  All of them need to be encouraged to brush up on the use of their Irish.  I would have to pay tribute to Senator Hederman who is in the process of learning the language.  She is an example of the goodwill there is there <Col N="91" /> towards the language and the fact that people, if they get the opportunity, will learn it.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that I got involved in trying to learn Irish again and promote the use of Irish at every opportunity, I am a member of a steering committee that was set up some years ago by the Minister for the Environment.  The idea of that committee was to promote the use of Irish on a voluntary basis within the local authority areas and I would stress the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;.  This committee has had a fair deal of success.  We work in very close co-operation with Bord na Gaeilge whose administrative staff give us great support and assistance.  The procedure we adopted was that we set up a sub-committee on the Irish language in each local authority area and by degrees we are creating an environment where people will be relaxed and happy in the use of Irish and will try to speak what Irish they have.  Programmes in Irish on the national network would be of great benefit to the many people who are in the process of learning the language.  In that way the language will remain vibrant and alive in the Gaeltacht and will be increasingly used outside.</P>
    <P>My own constituency of North Tipperary is a prime example of what can be done in relation to the promotion of the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht.  As a follow through of the steering committee that was set up at local level, the North Tipperary VEC decided to get involved in the promotion of the Irish language.  They took it on as a project and they called it &ldquo;Tiobraid Árann ag Labhairt&rdquo;.  It has been an outstanding success.  There was tremendous goodwill all round for the language and we were amazed at the response we got from all sides.  Every stratum of society is involved in that particular project.  We have businessmen, clergy, schools, the general public, farmers, housewives, parents, children, teachers.  It is absolutely amazing how the project has taken off.  All of them without exception, every section of society, are absolutely 100 per cent behind the project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> I am talking here about people who never had the opportunity to learn Irish at any stage.  I was one of the fortunate ones, I got the opportunity but I let it slip when I left second level school but I am hoping to correct that as time goes by. There are quite a number of people who never got the opportunity to learn Irish and those people are as committed to the promotion and use and learning of Irish as any of the others.  That has to be borne in mind.  I do not think that in order to keep the language alive we can just put all the emphasis on the Gaeltacht and say that if we promote the use of Irish within the Gaeltacht itself it will survive.  That would be to put in a ghetto a section of the population.  We have to broaden our horizons in relation to the use of the language.</P>
    <P>In relation to the committee that was set up, we hold an annual conference in the Gaeltacht each year.  That conference has been a great success.  It is now recognised as one of the best conferences of the year.  I do not think this would be the case if local politicians did not have an interest in and goodwill towards promoting the use of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I know time is of the essence at this particular time, but I have just one small word of regret in relation to the University of Limerick.  As I understand it, there are just two words of Irish used in all of the University of Limerick and those are &ldquo;Ollscoil Luimní&rdquo;.  De réir deallraimh níl ach an dá fhocal sin á úsáid. Tá mic léinn ag freastal ar an ollscoil sin ó na Gaeltachtaí agus gach áit eile.  Ní mórán é a iarraidh ar lucht stiúrtha na hollscoile sin úsáid na Gaeilge a spreagadh ar fud an choláiste.  I do not think it is too much to expect that an Irish University should promote the use of the Irish language within one of our universities.</P>
    <P>I wish to support this amendment.  I know if it goes through, with the support of the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta the Irish language will be promoted.</P>

De réir m'eolais, is traidisiún é le fada an lá i dTithe an Oireachtais nach ndéantar a leithéid d'ionsaí i leith daoine nach bhfuil deis acu iad féin a chosaint sna Tithe seo.  Is trua liom go mór nár chloigh an Seanadóir Ó Foighil leis an traidisiún sin.  Cúis iontais dom freisin é, nuair a smaoinítear ar an gcúnamh a fuair an Seanadóir ó na daoine céanna sa Roinn sin le linn a bhlianta mar bhainisteoir chomharchumainn sa Ghaeltacht.  Seirbhís thar barr atá á chur ar fáil acu i gcónaí ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus leis na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cé nach bhfuil deis ag na daoine sin iad féin a chosaint, tá an deis sin agamsa. Dearbhaím go bhfuil foireann den chéad scoth sa Roinn.  Muna bhfuil muinín ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil san Aire, ná san Aire Stáit, ná sa bhfoireann, ach go háirithe, ba mhaith liom a rá anseo tráthnóna, go bhfuil lanmhuinín agamsa sa bhfoireann atá agamsa i Roinn na Gaeltachta. Is eol daoibhse go léir go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht agus pobal na Gaeilge i bhfad níos measa as, mura mbeadh Roinn na Gaeltachta ann.  Beidh deis ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil, tráthnóna, an méid a dúirt sé i leith na fóirne atá agamsa sa <Col N="94" /> Roinn, a tharraingt siar, agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Déanadh tagairt sa díospóireacht anseo do thionchar agus do thábhacht na teilifíse i saol an lae inniú.  Glacaim leis an ráiteas seo go hiomlán.  Is léir go bhfuil tionchar thar cuimse ag an teilifís ar fhormhór an phobail ar fud an domhain; is amhlaidh an cás sa tír seo, go háirithe ar dhaoine óga agus ar dhéagóirí.</P>
    <P>Dúradh freisin go mbeadh tionchar mór ag an teilifís ar athbheochan agus ar chaomhnú na Gaeilge laistigh den Ghaeltacht, agus lasmuigh chomh maith.  Aontaím leis an dtuairim sin agus glacaim leis go mbeidh ról lárnach ag an teilifís in aon iarracht a dhéanfar chun an áit is dual di a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge i saol na tíre seo.</P>
    <P>Tagraím anois don rún nó don tairiscint go gcuirfí seirbhís teilifíse Ghaeilge/ Ghaeltachta ar bun roimh dheireadh na bliana agus go gcuirfí i gcrích na moltaí a dearnadh i dtuarascáil Roinn na Gaeltachta. Breathnaíonn sé seo furasta go leor, go háirithe nuair atá tú sa bhfreasúra. Nuair a thosnaítear ar impleachtaí na moltaí a scrúdú go mion, agus nuair a chuirtear san áireamh na tuairimí éagsúla a nochtadh anuas tríd na blianta, maraon leis na tuairimí a nochtadh sa díospóireacht seo, is léir go bhfuil an scéal i bhfad níos castaí agus níos deacra ná moltaí tuarascala a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach aon dochar ag an bpointe seo féachaint siar ar chuid de stair an cháis seo.  Foilsíodh tuarascáil i 1987 a bhí réitithe ag grúpa oibre a bhunaigh Airí Gaeltachta agus Cumarsáide na linne i 1986.  Léirigh an tuarascáil sin go mbeadh ar a laghad 14 uair a chloig de chláir oiriúnacha in aghaidh na seachtaine ag teastáil chun seribhís shásúil i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil agus measadh go gcosnódh na cláracha sin thart ar £10 milliún sa bhliain.  Dúradh go gcosnódh gnáthlíonra tarchuir don tír ar fad thart ar £25 mhilliún ach aithníodh go raibh forbairt teicniúla ag teacht chun cinn, mar shampla, MMDS a d'fhéadfadh crot eile a chur ar an ngné sin den scéal.  Is go <Col N="95" /> gairid i ndiaidh fhoilsiúchán na tuarascála seo a chualathas don chéad uair ó dhream atá luaite go minic le linn na díospóireachta seo sa Seanad, sé sin Meitheal Oibre Theilifís na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé suimiúil machnamh a dhéanamh ar cheann de na bun-rudaí a dúirt an Mheitheal Oibre i gceist ag an am:</P>
    <P>Tá géarghá le seirbhís áitiúil theilifíse, le freastal ar phobal na Gaeltachta go príomha ... Dá mbeadh éileamh ar na cláracha a dhéanfadh Teilifís na Gaeltachta sa chuid eile den tír d'fhéadfaí na cláracha sin a dhíol le RTE le craoladh ar fud na tíre ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anois táthar ag rá nach miste seirbhís a bhunú, i bhfocail an Fheachtais Náisiúnta Teilifíse, a fhreastalóidh ar phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta agus nach ceart go mbeadh aon bhaint ag RTE leis an tseirbhís seo.  Is mór an t-athrú atá tagtha ar a bhfuil á lorg le cúpla bliain anuas.</P>
    <P>Réimse eile a bhfuil tuairimí éagsúla ina leith ná costas na seirbhíse agus cé mhéad uair sa tseachtain a mba ghá chun seirbhís shásúil a chur ar fáil.  Tá an tuarascáil a réitigh an grúpa oibre i 1987, agus an tuarascáil a réitigh Údarás na Gaeltachta, ar aon fhocal faoi uaireanta a chloig de chraolachán sa tseachtain &mdash; 14 uair a chloig &mdash; agus beagnach ar aon fhocal faoin gcostas a bhainfeadh lena sholáthar, £10.25 mhilliún sa bhliain ag an ngrúpa oibre, £9.6 mhilliún sa bhliain ag an Údarás.  Shilfeá uaidh seo gur rudaí iad sin, ar aon nós, a bhfuil daoine ar aon fhocal futhú.  Ach ní mar a shíltear a bítear.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh an dúch tirim ar thuarascáil an Údaráis nuair a tháinig cáipéis chugainn ó Bhord an Údaráis, bord ar a bhfuil an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ina bhall tofa.  Dúirt an cháipéis gur shíl an bord go bhféadfaí seirbhís dhóthaineach a sholáthar le hocht uair a chloig d'am craolta in aghaidh na seachtaine a chosnódh £4.62 mhilliún in aghaidh na bliana.  Dearbhaíonn an tuarascáil agus táim ar aon <Col N="96" /> tuairim leis gur den riachtanas é go mbeadh ceithre uair a chloig déag d'am craolta á sholathar gach seachtain.  Is ábhar iontais dom é go sílfeadh Bord an Údaráis, agus an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil ina bhall den bhord seo, gur leor ocht nuaire in aghaidh na seachtaine.  An bhfuil na daoine seo i ndáiríre, nó nach bhfuil?</P>
    <P>Níor chloígh an Bord, áfach, le ceist na gclár.  Mheas siad, freisin, go bhféadfaí an costas caipitil a ísliú £1.55 mhilliún; ísliú de 27.5 faoin gcéad a bheadh i gceist anseo, ó £5.65 mhilliún go £4.1 mhilliún. Luaigh an bord freisin go raibh seans ann go bhféadfaí níos mó airgid ná seo, a ghábháil, trí ísliú a dhéanamh ar chaighdeán chuid den treallaimh a bheadh in úsáid.  Is dóigh liom go raibh comhaltaí uilig an bhoird sásta leis an moladh sin. Tá sé ráite, faraor, acu siúd atá ag lorg na seirbhíse gur den riachtanas é go mbeadh treallamh den scoth ar fáil chun cláracha den scoth a dhéanamh, agus anotaím féin go hiomlán leis an dtuairim sin.</P>
    <P>Is é atá faoi chaibidil anseo ná rún atá breactha síos ag gach ball d'Fhine Gael sa Seanad.  Nuair a bhí an rún céanna á mholadh ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil, luaigh sé cuid de phríomhmholtaí thuarascáil Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Orthu seo bhí am craoladh de cheithre uaire a chloig déag in aghaidh na seachtaine, costas reatha de £9.6 mhilliún sa bhliain, agus is é a dúirt sé ná: &ldquo;Ní thuigim cén fáth an bhfuil an oiread sin moille agus fadhbanna le sonrú i dtaobh na tuarascála.&rdquo; Dúirt sé freisin: &ldquo;Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Meitheal Oibre Theilifís na Gaeltachta in ann a chruthú go bhféadfaí ceithre uair a chloig déag in aghaidh na seachtaine a chur ar fáil ar chostas sé mhilliún punt.&rdquo;  Ba é £9.6 mhilliún, an chéad meastachán a bhí againn; laghdaíodh go £5.65 mhilliún sa tarna háit é, agus anois tá £6 mhilliún i gceist.  An cheist atá aige orainne ná &mdash; cén fáth go bhfuil an oiread sin moille i gceist agus an oiread sin fiosrucháin á dhéanamh sa ghnó? Agus daoine ag caitheamh figiúrí éagsúla amach &mdash; £9.6 mhilliún, £5.6 mhilliún agus £6 mhilliún! <Col N="97" /> Más amhlaidh an scéal thuas, cén fáth go bhfuil sé á mholadh sa rún atá curtha síos ag comhaltaí agus ag Seanadóirí Fhine Gael &ldquo;go gcuirfí i gcrích na moltaí atá sa tuarascáil teilifíse a chur Údarás na Gaeltachta ar fáil&rdquo;.  Ar na moltaí seo, bhí ceann a dúirt gur costas £9.6 mhilliún a bheadh i gceist.  Céard mar gheall ar thuairimí Bhord an Údaráis, a bhfuil an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ina bhall de?  Tá an bord seo den tuairim gur leor £4.62 mhilliún chun ocht n-uair a chloig d'am craolta a sholáthar chuile sheachtain. B'fhéidir freisin go bhféadfaí treallamh a cheannach nach mbeadh den chéad scoth.  Ní hé sin deireadh an scéil, áfach. Ag tacú leis an tairiscint di, dúirt an Seanadóir Jackman &ldquo;&ldquo;Is é mo bharúil go mb'fhéidir é a bhunú ar £5 mhilliún nó faoina bhun sin ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Foighil nár thuig sé cén fáth a raibh an oiread sin moille i gceist.  Measaim go bhfuil sé léirithe agamsa anseo, tráthnóna, go bhfuil cúiseanna ar leith leis an scrúdú agus an dianchíoradh a bhí le déanamh againne agus ag an Roinn Cumarsáide agus ag RTE sa ghnó seo.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Mooney ceist mar gheall ar an Roinn Cumarsáide agus tá freagra agam anseo air.  Tá an tuarascáil sin agamsa anois le cúpla lá agus beidh ormsa anois agus ar oifigigh mo Roinnese, scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na moltaí sin; moltaí iad seo a tháinig ón Roinn Cumarsáide a bhí i dteagmháil le RTE, áit a bhfuil na saineolaithe ar fáil.  Ina dhiaidh sin, rachaidh mise ag plé na ceiste seo leis an Taoiseach agus le Airí na Gaeltachta agus beidh sé á phlé, ar ndóigh, ag an Rialtas níos déanaí.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag gach duine, fiú muna bhfuil siad sásta é a admháil, go bhfuil an Rialtas seo dáirire maidir le ceist na teilifíse.  Is eol dúinne cé chomh tábhachtach is atá seirbhís teilifíse.  Tá a fhios againn cé chomh tábhachtach is atá seirbhís teilifíse, ní don Ghaeltacht amháin, ach don tír go léir, ní hamháin do 80 faoin gcéad den Ghaeltacht, ná do 50 faoin gcéad den tír ach don tír ina iomlán, idir <Col N="98" /> dheisceart agus thuaisceart.  Tá go leor daoine i dtuaisceart na tíre a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge, atá ag teacht chuig na Gaeltachtaí leis na blianta agus iad faoi bhrú ag an am céanna.  Ní raibh sé éasca orthu agus tá an dualgas orainne gach iarracht a dhéanamh chun seirbhís a sholáthar dóibhsean chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Nílimid ag deánamh cúlú ar bith sa cheist seo; táimid réadúil ina thaobh.  Tá spéis mhór ag an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas sa scéal.  Bhí an Comhrialtas i gcumhacht ar feadh ceithre bliana go leith agus ní raibh suim dá laghad ag an gComhrialtas sa Ghaeilge.  An mó punt a chuir siad isteach sna bóithre áise sa bhliain 1984-85?  Agus an mó i mbliana?  Suim agus dairíreacht i leith na Gaeilge atá faoi chaibidil anseo.  Tá airgead gann ach i mbliana tá árdú de 27 faoin gcéad le sonrú i Meastacháin Roinn na Gaeltachta. Léiriú é an t-ardú seo ar dháiríreacht agus ar shuim an Rialtais i gceist na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ceist mhór í seo agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé deacair a rá nár cheart luach a chur ar ár dteanga, ach caithfear an gné seo a thabhairt isteach san áireamh.  Tá dualgas orm fiosrú a dhéanamh sa scéal, nuair a thagann ball de Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta atá ina Sheanadóir, isteach sa Teach seo ag rá go mbeidh Údarás na Gaeltachta ábalta £1 mhilliún a chur ar fáil as an ngnáth soláthar.  Táim féin faoi bhrú ag an Údarás céanna i gcónaí agus déanaim mo dhícheall chun breis airgid a chur ar fáil.  D'ardaíomar an uasteorainn anuraidh ó £4.5 mhilliún go £9 milliún. An féidir a rá nach bhfuil suim ag an Rialtas seo ná ag an Roinn seo i bpobal na Gaeilge i gcoitinne?  Deir daoine, ar chóir a bheith eolach sa ghnó, go mbeidh £1 mhilliún le fáil as an ngnáth soláthar. Tá an dualgas ormsa an cheist a fhiosrú má tá an cineál sin airgid le fáil ón méid atá á thabhairt d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Táim i ndáiríre faoin gceist anseo.  Tá moltaí faighte agam ón Roinn Cumarsáide; beidh mé á scrúdú agus beidh mé á bplé leis an Taoiseach, fear a bhéas <Col N="99" /> gnóthach anseo agus san Eoraip go dtí deireadh na míosa seo chugainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt i dtaobh rúin Fhine Gael, is é sin, go gcuirfí i gcrích na moltaí atá sa tuarascáil teilifíse a d'ullmhaigh Údarás na Gaeltachta. Is é atá i gceist ann ná seirbhís teilifíse Ghaeilge a bhunadh le freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, sa chéad áit, agus ar an tír go léir ina dhiaidh sin.  Is é mo thuairim go bhfuil an dualgas orainne gach cabhair a thabhairt chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt ar fud na tíre.</P>
      <P>We have at present an obligation to ensure that all technological developments are put in place to the maximum degree and in a correct location in relation to the development of the Irish language.  Listening to some of the speakers I have heard various criticisms about our method of teaching, the fact that we have failed, since our independence in 1922, to ensure that Irish became a national language that could be spoken on a wide basis throughout the country, as envisaged in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>I believe the approach suggested in the report from Údarás na Gaeltachta, that was commissioned incidentally at the behest of the Taoiseach himself, is the correct one, namely, that the emphasis is on a development from a position of strength, from a location of strength and that is the Gaeltacht itself, rather than coming down from RTE.  I believe that is the essential issue that is at stake, how the proposals, as envisaged, are going to be introduced.  I would be very much concerned, considering the statement and attitude over the past 12 months of the Minister for Communications that that would not be his perception.  He is, from his statements, inclined to move towards the break-up of the public service in terms of broadcasting and I feel we have no commitment from the Minister himself in relation to the development of a service from the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> I believe it would be counterproductive if there was an extension of time given on RTE, that it would, if anything, impair the likelihood of an effective programming in Irish throughout the entire country.  If we are going to be effective, we must work from ground where the Irish is strong; and the Irish is strong in the Gaeltacht.  If we can have a separate station established in the Gaeltacht, that we ensure it is transmitting there first and foremost.  That then goes in a wider circle to other areas and then it goes in a still wider circle to the country at large.  That, to my mind, is the critical issue: that we would approach this matter in terms of development from the ground up rather than RTE imposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PolOFoighil" hpid="Pól Ó Foighil Pól Ó Foighil">
      <NameTxt>Pól Ó Foighil</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím, ar dtús roimh an Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus roimh chuile dhuine a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo ó thosaigh sé seachtain ó shin.  Níl dabht ann ach gur léiríodh ansuim sa bheocheist seo le linn na tréimhse.  Tháinig an-chuid Seanadóirí chun tosaigh agus léirigh siad a suim san ábhar trí Ghaeilge a labhairt, de réir mar a bhí sí acu.  Léirigh sé freisin, an rud atá á rá agamsa i gcónaí ón gcéad lá a dtáinig mé isteach sa Teach, is é sin, má tá an toil ann, gheofar bealach chun réiteach a dhéanamh.  Mar a dúirt an Leas-Chathaoirleach nuair a labhair sé ar ball, ní duine mé atá ag labhairt ar son na Gaeltachta <i>per se;</i> tá mé ag caint faoin dtír iomlán agus faoi Ghaeilgeoirí uilig na tíre.  Ní féidir liom dul ar aghaidh gan freagra éigin a thabhairt don Aire Stáit maidir leis an lascadh a rinne sé iarracht a thabhairt dom faoi go raibh sé ag cur ina luí orm go raibh mé dána le linn dom bheith ag caint an tseachtain seo caite. Ach tá mé ag rá leis, cibé rud a dúirt mé, go dtacaím leis agus go gcreidim ann, agus ní duine mé a iarrann rud gan fáth a bheith leis, agus ní duine mé a théann taobh thiar de chlaí le rud ar bith a dhéanamh. Creidim i mo chroí istigh, tar éis dhá scór bliain a chaitheamh i mo chónaí sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge <Col N="101" /> beagnach imithe, básaithe, sa Ghaeltacht, agus gur gearr uainn an lá, an chéad ghlún eile, nach mbeidh sí á labhairt sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Sin an difríocht idir mise agus an Aire Stáit.  Creidim é sin, de réir mo thaithí féin, agus is mar gheall air sin a labhair mé ar an chaoi sin, agus sin an chaoi a labhróidh mé arís.  Mura mbíonn Teilifís Ghaeltachta ann taobh istigh de bhliain, agus níl mé a rá go gcaithfidh sé bheith ann roimh an 31ú de mhí na Nollag, tá mé cinnte dearfa go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag sleamhnú, ag imeacht uainn agus táimid ag caint anseo faoi chúrsaí airgid.  Táimid ag cur costais ar an Ghaeilge ag an bpointe seo i stair na teanga.  Níl an costas tábhachtach.  Is í an cheist atá ann, an bhfuil an Ghaeltacht chun maireachtáil? An bhfuil sí le fanacht beo?  Sin an cheist, agus sin é an fáth an rún seo bheith faoi chaibidil agam anseo.</P>
      <P>Ní ceist chostais í.  Mura bhfuil an Stát seo, an Rialtas seo, mura bhfuil muidne, muintir ne hÉireann, sásta airgead a chur ar fáil anois leis an iarracht deireanach a dhéanamh, nuair atá an Ghaeltacht ar an dé deiridh, tá thiar orainn, tá deireadh linn.  Tá an bás i ndán don Ghaeltacht mar Ghaeltacht, agus tá sé ag saothrú an bháis an lá atá inniu ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag caint faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta, ní rud pearsanta a bhí i gceist agus ní dhearna mé aon tagairt do dhuine ar bith i Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Bhí mé ag caint go corparáideach faoi eagraíocht Stáit atá ag feidhnmiú gan cheann, gan Aire, agus deirtear liom anseo go bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta ann.  Níl aon Aire na Gaeltachta ag an Ghaeltacht; tá sé in ainm is a bheith ann.  Bhí ceann ag Roinn na Gaeltachta nuair a bhí an Comhrialtas eile ann a raibh an tAire Stáit ag caitheamh anuas air, agus ná déanaigí dearmad gurbh é an Comhrialtas eile a chuir Roinn na Gaeltachta ar fáil agus a thug Aire na Gaeltachta Uí Dhomhnaill dúinn.  Agus sin mar a bhí ó thús.  Tháinig Fianna Fáil ansin agus rinne siad díspeagadh ar an Ghaeltacht.  Chuaigh siad <Col N="102" /> bealach eile ar fad agus anois tá Aire againn nach Aire é, beag ná mór.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh mé go pearsanta, agus ní bheinn go pearsanta, faoi dhuine ar bith, ach tá mé ag rá anois, mura n-éiríonn an Rialtas as an tseafóid atá ar bun acu agus as an drogall atá orthu rud éigin a dhéanamh go práinneach, agus mura gcuireann siad faoi chois na ráflaí atá ag dul thart faoi eireaball a bheith ar RTE 2 agus cúpla uair an chloig Gaeilge á léiriú air más é sin atá beartaithe ag comhairleoirí an Aire, go dteipfidh air.  Beidh raic sa Ghaeltacht agus neart le cloisteáil ag Aire na Gaeltachta agus ag Aire Stáit na Gaelachta, más é sin an cinneadh a dhéanfar i ndeireadh báire.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin an-soiléir ón díospóireacht, go bhfuil chuile dhuine a labhair, fiú amháin lucht Fhianna Fáil anseo, ag rá gur chóir go mbeidh an tseirbhís ann. Tá ceist bheag shimplí agam: cén áit, cén bealach, cén uair a bheidh sé ann?  Nuair a chloisim an Ghaeilge á labhairt ar an teilifís agus í lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht, mar is ceart í a bheith agus í dírithe ar mhuintir na h-Éireann uilig, agus cláir ar nós &ldquo;Skippy&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Lassie&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Dempsey's Den&rdquo; i nGaeilge, déarfaidh mé go bhfuil seans ag an teanga.  Tá an t-aos óg ag teacht aníos agus is í teanga na teilifíse atá acu, an teanga Bhéarla.</P>
    <P>Níl aon locht agam ar na daoine óga sin, ach tá locht agam ar an Rialtas nach bhfuil in ann, nach bhfuil de mhisneach iontu, deifir a dhéanamh agus an tseirbhís a thabhairt isteach.  Ná bímís ag caint faoi £1 mhilliún anseo agus £1 mhilliún ansiúd.  Is seirbhís atá ag teastáil.  Tá an teanga ar an dé deiridh agus caithfear theacht i gcabhair ar an Ghaeilge, ar an Ghaeltacht anois díreach.  Ní an bhliain seo chugainn, ach anois díreach.  Tá an lá imithe agus tá sé rómhall anois.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfainn glacadh leis an leasú atá déanta ag an Rialtas.  Tá siad ag iarraidh orainn go mbeadh lánmhuinín againn as Aire na Gaeltachta.  Ní fhéadfainnse a rá go bhfuil lánmhuinín agam as Aire na Gaeltachta, mar níl aon Aire na Gaeltachta againn.  Nuair a fheicfidh mise <Col N="103" /> istigh anseo é agus é ag caint linn ar theilifís Ghaeltachta, nuair a chloisfidh mé é ag caint faoi sa Dáil, creidfidh mé go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil seans ann go bhfuil dé éigin in Aire na Gaeltachta go fóill.  Ach níl sé le cloisteáil, níl sé le feiceáil, níl aon rud ag teacht uaidh agus fad agus a bhaineann sé liomsa, níl aon Aire na Gaeltachta ann.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, ní fhéadfainnse, ar aon bhealach, glacadh leis go bhfuil aon chiall nó aon réasún leis an leasú atá molta.  Is bealach atá ag an Rialtas le héalú amach as an rud uilig.  Níor thug siad aon chúnamh, níor thug siad aon seasamh don Ghaeltacht, agus níl siad á thabhairt; ach an oiread leis an bPáirtí Daonlathach i nGaillimh nuair a bhí an cruinniú acu cúpla seachtain ó shin; níor thug siad san aird ar bith ar an Ghaeltacht.  Ní raibh aon rún faoin Ghaeltacht ar an gclár.  Tá an leigheas ag an Rialtas.  Tá an tuarascáil ar fáil agus na moltaí acu.  Níl le déanamh acu ach dul ar aghaidh agus gníomh a dhéanamh.  Ná bíodh eadrainn £1 mhilliún nó £2 mhilliún.  Más é an bás nó an bheatha atá i ndán don Ghaeilge anois, b'fhearr go mór le muintir na Gaeltachta go dtógfaí £1 mhilliún punt as ciste Údarás na Gaeltachta, as ciste Roinn na Gaeltachta, agus é a úsáid le Teilefís na Gaeltachta a chur ar bun.  Thiocfainn leis sin, agus chabhróinn leis sin.  Tá mé cinnte go nglacfadh formhór mhuintir na Gaeltachta leis sin.  Níl sé ceart ag an Aire Stáit a rá go bhfuil mise ag iarraidh deireadh a chur le teacht isteach Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Níor thuig sé céard a bhí á rá agam.  Ba é an pointe a bhí a rianú agam ná go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar an dé deiridh, ach arís deirim má chuirtear teilifís Ghaeltachta ar bun anois tá seans éigin ag an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go bhfuil todhchaí na Gaeilge ag brath, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Murphy, ar áiteanna taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Más mar sin is maith le muintir na hÉireann, agus leis an Rialtas, bíodh acu.  Bíodh a fhios againn gur mar sin atá sé mar pholasaí acu.  Tá neart <Col N="104" /> Gaeilge ag daoine ar nós SBB agus Bibí agus Kathleen Watkins (Faces and Places) agus Pat Kenny.  Níl fáth ar bith nach mbeadh siadsan in ann cláir Ghaeilge a chur ar bun in éineacht le muintir na Ghaeltachta.  Tá neart daoine sna Gaeltachtaí féin traenáilte ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, atá in ann cúrsaí agus cláir a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Níl i gceist ach mhilliún, ach más £6 mhilliún féin é, cén difir, cén dochar.  Is é bás nó beatha na teanga atá i gceist, agus nuair atá a leithéid i gceist ní féidir bheith ag argóint faoi £1 milliún anseo nó £1 milliún ansiúd.  Tá sé an-éasca ag aon Aire nó aon Taoiseach £1 milliún a chaitheamh anseo is ansiúd go fánach, ach dá gcaithfí é ar son na Gaeilge, ar son na teilifíse, bíonn caint mhór faoi. Dhá scór bliain ó shin chuaigh mé ag múineadh sa Ghaeltacht agus bhí Gaeilge phaiteanta, shaibhir ag gasúir na Gaeltachta. Na scoileanna céanna inniu, tá an Ghaeilge imithe astú, agus tá an Ghaeltacht ag imeacht in aghaidh an lae.  Is air sin amháin atá mise ag díriú m'intinn go huile is go hiomlán.  Teastaíonn uaim go dtabharfar éisteacht do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus don rud atá ag teastáil uathu, agus ní don rud a cheaptar anseo a chuirfidh leigheas orthu.  Má tá Seanadóirí ag cur lánmhuiníne in Aire nach bhfuil ann, is beag an seans atá againne go mbeidh aon Ghaeltacht ann amach anseo nó go mbeidh teacht aníos inti ná seans aici. Thóg sé tríocha bliain ó na tríochaidí sul má bhí Raidió na Gaeltachta ann agus bhí orainn feitheamh ar a leithéid d'fhear maith agus George Colley chun é sin a chur ar bun.  Tá an-difríocht, faraor, idir an chás a bhí againn an uair sin agus an cás atá anois ann.</P>
    <P>Nuair a labhair an Seanadóir Donie Cassidy, ní raibh ag cur as dó ach nach ndeachaigh An Teachta Garret FitzGerald ag Cluiche Ceannais ariamh.  Ní thuigim, mar sin, cén fáth go bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh leasú a dhéanamh ar rún a bhfuil gach duine ag tacú leis.  Thug an Seanadóir Mooney oráid bhreá uaidh agus d'admhaigh seisean go bhfuil gá leis <Col N="105" /> an tseirbhís seo a lonnú sa Ghaeltacht. Mar sin, ní tuairimí pearsanta atá ag teastáil anseo ach tuairimí an Rialtais, agus go mbeadh siadsan againn.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Donegal Meat Factory Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister <Col N="107" /> to the Seanad and express my sincere appreciation that he came in to respond to this motion, because I consider it a very important one.  I am glad to have the Minister here because he has a contribution to make.  A statement from him to be very valuable at this time.  I appreciate it very much.</P>
      <P>I did not lightly put down the motion on the Adjournment.  I realise that to use this opportunity to raise this matter as a publicity stunt or in the sense of flying a kite would be far from productive when dealing with a matter so delicate and so serious.  In fact, it would be a disservice to the people whom I hope to assist. My motion refers to the serious situation caused by the closure of the meat factory at Carrigans, County Donegal and it asks the Minister for Industry and Commerce to try to resolve the dispute and have the factory working again.  Farmers in County Donegal are completely in the dark and they are unaware of the situation. Statements have been made, the IFA have had meetings and I believe it is necessary to have the position clarified.</P>
      <P>I fully understand there is a serious difference of opinion on major issues, many not directly relating to the Carrigans meat factory, between the Minister, his Department and Goodman International and I appreciate that these differences are not the easiest to resolve. There is no simple statement that I or any other person could make that would contribute to removing any obstacles there.  It is in that frame of understanding that I approach this motion.  However, because I live in County Donegal within four miles of the Carrigans meat factory, I believe it is important for me to raise this matter on the Adjournment to highlight the difficulties and to give the Minister an opportunity to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way the people who are in the cattle business and the sheep business look at it in County Donegal is that they have a newly equipped factory at Carrigans and the owners, according to the <Col N="108" /> best information available, are Goodman International.  It is a very modern factory and Goodman International have a market at a time when cattle and sheep are difficult to sell.  These are the bones of the problem that exist in County Donegal at present.</P>
    <P>The list of priorities is simple enough. There are many people whose jobs are at stake.  There are about 300,000 cattle, 40,000 cows, and 330,000 sheep plus lambs in County Donegal.  In 1989 we had 6,580 applications for headage payments and over £4.5 million was paid.  Therefore, the cattle and sheep industry is a vital part of the economy of my county.</P>
    <P>The Carrigans meat factory is to Donegal what Waterford Glass is to Waterford. That is the magnitude of the concern of the people in Donegal.  On 20 April 1989 I wrote to the Minister and had a reply.  I also wrote to Goodman International to ask them to assist me. I will quote from the reply I got from Goodman International and I will give the Minister a copy of what I have received also.  The letter from Goodman International states:</P>
    <P>For your information we signed the contract for the acquisition of the plant on 14 June 1989.  Within a few days we injected over £4.5 million into the company to enable all farmers, suppliers, creditors and employees to be paid in full and to clear off a substantial bank debt incurred by the previous owners.  Following our acquisition, we spent substantial sums on parts of the plant which were not up to our group's high standards with the objective of having the plant operational for the main killing season in the middle of October 1989.</P>
    <P>In fact we had eased the inspection following this work in early September and got full approval.  The history of the problem relating to the Merger and Acquisitions Act is as follows:</P>
    <P>On 28 June 1989 mergers were notified by the vendors.  On 26 July <Col N="109" /> queries were raised by the Department of Industry and Commerce. On 9 August 1989 queries were replied to in detail.  On 12 September Department of Industry and Commerce notification without prior warning to the Free Trade Commission. On 19 September 1989, a full submission by our Group to the Fair Trade Commission.  On 9 October 1989, report by the Fair Trade Commission to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  On 11 April 1990, ministerial order preventing the factory from opening.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts that Goodman International have supplied to me.  It is an important issue in County Donegal and it is important that the Minister and his Department are seen to contribute towards resolving the difficulties in their domain.</P>
    <P>I will not underestimate those difficulties. I believe the Minister has to look at the situation and how it affects the life of the small farmer in County Donegal.  Unfortunately, my county does not have very large milk quotas.  We have a large number of small family farms that are depending on rearing a small number of cattle.  The average herd is about seven cattle so that gives some idea of the size and the farm income that is affected.  I will not talk about the current problems with cattle: I do not think that is an important part of what I hope to do.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister, however major the difficulties between Goodman International and his Department, to examine the Carrigans factory situation in the light of what it is doing to the community that depends on it for a livelihood. My county has a very high number of unemployed.  We have ambition, the people there are hard-working and this is a very big issue.  I hope the Minister can contribute to a settlement of the dispute. I am delighted he has come in here, that he did not choose to send in a representative. I ask him, if it is humanly possible, <Col N="110" /> to press his Department, or whoever is responsible for the hold-up at this time, to try to resolve the Carrigans situation, to take it out of the general picture.  If there is an overall dispute with Goodman International, then I ask the Minister to resolve the dispute and please try to allow Carrigans meat factory to go into operation and relieve the difficult situation we have in County Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, my action in relation to the Carrigans meat factory in County Donegal arises under my functions under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987.  This legislation sets out to control takeovers and mergers involving any two or more enterprises, at least one of which carries on business in the State, coming under common control and where they exceed certain financial thresholds, as defined in the 1978 Act. Where a merger or takeover is proposed, which falls within the scope of the Act, notification of the proposal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is obligatory.  A merger or takeover cannot be concluded until the Minister has stated that he does not propose to prohibit it, either absolutely or conditionally, or, in the absence of such a statement, until the period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, or from the date of receipt of such further information as the Minister may require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal involving the proposed acquisition of the entire issued share capital of DJS Meats Ltd. at Carrigans, County Donegal by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors Ltd. was notified under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987, on 27 June 1989.  Additional information was requested from the parties on 26 July 1989 and while the notifying parties responded on 9 August 1989 it was considered that they failed to fully answer all the questions raised.  The additional information requested was eventually <Col N="111" /> received on 17 January 1990.  I notice that very pertinent fact was omitted from the letter of 7 May which was sent to Senator McGowan.  The three month timescale for my consideration of this proposal and for the proposal involving the proposed acquisition by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors of Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Ltd., expired on 16 April 1990. I referred the proposal involving the proposed acquisition of the DJS Meats Ltd., plant by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors to the Fair Trade Commission on 11 September 1989, my predecessor having referred the earlier proposal in respect of the Master Meats plants and I received the Commission's report on 10 October 1989.  Under the Acts I have discretion initially to approve a proposal without further investigation or to refer it for investigation to the Commission, which are obliged to investigate every proposal referred to them and report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on their investigation.  The Commission's report must state their opinion as to whether or not the proposed merger or takeover would operate against the common good in respect of the criteria set out in the Schedule to the Act.</P>
    <P>While, as I have indicated, the Commission's report in relation to the DJS Meats Ltd., plant was received on 10 October 1989 I did not wish to consider this proposal in isolation from the general issues concerning Master Meats which were very complex and which had fundamental implications for the future of the beef processing industry.  In this regard it was clear to me from the Fair Trade Commission's separate report into the change in control of the Master Meat group that effective control over the group was being exercised by a person with other substantial involvement in the meat trade in Ireland.  I considered it undesirable and contrary to the common good for this control of the third largest meat processing group to continue and, <Col N="112" /> therefore, undertook rigorous examination of the legal means, including the powers available to me under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts 1978 and 1987, by which this undesirable control could be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>While this examination was continuing I was, of course, aware of the concerns relating to the closure of the DJS Meats plant in regard to the future prospects for employees at the plant and the difficulties for farmers in the area, as effectively no slaughtering has taken place in the plant since the end of June 1989, although I believe the factory was open for boning and processing for a fairly substantial period of time since then.  Indeed, I had two meetings with representatives of the IFA in this regard.  However, as I have already indicated, it was necessary for me to complete my examination of the general issues surrounding the Master Meat group before taking my decision in relation to the DJS plant.</P>
    <P>On 11 April 1990 in the due exercise of my powers under the Mergers Acts, I made two separate orders prohibiting the proposed acquisitions by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors of the DJS Meats Ltd. Plant and of the Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Ltd. plant.  Under the order relating to DJS, this prohibition will cease to have effect if and when the Omagh Master Meats plant has been disposed of as a going concern to interests other than Anglo-Irish Beef Processors or connected parties and if and when there are no anti-competitive agreements or arrangements between Anglo-Irish Beef Processors or connected parties and Master Meat Packers or connected parties.  It should not be too difficult to sell that single plant.  That is the only condition because I discovered from the IFA that they were under the impression that the disposal of all the Master Meat processor factories was required, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In making the orders I carefully considered reports of investigations by the Fair Trade Commission and I consulted with <Col N="113" /> the Minister for Agriculture and Food in making my decisions in regard to the proposed acquisitions by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors of the Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Ltd. and DJS Meats.  I took advice over a period of several months from the Attorney General in relation to the legal issues which were extremely complex.</P>
    <P>Regarding the DJS Meats plant, the Fair Trade Commission concluded &mdash; I want to lay some emphasis on this because this whole matter tends to be personalised into some sort of personal row &mdash; that the acquisition by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors would not be likely to operate against the common good provided that (1) the Carrigans plant was to be operated as a going concern and (2), that the Omagh plant only was not owned, controlled and operated by AIBP or by connected persons.  The Commission's concern, which I fully endorsed, was that if the DJS Meats plant and the Master Meat Packers (Omagh) plant were under common control, this control would be likely to prevent, restrict or distort competition in the purchase of cattle in County Donegal and in areas in the State adjoining that county to such an extent as to operate against the common good.  It is therefore, in the clear interests of farmers in County Donegal that this relatively simple condition be insisted upon.  They should not confuse their very short-term interests with their medium and long-term interests which, in my view, are infinitely more important.</P>
    <P>As required by the Acts, the order sets a deadline of 12 months for the completion of the acquisition by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors of DJS Meats in accordance with the conditions in the order. However, I would like to emphasise that the matter now rests with Anglo-Irish Beef Processors and its connected persons to fulfil the conditions of the order and, accordingly, pave the way for the earliest possible reopening of the DJS plant.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the second <Col N="114" /> paragraph of the letter that Senator McGowan has just given me where it is stated by the writer, on behalf of Goodman International which is a holding company of Anglo-Irish Beef Processors, that &ldquo;the reason the plant is not open at this point in time is entirely beyond our control&rdquo;.  Of course, that is not so.  The takeover can be completed in the morning if the condition that is attached to the prohibition order is complied with.  The Fair Trade Commission regard it as desirable, fair and essential that that be done.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on the fact that the letter omits the date of reply to the request for particulars which was, of course, a very very long time after the request.  &ldquo;On 11 April a ministerial order preventing the factory reopening&rdquo; is quoted in the letter.  That, of course, is not the case.  I made no such order.  The factory was open for most of the time after the notification was given.  The order I made did not prevent it reopening. It simply requires a condition to be complied with before the transaction can be legally completed.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan described a dispute between me and my Department on the one hand and Goodman International on the other hand as being the cause of this difficulty which I accept exists in Carrigans. That, of course, is not the case. There is not a dispute.  Each case is judged on its merits.  A separate order was made in regard to this.  The conditions are far less onerous than they are in regard to the other proposal and that should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Each case will continue to be judged on its merits, and could not be judged in any other way.  The fact that there may have been difficulties with the same group in relation to other matters that have no connection with this particular factory, which they did not own in any way at the time, or had not sought to acquire at the time, are irrelevant.  They were certainly not taken into account and did not in any way influence my judgment, or needless to say the judgment of the Fair Trade <Col N="115" /> Commission, which in this case I simply concurred with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 May 1990.</P>
