      <P>It is proposed to take the three Bills on the Order Paper.  The first business will be the Central Fund Bill.  At 7 o'clock it is proposed to take the Court Officers Bill and the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, and then to resume on the Central Fund Bill.  If there is a prospect of finishing the Central Fund Bill, I think the House might agree to sit until 11 o'clock.  We can judge that later.  If there is no prospect of finishing, then we can sit to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of this Bill is the usual one.  It provides authority for the issue of money from the Central Fund to cover, in the first place, the total amount of the Supplementary and Additional Estimates for the current financial year which are not already covered by the Appropriation Act, 1950, and, secondly, the amount of the Vote on Account for 1951-52.  It provides also for borrowing by the Minister for Finance and for the issue by him of such securities as he thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vote on Account is granted by Dáil Eireann to enable the supplies services to be carried on for the usual period, and the period to be covered is until the individual Estimates have been passed and the Appropriation Act has become law.  Generally, provision is taken for a number of months on the expectation that the Appropriation Act will be passed by the month of July.  The amount that is required <Col N="752" /> this year under this heading is £29,375,120, and Senators have seen how this sum is made up from the White Paper already circulated.  On account of the very early date by which the Estimates volume had to be circulated this year, it has not been possible to show, as is the custom, in full the effect of the Supplementary and Additional Estimates for 1950-51 in the book.  A note in the Estimates volume sets out the Supplementary and Additional Estimates that were taken into account in arriving at the 1950-51 figures.  In the remarks that I go on to make, a comparison is made between the present Book of Estimates and the original Estimates for 1950-51.</P>
    <P>The total of the net Estimates for 1951-52 is £83,036,048.  That is split into £12,079,705 for capital services, and £70,956,343 for other services. Capital services show a decrease of £37,225 on 1950-51, and other services show an increase of £4,946,040. Although the amount that is provided for capital services is almost the same as that for 1950-51, Senators may be interested in the changes which have taken place within that total.  There are increases of £650,000 for housing, including Gaeltacht housing and housing for turf workers; £484,970 for forestry, including £193,000 for reserve stocks; £201,000 for new buildings and reconstruction works.  These are offset by decreases as follows: £755,000 for agriculture; £530,000 for grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949; £130,000 for sanitary services works, and £104,700 for aviation and meteorological services.  The provision previously made through the Transition Development Fund is now the subject of special provision in the Vote for Local Government.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced elsewhere, for a full account of capital outlay financed by borrowing, regard must be had not only to the capital services included in the Estimates volume but also to direct issues from the Central Fund for advances to the Electricity Supply Board, the Local Loans Fund, etc., estimates of which appear in the White Paper of Receipts <Col N="753" /> and Expenditure published prior to the Budget.  Turning now from the capital to the other services, which as I have said, show an increase of £4,946,040, I may mention that roughly £1.8 million is in respect of provision for reserve stocks.  The Estimates which contribute most towards the increase are: Posts and Telegraphs £1,223,400 increase, of which £806,600 is for reserve stocks; Defence shows an increase of £1,100,160, which includes £159,800 for reserve stocks; Health shows an increase of £618,500, including £200,000 for reserve stocks; Industry and Commerce shows an increase of £505,170.</P>
    <P>The reserve purchases, that is to say purchases in excess of 1951-52 requirements, which are included in the non-capital services, are as follows: Posts and Telegraphs, £806,600; Gaeltacht Services, £228,800; Public works and Buildings, £220,500; Health, £200,000; Defence, £159,800; Garda Síochána, £85,900; Stationery and Printing, £80,000; Prisons, £8,400.</P>
    <P>The three sections of the proposed legislation run in the ordinary way. Section 1 has the following application. Twenty-three Supplementary and Additional Estimates totalling £1,911,931 (of which approximately £538,800 was for reserve stocks) were passed by Dáil Eireann for the current financial year.  Leave was, in fact, given to introduce another Supplementary Estimate for Ordnance Survey, a small one, but it was found unnecessary to proceed with it.  The Appropriation Act, 1950, covered five of these Estimates totalling £199,020. Accordingly, Section 1 of the present Bill authorises the issue from the Central Fund of the balance, namely, £1,712,911.</P>
    <P>Section 2 covers the Vote on Account.  The total of the Estimates for the Supply Services for 1951-2 is £83,036,048 and the Dáil has voted £29,375,120 of this amount on account. Section 2 of the Bill authorises the issue from the Central Fund of this latter amount and the balance will be covered by the Appropriation Act after all the Estimates have been considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> The third section is the usual borrowing section.  It authorises the Minister to borrow the total of the amounts mentioned in the foregoing two sections and for that purpose to issue such securities as he thinks fit.  Under the statute of the Irish Parliament under which the Bank of Ireland was established, the bank is liable to forfeit any moneys advanced or loaned by it to the Government unless Parliament has specifically authorised the advance or loan.  Accordingly, this section also provides that the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister for Finance any sum or sums not exceeding the amount he is authorised to borrow.</P>

      <P>When one has to deliver a message such as that which the Minister for Finance has had to deliver to us to-day, one likes to be as brief as possible because it is not a very pleasant message for the Irish people.  It is a message which indicates that in the coming year a sum of no less than £83,000,000 must be extracted from the taxpayers of this country.  It is interesting to relate the Minister's introduction of this Bill into this House to-day with his introduction of the Estimates of 1948.  Attached to the 1948 Book of Estimates was a little note from the Minister to remind us that that Book of Estimates was drawn up by a previous Government: that he was not prepared to accept any responsibility for it and that, in the very short time at his disposal, he had gone through the book as far as he could and brought about some economies, and that, therefore, he proposed to reduce the amount of money that would otherwise have been extracted from the people.  The amount asked for in 1948&mdash;and with which the Minister found grave fault&mdash;was £65,000,000. The present figure is no less than £83,000,000.  In his closing speech on the Vote on Account in the Dáil the Minister said that in presenting this huge bill to the people and to the Parliament he was taking a grave risk but that he thought it was worth taking the risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often been said that the most ardent believer in any doctrine is the person who has been converted to it. No doubt many sections of the community <Col N="755" /> are pleased with the conversion of the Minister and with the fact that, as is evidenced by his introduction of this demand, he has thrown over all the principles which he alleged in the past that he stood for.  He warns the people that he is taking a risk, but he fails to point out what steps either he or the Government are taking to avoid this risk or to avoid what might be the aftermath of such risks.</P>
    <P>In connection with this huge demand of £83,000,000, we must bear in mind that in this Book of Estimates no provision is made for certain measures which are now under serious consideration and which will probably be given effect to by Parliament in the coming year.  No provision is made in this Estimate of £83,000,000 to provide for the huge demand that will be made on the people as a whole for the implementation of the social welfare scheme. No provision is made in this huge Estimate for the implementation of the mother and child scheme, of which we hear so much at the present time. Before I pass from that particular matter, I might say that I cannot understand why the Department of Health is conducting such an extensive propaganda campaign in relation to this particular scheme.  It seems to be what might reasonably be referred to as just political propaganda.  I submit that there is no need for such expenditure of public money in order to try to put across a scheme of this kind in an endeavour to influence a very small section of our people into giving it their support.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when replying to the debate on the Vote on Account, warned the members of the Dáil and the public that the full picture had not been presented and that certain provisions had been omitted.  I think he said that over £1,250,000 would have to be provided for old age pensions and that another £1,000,000 would have to be provided for Central Fund services, apart altogether from the amount of money that would be required for the two schemes to which I have already referred.  Added to all that, however, he should have taken into consideration another very serious demand on the <Col N="756" /> taxpayers and ratepayers of this country, namely, the general increase in rates.  I know the Minister's reply will be that there is also an increase in the rebate, particularly in relation to that measure which we passed through this House a few weeks ago&mdash;the Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land.  In that connection, I would point out that the Minister for Finance is the responsible Minister concerned and that it makes very little difference, if any, to the people of this country which pocket the money is taken out of so long as it is taken out of their pockets as a whole. In this House and in the other House, the Minister has often expressed the view that he would much prefer to leave the money in the pockets of the people, to be spent as they might desire to spend it, rather than to extract it by way of taxation or rates.  It would now appear that the Minister is converted to an entirely different doctrine from that which he has propounded on other occasions.</P>
    <P>There is very little, if anything, that we in this House can do about this demand but I would like a definite answer from the Minister to a few questions which are worrying the people in general at the present time. When we were discussing this measure last year and also the Finance Bill. some of us on this side of the House attempted to bring before the Minister and the Government some matters which we considered should be attended to: our national defence, the securing of ample fuel supplies for the coming winter and a new approach to the provision of food for the people.  When we spoke of the need for defence measures we were told that we were war mongers and that the Government's policy was to plan for peace.  We were told that what we were advocating was recruiting all the young men of the country and keeping them in the barrack squares forming fours for the rest of their lives.  We got much the same reply with regard to fuel.  We were told here and more often in the other House by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary responsible that there was no fuel scarcity.  As a matter of fact it was suggested that certain persons interested in that business were trying to <Col N="757" /> create a scare.  No steps were taken and we were to rely on securing sufficient fuel from abroad.  In our towns and cities the position was never so bad.  To my own knowledge in the City of Galway, which after all, is an importing city where ample supplies of fuel were always available even during the most difficult days of the emergency, people were compelled to pay no less than £13 or £14 per ton for coal, while those unable to buy in such quantity had to pay more for a cwt. or a half-cwt., which they took away themselves. At the height of this difficulty the Tánaiste made a statement&mdash;it should have come from the Government Information Bureau&mdash;that it was now proposed to re-undertake turf development and to impose on the county councils the obligation taken from their shoulders in 1948.  Not alone were they requested to produce the same amount of fuel as during the emergency but to produce in one year three years' supply.</P>
    <P>When we hear a statement of that kind from a responsible Department with the backing of the Government we must cast our minds back to what happened in years gone by.  Senators will remember that we discussed the cancellation of turf production on various occasions.  We were then told by various Ministers that turf was a commodity that did not withstand age or many handlings and that the sooner it was consumed the better.  Many agree with that point of view but it was held chiefly on the far side of the House.  It is an extraordinary thing, therefore, that the Parties composing the Government should decide that by the waving of some extraordinary wand, county councils should produce not one but three years' supply of turf. If it was a bad thing to produce one year's supply in 1946, 1947 or 1948 why, because of a change of personnel, should it be within the bounds of possibility to produce now in one year three years' supply?</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, there is a much more serious aspect of this question. A meeting of county managers and county surveyors was held in the Department of Local Government and many questions are being asked as a <Col N="758" /> result which, I suggest, the Minister might answer to-night if the Government is serious about getting a fuel supply for our people in the coming months.  The announcement that our people must fall back on turf production was for some extraordinary reason made by the Tánaiste, not by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce and every subsequent announcement was made by the same person.  As a result of that meeting in the Department of Local Government the people in the country and those interested in turf production are asking if the Government is serious about this matter or is it divided on this issue as it is on many others.  As we have seen from reports, this meeting was attended only by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Health and neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor his Parliamentary Secretary was present.  When we examine the Order which was made we find that it is most extraordinary. County councils have been requested to produce sufficient fuel for their own institutions, and to do that to cover a period of three years.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement was first made, we know the fuel situation abroad has worsened.  Still, there has been no direction as to how our towns and cities are to find supplies for the coming year or years.  At present the county councils are asked only to produce sufficient for their own requirements in institutions.  The question that must be answered is as to what organisation is to be authorised by the Government to provide fuel for the people and for our industries and transport.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, when speaking in Kildare, as reported in yesterday's papers, suggested that there is to be a new scheme, overlapping those already announced, asking the county councils not alone to produce for their own institutions but to produce machine-won turf.  The Minister's reply, naturally, will be that this is a question for Bord na Móna.  Definite areas have been scheduled in the Order.  Statements have been made by <Col N="759" /> the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that no turf will be transported into the City of Dublin.  That is all very fine, if the coal position does not become so acute that turf will be needed in the city.</P>
    <P>There is at present a recruiting campaign by Bord na Móna to bring workers from Connemara and Galway in general to Kildare and Laoighis-Offaly and to other bogs operated by the board.  I suggest to the Minister and through him to Bord na Móna and to the Tánaiste&mdash;as he seems to be the Minister for Supplies&mdash;that if turf production is to be increased it must be encouraged where there can be greater production and where the people themselves reside, where they can go out from their homes in the morning and do the job, rather than tell them: &ldquo;If you do not accept employment in Kildare or wherever we want you, we have the right to cut off your unemployment assistance or whatever other assistance you may be getting from some Department of State.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is serious in approaching this very serious problem, he will not try to interject a remark of that kind.  He knows as much about turf production as I do and he knows it can be produced only at certain times.  If an attempt is made to bring the people from these areas to work in other areas, at the same type of job, which they could do better in their own immediate vicinity, that is a wrong approach to the problem. Those interested in keeping industries and transport going are anxious to know what provision is being made through Bord na Móna or the county councils or the new Minister for Supplies, to ensure that the essential fuel will be available for these undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the amounts being spent on agriculture. Last year there was introduced here, <Col N="760" /> with great sounding of trumpets, a scheme which was to signal the rebirth of the nation, the land rehabilitation scheme, and £40,000,000 was to be spent, to the immense benefit of the Irish nation.  What do we find?  As in everything that is rushed, we find that this scheme has not worked out as we on this side of the House and I am sure that the Minister on his side would like.  We had the Minister for Agriculture advising our people to undertake the benefits of this scheme as far as possible.  Not being satisfied with advising the agricultural community, he advised another section of our people, those engaged in concrete products. We wanted 500,000,000 miles of concrete pipes.  It is a fairly big order, one that no single firm in this country could fill in a short time.  Therefore a number of firms were encouraged to undertake the production of concrete pipes.  The Minister may smile at the introduction of this matter into the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 500,000,000 miles stagger me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not even know if it would stop. at that.  Here is where it did stop.  Having advised those people interested in the manufacture of concrete products that this market would be there, by saying: &ldquo;Here is something the production of which we will encourage; as a matter of fact, if you are not in a position to produce, from a financial point of view, there is money available and we are prepared to give you the necessary financial assistance.&rdquo;  Some firms were encouraged to come from the other side to undertake this very worthy project of manufacturing concreate pipes to drain the land of Ireland. What happened?  Unfortunately for themselves, some of our farmers were over enthusiastic and undertook the scheme.  They purchased the <Col N="761" /> pipes and laid them.  Then they found that the land was in a much worse condition after they had incurred this great expense, on the advice of the Minister for Agriculture.  We awoke suddenly one morning and found an announcement in the daily papers: &ldquo;Concrete pipes are condemned for the land drainage scheme until such time as I and the members of the staff in the Department of Agriculture draft a specification.&rdquo;  Would not any sane person think that the first step that should have been taken was to draft the specification and to ensure that if farmers were enthusiastic about the scheme and if £40,000,000 of Irish or American money was to be invested in it, every step would be tried and tested beforehand?  Now, after people had bought these machines and people had piled up their yards with concrete pipes, we had them condemned.  We have the officials in the Department worrying their heads and saying: &ldquo;What is going to be our new specification in order that we can once again use concrete pipes for the drainage?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As a result of that, if you look at the Book of Estimates, you will find an extraordinary thing, that this project which was going to be extended from year to year from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000 and then to £40,000,000 is the one heading under which there is a reduction in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture this year.  That is a sure indication that the Minister and the officers of his Department are quite satisfied that there can be no real progress made with this land rehabilitation scheme during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot at present about the necessity for increased production. There are two fields in which we can have increased production and the easier field would be that of agriculture. I put it to the Minister and the House that if we are to have any increase in production in agriculture we must first have some direction.  We have had many directions given to the farmers during the last three years. First of all, we had advice given by the Minister for Agriculture to the farmers to grow more potatoes and oats.  He said: &ldquo;The more potatoes and oats you <Col N="762" /> grow, the greater the price and the surer the market will be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the potato and the oats acreage was increased we know what happened. In case the Minister may think he has a point to make in regard to that, I will say that a very serious attempt was made to find a market for oats during a short period which just extended over the East Donegal by-election. The very day that election campaign was over the Minister's efforts to find a market for the oats ceased.</P>
    <P>Having encouraged the farmers in that way, he then directed his attention to the farmers' wives.  He knew the important part that the farmers' wives play in agriculture and he said to them: &ldquo;You can also do your part and you will realise that I am willing to do mine.  I want you to increase the production of poultry, eggs and butter and the greater production you have the surer the market and the greater the price will be.&rdquo;  What happened in the spring of 1951?  Having encouraged many farmers' wives and daughters to go into the production of eggs and poultry, the Minister says: &ldquo;I quite realise that 2/- a dozen is not a good price for your eggs, but at least you can kill the cockerels and the pullets.&rdquo;  If that advice is accepted by the people whom the Minister induced to go into the production of poultry and eggs, it will be very easy to find a market for the eggs produced this time next year.</P>
    <P>At the present time we have advertisements being issued by the Department of Agriculture at the expense of the Irish people.  Having regard to the present world position and to our position here and the amount of money, and borrowed money at that, that we have expended on the purchase of wheat to feed our people during the last two or three years, it is an extraordinary thing that while these advertisements request farmers to grow more barley, more oats and more potatoes, there is no recommendation made to the farmers to grow two crops which are essential for the maintenance of our people, namely, wheat and beet.  That, perhaps, is natural enough having regard to the Minister's past history in relation to these two crops.  We have him on <Col N="763" /> record as saying on many occasions that he would not be seen dead in a field of wheat.</P>
    <P>When he took over the responsible position of director of the farming community as Minister for Agriculture, the guaranteed price for wheat was carried over for a period of five years. In making that announcement, he very generously gave the advice I have already outlined, and he said: &ldquo;In order not to be considered one of those persons who are prepared to victimise any section of the people, and in order to give fair play to those who have been &lsquo;codded&rsquo; during all these years by Fianna Fáil and who are prepared to carry on with the growing of wheat, I am prepared to continue the guaranteed price at present prevailing because I would not like to be hard on them.&rdquo;  As the people who were described as having been &ldquo;codded&rdquo; by Fianna Fáil still believed that wheat could be grown on the land here, the Minister then gets up and says: &ldquo;I had a greater yield last year from the acreage of wheat grown than the previous Government got during the years of the war notwithstanding the fact that during that period there was a very serious shortage of fertilisers which are available this year But he did not advert to the fact that it was those people whom he regarded as foolish to grow wheat and to whom he was prepared to continue to pay 65/- a barrel who grew the wheat.</P>
    <P>Addressing a meeting in his own constituency last week, the Minister for Agriculture again gave some advice to the farmers, but he omitted to advise them to increase the wheat acreage.  He warned them: &ldquo;If you do not produce sufficient foodstuffs to maintain the live stock of this country you will be at a very serious loss.&rdquo; What I am afraid of is that there are many people who might take up that challenge of the Minister's seriously and, in order to get him out of his present office, might be prepared to let us all starve, because he went on to say: &ldquo;If you do not produce the food, you are going to lose the very important person you have now as Minister <Col N="764" /> for Agriculture, because I am not going to be Minister for Agriculture any longer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No matter how Senators on the other side may look at it, I think it should be brought home to the Minister that if the international position is as serious as they sometimes present it to be&mdash;it is only quite recently of course that they have acknowledged it is serious&mdash;notwithstanding the Minister's approach to this matter in the past, it is his duty to the Government of which he is a member and to the Irish people to ensure that as far as possible the food that our people require should be grown on Irish land.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about compulsion. None of us like compulsion of any kind, although every piece of legislation we pass in this or the other House compels some body of persons to do some particular thing.  If he is so anxious about inducing and encouraging the farmer to grow crops, why not give him all the inducement and encouragement he can to grow the one crop that is so essential to the life of the nation and that is costing the Minister for Finance and the nation so much to import at the moment? Why not increase the price given to the farmer as an encouragement to him to grow wheat?  There will then be no need for compulsion.  Ample stocks of fertilisers should be available at the present time and no question of compulsion of any kind should enter into the matter.  We still have the price fixed by that very naughty Fianna Fáil Government in 1947 which, under then existing conditions, was fully justified.  We have the present Minister for Agriculture continuing that price notwithstanding the heavy burdens that have since been placed upon the farming community.  Last week we passed a Bill which will add still further to the farmers' burdens. Possibly we shall pass similar Bills in the future which will impose even greater burdens on the farmer.  Yet, we still expect the farmer to provide food for our people at the same price as that given to the farmer so far back as 1947.</P>
    <P>I come then to this very important question of butter production.  The <Col N="765" /> Minister for Agriculture claims that more butter is produced and consumed now than was ever produced or consumed in the past.  Possibly that is so. If we were to enter into a lengthy debate as to what has brought about that position, I think we could spend a very long time on this Bill.  One cannot expect people to go on producing something that is not a paying proposition. Nobody will do that.  During the emergency, because of lack of animal feeding stuffs, there was a certain reduction in milk and butter and production in general.  But feeding stuffs are more freely available now and one would naturally anticipate that there should be an increase in production.  One point in particular which I would like Senators to bear in mind, especially Senator Baxter because he takes such a keen interest in agriculture, is that while we may have an increase in creamery butter production at the present time we have suffered a decrease in the production of farmers' butter.  When I was a young lad very few people had a taste for creamery butter.  Farmers' butter was the popular commodity, or, as it is sometimes called, factory butter.  A changed position has come about.</P>

      <P>There are now travelling creameries and more creameries have been established.  More milk is now going into the creameries.  But that does not mean that more butter is consumed.  It merely means that more creamery butter is consumed and less farmers' butter or less factory butter. If we do not have regard to the changing circumstances we can be entirely mistaken.</P>

      <P>If one wants to make a case, either good or bad, the best way one can do it I always think is to set out a table of figures; one can prove anything from figures.  I can prove to my own satisfaction&mdash;I have never yet succeeded in proving anything <Col N="766" /> to the satisfaction of Senator Baxter &mdash; that areas which were renowned in the past for the production of farmers' butter are now sending their milk to the creameries.  There is, therefore, a certain amount of butter taken out of circulation from the point of view of consumption and that butter is transferred into the creamery; there is then a greater consumption of creamery butter so-called.  That is quite true.  But there is a lesser consumption of farmers' butter and there is an equivalent reduction in farmers' butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an idea&mdash;possibly I may be mistaken, because one can be mistaken&mdash;that Senator Baxter was a member of a particular organisation with a very particular interest in this matter.  I would imagine that Senator Baxter ought to be fully aware that there are such things as travelling creameries, and it is not necessary to have a creamery established in a particular district in order to enable the farmers to supply their milk to the creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister, we had a position where there was over-production of butter.  On another occasion here I recommended that butter should be taken off the ration and that all butter produced should be made available to our own people.  That was not accepted because it would involve some expense on the Department of Finance.  I take it is would have meant an increased subsidy.  Nevertheless, I maintain that it would have been better to increase the price of butter generally, while taking all butter off the ration and letting it find its own level rather than find ourselves now in the position of having to import butter.  Rightly or wrongly, the Minister states that he was forced to export butter because of lack of storage, or perhaps simply because he wanted to have it appear that at least <Col N="767" /> once during his period of office butter was exported.  Butter was exported. and now we find ourselves in the position of having to import butter.  I think particular note should be taken of that, because the butter imported was imported at a higher price than that which we received for our commodity on the export market.  We were then informed by the Minister that this imported butter would be available only in Dublin.</P>
    <P>First of all, it was proposed to make it available on the ration.  The idea was that those who were not able to pay the off-the-subsidy price would be compelled to purchase the imported butter.  Protests were made.  Another scheme was then evolved in the Department of Agriculture.  To me it would appear as if the officials of that Department do nothing except change their minds, trying to keep up with the Minister changing his.  The new scheme was that 50 per cent. of imported butter and 50 per cent. of Irish creamery butter would be available on the ration.  But there is always a likelihood of something unforeseen happening in distribution.  Protests were again made that this scheme was not fair and we had then the extraordinary statement from the present occupant of that responsible office when the matter was drawn to his attention in the Dáil last week: he said that if the housewife was not pleased with the particular type of butter she was receiving, she had in her own hands the method of dealing with it and that is to change her grocer, as he had done with very good effect.  I think that is most unfair. I think it is most unfair, coming from a responsible Minister to a group of people who are engaged merely in carrying out the Minister's orders as well as they possibly can.</P>
    <P>From time to time we had various charges made against the people engaged in the wholesale or the retail trades.  I often wonder how far the various Orders made by the Government could or would be carried out were it not for the loyal co-operation of all those people engaged in various trades.  And to suggest to the housewives, <Col N="768" /> from the important place he holds in the Dáil as Minister, that if they do not like the commodity that he compels the grocers to sell, they have a remedy, and that is to change their grocer, is easy enough.  How we can hope to make any progress under the direction or advice of such a person, I do not know.</P>
    <P>I would like to pass on from that Department with one other reference. Quite recently there was an announcement made that we are to have a new lime distribution scheme.  When the land rehabilitation project was going through the House I and other Senators from different parts of the House suggested to the Minister for Agriculture that it would be much better to spend the moneys that were going to be spent on the concrete pipe drainage scheme, that did not work, on the distribution of fertilisers and lime to the farmers and in that way help them to put their land back into good heart and compensate them in some practical way.</P>
    <P>We all know the flurry the Minister for Agriculture got himself into in this House on that occasion.  He told us that he, for one, would never be a member of any group that would suggest that the Department should spread lime or fertilisers on any man's land.  Now there is a new scheme being introduced, but it is introduced only because of the demand made, not by the representatives of this House or by representatives of the farming community, but by another person who is here representing another Government in this country.  However, be that as it may, we have a new lime scheme.  What will it mean?  To my mind it is not a subsidy on lime and it is not a subsidy to the farmer; it is really a subsidy to Córas Iompair Eireann.  So far as the scheme is concerned, each farmer will pay 16/- per ton for the lime.  It must be carried by Córas Iompair Eireann lorries and it will be carried only to the main road nearest to the farmer's holding.</P>
    <P>We have had various lime schemes in the past.  Every county council operated a lime scheme of its own.  In the West of Ireland we have more faith in burnt lime than in crushed lime.  I am not in a position to say which is the better, <Col N="769" /> but I think that until such time as our farmers are converted, if there is anything to convert them to, the old scheme should be continued.  Where the sugar company was operating and where various private enterprises were operating, taking out the lime and spreading it, that would be more beneficial than this new scheme, which is a further subsidy to an organisation that is already very well subsidised by this State.</P>
    <P>Lime affects us very much in such areas as West Galway, and Connemara in particular.  Now we find we are being practically cut out of this scheme entirely.  I will leave it to the leaders of the Farmers' Party to deal with that aspect.</P>
    <P>There is another subject with which I must deal and that is the tourist industry.  Strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless a fact that we have had three Tourist Boards within the last three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcCrea" hpid="Mr. McCrea Mr. McCrea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mention it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a delegation from the Tourist Board visiting America.  We also had a delegation of hoteliers visiting America and we had a commission from America visiting this country.  I assume there must have been some report or recommendation made to the Government as a result of these visits.  We are now on the eve of a new tourist year and it is an extraordinary thing that, despite the change and the fact that we have had three Tourist Boards, none of which was an improvement on the other, those engaged in the industry have not been given any direction as to what is expected of them, and no step has been taken to encourage an increase in this very important source of revenue.  I think we have now reached the stage that no matter on what side of the House we sit we all agree that the tourist industry is a very important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again I am glad to see that the converts are even more enthusiastic than the old advocates in relation to this industry.  During the last general election we had various suggestions <Col N="770" /> about tourists.  We were told that the then Government was only making provision for strangers coming to this country to consume the food put aside for the maintenance of the Irish people. It was suggested by a person who now holds a very important ministerial post that in order to keep tourists out there should be a tax placed upon them.  All these and other suggestions were made and I am glad we have so many converts, but we would like to see something more substantial arising from their conversion.  People engaged in the industry would like to have some-knowledge of what the delegation to America did and what are the likely benefits as a result of the changes made by establishing three different boards.  Why was it necessary to have these three changes?</P>
    <P>What recommendations from the delegation of hoteliers that went to America have been accepted by the Government, and when do the Government propose to give effect to them? While the previous Government were accused of being prepared to cater for millionaires and spivs and others who made money out of the war, provision. has been made to establish in Courtown a workers' holiday camp. We would like to know what progress has been made there, or whether that scheme has been cancelled.</P>
    <P>We are quite well aware that it is proposed to introduce a new Tourist Bill in the Dáil.  We are also aware that one provision in that Bill will suggest an increase in the membership of the present board.  The idea is to include certain people.  It will also be insisted by those people whose money we are spending in this and other regards that provision must be made for the representative of another country on that board.  I am not objecting to any such provision, but I think that the suggestion is being made because the persons concerned are not satisfied that the Government are doing all they should or could do in this connection.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of transport.  We had here during the year a Transport Bill.  We have arrived at the position where we see a public announcement that many of our services are going to be curtailed. <Col N="771" /> I have already requested the Minister that we should be given some indication as to what steps the Government are taking to provide the essentials or at least the nucleus of a service during the coming months.  We know that the fuel position has become much worse.  We have sent many delegations, supplemented them on various occasions, changed the personnel and used every influence that a Government can to extract from our friends across the water the necessary fuel to keep our services going.  We have failed to tell our people that these delegations have failed to extract even a promise from the people across the water that they will give us the essential fuel.  What are we doing about it?  What supplies of fuel have we?  What services can we curtail? When we see on the one hand an announcement curtailing services we see on another an announcement extending services.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point in which we are interested in more ways than one.  Should the position become more serious, then we must utilise every available means we have of getting the supplies to our people.  This time last year I think Senator Mrs. Concannon pleaded with the Minister&mdash;so did I&mdash; to give immediate and sympathetic consideration to an application made by the Galway Harbour Commissioners for assistance in order to complete the development of Galway Harbour.  That work is of national importance.  It is important not only to the West of Ireland but to the nation as a whole. It has been held up for one reason or another for a number of years. Nothing has been done, and every year it is held up is going to add to the cost.  It is all very fine to ask for a more modest scheme, but what may be looked upon by the Minister as being a modest scheme this year is going to become an extravagant one because of the cost of carrying it out. I would again plead with the Minister to give his immediate attention to this application and to give sanction not for the curtailed scheme but for the full development of this very important project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> That brings me to what might be regarded as a local matter but which is really a national question.  We have a community of our people living in Aran.  Over a long period of this year their services were cut off because a State-sponsored company and the State itself cannot agree over particular terms.  The only people that must suffer in consequence are the people who are confined within the radius of this particular island.  For three or four weeks after Christmas there was no service to the Aran Islands.  It is a matter of a very small sum when you take into consideration this £120,000,000 that we are going to expend.  If there is any section of our people who deserve sympathetic consideration it is the people of Aran, and, as we are providing a service at the expense of the people for the rest of the community, we should not object in any way to this service.  I would plead with the Minister to take up this matter and take steps to ensure that this service is maintained.  It is all very fine to close it down for a period and then have somebody come up to the Department and make representations and have it appear that because So-and-So came to the Department the service was resumed.  The people have suffered meanwhile in order that a particular individual should get kudos for bringing about a resumption of the service.</P>
    <P>That brings us also to the question of what steps are being taken to secure for our people the necessary stockpiling.  We are being informed by the Government that the rise in prices of commodities is due to the various Governments throughout the world stockpiling essential commodities. What steps are the present Government taking to do likewise in view of what seems to be a coming emergency?  None as far as can be generally seen.  Great play has been made with the taking back of our foreign investments but, when we examine the position, we find that the greater amount of that money was spent not on the purchase of machinery nor on the building up of industries that might be necessary for us during a <Col N="773" /> future emergency but on consumer goods.  That is all very fine as far as the Minister for Finance is concerned because the more such goods are consumed the easier it is to control the revenue.  Decisions have been made through the Government.  The sale of our chassis and machine tool plants and other plants for factories that were about to be established will have a very serious effect.  While I am on that point, I would like to ask the Minister how far progress has been made in providing the travelling community of this country&mdash;that section of our people who travel by bus&mdash;with the bus station that we were promised in substitution for Store Street?  After all it is only fair that some indication should be given to the people when they will have this new Smithfield bus station.  We have already sanctioned the spending of a £1,000,000 of the insured workers' money in the completion of Store Street.  Having done that, the least we might expect is some indication as to what time or in what year we might expect to have this new station in Smithfield.</P>
    <P>There is another very important aspect of this whole question and that is the continuation of our building industry.  The Minister, in his opening statement, informed us that one of the increased Estimates was for housing.  I will be as brief as possible in this connection, but I want to draw the Minister for Finance's attention to the fact that we are paying at the present time a very heavy subsidy on cement&mdash;a subsidy of 15/- per ton on Irish produced cement in order that imported cement might be sold at the price at which the Irish Cement Company is in a position to supply.  Some two years ago a statement was made by the Minister that sanction was given to the cement company to make an addition to their factories in order to increase production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. There was never sanction given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister did state in the Dáil that there were two proposals under consideration&mdash;one, <Col N="774" /> the establishment of a new factory and the other, that additions would be built to the existing factories.  Two or three years have passed and nothing has been done.  For every ton of foreign cement that is going into the building industry in this country the Irish people are paying a subsidy of 15/-; the greater portion of that cement could be produced in this country if the Minister had made up his mind whether new factories could be established or necessary additions made to the existing factories.</P>
      <P>We come then to this question of the increased cost of living.  Great play was made in the past with the increased cost of living and we were told, when the matter was raised in the Dáil, that the problem was about to be solved, that a new advisory body was being set up and that a freeze Order was about to be introduced.  The freeze Order came and a number of commodities were included in it, although quite a number were not.  The first meeting of the advisory body was held and the first announcement made by that body was that, notwithstanding the fact that they would give every consideration to applications brought before them, the people could not expect other than increases in prices.  Two Orders have been made since this body has been set up.  The first removed from the ambit of the freeze Order a very limited number of commodities, but the second was a rather more bold Order which removed a greater number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the experience we had during that period?  It was found throughout the country that the commodities concerned were not in circulation, but these suddenly came into circulation again when the freeze Order was removed.  In other cases, certain lines were withdrawn and new lines of the same commodity introduced at the increased prices.  All this was pointed out to the Minister in the Dáil and it was suggested that every step be taken to guard against such eventualities as I have pointed out.  The result has been that, in place of encouraging the people to import the things that could and should have been imported at the time, in place of encouraging the production and manufacture of various <Col N="775" /> commodities, both the importation and manufacture of a great many commodities which were and will be in short supply were brought to a standstill.</P>
    <P>Taking it by and large, the Minister will admit that this freeze Order was merely designed to pacify the people at the time, that it was never seriously considered by the Government and can never be considered seriously as something which will operate as the people were given to understand it would operate.</P>
    <P>The bill before the house is a huge bill, but, as I have said, it does not give the full picture.  We have this amount of £70,000,000 or £83,000,000 in full, and this amount of £12,000,000, for capital development which the Minister suggests he is taking a grave risk in going ahead with.  We have the advantage at present of aids of one kind or another in the shape of loans or grants from Marshall Aid.  We have had during the term of office of this Government an annual loan of something in the region of £12,000,000, and when we add all that up and when we consider the interest which we must pay on it at some time and consider then the very limited increase in production which that huge expenditure has brought about, we must seriously examine where we are going.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the whole Book of Estimates and nothing in the whole programme which the Government have put before us which will relieve that section of our people who are in greatest need of relief.  There is nothing in it to stop the trend of unemployment or of emigration from the areas in which it is greatest, that is, the Gaeltacht. No provision is made for any scheme that will give to the people of the Gaeltacht any hope that the position in future will be any better for them than it has been in the past. There is nothing to encourage them to stay and try to find work there.  Rather is every encouragement given to them to seek work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is a huge sum, but there is very little we can do about it. We should like, however, to have from the Government some definite indication of what they propose to do in <Col N="776" /> relation to the three very important matters to which I have referred. There is a feeling throughout the country that the Government are not serious in this matter of defence.  We have had an experience in that connection in relation to the reorganisation of the Red Cross.  It was suggested that there should be a reorganisation and each of us would like to see it making progress in every town and village.  A meeting was called in the larger centres, but the campaign was not entered into with that enthusiasm which is essential for the success of a reorganisation campaign of that kind. The same applies now to turf production. There is this suggestion that there is only one section of the Government that is interested and my attention has been drawn to the fact that neither the Taoiseach nor any of the Fine Gael Ministers in the Government have once come out and once advocated increased turf production. Although Senator Baxter looks at me with amazement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know who it was that did advocate it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he will agree with me that turf can be produced only from now until May or June and there is no use in saying after June: &ldquo;We did not get the men; we did not get the co-operation; we did not get this, that or the other.&rdquo;  It is the Government's responsibility now to give a direction, to tell industrialists and people in towns and cities whether it is to be left to themselves to produce their own fuel requirements or whether the Government propose to step in, and not leave it to the shadow Minister for Supplies to make these announcements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only twice yearly that we have the opportunity of having something in the nature of a general review of the financial situation with the Minister for Finance present, and these opportunities are too valuable to be allowed to pass without making full use of them. Therefore, I propose to say something about the general financial background of this Bill rather than deal with the <Col N="777" /> particular issues which Senator Hawkins has been dealing with.  The Minister, in introducing the Bill in the Dáil, called attention to the background against which his financial proposals are framed.  I think it is becoming more and more clear as time goes on that the Estimates and the Budget every year form a consistent whole, and that now, in March, we are at the beginning of that grand inquest into the affairs of the nation which takes place every year and which culminates in May in the Budget.  We are now, if you like, at the stage of trying to diagnose the evils and ills in the national situation, and I think that the cure, or the attempted cure, if it is to be found, must be very largely found in the Budget, for reasons to which I will come later.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me that there are three things to look for in diagnosing the condition of the national economy which he is trying to deal with in his Budget.  One which is most talked of is the balance between revenue and expenditure.  It is important, but it is an internal affair which is very largely inside the control of the nation.  Another balance which is of importance but, I think, of secondary importance also, is the relation between the price level at home and the price level abroad.  The most important balance, I think, against which the Budget and the Estimates must be framed and the whole financial policy of the country must be constructed is the balance of external payments and in the balance of external payments there are signs at the present moment calculated to cause a certain amount of disquietude in people who are interested in the health and welfare of the national situation.  Disequilibrium in the balance of payments of the magnitude and nature to which the Minister referred in the Dáil must sooner or later be corrected.  If we do not correct it in one way, nature will correct it in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No community of people, any more than a family, can go on living beyond <Col N="778" /> its income indefinitely.  Disequilibrium in the balance of payments of the amount which emerged in the current financial year, as far as the latest figures show, does seem to indicate that either the nation as a whole, or the Government, or possibly both, are living slightly beyond their income. It therefore behoves the Minister for Finance, as the guardian of the nation's purse, to try to correct this unhealthy tendency.  I do not suggest for a moment that these unhealthy tendencies are entirely or even to any great extent the fault, or even the responsibility, of the Government itself.  As everybody knows, the terms of trade moved against this country. The Minister in the Dáil stated that this factor alone accounts for £8,000,000 of the disequilibrium in the current year.  That in turn reflects the delayed consequences of devaluation, together with the various events in the international field, stockpiling, rearmament and the war situation in the world.</P>
    <P>Possibly the full adverse effects of the changes in terms of trade have not yet fully appeared.  I am afraid that the rise in wholesale prices, which is shown in the terms of trade, has not yet seeped through into the cost of living and the retail index number to the extent that it will.  I am very much afraid that what at the moment appears to be merely an adverse turn in the balance of payments may, before very many months elapse, become reflected in a rise in the cost of living, which is a much more urgent matter for the ordinary member of society.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to discuss the question of the Prices Commission and the attempt at freezing prices.  Obviously, prices cannot be frozen in a position of this kind.  All that the Government can do, I think, is to make the gallant effort it has made to keep the inevitable rise within reasonable control and, above all, to introduce publicity into this situation so that, at least, whatever rises in prices do take place, will take place under the searchlight of public investigation and that people will not be suspicious that the rise in prices is the result of some improper manipulation or profiteering on the <Col N="779" /> part of middle men and business people.  If the Prices Commission can do nothing else to hold the line, it at least can do that.</P>
    <P>While disequilibrium in the balance of payments is to a very large extent the result of deterioration in terms of trade, I do not think one can close one's eyes to the fact that there are other factors at work as well and that there is a £20,000,000 gap which, according to the Minister's own calculation, is not accounted for by the adverse terms of trade.  I think the Minister will agree with me that this gap in the balance of payments will have to be closed somehow, sooner or later, I do not say this year, I do not even say next year.  No country, any more than a family, can go on living forever beyond its income in the way in which this country has been doing over the last year.</P>
    <P>If it were not for the fact that we are a creditor country still to the extent that we are, a course would be forced on us in the hard way.  If we were a debtor country we would have to trim our sails to the facts of the situation, whether we liked it or whether we did not, unless we were able to borrow abroad, unless there were nations in the world prepared to extend Marshall Aid to this nation continuously in almost unlimited amounts. We are not faced with that urgent situation, owing to our creditor position, which in its turn is owing very largely to the thrift and foresight of Irish people in the past.  Therefore, we have a certain amount of freedom which is denied to other countries and I suggest to the Minister that that position of freedom gives to him and the Government a certain responsibility. That freedom is to be used and not abused and the very fact that we have a freedom that other countries have not imposes on him and on the Government the responsibility for dealing with the situation in a deliberate, calculated and prudent manner.  He can secure that, at least, the necessary steps, the necessary deflations, are not imposed, through force of circumstances, on an unwilling country. They will be the result of measures deliberately taken by the Government <Col N="780" /> after full review of all the aspects of the situation and all the consequences of anything they decide to do.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not suggest for a moment that equilibrium can be restored in the current year, but I think the Minister will agree that a long period of dissipation of external assets is not a prudent course for any nation to pursue.  Such a course would reduce this country from its present creditor status to a debtor status. Certain other countries in Europe, not very far away, have experienced that change of status in recent years, largely through no fault of their own. I do not think that either the financial or the political consequences of such a change are such as to commend themselves to anybody with regard to the national well-being.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly aware of what is said about the deterioration of our sterling assets, of the criticism which is made of the wasting assets in which our foreign reserves are held.  That is, no doubt, true, but it must be remembered, as against that, that although sterling is depreciating in value, it is not depreciating more rapidly, as far as I know, than any other currency in the world to-day.  It is regarded at the present time as one of the hard currencies. It is not despised by people in other nations who are short of it. It may in the future become convertible to a very much greater degree than it has been in the past.  Therefore, I certainly do not think that it is wise or prudent for people to despise the value of our external holdings simply because they are in a currency which in a world situation is losing value like every other currency.</P>
    <P>But, apart from that, the central fact remains that they are the only reserves we have and that they are the only reserves that stand between us and the loss of our financial and, to some extent, I suggest, our political independence in the world to-day.  Therefore, I think the Minister will agree with me that the total dissipation of these assets, or even rapid dissipation, is a course of action not to be condoned or regarded as even in the realm of the possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> That being so, it does seem to me that there are three questions which need answering in this connection.  The first question, I suggest, is to what extent are corrective forces to be observed in the present situation?  To what extent will the disequilibrium tend to cure itself if nothing is done by the Government?  The second problem, I suggest, is: to the extent to which corrective forces are not at work, what is the desirable extent to which the Government should attempt itself, by policy, to close the gap? Thirdly, having decided on that amount, how should the gap be closed; what measures should be taken to try to close that amount of the gap between our imports and exports?</P>
    <P>As regards the first of these questions, I think there are certain corrective forces observable.  The Minister, I think, referred to them in the debate in the Dáil.  There is a possibility, I hope, of an increase in the volume of production and the volume of our exports.  I do not wish to delay the Seanad by quoting from the Minister's speech in the Dáil, but the Minister did give certain figures, as reported in column 788 of the Dáil Debates, showing a substantial increase in agricultural and industrial production.  There is no reason why there should not also be an increase in our exports and, if export prices rise, why the export side of the account should not improve in time. It is also possible, I think, that there may be a certain reduction in the volume of imports partly caused by outside scarcities, partly caused by inaccessibility to certain goods, and partly caused by the end of stockpiling, which, after it has been in existence for some time, tends to slow down.  There also seems to be indications in the outside world that the upward rush of wholesale prices has come to an end and that the rate of increase in these prices is tending to slow down. It has been suggested in recent weeks that the change in American stockpiling policy may easily result in slowing down the increase in raw material prices, and that there may be something like a new equilibrium of raw <Col N="782" /> material prices, at a higher level, it is true, than that which we had some years ago but, at the same time, that this constantly rising tendency may stop.  This would be a self-corrective force in the balance of payments in regard to which I suppose the Minister has already made some estimate.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would be optimistic enough to suggest that the forces I have mentioned would correct the disequilibrium and this gives rise to a second question.  It is a question for the country and a question for the Minister: how far should he deliberately attempt to close the gap remaining when all the corrective forces may have done their work?  I do not think it necessary, in one year or in even two years completely to close the gap.  That is to say, I do not think that an adverse balance of payments is so evil of itself as to call for a rapid change in policy. What I really have in mind is the problem which was discussed in this House last year in connection with the repatriation of Irish capital invested abroad.  It is very difficult, of course, to say, looking at the list of imports, how far they are of a capital nature and how far they are not.  At a time like this, imports that appear to be consumption goods may really represent something in the nature of an accumulation of stocks.  Therefore, I think to the extent these imports are of a capital nature or represent an accumulation of stocks, that they are not necessarily in themselves evil things.  We discussed the matter fully last year in this House and I think there was general agreement that at a time of rising prices, at a time of a tendency to increase investment in home production, at a time when Government policy quite definitely is to increase production, this disequilibrium in the balance of payments by the repatriation of sterling is not in itself a bad thing.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister that we should try to make some sort of rough estimate of the remaining gap that is to be closed in capital imports, of how far they are consumption goods for current consumption or how far they are being imported for the building up of stocks or stockpiling.  There is the question <Col N="783" /> of how far the imports are made up of goods for current consumption and, above all, of the extent to which they are luxury goods, and there does seem to be a case there for trying to check them.  The precise measures which are best calculated to bring about that I shall suggest later.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to wander too far from the issues in the Central Fund Bill.  I want to avoid giving the impression of treating this matter academically but I cannot help saying that whatever measures the Minister takes must be of a deflationary character and that, in the short run during which an expansion of production and an expansion of exports cannot be expected to take place&mdash;because an expansion of production and an expansion of exports take time&mdash;the correction of the disequilibrium in the balance of payments usually involves something in the nature of a reduction in some branch of internal expenditure, in other words, a deflation.  There are ways in which this can be done which are not feasible in this country.  There are more or less painless ways of imposing deflation, such as the devaluation of the Irish £ which we have discussed fully and which has been objected to on various grounds.  If the devaluation of the £ is not regarded as a practical measure, then I think the Minister may be forced to impose a certain deflation by interfering with the standard of living.  I should like to mention to the Minister one more or less painless method of imposing deflation which I do think is open to the Government in the circumstances of this country.  Countries differently circumstanced from us, whose banking systems are not so integrated with the banking system of other countries and whose central banking mechanism is different from us, may possibly succeed in imposing a deflation of credit also through a rise in the central bank rate.  That matter has been fully discussed in the Report of the Banking Commission&mdash;how far a rise in the Central Bank rate would restore equilibrium in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>That was one of the problems discussed in the report of the Commission <Col N="784" /> issued in 1938.  The conclusion is that owing to the peculiar nature of the Irish banking structure, a banking policy of this kind would not, in fact, be effective, and that, therefore, one of the accepted methods of correcting the disequilibrium in the balance of payments is not available to this country in present circumstances. I might suggest to the Minister that although the ordinary bank rate policy is not calculated to be effective, a certain restriction of credit on the part of the commercial banks, voluntarily undertaken, might have the slightly corrective result of producing some discouragement to over-borrowing for socially undesirable purposes at present.  I have mentioned two accepted methods of imposing deflation, one, the devaluation of currency and the other revising the bank rate. I do not think that either is practicable or would in fact be effective. Therefore I return to what I said at the beginning of my remarks, that I think it is becoming more and more realised in the world to-day everywhere, that the balance of payments must very largely be kept at equilibrium by means of budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>The Budget has long ceased to be the mere housekeeping account of the Administration.  In the old days, the Budget simply was an effort to raise, at the minimum of cost, a certain amount of taxation to pay for essential services.  These days have passed away.  At the present time the Budget, as I have said already&mdash;this debate to-day and the debate last week in the Dáil are the first stages in the debate leading up to the Budget&mdash; is the appropriate mechanism for restoring the equilibrium in the balance of payments.  In this country it cannot be left to the Central Bank to do that by bank rate.  The Central Bank, which might be made use of for that purpose in other countries, has not got the power to do it here.  The Minister for Finance and the Government in this country must, if they wish to restore equilibrium in the balance of payments, take the steps themselves, and the place in which to take the steps, I suggest, is through the Budget which will be opened by the Minister <Col N="785" /> for Finance at a not very far distant date.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am very anxious to avoid wasting the time of the House and of appearing academic in my approach to these matters which are all so topical and so pressing.  I do think there are four directions in which the Minister for Finance might impose this deflation. It could be done by suitable budgetary policy.  It is generally agreed to-day by every student of the subject that the expenditure of the community can be segregated into four classes, and that, when these four classes have been accurately measured, nothing really should escape the statistical net.  Community expenditure can be classified into (1) private expenditure on consumption goods, (2) private investment, (3) Government expenditure on current consumption, and (4) public investment.  These are the four directions in which money can be spent if it becomes necessary to impose deflation on the community. Deflation means cutting down purchasing power, cutting down expenditure in some direction pending the growth of productivity and of exports with, as we all hope, a rise in export prices.  That is what we all hope will, in the long run, be a solution for this problem.</P>
    <P>The cutting down of one of these four magnitudes is the essential policy required to restore equilibrium in the balance of payments.  As I say, every one of these four magnitudes could be reduced through appropriate budgetary policy.  May I say a word about each one of them?  As regards private consumption by private people, the Minister stated in the Dáil, and the published figures bear out what he said, that there is considerable expenditure in this country, a rising expenditure, on articles which must, by any standard of classification, be regarded as luxury or semi-luxury goods, many of which are imports.  An increase in indirect taxation on these luxury goods would seem to achieve killing three birds with the one stone. It would reduce consumption and, therefore, reduce imports, and would help the balance of payments on the import side.  It would raise revenue <Col N="786" /> and, therefore, would be welcome from the budgetary point of view.  Finally, it would not raise the cost of living because the objects I have in mind, rightly or wrongly, are excluded from the cost of living index number. Therefore, to raise their price would not have the effect of raising the cost of living index number, and, that being so, could not have the effect of giving rise to claims for additional wages.  Hence, there could be no attempt to produce wage inflation.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a deflationary measure of a kind to which he should give his utmost attention.</P>
    <P>Another measure of the same kind was dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture in the debate in the Dáil, and that is current voluntary savings. The essence of deflation is to make people save more than they had been saving before.  There are two ways in which you can make people save.  You can prevent them from consuming by high taxation of the kind I have just described, or you can encourage them to contribute to the various savings certificates, and loans issued by the Government.  I suggest to the Minister that an increase in the amount of voluntary savings in this country would help him in the disequilibrium position; but, before an effort of that kind can be expected to meet with success, the people of the country must be attracted by what they regard as satisfactory rates of interest, and they must have some assurance that, in all probability, the value of money in the country is not likely to deteriorate too rapidly in the near future.  Unless the public are satisfied about these two conditions, I do not think the savings campaign would be a great success.</P>
    <P>The line of attack which the Minister could make on private investment could, as I have already said, be effected to some extent by a credit restriction policy undertaken by the banks.  That does not seem to me to be particularly desirable, in view of the amount shown to be privately invested by the national income figures.  I think that the amount of private investment here was rather too little rather than too much.  Certainly, <Col N="787" /> in so far as investment is taking place, directly or indirectly, in the export industries, in agriculture, and in the tourist industry, anything in the nature of a discouragement of private investment would, in the long run, be doing more harm than good to the balance of payments position.  There may be a certain amount of private investment of a luxury, purely internal domestic character.  It may be that a selective policy by the banks in the granting of loans would reduce undesirable investment of that kind.  At least, it is an avenue which should be explored in this quest for deflation which is necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>So much for private spending and private investment.  What about Government spending and Government investment?  All I want to say about that is this, that I do not think one can ask the Government to reduce its current expenditure without asking it to reverse engines almost entirely so far as very important parts of Government policy are concerned.  I do think that the critics of Government action in relation to the balance of payments and to the Budget, if they object to the balance of payments position and if they object to the amount of public money that is being spent, should indicate categorically what parts of current public expenditure, in their opinion, could be equitably and conveniently reduced.  I am not aware that any concrete suggestions of that kind have been made to the Minister in the course of the debate in the Dáil or in this House.  I think the same is true of public investment.  But before I leave the subject of public expenditure perhaps I should say, and I am sure the Minister will agree with me, that although I think it is too much to ask any Government to cut out essential articles of general policy, at the same time I think this is not a time to engage on new schemes involving public expenditure unless they are absolutely necessary.  I think that the social desirability of any scheme designed to help the health or the welfare or the social well-being of the nation should be postponed in times like these until <Col N="788" /> the country can afford additional expenditure on current services more easily than it appears to be able to afford it to-day.  Certain attractive propositions, so to speak, have been offered by Ministers to the public&mdash;not, I must say, by the Minister present in this House to-day&mdash;and some of these attractive propositions have not been accompanied by any estimate of their probable cost.  I do not think that objects of expenditure should become objects of Government official policy until their cost has been reckoned.</P>
    <P>The final field in which some deflation is possible is that of public investment. I think one can say, as I said regarding private investment, that the amount of public investment seems to be slowing up or trailing off&mdash;that, although there are increases in the capital programme in some directions, they are more than outweighed or decreased in other directions.  Therefore, it looks rather as if capital investment, instead of going up is tending to go down naturally and may even be one of those forces which I described earlier as &ldquo;self-corrective forces&rdquo; in the situation. We discussed this question last year on the repatriation debate.  The public investment which the Government is undertaking&mdash;the land rehabilitation scheme, the improvement of agriculture, and so on&mdash;will, in the long run, have some effect on production and exports.  Taking the long view of the balance of payments, it might be a foolish thing rather than a wise thing to reduce it at the present time.  I think I have covered the only fields in which the Minister can reduce expenditure. In my opinion, for what it is worth, something in the nature of increased indirect taxation on luxury goods seems to be calculated to produce that effect with the least harm to the community. When I talk about the least harm to the community the factors I have in mind are the effect on employment, the effect on production and the effect on the cost of living.  I think that increased direct taxation at a time like this would possibly have an adverse effect on employment and possibly on production.  I do not think it would necessarily have an adverse effect on the cost of living.  I think, on the <Col N="789" /> whole, that, while producing revenue in reducing private expenditure, it would probably do it less easily than an increase in indirect taxation of luxury goods.  However, this is not a Budget debate.  These are only suggestions thrown out, I might say irrelevantly, just for what they are worth.</P>
    <P>If the Government decides to raise a certain amount of money for Government expenditure, the question whether it is raised by taxation or by borrowing is one of rather secondary importance.  I think that possibly too much importance has been attached to that aspect in these debates and discussions. The emphasis should be laid, as I have laid it this afternoon, and as the Minister himself laid it very emphatically in the other House, on the balance of payments.  The revenue and expenditure account is largely inside our own control.  It is a domestic matter rather than an international matter.  Whether we raise the money by borrowing or by taxation is really of rather secondary importance compared with the amount raised and the objects on which it is spent.</P>
    <P>Taxation can be inflationary and borrowing need not be inflationary. The two issues tend to get mixed up in popular discussion.  It is assumed that expenditure met out of borrowing is inflationary and that expenditure met out of taxation is not inflationary. That may be true, to some extent, but it is by no means a universal truth. If the borrowing is of a sort that can absorb current savings and if current savings can be attracted in the light of the future use of borrowings then the borrowing may be a great deal less inflationary than certain types of taxation.  Any additional taxation that would raise the cost of living and thereby raise wages would certainly be more inflationary than borrowing net from current savings.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that there are three questions which the Minister has to try to answer.  Can this disequilibrium be trusted to right itself? If left alone, will the gap tend to close?  I suggested that it will but that <Col N="790" /> it will not close entirely.  To the extent to which it does not close itself, how far can the import-export balance be forced together by Government policy in the light of the capital programme and the repatriation programme? Having decided the extent to which it should be brought together, how should that forcing be done?  In the long run, it may be done by expanding exports.  In the short run, I am afraid it involves a diminution of internal expenditure.  The Minister will have to decide how to impose this deflation on the community in such a way as to cause the least inconvenience and the least evil results.  This is the opening of our national spring cleaning&mdash; beginning with the Estimates and the Central Fund Bill and ending with the Budget.  At this point we are at the diagnostic stage in relation to the national economy.  I have tried to throw some light on the evils from which the country is suffering.  The cure is for the Minister and the cure will come in May when the Budget will be opened in the other House.</P>

      <P>I am sure that I am expressing the feelings of the House generally when I compliment Senator Professor O'Brien on the critical but very interesting analysis of Government policy in the realms of finance to which we have been treated this afternoon. It is the type of speech which contributes to a better understanding of the country's financial problems.  It must be an aid to a Minister for Finance&mdash;even to a very competent and wise Minister for Finance such as the present holder of that office.  That is the sort of thinking to which we must accustom ourselves, no matter on what side of the House we may sit, if we are to understand the purposes for which taxation is levied and the ideas behind the policy for which this expenditure is being incurred.  I am sure that whoever occupied the Minister's office would welcome constructive proposals no matter whence they came.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very long speech from Senator Hawkins this afternoon.  I think no one wants to be unkind to the Senator because he, in a personal sense, is rarely unkind himself, but quite frankly, I found little constructive <Col N="791" /> thinking anywhere from the beginning to the end of his speech.  I tried to think of what we used to say when we sat over there and I can recall various occasions in this House when we urged the then Minister for Finance that when he was levying taxes he should always think of the productive capacity of the people, the use they were making of their resources and the level of income they enjoyed.  I think I could repeat all that to-day with equal force and with equal truth.  I tried to analyse Senator Hawkin's mind and I just do not know what he would urge the Minister for Finance to do at this moment if he could control his policy.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Brien indicated towards the end of his speech, neither here nor in the other House had we any proposals by which any of the present expenditure could be dispensed with.  We had indications in the other House, it is true, from the leaders on the front bench that they did not think some of the methods adopted by the Minister the best and that his policy of borrowing did not meet with their approval, but no one said that the purposes for which he was borrowing were purposes on which money should not be spent and the obvious conclusion to which we must all come is that they would do the same thing but by taxation instead of by borrowing.</P>
    <P>No one will dispute the fact that we heard this afternoon an authority on this subject whose word, judgment and knowledge is accepted by everyone in the country when we heard Senator Professor George O'Brien.  He has given his point of view and no one will challenge the soundness of the judgment he passes on Government policy at the moment.  What we must apply our minds to is whether their present policy is the best one, whether they are not doing something which they ought to do and whether they are doing things which might be done better in another way.</P>
    <P>I often have felt and repeated on many an occasion that if a group of people from any grade of society who were honestly trying to serve the country and genuinely anxious to do <Col N="792" /> the right thing for the country could be got together and if they could eliminate from their minds for a short space the political divisions which are both unnatural and unreal, these people, whether they be interested in agriculture, industry, foreign policy or the problems that may be covered by the words &ldquo;social security,&rdquo; would be much more in agreement than in disagreement. It is rather tragic that after 30 years of this State we persist in this peculiar attitude that there are real and very great differences on many aspects of Government policy when in fact there are no such differences. My feeling is that the greatest necessity of the country to-day is to pipe down on political propaganda.</P>
    <P>You cannot make progress in a country where the minds of the people are not at peace.  I think it is wrong and unfair to the country to attempt to disturb people's minds and convince them that they are much worse off than in fact they are.  It is also wrong to convince them that they are entitled to many things which they cannot have either because of their personal circumstances or because of the conditions in which we must live in the world of to-day.  All that is being done now, and in fact one might say that that plan of campaign has reached a crescendo during the last two or three months.  It is all wrong, unfair to the nation and to the people, and is damning the possibility of the progress and development in the country in future which are necessary if our people are to live better.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins indicated that sort of approach, that type of mind.  Like most of his colleagues he was very critical of the Minister for Agriculture. They are unnecessarily and unjustifiably critical of him, and when I say that I repeat what I have said heretofore.  I would not say a number of the things which the Minister wants to say in the Minister's language, but there are farmers on the far side of the House who are concerned about his policy and I would be very anxious to hear where they disagree with it as that is terribly important.</P>
    <P>There is, I know myself, a great <Col N="793" /> deal of talk about the production of wheat.  The Minister is charged with not doing all that can be done to get the maximum production of wheat in the country, and with importing foreign supplies at prices higher than our farmers are paid to-day.  That criticism comes from the people who supported a Minister for Industry and Commerce who paid £50 a ton for foreign wheat at a time when he paid our own farmers only £22.</P>
    <P>We have heard Senator Hawkins to-day talking about the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the poultry industry, urging the farmers' wives to kill the cock and the hens.  I am not going over all the story responsible for the dissatisfaction in the poultry industry to-day.  If there are grounds for dissatisfaction, the fault cannot be laid alone at the foot of one Minister.  The truth is that the policy which we see coming to fruition to-day originated in the days of Deputy Dillon's predecessor in office.  An agreement was entered into then between the British and Irish Governments in regard to the development of the poultry industry in this country.  As a result of the fillip given to the industry by that agreement, the development was so swift that neither the British Food Minister nor the Irish Minister for Agriculture, nor any of their advisers, had any conception of the immense increase which poultry producers and their hens would be capable of, with ample encouragement. The stage was reached when, if the fruits of that agreement were to have full weight, the price of eggs 18 months ago would have been down to 1/6. There was an adjustment of that agreement which leaves us with a price to-day which all our producers regard as under production costs.  It is true that in August next the price of eggs will go up again to 3/6.  In the meantime, there will be difficult days for the poultry producers, but there should not be any criticism from that side of the House with regard to the consequences of the implementation of this agreement.  There should not be any charges against the Minister for Agriculture if he advises the poultry producers to kill off some of their stocks when they are not paying.  Of the poultry killed off to-day, one of the <Col N="794" /> cockerels or hens is commanding more than the calves commanded when they were slaughtered.  In each instance that development here at home was the result of the British Government's attitude towards us.  Apparently, that situation can be forced on a Government at a particular time, in certain circumstances over which they themselves have not all the control.</P>
    <P>There are people finding fault, I know, with what happens in regard to relations between us and the British on prices.  These people, if they study the whole situation, would also understand that the Danes who have made agreements with regard to eggs, pigs and bacon prices, have also come to get out of their agreements, as they were selling at under production costs. Up to the present, the Danes have not been released and are continuing to implement the agreement to supply the British with food, at far less than the price at which they can produce it. That applies to pigs, butter and eggs. It is important that we understand that when we are critical of agricultural policy here at home.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism also of the Government policy on turf production. I do not know if anyone over there will challenge me if I say that the first person to drop the production of turf on a great scale and bring back the coal was Deputy Lemass.  Before there was any change in Government, the British coal was coming back again.  I am not going over the whole story, but I challenge anyone who knows anything about the bogs last year, who would deny that not a farmer producer last season got his own turf out of the bog&mdash;in Kerry, Donegal, Cavan, Galway or Leitrim. If the Government policy and its direction to Bord na Móna is challenged, the fact is that no matter what was done last year, the turf would be there still.</P>
    <P>The problem before us is to decide what to do now.  In the last emergency we turned out to the bogs.  We learned from our mistakes then and from the extravagances of that time.  The people to-day and the people of to-morrow will be much more critical regarding turf than those in the last <Col N="795" /> emergency.  They will expect a much better product and if they do not get it there is a Press which will stir men's minds and make them as angry and as dissatisfied as it is possible to make them.  It is not doing the nation a service, however, if when we have no control over the seasons and they prevent us from delivering the goods as we would like to deliver them, that is not taken into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins was critical of the policy of taking men from Connemara to Kildare and said they ought to be kept on the bogs at home.  There is a great deal to be said for that, but one comment I have to make is that if we are to develop our bogs, the only acceptable commodity to produce is machine turf.  I have seen both and have a fair knowledge of bogs and I am convinced that that is the approach we must make in the future.  If the problem is tackled with vigour and intelligence, if our engineers are able to adjust the machines, if we can get a good output from the men on the bogs, if we can reduce our haulage charges and if we ensure that the turf is not broken up through improper handling and is kept under cover of some kind, we can raise the prestige of the product.  It will not be simple or easy.  The people of Dublin, during the last emergency, had to accept what was given to them, but there will have to be a tremendous effort to ensure that those people will live down their experiences and prejudices.  I believe the vast expanse of peat we have ought to be cleared away, so that forests and arable land would take its place, so that men and women could live where only the wild birds fly to-day.  We must bend our wills to that task.  We may fall down at times and the consumers may not get what they want.  If there is a Press that calls for the development of our peat resources and, when the peat reaches its destination and is not up to the standard, that will make the people dissatisfied, despite the fact that the elements have taken control instead of man, we will make our people impatient, intolerant and very critical.  Maybe there are minds prepared, for political reasons, to challenge every possible development <Col N="796" /> because it is not being carried out by the Party to which they give allegiance; but those of us who want to see progress must approach these problems on a different plane.  We have inherited many things, good and bad.  We should try to eliminate the bad ones and when action is being taken on lines of policy with which we are in agreement fundamentally, we should be prepared to give our hearty co-operation.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the Minister's policy regarding the land project.  I see nothing but good coming from it.  There are millions of acres of land in this country not producing 10 per cent. of what it is capable of producing. It needs to be rehabilitated and the capital investment is far beyond the capacity of the owners.  No banking institution in existence or capable of being brought into existence will provide the credit which will enable the owner of such land to carry out the undertaking.  But, through Marshall Aid and the vigour and imagination and, probably, through the aggressiveness of the Minister for Agriculture we have had very considerable funds placed at our disposal to improve land which requires it.  Instead of being critical, we should all support that enthusiastically.  Of course, we can be critical in a constructive way. If Senator O'Callaghan, and experienced and competent farmers like him, have constructive proposals to make, they ought to make them.  We all want to get the best out of this project.  We do not want to see the money wasted or mis-spent.  If capital is put into the land, we want to ensure by a policy of reconstruction that the best value is got and that it is done in the right way.  That is the approach we ought to make.</P>
    <P>I have heard this scheme likened to a scheme operated under the previous Government.  Is not that just like making a comparison between a midge and a mountain?  It could not have been done by the previous Government or any previous Government, because the funds were not available.  I do not say the previous Government would not have done it; I am sure they would if the money were available.  But it was not there and it is available now. <Col N="797" /> We are getting approximately three-fifths of a grant for this sort of work. Surely, that is something we should applaud.  We ought to applaud the Minister who was able to win his colleagues over to assenting that all this Marshall Aid should be put into the land of the country.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an immense increase in productivity as a result of this investment.  We ought to discuss here its effect on the income of our people and the influence it is going to have on population, on productivity and on the taxing capacity of our people.  I have no doubt that the carrying capacity of our land can be increased by at least 50 per cent. and much of it by 100 per cent.  The quantity of land that is well farmed in this country is relatively small, and by well farmed, I mean farmed to 100 per cent. of its potential productive capacity.  The best farming is carried on in the intensive tillage areas and there are just a few of these&mdash;the area from which Senator O'Callaghan comes and the areas around the beet factories.  In the main, these are the best farm areas.  But, in the large areas where we are growing grass, or pretending to grow it, the land is very badly farmed.  I say that even of the best grassland in the country.  The Minister wants to change all that.  I am convinced that he has the competence and the vision to do it.</P>
    <P>I urge on those who are critical of the Minister for Agriculture in a personal way to forget that.  It is not the right spirit in which to approach the nation's problems in these days of terrible difficulties for mankind in every land.  If there is a man amongst us who has such faith in the country and in its people, he ought to be given a chance.  It is neither patriotic nor just to adopt the attitude adopted towards that Minister.  There has been criticism of his policy in regard to dairying and butter production.  I have heard criticism of the butter which is being imported.  I heard people criticise it who had not even seen it.  At a meeting of the county committee of agriculture in my county one member denounced it and, when he was <Col N="798" /> challenged, he had to admit that he had not seen it.</P>

Having seen this butter in my own home, I can say that I could find no fault with it.  When people in this House or anywhere else in this country condemn the products of either the Danes or the people of New Zealand, they are talking of products and producers which have commanded respect in every country in the world.  They are two countries which have been held up to us as examples by one of the greatest authorities on increased production in this country, Dr. Henry Kennedy.  For years and years he has been asking why we cannot imitate the Danes and the people of New Zealand.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to me to see Senator Colgan so vigorous in defence of Senator Hawkins.  I am addressing myself to complaints made by Senator Hawkins with regard to the foreign butter which is coming into this country.  The total quantity of butter which came in was very small.  People like Senator Hawkins are trying to have it both ways.  If the butter did not come in and the ration was cut, <Col N="799" /> look at what would be said: &ldquo;This foolish Minister for Agriculture sold butter to the Germans.  He could not see so far ahead as to know that we would have six months of rain at the end of the year.  He should have foreseen that in March or April.&rdquo;  I wish he could have advised us of that and we would have adjusted our farm problems to the difficulties of the situation.  I think Senator O'Callaghan will agree with me that it would have been worth many millions to the farmers if the Minister could have foreseen that, but he could not.  He sold butter to the Germans and I hope he will be able to sell it to them again. Having sold it to them, despite the fact that our own production was giving evidence of drying up somewhat he kept his bargain with the Germans. If I sold a beast at a fair to somebody, some other person might come to me afterwards and say: &ldquo;You were foolish to do it; if you had held on I would have given you another pound.&rdquo; I have had that experience, but I went through with my bargain.</P>

      <P>That is regarded by one of the leaders of the Opposition as a serious contribution to a debate on a Central Fund Bill providing for the expenditure of over £80,000,000.  For years I was on the board of a co-operative organisation which sold annually over £2,000,000 worth of butter away back in 1927, 1928 and 1929.  The practice <Col N="800" /> at that time and for years before it was to sell off all the butter and import foreign butter over the winter months. In that way we got a better price for our butter during the summer months and a higher price than we had to pay for the imported butter during the winter months.  That was the practice, and the people then ate the imported butter.</P>

      <P>Senator Hawkins referred to the fuel situation and to our imports of coal.  He commented on the fact that delegations have crossed to Britain to confer on the question of fuel supplies.  I do not suppose for a moment that the Senator is against their going.  I do not know precisely whether or not he wanted them to get fuel supplies.  The question is would we be better off if they did not go? Are we better off because they did go? Which way does the Senator want it? Our train services will have to be curtailed, but at least they were not curtailed as quickly as the British; there more than 100 trains have been cut because of shortage of fuel.  The producers of fuel have to ration themselves. I do not know whether Senator Hawkins has any intimate information as to conditions in English homes and in the Six Counties in relation to fuel supplies.  I do know that conditions are more serious there than they are here.  If a commodity is in short supply a Government has only one choice; they must ration supplies. In Britain they have to ration because there is a shortage of fuel.  We may have to do the same thing here for the very same reason.  Fuel and butter are not the only commodities that will be in short supply.  Coal will be in short supply for some time to come. There is always the possibility that the reaction to the world situation may bring about unanticipated developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of a crisis and an emergency developing, it may well be that we shall <Col N="802" /> see prices tumbling before the end of this year.  One simply does not know. If one could prophesy with regard to the future, one could make a fortune. But one would want to have the information first and keep it to oneself in order to speculate.</P>
    <P>With regard to our financial policy, I think the Minister is taking very sound steps and I think he can be trusted implicitly.  I do not think we have anyone here with as good a brain to put at the helm to guide us in our financial policy during these difficult days.  I do not think his policy would be challenged by even the most progressive and intelligent members of the Opposition.  I think we should all support his policy.  Certain aspects of it may not afford much comfort to us.  I am sure Senator Mrs. Concannon would agree with me that there is a tendency to a too high standard of living on the part of considerable sections of our people, a standard that is not justified by the incomes they earn or by their capacity to provide themselves with an income.  I would like to see everybody with a decent income.  The tragedy to-day is that many of our people are abusing their incomes.  They could put what they earn to greater advantage to themselves and ultimately to the advantage of the country generally.  There is an unwillingness to face the realities of hard work.  The productive effort is declining and our people demand higher incomes from a lower level of production. The result is they must demand a higher price for their products than the consumers are prepared to pay and costs are, therefore, rising.  I think we should face that fact.  We cannot better conditions generally unless we produce a greater volume of goods while at the same time lowering the costs of production so that the consumers will be able to buy these goods cheaper.  Those of us who have high aspirations for the future of our country should, I think, make that declaration here openly.</P>
    <P>Unless our people are prepared to put their backs into the task of improving production, as our fathers did before them, we shall not succeed in raising the standard of living.  We will have a dissatisfied community.  We <Col N="803" /> will have people making demands for State assistance that the Government cannot provide and which the Government is not justified in providing because it imposes too great a burden on another section of our community.  But that appears to be the mentality of a large proportion of our people to-day. Perhaps it is the reaction from the general world situation but it is not good from the point of view of social stability.  A change of Government will not alter that mentality.  Even if there was a change of Minister to-morrow he would find himself confronted with the same difficulties, though he might wear a different political label and belong to a different political Party.  The only result of non-support of this policy will be to thwart the best efforts in statemanship in building up our nation.</P>
    <P>We are spending more money.  I believe we are spending it wisely.  I believe that the Minister for Finance is exercising rigid control and he is exacting from his colleagues the undertaking that they will get value from the money in the different Departments to which it is allocated.  It is our responsibility, where there is justification for a critical analysis and constructive suggestion, to advance these. I earnestly suggest that this should on all occasions be done by members of the Opposition.  Let them give the Minister their helpful criticisms.  He is a man with an open mind.  He is sufficiently well educated to realise that he does not know everything that is to be known about life on this earth. If people are in a position to give him advice and suggestions on various problems which he may not fully understand, I am quite sure that he will be prepared to accept their advice and suggestions and to give them his careful consideration.  We have had quite enough of carping criticism.  I ask members of the Opposition to examine their consciences and see if they cannot make a useful contribution to the national advance and to national stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think an increase of £18,000,000 in three years comes as bad news to the people.  Increased <Col N="804" /> expenditure can only be met by increased production.  Any increased production we may have must come from agriculture.</P>
      <P>There is one Estimate, the Forestry Estimate, which attracts my attention. It appears to be increased by about £500,000.  Side by side with that increase we have a Control Price Order, which was made in 1949 and which specifies that timber grown here will be sold at about half the price of imported timber.  I think that is not right.  If the timber which we grow here is worth only half the price of the timber we import from Sweden and other countries, then we ought to hesitate before embarking on an expenditure that is being increased by £500,000 on forestry.</P>
      <P>I have advocated forestry here and elsewhere.  Despite that Price Order, I believe we ought to go ahead with afforestation.  Timber has many uses, apart from its commercial use.  It tends to beautify the country, it improves climatic conditions, and it helps to lessen the danger of flooding. In addition to that, our soil and climate are quite suitable and we ought to be able to grow just as good timber as any other country in the world.  If that is so, why do not our timber producers get the same price as the importing countries get?</P>
      <P>I offer that criticism to the Minister in a helpful way.  I hope he will consider it helpful and I hope it will meet with the approval of Senator Baxter.  The position in regard to timber should not be allowed to continue.  If we are to increase our expenditure on forestry by £500,000, the price of our timber ought to be equal to or very nearly equal to the price of any imported timber.  The suggestion I make to the Minister is that he should examine the 1949 Price Order and make up his mind whether or not it should be withdrawn.  My opinion is that it should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a milk price is very much in the air.  There is a good deal of agitation on the part of farmers, and our Minister for Agriculture says it is a political ramp.  I would not like to say too much for fear it might be surmised <Col N="805" /> that I was approaching this matter from a political angle.  The price of milk was fixed in 1947.  Since then the cost of production of milk has gone up by at least 50 per cent. I am sorry Senator Baxter is not now in the House, because I am sure he is interested in this subject.  I suggest my statement about the cost of production of milk is a perfectly fair statement.  From 1947 to 1951 the cost of production has gone up by at least 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I pass from that to the question of beet.  We are growing considerable quantities of beet, but not sufficient to meet the requirements of our people. We have imported sugar from Cuba and, while the cost of production of our sugar is £37, I believe the Cuban cost is about £54.  If that is correct, the Cubans are getting 50 per cent. more for their sugar than we get for the sugar that is manufactured in this country.  That position is not right. The Beet Growers' Association represents 40,000 beet growers who are doing their best to meet the needs of this country.  They feel they are getting the cost of production and they are doing their best.  Great credit is due to the association and I am sure we all applaud and approve what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of wheat. The price of wheat is £25 a ton.  I do not like prophesying, but I believe that when the harvest arrives wheat will be one of the cheapest foods on the market and it will be used for the feeding of live stock.  Farmers, like other sections of the community, are human and they will feed wheat to live stock if they cannot get a cheaper food.  I think the price of wheat should be increased.  We are paying to other countries something like £31 15s 0d. a ton for wheat, while we give our own farmers only £25.  That position is not right.</P>
    <P>Then we come to eggs.  This matter has been dealt with by other speakers. The fact is that the egg producer has been and is getting less than the cost of production.  In this matter I do not like to refer in any way to Ministers for fear I would say anything unkind, but people have been encouraged by <Col N="806" /> the Minister for Agriculture to take an interest in egg production.  Senator Baxter made the point that the flop in the egg business was due, not to the present Minister, but to his predecessor. My answer to that is that I am afraid when our present Minister for Agriculture threatened to drown the English people with eggs he made a <i>faux pas.</i>  I believe the flop in the egg and poultry business started from that point.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As originally planned the Bill was to have contained only one section, namely, a provision to permit of the establishment subject to certain conditions of the existing unestablished District Court clerks.  It was later decided to take advantage of the opportunity to include in the Bill a few other provisions of a technical character aimed at remedying defects in previous Court Officers Acts that time had brought to light.  Therefore, the Bill, as it comes before you, is in the nature of a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill but, nevertheless, I think that the Seanad, like the Dáil, will be chiefly interested in the section that concerns the unestablished District Court clerks which is Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> Under Section 3 of the Bill, it is proposed to take power to enable clerks, who are regarded as being employed whole-time, to be established without the necessity of undergoing a competitive or even qualifying test at the hands of the Civil Service Commissioners. Furthermore, power is being taken to enable certificates of qualification granted under the section to be ante-dated so that unestablished whole-time service may be reckonable for pension purposes.  Provision is also made for the payment of gratuities on retirement to any whole-time District Court clerk who may for any reason not secure establishment under the section, as, for example, in the case of a clerk who might be considered ineligible for establishment on account of his age or for reasons of health.</P>
    <P>The section follows generally the lines of Section 62 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, with one very important difference.  A serious defect in the 1926 Act provision was that it stopped short at providing for persons who were employed in a whole-time capacity at the date of the passing of the Act.  Since the Act was passed, a number of clerks have become whole-time, but it was not possible to establish these clerks because of the defect to which I have referred.  In Section 3 we now propose to provide that any clerk who is at present only a part-time clerk may be established under the section if at any time subsequently he becomes a whole-time clerk.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators will wish to know how exactly the provisions of the section are going to work out in practice.  One thing I want to make clear is that the enactment of this provision is not going to mean that every District Court clerk is going to secure establishment automatically because there are some clerks who cannot possibly be regarded as fulfilling the requirement of whole-time service.  Thus, there are in some parts of the country, clerks who have only one court a month to attend to, dealing with no more than a couple of hundred cases a year&mdash;most of them trivial.  However, I can say that the powers under the section will be <Col N="808" /> operated in as generous a spirit as is consistent with the preservation of the idea that whole-time service is an essential condition for establishment&mdash; an idea which it is necessary to preserve because of the reactions which any departure from that principle would have on the Civil Service generally.</P>
    <P>The administrative details will have to be worked out between my Department and the Department of Finance, but I feel I am warranted in saying that the majority of the existing unestablished clerks will secure establishment under the provisions of the Bill and that in all cases establishment will carry with it recognition for pension purposes of some, at least, of the clerks' unestablished service.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil, I had to say that previous service, where reckonable, would count only from the first of January, 1927, but I am now in a position to say that in appropriate cases and subject to the fulfilment of the requisite conditions previous service will count from 27th March, 1923, that is to say, from the date of the coming into operation of the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>With regard to those clerks who may not secure establishment under Section 3 of the Bill, I have two observations to make.  First, it is possible that some of these will secure establishment later on as a result of the policy of amalgamating clerkships that is being pursued by my Department with the object of doing away with part-time clerkships altogether so far as may be practicable.  Secondly, I am authorised by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to say that sympathetic consideration will be given to a request for retention beyond the normal age of retirement from any existing clerk who fails to secure establishment under the provisions of the Bill and it may be taken that, in practice, any such clerk will be continued in office so long as he is capable of the efficient discharge of his duties.</P>
    <P>So much for Section 3 of the Bill which, as I say, is the really important section.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections deal with <Col N="809" /> technical matters which I do not propose to go into in detail unless the Seanad wishes me to do so.  Section 2 of the Bill is intended to remove any possible doubt as to the liability of a county registrar to surrender to the Exchequer any fees which he may receive in respect of duties that were formerly performed by the under-sheriff. Section 4 of the Bill is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is to remedy a technical defect in the existing law relating to district probate registries, which leaves these offices, as it were, in the air, that is to say, unattached to any particular court, although everyone is agreed that they ought to be attached to the High Court, which is what the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>Finally, Section 6 has a double object; first, to remove doubts as to the boundaries of the bailiwick of the county under-sheriff in Dublin and, secondly, to enable the present sheriff of the county borough of Dublin, who will be 70 years of age next month, to be continued in office for a further two years, that is to say, to grant him a concession that has already been made to the county under-sheriff, who is due to retire this month, having already reached the age of 72.  Both of these officers have given distinguished public service, and it is felt that it would be invidious to treat them differently. The reason why there has to be legislation in the case of the sheriff, which was unnecessary in the case of the under-sheriff, is that the latter was appointed by an Act of the British Parliament which imposed no absolute age-limit.  These, then, are the provisions of the Bill.  I think I have given the fullest information with regard to them, but if there are any points which Senators wish to raise, I shall be glad to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the principle of the Bill.  It is one of the pieces of legislation which is long overdue.  If we have any fault to find with it, it is not in relation to what is contained in the Bill but what is omitted from it.  We appreciate fully the desirability of placing officers <Col N="810" /> in the employment of the State in general on some permanent basis, a basis in respect of which they will be entitled to any pension or remuneration which may arise from their years of service.</P>
      <P>The omission to which I should like to refer is the Circuit Court officials. While provision is made to cover the majority of officials of the District Court, for some reason or other, officials of the Circuit Court are not catered for.  It would probably necessitate another piece of legislation, but it would be well, in dealing with matters of this kind, that we should deal with them as a whole rather than in a piecemeal way.  From time to time, our attention has been drawn to cases of people who, having given long years of service, because they have not been placed on a pensionable basis, suffer considerable loss on death or retirement and I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that not alone in connection with those whose employment the Bill covers, but all State employees, where good service has been given for ten or 15 years, that should be sufficient, regardless of passing a competitive examination, to place them in the position of permanent employees.</P>
      <P>I would raise very serious objection to Section 6 were the circumstances not as they are.  I think it is a bad procedure to debate a principle of this kind, having to bear in mind that, in doing so, the person who occupies the position at the moment must be taken into consideration.  If matters of this kind could be dealt with without the necessity for relating them to a particular person, we would be in a much better position to form a sound judgment. I feel that we should not have to discuss individuals in relation to matters of this kind.  We welcome the Bill as a whole and the only fault we find with it is that it does not go as far as we would like it to go.  I suggest to the Minister that, whenever legislation relates to a particular person, to either an improvement or worsening of that person's position, it would be much better if we could consider it from the angle of principle rather than on the basis of the particular individual.</P>

      <P>I find myself in fairly full agreement with what Senator Hawkins has said with regard to Section 6.  May I go further and say that it would be much better if we could agree upon a retiring age for all public servants, whatever that age might be? There is, however, a particular case to be made here, in view of the position of the officer concerned.</P>
      <P>The question of the Circuit Court clerks was pressed fairly strongly in the Dáil.  It was not found feasible to include them in this Bill, but I should like to say that provision is being made and machinery is being established&mdash; and I think will very soon be in operation&mdash;which will enable these clerks to become established by another method outside and away from this Bill, a method which will meet their claim just as effectively as this will meet the claim of the Circuit Court clerks.  I should say that this Bill was supported by all Parties in the Dáil, and, in fairness to all my predecessors in the Department, that all of them have striven over the years to get this measure of justice for District Court clerks.  I can only repeat that, when it comes to giving effect to this Bill, it will be approached in a very sympathetic and very generous spirit.</P>

      <P>With your permission, I would like, on behalf of the members of the House, to congratulate the Minister on his restoration to health after his long illness.  I hope he has got a less onerous task than he had.  As this is the first opportunity I have had to do so, I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister for the help he gave to the delegation, of which Senator McGuire and I formed part, who attended the International Labour Conference last June.  He was a great help then.  He made a magnificent speech from the rostrum and the reception that he gave was spoken about by delegates from all the countries in the world.  I am sure that what will have a lasting effect on the minds of both Senator McGuire and myself was the little Irish night we had ourselves.  We held our heads high and enjoyed ourselves immensely.  The Minister was a great source of help to us.  The only pity was that he stayed so short a time with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, has been maintained in force up to the present by a series of continuing Acts.  The Bill now under consideration is one of these and its purpose is to continue the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts in force for another year&mdash;that is, up to the 31st March, 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A permanent Defence Bill was circulated to the Dáil late last year and it is at present awaiting a Second Reading there.  It is a very extensive Bill &mdash;one of the most extensive which has been introduced&mdash;and I cannot say with certainty when it is likely to be enacted.  If its enactment is not greatly delayed it may be possible to repeal the Temporary Provisions Acts before the 31st March next, but as a matter of precaution I have thought it desirable <Col N="813" /> to envisage their being in force up to that date.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is similar in form to those of previous years and is self-explanatory so that I do not think it necessary to delay Senators with any further remarks about it, particularly as they will have an opportunity for a full discussion of the permanent Bill when it comes before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, this is a temporary measure and there is a permanent measure in the hands of members.  I do not know when it will come before the House.  In the meantime, it may be no harm to direct a few remarks to the Minister on the question of our Defence Force.  There has been some criticism of the Government's approach to this question.  There is a feeling abroad that something more than the mere issue of advertisements to recruits to join the Army might have been done, that more sincerity should have been shown in the appeal than the mere issue of advertisements.</P>
      <P>We have relied, and must rely to a great extent, on forces such as the F.C.A.  Here, again, there is very serious criticism as to the approach of the Departments and the Government to this force.  Much more could be done if greater interest were shown by the Minister.  I hope that the new Minister will take a keener interest in the development of this force than has been taken up to the present.</P>
      <P>We see too little of our Army.  On occasions such as St. Patrick's Day and national holidays of that kind, the people should see more of the Army, which would bring home to them, first, that we have an Army and, secondly, that it is an Army which reflects credit on the country.  In that way our people would be encouraged to take part in our defence, in one field or another, whether in the permanent force or in a temporary force such as the F.C.A. or whatever other forces may be organised in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ireland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that this is a continuing Bill and that a permanent Bill is coming later, but there are a few things about defence that cannot be said too often.  One is <Col N="814" /> that any solution of defence problems arrived at in 26 out of 32 counties must be partial and, by its very nature, it must be, in the final analysis, a kind of makeshift.  The ideal solution will be when the national sentiment of all Ireland is harnessed to the defence of all Ireland.</P>
      <P>As to that ideal solution, there are some things that only an inhabitant of the Six Counties can say.  What I am saying here is very short.  I have said it already inside the Six Counties and also in the columns of English newspapers.  I said that we Six-County Protestants especially hold in our hands the key to the solution of the defence problem of our island.  What I said, in effect, was that we have duties in Ireland as well as rights and with the first move on our part to join in the defence of Ireland as Irishmen most of the present difficulties would disappear as if by magic.  But, until that desirable solution is achieved, I repeat that we should underline the fact that any Defence Bill brought before the Oireachtas of the Twenty-Six Counties must be, in a divided country, only a means towards a partial solution of Ireland's defence problem as a whole.  We should underline that and say it every time any Defence Bill is brought before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say with regard to what Senator Ireland has said, I think we all agree with him? With regard to Senator Hawkins, I agree with him on one point.  Perhaps I had better put that first.  We would all like, if it were possible without imposing an undue burden on our small Army, to see more of it on the streets.  I do not follow Senator Hawkins on some other matters.  He wants something done about recruiting, more than advertisements.  He thinks advertisements are insincere.  Advertisements are not necessarily insincere.  I am sure, for example, the Party opposite, when issuing advertisements &mdash;and they issued more than nearly any other Party in these islands&mdash;were perfectly sincere, although you could make an argument that they were not, but I will not make it for the moment. With regard to interest in the F.C.A., <Col N="815" /> who are the heirs and successors of the L.D.F. of the war, I think the Minister's predecessor took a great interest in the matter and the Minister will continue to take that interest.</P>
      <P>It might be of some importance, as a matter of record, to say that that force is under the control of Regular Army officers and that the suggestion that that force should be put on a proper military basis and put under the control of the Regular Army came from a member of Fine Gael and a member of the present Government. That is the origin of the present control of that force.  We all agree with Senator Hawkins that that is a force which should be developed, so far as it possibly can be developed, and that it is a force on the efficiency of which a great deal may ultimately depend.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a word in connection with the point made by Senator Hawkins supported by Senator Hayes on the matter of letting the public see the Army more frequently.  I make a special plea, if anything can be done in that way, for a revival of the tattoo.  I think we have had a tattoo only on two occasions in Ballsbridge and the fact that on each occasion it took one about an hour to get into the grounds showed the huge attraction it was from the point of view of the general public.  I think there should be a revival of the tattoo and that we should have exhibitions of that nature at fairly regular intervals. Possibly it might mean some extra work for the men concerned because on former occasions I know that the programme was carried out like clockwork and the preparation for it must have entailed a good deal of work.  I feel that spectacles of that nature and regular parades of the Army would keep the Army in front of the public and would result in their getting greater respect from the populace generally. I make a special plea that something might be done to bring about a revival of the tattoo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that quite an amount is being done already to popularise the Army.  I know that in our town we had a church parade on <Col N="816" /> St. Patrick's Day and the great honour of forming the flag party fell to members of the F.C.A.  There was an Army band and three companies of infantry present.  They paraded the town, both going to Mass and coming from Mass, on St. Patrick's Day.  With regard to tattoos, I think Senator Loughman will bear me out in stating that wherever there was any form of festival or centenary the Army gave it their unstinted help and support.  In Clonmel last year we had the celebration of the tercentenary of the Siege of Clonmel and the Army put on a wonderful performance in the form of a tattoo.  Many people remarked to me that it was the best recruiting drive the Army had ever had.  The soldiers who took part in the celebrations were, I would say, second to none in the world.  Hundreds of civilians said to me that they did not think it possible that an exhibition like that could be given by the members of the Irish Army.  People who had seen similar performances in Aldershot said they were not at all comparable to the tattoo given by the Irish Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the previous year the Army presented a tattoo in Cavan.  I think that if performances of that kind were given in various parts of the country&mdash; say, one each year in the different provinces&mdash;it would show the people of the country what the Army was doing and the type of material they were turning out.  I think it is not quite the fact to say that we do not see enough of the Army.  The Army is small and we cannot see them everywhere but in places in which we do see them, I think it is generally agreed that their discipline and their apparent fighting spirit are such as to make a very good impression.  I had the honour of serving for the whole emergency period with another member of this House in the L.D.F. and I think the spirit that existed during the emergency still animates the officers and men of the Army and the F.C.A. If there is a little bit of publicity needed, we can get over that difficulty. I again suggest that some effort might be made to present a tattoo each year in the different provinces so that people of the Twenty-Six Counties, and even people from the Six <Col N="817" /> Counties, might have an opportunity of seeing the Irish Army at these various centres, and of forming an idea of what it is capable of.</P>

      <P>Since the matter of public parades and tattoos has been mentioned, I should like to join with Senator Burke in paying tribute to the Army for the exhibition which they gave in Clonmel during the celebrations in connection with the tercentenary of the siege.  I think nothing could be more impressive than the display which they gave, particularly on the final day, when they marched with all their equipment through the town and the President took the salute.  The tattoo itself was seen by thousands of people, notwithstanding the fact that the weather could not have been worse.  I think there is every reason to have a repetition of these events throughout the country.  In the first place, they portray past history, and, secondly, they give an idea to the people of what their money is being spent on and what the country can do in the matter of defence.  I join with Senator Colgan and other Senators who have spoken in suggesting that more frequent displays should be given by the Army in as many places as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">

      <P>I wonder whether, in addition to the publicity that has just been suggested for the Army, it would be feasible to have occasionally combined operations with part of the Army and a unit of the F.C.A.  It is all very well to depend on local training and a fortnight in camp for the training of the F.C.A. but to arouse real enthusiasm, there is nothing like small combined operations.  I know they are rather bothersome things to manage but I believe it would be a valuable incentive within the F.C.A. if occasional operations of that nature could be devised and carried out.  After all the Army and the F.C.A. are to form an integrated force and, therefore, when it is possible their operational training should be carried out together.  One would have liked to have gone over more of the field of defence, but seeing that we are going to have a comprehensive Army Bill <Col N="818" /> later on and that it is possibly not fair to go into matters of defence with the Minister just after he has taken up his new office, it is better I think to postpone a discussion on the question of defence until such time as the more comprehensive Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators for allowing me to get my sea legs before they proceed to tackle me on the problems of defence.  I think a more opportune time will present itself when the premanent Army Bill comes before the House.  Let me say that I am anxious that the Army would be recruited to the strength that will be required to defend the country in any emergency that may arise.  It would appear to me that the question of policy is fairly well accepted and, therefore, there is no great difficulty in training a force to meet the requirements of that policy.</P>
      <P>On the question of the F.C.A., Senator Hawkins says that we should have more reliance on it.  Well, a person like myself might, perhaps, be inclined to have too much reliance on it, because it would be to me the nucleus of a very powerful series of columns all over the country, and, being a column commander of a sort in the past that met with some success, I might be inclined to go too far that way.  Therefore, I have to be careful and see that I do not let my feelings run away with my brain and responsibility. I am satisfied that the F.C.A. if properly developed, can play a very important part in the defence of the country.  That question has been argued at various times.  Of course, it is absolutely essential to have a very efficient and highly trained Army in existence to make the best use of the F.C.A. and so that you would get the greatest benefit out of it.  It is also true to say that it would be a very great incentive if, as has been suggested by Senator Orpen, combined operations could be carried out in the way of manoeuvres with the two bodies fitting into each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we have Regular Army officers and N.C.O.s in charge of the F.C.A. all over the country.  It is the intention to move in that direction <Col N="819" /> as quickly as possible.  For that reason, we are training now to meet a certain objective.  There is an object in training to-day, and for that reason it would not be fair or reasonable to divert the Army from training for tattoos.  In peace times, when you have a large body of men, tattoos can be very spectacular, but training for them is not of the type or value that you require for the defence of the country.  I regret to say that the times in which we live are far different from what they were when the defence and siege of Clonmel took place.  As one might say, they fought with kid gloves in those days as compared with the present time.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Army should be seen more frequently.  I am glad that the Dáil and Seanad have taken that view, because I remember the time when parliamentarians were insisting that the less you saw of the Army the better: that it should be pressed into the background, that the civil authority was supreme, and that the Army should not be pushed too far forward since it might lead to certain other developments.  However, I suppose, being a constitutionalist as well as a soldier, I will see to it that the balance is kept fairly well.  I will try to give expression, during my term of office, to the views expressed here.</P>
    <P>There are many things which, I think, the people should know, but still, in my opinion, it would not be in the interests of the country to discuss them too openly or too freely.  We have difficulties.  The world is very unsettled, and it is very hard to get our requirements either in men or materials.  I will just put it that way. It is not a question of money.  As far as this Government is concerned, and as far as I, as the Minister responsible to the Dáil and Seanad am concerned&mdash; and responsible, too, to the people of the country for the country's defence &mdash;I will see to it that the people will get the best value possible for the money they pay for a very costly form of insurance&mdash;and it is an insurance. I am satisfied from what I have seen of the Army since I became Minister&mdash; as well, of course, as before that&mdash; that, as I said in the Dáil, the Army, <Col N="820" /> if an emergency were to arise, will be able to give a very fine display, that it will, please God, surprise any country that would attempt to interfere with our independence or try to force its view on our people, a view which our people or Parliament do not want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Even those who look for the best in all possible worlds and under the best of all possible Governments, must have had their complacency a little disturbed by the figures revealed in the Estimates for the coming year, especially when one contrasts them with the figures of ultimate expenditure for the year 1942 and onwards.  In that year expenditure was a little under £38,000,000.  In the year for which we are now budgeting the figures are reversed, and the £38,000,000 becomes £83,000,000.  But that is not the worst of it.  I am not going to blame the Government.  The point to which I am drawing attention is that every year, by reason of the inevitability of some natural law that cannot be escaped, there has been a rise of £3,000,000 or £5,000,000, so that it looks as if every year the expenditure will be increased.  It does not seem as if these increases can ever be stopped.  In addition to the sum set forth in the Book of Estimates, we have got an indication that we shall be asked to give blank cheques in respect of two services, which will mean the expenditure of a great deal of money.  I refer to the mother and child scheme and the social services scheme.  What these sums will amount to, nobody can tell.  When one thinks of that, and remembers, as one <Col N="821" /> Senator has pointed out, that at the same time we have a terrific rise in local taxation, the burden on the citizen is really becoming almost impossible.</P>
      <P>It is true, as the Minister said on one occasion, that high taxation and the spending of public money might not always be a bad thing, but that it must be supported by increased production and increased powers of work. What I regard as the most serious aspect of the present situation is that we are losing largely our powers of work.  We have not the same interest in work.  Hardly anybody has the same interest in work as compared with the generations which have gone before us.  Unless we take stock and try to improve, the position will become worse and worse.  Everybody is looking for shorter hours and easier work.  That, in its turn, helps to create a rise in the cost of living and, with the burden of taxation, it is likely to come to a crisis.  I do not know if anything can be done about the matter.  It is possible that the Minister can do something about it, and if it is possible I think he will take steps to cope with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should go through the Estimates, Department after Department, and see whether he cannot lop off some of the expenditure for which, apparently, we do not think we have got an adequate return.  Take, for instance, the Department of External Affairs.  I wonder if we have got an adequate return for the £25,000 that has been spent, and that is being budgeted for again, for the Irish News Agency?  It is only when the Irish News Agency is responsible for some very undesirable publicity for our country that it comes within our ken.  There have been two instances which give one to think about its use. One was its report on the Baltinglass affair and the other was a reference to Aran which is deeply resented by the people there.  In the item of news that was circulated in America, the people of Aran were represented as crouching in their huts, so to speak, around a fire of dry cow manure.  That may have been a picturesque way of describing the position when the <Col N="822" /><i>Dún Aengus</i> was held up, because of a strike, from bringing supplies to the people&mdash;but why that description should have been sent to America it is hard to tell.  I have not seen any of the bulletins issued by the Irish News Agency but if any of them are of that nature I think it will be agreed that we would gain rather than lose by a liquidation of the £25,000 which is being sought for it.</P>
    <P>Another item which could, perhaps, be reviewed is the matter of the visits of some of our Ministers to foreign countries&mdash;especially when they make pronouncements that are not in accordance with what we know of the facts and that are not calculated to do us any credit.  I refer to the remark made by the Minister for External Affairs in Washington to the effect that we in Ireland can see no difference in the matter of orderly democracy between Britain and Soviet Russia.  Like the Minister who is present this evening, I am one of those who feel deeply about all that has been done to this nation by Partition.  My roots go deep through kindred earth of many generations in the lost territory.  I desire to point out that while Britain is largely responsible for Partition she may not altogether be responsible for it.  Other facts have to be taken into consideration in connection with this problem.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that in order to make a point against Partition the Minister should have said that we can see no difference between Britain and Soviet Russia.  It is most regrettable at present when, apart from the question of Partition, we are inclined to be friendly with Britain and when we need to be friendly with Britain.  At present, Britain is giving employment to a great many of our people.  At present we are trying to get coal from Britain and we are trying to get Britons to come to this country in our endeavour to further the tourist industry.  Apart from all that, we are trying to make good trade agreements with Britain that will help our economic and agricultural progress.  For these reasons it is most regrettable that a Minister should have said what the Minister for External Affairs is reported as having said.  I take this opportunity of expressing <Col N="823" /> the opinion that he should not have said it.</P>

      <P>If he said it, then it is most regrettable.  It is no harm that he should know my opinion.  I feel as deeply as he on this question of Partition, but do not like our case to be made on inaccurate statements.</P>
      <P>Another item in respect of which the Minister for Finance could use his pencil is that of excessive expenditure on advertisements by new Departments. It is a new departure.  I think that Ministers can get plenty of publicity without having to pay for it.  The Minister for Finance should speak to the other Ministers.  He is, as it were, the father of the family.  He has the people's money in his trust.  He should not allow money to be spent unless there is absolute necessity for it.</P>
      <P>On the subject of expenditure, I regret that the Minister has not budgeted more for harbour development.  There is only about £275,000 budgeted for capital services this year.  To my mind, nothing would give a safer or a richer return than the development of our harbours.  This is an island.  All our imports into this country and all our exports from this country are transported by sea.  More depends on the efficiency of our ports than I can say. One has to think of all the things that might be developed if we had good harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I have Galway Harbour in mind.  I should like the Minister to give serious attention to the position which exists as regards that harbour and to allocate the development grant for which the commissioners have applied.  Galway Harbour is the best natural harbour on the West coast.  It is significant that when the first ship was torpedoed in the last war, the <i>Athenia,</i> the survivors were brought not to the nearest port but to Galway.  It is also significant that when both the Americans and the Japanese evacuated their nationals <Col N="824" /> from Britain it was to Galway Harbour that their ships came.  I think there is a great case to be made for the development of Galway Harbour especially in the position which is now developing.  The Minister has been made familiar with the Galway Harbour Development Act of 1935 and of the position which has since arisen. The scheme was divided into two parts but the war came before the second part of it could be undertaken.  The trouble is that there was a time-limit. Now the position has changed so much that the Harbour Commissioners cannot raise the money on their surplus revenue while the guarantee by the county council and corporation to service the loan charge does not outlive the period set out in the Act. They have, therefore, been obliged to apply for a grant of £370,000.  I wish the Minister would give serious attention to this matter.  A very good and clear case has been made, and it would mean a great deal for all Connacht if the second part of the scheme were undertaken.  The quicker it would be undertaken the better, because every year the cost would be rising. It would create tremendous employment, help to solve many of the problems with which Connacht is afflicted, and do more to advance the prosperity of the whole country.</P>
    <P>Another thing which would richly repay capital expenditure is the construction of new schools.  We have a particular obligation to children and parents because of our Compulsory School Attendance Acts, and if we ask them to come to insanitary schools which are described as such by the medical officers of health we are doing a great injustice to these children.</P>
    <P>If I had anything to do with the schools I would see to it that the girls of the country got a proper chance of being trained for their role in life of good wives, good mothers and good housekeepers because I can think of nothing that would help the country more than that.  We should provide well-paid work for the men and the women they are to marry should be well-trained housekeepers who will be able to run their homes, train their children and rear them in a hygienic <Col N="825" /> way.  If we had these good homes and well-trained women we would save a great deal on the hospitals and health services that cost so much.  I do not know how the new hospitals in Galway are going to be financed.  We are to have £1,000,000 regional hospital and a regional sanatorium costing another £1,000,000.  It is most disquieting. If we spent money in other ways we would not have these problems to face and would have a richer and a happier country.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Mrs. Concannon when she speaks of being somewhat appalled at the size of the bill and yet when she gets down to detailed criticism finds that the main things she would like to suggest are some additions.  That is not criticism, as I think that is what most of us feel. We would like to see more of the things we are convinced are essential and at the same time we would like to see a smaller bill.  It seems to me that the size of the bill is no proper criterion.  The criterion is first of all the value received for the money and secondly whether we have sufficient resources and wealth to meet it.  If we have resources they should be spent and well spent, but if we have not got them we would be heading for disaster.</P>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon made certain references to a report of a speech by the Minister for External Affairs. If he said what she says he said I completely agree with her, but I am not prepared on one newspaper report to believe that he said exactly what is stated in the Press.  I myself last summer attended a Brotherhood International Conference in Paris and spoke on the subject of Partition. When I came back I found a newspaper cutting of five or six lines: &ldquo;Senator says Ireland is suffering.&rdquo; Whatever I said about Partition I did not want to convey the impression that we were suffering or starving or that we were a lot of refugees, an impression that could easily have been taken from the report.  I think it is right and natural that we should object to statements that appear in the Press but we should be careful before accepting that the Minister said that.</P>

      <P>If they are I would not believe in their infallibility any more than any other news agency. Statements are often cut and turned so that they can do a great deal of harm.  When that happens in a political debate between Parties one is inclined to laugh at it but when a Minister representing the country is reported as saying something that could do a great deal of harm I will not without proof accept that he said it.  That is not Irish policy and does not coincide with the views of any Party here.  None of us would suggest for one second that democracy in Britain is in any sense the same as the so-called democracy in Russia.  The fact that we might have quarrels with Britain about partition or about lesser things such as coal is no reason why anyone should make that statement.

      <P>The only reason I mentioned it was that I felt that we should not have it go out from this House that we necessarily accept it. If the statement was made we would probably agree on the matter as it is not one for Party feeling.</P>
      <P>In the financial debates in this House there is, naturally and properly, a very considerable amount of latitude and it is possible to raise a large number of subjects.  I generally confine myself to one or two rather than follow a large number.  I want to say a word or two on a question which took up a good deal of time in the Dáil on the Vote on Account, the general question of prices and profits, which has a very considerable bearing on the question of what our capacity is to pay the bill.  It was expected under present circumstances that we would have this debate, but it seems to me that there has been so much talk about profits, both in and out of Parliament, that the public mind has become somewhat confused and some people seem to regard profits as something evil which should be abolished.  The Minister's approach to the question, as I read it in the report on March 8th, seemed to me an eminently reasonable one.  Although the newspapers gave a good deal of space to it, it was not very accurately reported and I would suggest that Senators would do well to read the report.</P>
      <P>I believe that the time has come when a serious attempt should be made to study the whole question of price and profit control and, as far as possible, to remove it from Party political controversy.  For years I have urged successive Ministers for Finance to set up a committee or commission to inquire into and report on the best methods of taxing trade and industry. I made it very clear that the object of such a committee should not be either to reduce or increase the taxation of trade or industry, but rather to find a more equitable basis for taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that the first task of <Col N="828" /> such a committee would be to suggest methods of ascertaining normal or reasonable profits as, until this is done, it would be impossible to propose more equitable methods of taxation.  I dealt with this at length in previous speeches, and I do not propose now to take up the time of the House by repeating all the details.  I desire once again to urge on the Government the need at the present time for the appointment of such a committee or commission.  It appears to me that there are three main reasons why some such body should be set up at an early date.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it is clear that during the next few years very large sums of money will have to be found by way of taxation, and that trade and industry will have to bear a considerable share of such taxation.  Both the Government and the Opposition are in favour of very heavy expenditure, and the main difference between them is that the Opposition thinks that a larger part of the total Bill should be met at once by taxation.  Secondly, various recent statements by Ministers have made it very clear that the Government has no intention of allowing State interference or control to prevent traders from making fair and reasonable profits.  I suggest that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to carry out that policy fairly unless some general agreement can be reached as to how fair and reasonable profits are to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has reminded us that every year he receives figures showing the combined profits of various industrial or trading groups for the purpose of preparing his Budget.  These profits are presumably the profits as shown by income-tax assessments.  If, as I believe, the profits as assessed for income-tax are not the actual profits, such as would be approved by any competent accountant, then the figures given to the Minister are inaccurate to some extent and may be misleading.  By actual profits I mean the balance of the income over the expenditure in any year after provision has been made for annual depreciation and for the amortisation of all money spent on assets which will be used up in the making of profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> The Minister for Finance made it very clear in his speech that he was opposed to an excess profits tax and that its re-imposition at the present time would cause considerable difficulty. This part of his speech was in-accurately reported in the Press.  Personally I am in agreement with him, but I would not be opposed to a graduated tax on business profits, by which normal profits would be taxed at a low rate and excessive profits at a high rate.  I do not see how this could be done fairly unless some equitable basis could be found for assessing normal profits, and I submit that this would require expert and careful examination.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned at the effect that some recent speeches about profits have had on the public mind. It is, I believe, important that the public should appreciate that adequate profits are essential if this State is to achieve any degree of prosperity, and maintain a reasonably high standard of living.  There is a danger that in our hunt for profiteers we may injure our whole economy and fail in our object, which is to develop our industrial production on a basis of adequate but not excessive profits.  If the principle of private enterprise, which is generally accepted in Ireland, is to be maintained, we must solve the problem of profit and price control in a satisfactory manner.  Companies or individuals who take advantage of exceptional circumstances, such as short supply, to make profits which are quite unnecessary are the enemies of private enterprise, just as much as those who want everything controlled by the State, and hope to achieve this by squeezing profits so low that they will injure the efficiency of industry and force the State to take them over.</P>
    <P>A large section of the public seems to believe that excessive profits are being made by every Irish industry.  I do not believe that this is true of the majority of our industrial concerns.  I am inclined to believe that some of the scare about excessive profits is due to the scarcity of information given by some of our public companies.  Profit figures are quoted in the newspapers, which may seem to the casual reader <Col N="830" /> to be high, because no information is given as to the capital employed in the business or to the total value of the production.  A few companies have recently published figures showing how each £1 of the price at which they sell their goods is made up.  These figures showed how much of each £1 was represented by profits, whether distributed to shareholders or retained in the business.  I would like to see this practice adopted more generally.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it is far more important for the public to know what percentage of the price is represented by net profit than to be given total figures which may be misleading. Where profits are grouped together I think the same kind of information should be given to the public.  Where figures are issued by the grouping together of a large number of businesses I think figures should be given for the lowest and the highest as well as the average.  The Minister for Finance referred to one group which had a profit of £600,000 in 1939 and over £2,000,000 in 1949.  With great respect to the Minister, I would suggest to him that these figures do not really tell us very much.  It may be proof of gross profiteering, or it may not.  If the capital employed is larger and if the total output of the group had increased by four times during the period the profit might be quite reasonable.  What I would like to know is the relation of this profit to the price of the article which the group supplies to the public.</P>
    <P>According to the 1949 Statistical Abstract the paid up capital of companies on the Register of Companies was £42,112,000 in 1936.  By 1939 it had risen to £50,845,000 and in 1948 it was £72,760,000.  It is probably, higher now.  While I know that this increase may partly be due to the formation into companies of businesses which were not previously limited companies, I am satisfied that there has been a very substantial increase in the capital employed in business during the last 15 years.</P>
    <P>Increased total profits as a result of increased investment and production is something highly desirable, not something to be deprecated.  If we cannot increase the national income, I do <Col N="831" /> not know how we can continue to meet an annual bill of over £80,000,000.  Our aim should be not to decrease the total profit made by agriculture or by industry, but see that all classes of the people benefit by any increase in total profits.</P>
    <P>I think we must face up to the fact that under present international conditions we are not likely to have normal competition in trade for a long time to come.  For good or evil, Government interference is likely to continue, and in some form or other price or profit control is inevitable.  At the same time we must recognise that we have not yet discovered any really satisfactory method by which this can be carried out.  One reason, as I have already pointed out, is that we have no generally accepted standard of what are reasonable and necessary profits. Another reason is that we have so far failed to secure the full co-operation either of the public or of trade and industry. The previous Government had a plan which was embodied in a Bill entitled the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill.  In a recent debate in this House we were told that the Bill still represents the policy of the Party in opposition.  The unique feature of this Bill was the appointment of an individual&mdash;presumably a civil servant&mdash; who was to exercise a continuous supervision over the efficiency of every industry making an article protected by a tariff or import restriction.  As the Government can protect any industry, whether it asks for it or not, this could include every Irish industry, if the Government of the day wished to do so. To my mind this was the most objectionable form of State interference ever introduced into a Parliament in a democratic country.  The Government could, under the Bill, on the advice of a committee of civil servants, interfere with industry to a practically unlimited extent&mdash;it could even interfere with its purchases of raw materials&mdash; its management&mdash;capital structure&mdash; methods of selling and employment of labour.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for State owned and controlled industry under certain circumstances, but I do not believe that <Col N="832" /> any good case can be made for private enterprise controlled and managed by the State.</P>
    <P>This Bill fortunately did not become law, but its introduction was an unfortunate reflection on the efficiency at any rate of a part of Irish industry which did a good deal of harm.  I do not believe that Irish industry generally is inefficient.  The chairman of one of our largest distributing companies recently stated that, in the majority of cases, home manufactured goods were better value than those imported.  He added that new Irish industries had greatly helped to cushion the impact of rising prices.  I am satisfied that this statement is true and that most of the attacks which have been made in recent years have been quite unjustified.  The unfortunate Industrial Efficiency Bill provided a regrettable headline for these attacks on the efficiency of Irish industry, but members of all parties have made speeches which tend to create a want of confidence in Irish industry which was not based on facts.</P>
    <P>Until this year the present Government continued the system of price and profit control in force when they came into office.  It worked quietly and although it received little publicity manufacturers and traders knew that it was in force and that their profits were regularly examined.  The selling prices of a large number of articles were fixed either by a specific price or by a fixed profit margin.  In the case of many articles of clothing the profit permitted is considerably lower than that allowed for similar articles in Great Britain under a Socialist government.  I do not suggest that this system is entirely satisfactory, but its faults did not warrant the somewhat wild criticism indulged in by many persons, especially towards the end of last year when prices began to rise.</P>
    <P>When the Government appointed a new Prices Advisory Body I hoped that it would add to public confidence and co-operation.  It is too soon to pass judgement on its work, but the reports in the Press of the public sittings have disappointed me.  The object of an examination in public is not to <Col N="833" /> place manufacturers or traders in the dock, but rather to consider evidence which will assist in fixing a fair selling price having regard to all circumstances.</P>
    <P>The majority of manufacturers, whom I have consulted, are quite willing to co-operate in any fair system of price or profit control.  A great many of them recognise, as I do, that it is not only in their interest but also in the interest of the public that they should do so.  Some of them fear that confidential information which they have given to the Government may be made public, and thus given to their competitors.  I feel sure the Prices Advisory Body will respect the promises made by Ministers that this will not be done.  It is necessary that it should not be if you are to have the co-operation which I believe is necessary.</P>
    <P>In questions affecting supplies and industrial development generally there is a good deal of co-operation between the Government and Irish industry. The value of this co-operation is very great and, as a general rule, I think it is being carried out by satisfactory methods.  I feel that we need somehow to bring the same spirit of friendly co-operation into the question of price and profit control, and I believe it can be done, but it will take time and patience.  I would like to appeal to Deputies and Senators of all parties to use restraint in discussing this difficult question.  Successful and profitable industrial development is an essential part of our economy.  Let us be careful not to kill the goes that lays the golden egg by unfair or irresponsible criticism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is reported to have said that a fair test of the efficiency of Irish industry was its capacity to produce and sell in Ireland goods of equal quality at the same price as those goods were produced and sold in England or other countries.  In general terms, I agree with that statement, though I would prefer to say at the price at which similar goods can be sold in countries where conditions are similar and where the price of essential raw materials, wages and conditions of employment are substantially <Col N="834" /> the same.  An industry which is a large user of coal, for instance, may be handicapped in competition with a similar industry in England. In my opinion, Irish industry at the present time can stand up to that test better than ever before, and my advice to the Government is that industries which are producing quality goods at a competitive price should be left as free as possible from State interference. I have dealt with this question on this occasion, partly because of the debate in the other House on the Vote on Account and the way in which the matter was given publicity, and partly because I believe the problem of prices and profits has an important bearing on our whole economy and, in particular, on our capacity to meet the taxation which is necessary to pay for our estimated expenditure in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is late, I shall try to be brief, but I am sorry that such an important Bill as this should have to be taken in a hurry, as it gives us the one opportunity we have in the year to discuss calmly and without Party bias, if we wish, the political economy of the whole country.  The Minister is asking us for £29,375,120.  He is merely asking to-night for an instalment in order to oil the machinery to keep things going until ultimately he gets the total sum he is budgeting for, about £83,000,000, including what he proposes to borrow. He tells us to-night how much he wants on account and what he intends to do ultimately with the total amount of £83,000,000.  Not until later on will he tell us how he is going to extract that from us, but we may be certain that, however gently he goes about it, it will not be a painless extraction and none of us will like it.  Some people may think that, because Labour are always accused of wanting to nationalise everything, every time the Estimates go up it is a victory for Labour.  I think it is disastrous for any country that public expenditure should go up unless the public ability to meet it by increased production and increased prosperity generally is there to justify it.  I do not believe that State expenditure can ever be as <Col N="835" /> economic as expenditure by private individuals or groups of private individuals. State expenditure is the most wasteful form of expenditure that I know of.</P>
      <P>The economics of the Labour Party may seem to be unorthodox, but then we had an unorthodox training.  Yet, I find myself this evening practically in agreement with everything that Senator Professor George O'Brien has said.  We had to learn our economics and we had to study them.  It is one subject upon which no one can accuse us of being ignorant.  The trade union movement and the Labour movement forced its way forward by knowing something about economics.  Indeed, we knew more about real economics 20, 30, 40 and 50 years ago than the professors did.  What we were told by the textbooks and the university professors was wrong has now proved to be right, and it is the textbooks and the university professors that have had to change their tune; and we have been justified to a certain extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Professor O'Brien when he says that an increase in taxation on the import of luxuries would do three things: firstly, increase revenue; secondly, reduce the gap between our imports and our exports; and, thirdly, send up the cost of living.  Theoretically it might do all those things, but I imagine that if the tax were high enough to be revenue producing it would have the effect of limiting the importation of luxury goods, provided we could define what luxury goods are.  You would, therefore, collect over a smaller import practically the same amount of taxation which we collect at the moment from a low tax on luxury goods.  I do believe, however, that if there are luxury imports they should be taxed rather than essential commodities, even if those essential commodities be imported commodities.  By all means if we must raise money let us raise it on luxuries first, but the difficulty is to define what a luxury is.  One man's necessity may be another man's luxury, or, if I might put it this way, one maiden's necessity might be another maiden's luxury.  The State when it collects its taxes, whatever way it gets <Col N="836" /> them, and even when it borrows money is merely taxing Peter and Paul to subsidise Paul and Peter.  It amounts to no more than that.  One must have a staff to collect the money and a staff to distribute it and if £1 is collected the full £1 can never be distributed because a large proportion of it is lost in the process of distribution.  I believe &mdash;I may perhaps be accused of being an unorthodox Labour man&mdash;that we can go too far with State services for the community.  The more the State steps in and insists on doing for the people what the people should do for themselves the more we shall make our people thriftless and unprogressive.  I say that knowing exactly what it means and what it implies.  It is essential that certain things shall be done by the State for the public since otherwise they will be left undone; but I would prefer to see every member of the community willing and able to work for himself and for his family rather than that he should be prepared to exist in a state of semi-poverty to qualify himself for State assistance.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the money to be raised there is a sum of £2,000,000 for food subsidies, £3,500,000 for agricultural subsidies and an amount, which I have not calculated, for housing and other subsidies, plus a nominal sum for fuel subsidies.  Possibly they will amount to more than that.  But that bears out what I have been saying. That £5,500,000 has first to be collected and it has then to be given back to us in the form of subsidies.  It is inevitable that that should happen since subsidies have to be given for certain foodstuffs that cannot be purchased owing to the high price without a subsidy.</P>
    <P>One Senator spoke this evening about the import price of timber and sugar.  He pointed out that we are paying more for imported timber and sugar than we pay the producer at home.  I see nothing wrong in that. The timber from abroad and the sugar from abroad contain not merely the cost of production but also the cost of transport, the cost of rehandling and the cost of I do not know how many profits in the interval.  The price is an abnormal one because the situation is abnormal.  If it takes &ldquo;x&rdquo; to purchase <Col N="837" /> a lb. of sugar or a cubic foot of timber from abroad that does not mean that the producer here should get an identical sum for an identical article, no matter what it costs him to produce it.  Where we can produce cheaper than we can import we should produce, otherwise our economics are at fault.  If we can produce and pay the producer a reasonable price for his commodity and a price that is lower than that at which we can import the same commodity, it would be bad economy if we did not produce that article ourselves.  If we have to supplement home production temporarily by imports at a higher price that is no reason why the imported price should immediately become the home price. I think that type of false economy should be examined.  It can do a lot of harm.  If we argue that way, somebody else will argue the same principle in reverse: he will say that when we can buy sugar from Cuba at 1½d. per lb. then we will lower the price of sugar produced here to 1½d. per lb. and that argument would militate very seriously against the producer of beet here.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Professor O'Brien, if I understood him correctly, when he says he does not see any virtue in a savings campaign.  I am not sure if he said that exactly.</P>

      <P>Senator Professor O'Brien must blame himself and not me for mishearing him because he did not speak sufficiently loudly for his voice to carry.  I think one of the things we need most here is a savings campaign.  I think the State should undertake a savings campaign.  If more money were saved it would be an advantage since it would help to some extent to bring down prices because through the medium of a savings campaign we could overcome this disability of too much money chasing too little goods.  The tendency at the moment is to spend what you have because to-morrow will be another day. I know that it will be argued against any such campaign that there is no good in saving money when the value of the £ is falling and will continue to <Col N="838" /> fall; better spend your £ to-day when it is worth 15/- than save it up until the year after next when it may only be worth 5/-.  There is a good deal of talk about money losing its purchasing power and depreciating in value. Constant talk of depreciation will not induce anybody to save.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other things, and then I am finished.  Somebody suggested that the State should control the cost of living.  If it was not suggested here to-day, it has been suggested frequently in other places.  The State can control the cost of living only when it controls the standard of living.  The State cannot control my standard of living unless the State dictates to me what I may buy and what I may not buy.  That is a dangerous policy to go on.  The cost of living is always an argument that we bandy from one side to the other.  Perhaps the cost of living is going up; perhaps it is remaining stationary&mdash;I am not going to argue that point now.  I do know the standard of living is going up, and rightly, and I think it is a mistake certain people make sometimes when they base their arguments for better remuneration and better conditions, on the assumption that the cost of living is going up.  Let them be honest and say: &ldquo;We want a higher standard of living; we are entitled to it, and we will work for it.&rdquo;  The standard of living in this country has risen in my lifetime.  The cost of keeping up the standard of living has gone up.  It is quite a different standard of living from what it was years ago, because some of the goods regarded as necessaries now were not even thought about them.  Now we could not live without them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder will we, within any reasonable space of time, come to the point that Senator Douglas was talking about, when we will discover what are fair profits?  If he thinks it is not equally the interest of the employee as it is the interest of the employer to have a fair profit in an industry then he misjudges us.  Every worker must want to see the job he is engaged in pay a reasonable profit.  If it does not, it cannot pay wages.  But what is a reasonable profit?  You will never <Col N="839" /> discover it by setting up a commission and you will never discover what a reasonable profit is by setting up a prices tribunal.</P>
    <P>No matter how well-intentioned or informed the tribunal members may be, the fairest, the best, the surest and the quickest way to have an equitable profit in any industry is to do what has often been advocated and seldom tried&mdash;to see by some means, wherever it is practicable, that the workers will get a share in the management.  I know it has been ridiculed and denounced, but if you do not give the workers a share in the control and management of industry, then industry will never be efficiently managed; either the one side will mismanage it for one reason or another, or the workers themselves will neither have the knowledge nor the inducement to do what they could to improve conditions in that industry.</P>
    <P>If you do not give the workers some voice in the control of industry, where-ever it is possible, then you are forcing the State into a policy of nationalisation. Nationalisation is the only alternative way in which the workers will get a nominal voice in the control of industry.  If you do not allow the workers to have some control of industry, if that industry is nationalised you will lose your control of it and the workers, through their representatives, through the State, will control it wholly.  I do not think that is a good policy.  If you give the workers a share in the control and management of industry, you will be ensuring that they will take a greater interest in the work they are doing and they will be as anxious as you are to see that the industry pays its way.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient that the workers and the employers should come to an agreement as to what profits will be made.  All profits, or practically all profits, would disappear if there were not wage earners at one end of the scale.  Take the wage earners out of any factory and it will be as effective in closing it as if you were to take all the capital out of it.  But you can have the position in which workers and employers are both satisfied that they will get paid at the expense of the public, <Col N="840" /> if the price is too high.  That operates in monopolies.</P>
    <P>If we want to be serious about these things, there is not any reason, because we happen to sit on different sides of the House or because we come in here under different flags, one carrying the farmers' banner, another as the representative of the labourers and others as representing business interests, why there should not be a time when we can have a common interest and discuss these things together.  Such a time is afforded us in the consideration of this Central Fund Bill.  I think it gives us an opportunity, without trying to make Party capital, of saying things really worth while saying.  Even though the audience is small, somewhere, some of the opinions we give expression to many take effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas was held up for attempting to refer to what the Minister for External Affairs is reported to have said.  I will not attempt to go along that line.  I can imagine the words attributed to him having a completely different and justifiable meaning if one heard them as they were uttered, so let us not go into that to-night.</P>

      <P>Both Senator Douglas and Senator O'Farrell have spoken at some length of profits and prices control.  Senator O'Farrell, concluding his speech, spoke of the good that would result if the workers were given a say in the management and control of industry.  I can give one instance in which the worker has a particular say, and that is Córas Iompair Eireann.  Perhaps it is not long enough working to be able to judge or to give it a fair trial, but I do not see that there is any great improvement in it since we had Labour represented, the workers represented, on the management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the workers at present practically control the management of industry, because no industry can keep open at the present time if it does not play evenly with the men employed in it.  Senator O'Farrell mentioned that we have not monopolies here.  To my mind, we have monopolies here.  First of all, we have them in the way in which the workers <Col N="841" /> exercise control in industry.  We also have them in the way in which groups of manufacturers exercise control both in relation to output and prices.  I think we have monopolies also in respect of trade organisations.  I will put it this way, that the retail and even the wholesale traders get a reasonable profit from the articles that they market and sell.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas asked for a commission or a committee to examine the question of profits and prices control. To my mind, such a commission or committee could be much more usefully employed examining all the monopolies I have mentioned.  I have in mind now the position of trade organisations, trade union organisations and manufacturers' organisations in the matter of the control of industry.  I have a feeling that very often these organisations are used to get the greatest amount possible out of the industry, either for the workers or for the management, and it all comes in the end out of the consumer.  I am just mentioning these things as they come to my mind after listening to Senator Douglas and Senator O'Farrell.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan mentioned the increased prices that were paid for timber and sugar which came into this country from abroad.  Senator O'Farrell did not, I think, seems to get the idea Senator O'Callaghan had.  I think Senator O'Callaghan's idea in connection with the timber was that the Irish Timber Producers should get a fair price for the timber which was in our forests, that the prices paid for timber were not high enough and that if we were prepared to give a higher price to outside countries, at least, we should give a fair price to people who grew timber at home.  The same thing applied in connection with sugar, although I would remind Senator O'Farrell that Senator O'Callaghan stated that the farmers were agreeable and happy to produce large quantities of sugar beet because they were satisfied, more or less, with the agreement which the sugar factories made with them regarding prices.  He perhaps did suggest that a greater price still should be paid to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I listened to Senator Baxter and was glad to note that he had lost the pretty aggressive mood he had last year.  I felt that he was more or less on the defensive this year and that he actually in his speech made, what Senator O'Farrell would say, a sermon to us on this side of the House.  He told us on one occasion that we should pipe down on political propaganda and made a particular case that we should not concentrate on attacks on a particular Minister.  The particular Minister has, as he has admitted himself, a pretty vigorous tongue and if a man gives he should be prepared to take. I am going to give you two very recent statements of the same Minister.  One of them was in the Dáil on the seed and breed of a particular Deputy.  I thought it was a very ugly statement.</P>

      <P>I am just referring to this question that we should pipe down on attacks on Ministers, and I am going to give a reason why we may make these attacks.  When a group of milk producers in this country asked the Minister to receive them he is reported as having stated that he would not deal with these gentlemen at the end of a 40-foot pole; that they were a group of Fianna Fáil opportunists. From my own knowledge of these same gentlemen they were not Fianna Fáil supporters at all, but just that they did not happen to fit in with the Minister's idea of things.  I mention these things to ask Senator Baxter if he would direct some portion of his sermon sometimes to these Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that Senator Douglas stated that Deputies and Senators also should use restraint.  That is actually a quotation from what he said this evening.  He might very usefully have included Ministers in that statement because, to my mind, a goodly portion of the statement made by Senator Douglas this evening could have been addressed to at least one or two or, perhaps, three Ministers.  Why he <Col N="844" /> should concentrate on the ordinary Deputy and Senator I do not know because they are not the most vigorous in this matter of personal abuse at all.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas certainly gave one of the Ministers a pretty fair trimming this evening without mentioning him.  I was very glad, I must admit.</P>
      <P>I want to talk on the question of fuel.  Of course, the winter season is practically over.  Suggestions have been made to me and I have seen them made by public bodies that certain places should be made coal areas, and others recommended that they should be rationed.  The main thing we are concerned about is an abundance of fuel so that we will not be faced with a fuel shortage again.  Last year, Senator Baxter told us the farmers could not get their turf out of the bogs.  It would be pretty difficult to get the turf out of the bogs after June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a number of people who were accustomed to cutting turf.  It was because of the assurance they got from people who should be able to give these assurances that there was no danger of fuel shortages that they were careless about cutting turf last year.  The result was that they were going around with barrows looking for coal during Christmas time and January. Since then, coal has become more plentiful but the price has become so high as to almost make rationing unnecessary.  I was going to suggest that if coal is to be rationed it would be necessary at the same time&mdash; that is if coal is to be sold in areas with which I am acquainted&mdash;to introduce some system of subsidy for that particular article.  If that is not done I really believe that many of the people will not be able to purchase it. Rationed coal at 11/- per cwt. imposes too great a burden on poor <Col N="845" /> people.  I certainly think that, if the coal supply is limited, it should be rationed, and similarly with the turf supply, but, at whatever cost, the Government should see to it that it will be available at a price which the poorest of our people can pay.  It will be no hardship on the people who have money if they have to contribute in taxation to the cost of it, but it will be impossible for the poor people to buy it, if it is not done.  I do not know the conditions of turf production in the turf producing areas, but I hope abundant turf will be produced because we can now see that we must rely on what we produce ourselves if we are to keep the fires lighted next winter.</P>
    <P>Listening to Senator Douglas on the Prices and Efficiency Bill, I had the feeling that, if he were making a case for the Bill, he would do much better, and I felt that he would be more at home making a case for it.  He gave the extreme story of the civil servant being recommended by another group of civil servants and going to a factory and interfering and so on, if the article being produced was not up to a particular standard.  For many years, we have been listening to stories about the inferiority of certain products of Irish factories.</P>
    <P>All of us who were interested in the industrial revival were always anxious that these factories should produce goods as good as those produced elsewhere and at a price which would be reasonable, taking into consideration, as Senator Douglas puts it, the resources of the country and the reasonable needs of the workers employed. If we found that some factories were exploiting the people, were turning out inferior goods, perhaps not paying their workmen reasonable wages and were trying to extort too high a price for their articles, I do not think that any good industry, any industry which was doing the reverse would have any need to worry about that civil servant or the group of people advising him. I rather think that the number of factories affected would be very small and I think that the fears of Senator Douglas in that connection were more or less unnecessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> Senator Baxter spoke about not expecting the Minister for Agriculture to be a prophet and suggested that nobody could be a prophet on the matter of rain interfering with the production of wheat, milk or other commodities. He said it was most unreasonable to expect anybody to be a prophet, but, at the end of his speech, he made a prophecy which many people, hearing it, would laugh at, with regard to the result of a general election.  He made the prophecy that there was no hope of there being any change, if a general election did take place.  He became a prophet himself in that connection and I venture to suggest that he was a false prophet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>It always strikes me as curious that, each year, as we find the sum of money in the Book of Estimates increasing, it is said that the burden on the community is becoming unbearable, but yet, when we look at another set of figures purporting to give the national income, we find that the figures in the Book of Estimates seem to be moving most remarkably in step with the figure given for the national income.  For example, the amount in the Book of Estimates in 1942 was £38,000,000 and it is now £83,000,000.  The national income in 1944, the nearest year I can get, was £253,000,000 and is now £352,000,000. In 1938, the figure was £158,000,000, which gives a very rough idea that public expenditure is more or less moving with the estimated national income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure recently issued, we find some very interesting phenomena.  In Table 7, dealing with expenditure of personal income in the main categories in 1938 and 1949, we find a rise in food which is slightly over double.  Much the same ratio is to be found in relation to alcoholic beverages and tobacco but clothing, on the other hand, has increased nearly two and a half times.  I do not propose to weary the Seanad with all these figures, but, while some of these expenditures have doubled, the figure for gross personal rent has remained almost stationary.  Travelling has increased about four times and amusements <Col N="847" /> are over double.  The following table, Table 8, gives the same categories of personal expenditure calculated back to 1938 prices and virtually gives you the change in volume as between 1938 and 1949.  We find a slight increase in the volume of consumption of consumed goods at market prices.  There is an increase in food, but the biggest increases are in respect of services which, presumably, are less essential than food.  In other words, every item in this analysis tends to show that the consumption of nonessential goods and services has increased more than consumption of the essential ones.  I say that is all to the good.  That is a very firm indicator of a rise in the standard of living and it is something we should welcome.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I will go further into the information given in this White Paper on National Income but one should bear in mind, when complaints are made that the cost of living&mdash;not the cost-of-living index&mdash;has increased substantially over the years, that one should relate that to the movement over the period of the national income.  The burden of the cost of living on any individual is primarily a function of his income. Naturally, in a period when prices have changed, it is quite clear that the cost of living, measured in prices, cannot remain static and, unless the consumption is less, expenditure on goods and services must go up.</P>
    <P>I have one complaint to make about the Book of Estimates in that the ordinary Senator who is not an accountant finds the gravest difficulties in disentangling to-day the various subsidies that appear to be in operation.  They are hidden away in all sorts of curious places.  As they have reached a very substantial amount, I feel it is not quite right that they should be so obscurely hidden.</P>
    <P>If we take merely the so-called food subsidies, the subsidies on bread, flour, sugar, tea, butter and other items, they are, of course, in every sense of the word, purely consumer subsidies.  It is well to stress that point because, in the early days of the sugar-beet growing, clearly, it was the <Col N="848" /> farmer or the grower of sugar-beet who was assisted by way of subsidy and, for many years, sugar could have been bought from outside at a lower price than obtained in this country.  Now the reverse is taking place or, at any rate, let us say, so that there will not be an argument, you cannot buy sugar outside the country as cheap as it is manufactured in our sugar factories.  I think they claim that in or about £44 a ton, in bags, ex factory, is the home price of sugar of 98 polarisation.</P>
    <P>Recently, we find, by going into the open world market, that the various subsidies and stabilisation funds in respect of butter have, at any rate, ceased to be subsidies to the producer. Anything that is now paid comes in purely as a consumer subsidy.</P>
    <P>One would wish that the methods of dealing with bread and flour, the subsidy scheme and repayment scheme, was a little less obscure.  Some of us have tried to wade through the report but the more we delve into it the more difficult we find it is to see what is happening, how everything is working. The only feature that does emerge from that report which I think it is as well to draw attention to, is, that it seems to me that the method has been devised to secure a fixed return on the capital invested in flour mills and wheat mills irrespective of the efficiency or inefficiency of the concern. That is the only conclusion I can come to from reading the report.</P>
    <P>On the question of subsidies, this Government inherited from its predecessor a curious form of consumer subsidy, a subsidy down to a fixed price.  It was thought necessary that butter, sugar, and so on, should be always subsidised down to a certain price, and that policy has more or less continued.  I would very much like to hear the argument that seeks to justify subsidisation of any essential commodity down to a fixed price&mdash;in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, of course &mdash;at a time when prices are rapidly rising and, fortunately, at the same time, incomes are rising or, if one likes to regard it as such, when there is a change in purchasing power.  It seems to me that quite powerful arguments <Col N="849" /> are required to justify a method of subsidisation which attempts to fix a price at a constant level when everything else is moving rapidly.  However, perhaps it is an inherited characteristic that is unalterable.</P>
    <P>There are several other features of our financial position on which I should like to say a word or two.  I should like to deal with the question of the £30,000,000 gap between imports and exports, allowing for the invisibles, but not taking into consideration the £8,000,000 correction which the Minister for Finance told us was due to the change in the terms of trade. Suppose we take the values of agricultural exports and industrial exports in 1950.  In this calculation I am making, I am giving credit, as agricultural exports, to some things that are sometimes looked upon as purely industrial. There is portion of Guinness' exports, which is in the form of an agricultural product, and I am crediting agriculture with that.  This rough calculation shows that agricultural exports in value in 1950 were just about three times that of industry&mdash;£54.5 millions as against £15.9 millions.  If we look at the other end of the picture, the import figures, out of total imports of £160,000,000, £13.7 millions are indubitably imported for agricultural purposes and £146,000,000 for everybody else but including imports to people who are engaged in agriculture which are generally distributed.  What I want to bring out in these figures is that we have got this £30,000,000 gap; who is going to fill the gap?</P>
    <P>As I see things in agriculture, we have provided three times the exports that industry can claim.  Though I have not made any calculations, I should very much like to know what the raw materials imported for industry actually amount to.  Though our industrial production since the termination of the war has risen in a very remarkable manner, I should like to see if possible a more rapid rise in exports.  While the volume of agricultural exports has risen, to alter the volume of production of agriculture is a slow process; you can comparatively easily substitute one product for another in industry but you cannot make a rapid alteration in certain <Col N="850" /> classes of animals.  If we are going to fill this £30,000,000 gap in a reasonable amount of time, we cannot very easily fill it by means of export of agricultural goods because the growth is too slow.  If you could add 5 per cent. in volume per year you would be doing remarkably well.  If industry can fill that gap, seeing that it has some chance of rapid expansion, well and good, but surely what we should look to to-day is to see if it is possible to reduce some of these imports.  I think the Minister in his opening statement in the other House rather drew attention to the possibility that some of these imports could not be classed as essential commodities, that there was a considerable amount of imports that possibly were non-essential, and, in the light of the fact that we had this comparatively large adverse balance, he suggested that we should do something to close it. by restricting the imports of non-essentials. I think that if the public knew a little more about our position, that we were importing non-essentials, possibly a certain amount of curtailment in imports of that type of goods would come about, without having recourse to actual restrictive and prohibitive methods.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter I want to mention.  We have this large number of consumer subsidies.  I have asked to hear an argument for the justification of our subsidy down to a fixed price.  I am now going to refer to one other system of subsidisation which I should like to call the hidden subsidy.  Very appropriately it deals with hides.  I do not know exactly when the methods of keeping down the price of hides in this country was first devised, in order, as I am told, to assist boot manufacturers.  The boot industry may require assistance; I do not know but I do question the method, if my information is correct, of what I might call the hidden subsidy on hides.  There are one or two other cases where assistance is given to one section of the community or to one activity, in an obscure manner.  If we are to help an industry in its early stages or any section of the community at any time, I do not believe we should hide the process. We should make quite clear what is <Col N="851" /> being done.  I have been a rather long time complaining about this obscurity to the ordinary man in the strect who is not an accountant.  How much help the community at large is getting over these food subsidies is not made as plain as it should be.  We know it is difficult sometimes to find out what other help is being given to various activities of sections of the community or certain State services. We know it is difficult, sometimes, to find out whether State moneys are still being given to help some of our external companies.  I know that one can find that out by asking questions and making a study of it.</P>
    <P>I feel that it would be helpful, at any rate to Senators, if these matters could be put a little more clearly and brought a little more into evidence. One gets rather the feeling that sometimes there is something not quite nice about public money being given to assist in keeping down well, not food subsidies, but in sponsoring or helping certain activities.  I think we should know all about these things, and that the information should be easily available without putting one to the bother, first of finding out, and then asking questions.  Now that we have separated capital expenditure and current expenditure in the Book of Estimates, which has been of immense help to people in seeing how we stand, I think that these various devices of assisting one section of the community, or one type of activity should be shown quite clearly, so that there can be no confusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how far it is useful to have on this Bill a general discussion covering every phase of governmental expenditure.  It seems to be the practice with Senators to do that on this Bill.  That is quite understandable because of the fact that Senators have not the opportunity, which is given to Deputies, of dealing with the Estimates for the different Departments.  All the criticism in regard to different phases of governmental expenditure has to be listened to by one Minister even though he has no particular function in the actual administration of many of those Departments. <Col N="852" /> Since that is so, one wonders how far it is useful to have a discussion of this kind.  There may be the possibility&mdash;I would say it is a vain hope&mdash;that other Ministers will go to the trouble of reading the debates in this House, of wading through the filling up stuff, to get the facts in regard to the different points which Senators try to put across.  I think it would be too much to expect particular Ministers to do that.</P>
      <P>Even though that may be the position it is only natural to expect that Senators would be anxious to discuss this Bill since it affords one of the few opportunities they get of discussing different phases of Government expenditure. Strangely enough, when the Minister for Finance is before the Seanad with this measure it is his fellow Ministers who come in for all the criticism, while he himself seems to get off very nicely.  It is a pity, I think, that we cannot have more things to say to the Minister for Finance.  When I have criticism to offer an any matter, I would much prefer to criticise someone who is present than someone who is not.  I refer to that because some time ago we had people who entertained the hope that there was to be retrenchment in public expenditure.  In fact, it was held out by the present Minister for Finance as a thing which be believed in.  On a former occasion we had people who suggested in this House that the Minister was a wizard in finance, and that he would succeed in ensuring retrenchment in public expenditure. I do not want to pile it on to the Minister because I understand quite well that probably every member of this House is anxious to see public money spent.  One member may want money spent on one particular thing, and another member will advocate something else which will entail public expenditure.  Therefore, it is with a certain amount of sympathy that I criticise the Minister for not succeeding with his policy of retrenchment in public expenditure, due to the fact that he is being goaded on to increase expenditure, not only by members of this House but by members of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will not regard <Col N="853" /> that as unfair criticism.  We must admit that members of this House and of the other House have goaded on the Minister to increase public expenditure. The funny thing is that Senators who have applauded the Minister on a policy of retrenchment in regard to public taxation are to-day quite anxious, and are prepared to justify without any criticism at all, expenditure to an extent which is much greater than that ever before presented to the House, either by the present Minister or by his predecessor. That is the position, despite the fact that some of those people were quite anxious to use such a term as &ldquo;squandermania.&rdquo;  It is hard to coincide the two points of view.  While making that criticism of the Minister, I do admit that I am sure it is not easy to ensure retrenchment.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice on this Bill to refer to the activities of different Government Departments.  It would be hard to raise anything at this stage without traversing ground already covered in the debate.  Sometime ago, a Land Bill was brought to this House by the Minister for Lands Every time there is a charge of Ministers in the Department of Lands the new Minister, no matter who he may be or what Party he may belong to, is prepared to make statements which raise the hope again in the minds of certain people that there is going to be some real push put into the activities of the Land Commission.  People get the feeling that the activities of that Department are going to be much speedier than they had been in the past, but to me that seems to be the end of it.  During that particular debate, I had before me the report of the Land Commission.  Since the present Minister for Lands has come into office, we have heard him compare figures in relation to the amount of land handled or rearranged or resold in County Leitrim with those of other counties in the congested districts. Having heard the Minister, I had hoped that something would be done, but despite the fact that the Land Commission have officials working in County Leitrim, all they ever seem to do, in a very congested district where the <Col N="854" /> average poor law valuation is less than £10, is to rearrange small miserable patches of bog or land.  We hear statements by the Minister for Lands about the amount of land acquired, particularly in Leinster, by the Land Commission. I often wonder, and many people in County Leitrim often wonder, what has happened to this land.  I speak subject to correction, but as far as I am aware not one small farm of land has been allocated in the past three years to any applicant to relieve congestion in County Leitrim.  Can it be that all the talk is nothing but paper talk, and that the figures are fictitious?  Is the land acquired at all and, if it is acquired, who is getting it? It appears to me that County Leitrim has not so far got any measure of equity&mdash;nor has it in the past, for that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter severely castigated Senator Hawkins.  I always think and I cannot help thinking that Senator Baxter seems to think that he has a divine right to preach to or castigate other people.  I may say that I think he does it quite sincerely: That is my own opinion and others may have a different opinion.  However, he has taken it upon himself to castigate Senator Hawkins and he charged him with making political propaganda in connection with the question of imported butter.  Senator Baxter even suggested that it was wrong for Senator Hawkins to criticise or make any reference to the fact that the present Minister for Agriculture exported Irish butter from this country&mdash;which, apparently, suited the taste of the Irish people&mdash;and imported butter at a dearer price.  The taxpayer, I am sure, had to suffer a loss and the Minister for Finance cannot have been too happy about that arrangement either, because of subsidy commitments by his Department.  Apparently, Senator Baxter feels that Senator Hawkins is taking an unfair advantage of the situation by referring to that matter in this House or anywhere else.  If that be so, I wonder what we understand by the right of criticism in democracy.  Apparently the case was made that the facts as stated by Senator Hawkins were not so and that it was nothing but propaganda to suggest <Col N="855" /> that our people are more partial to home butter than to the imported article&mdash;leaving out altogether the question of price.  In reply to that criticism by Senator Baxter, I suggest that if the Minister for Agriculture or Senator Baxter want to test that matter, all the Minister has to do is to put the Irish butter on the ration and leave the foreign butter to be sold, even at the same price, in excess of the ration.  We should then see whether it would be sold or not.  I realise that that would mean a further commitment and in any event I know that it will not happen because the Minister for Finance would say that it would mean further expenditure in relation to the butter subsidy.  But if it were done, it would satisfy Senator Baxter as to whether what Senator Hawkins said in that connection was propaganda or not.  Surely it cannot be asserted that it is unfair criticism of a Minister for a member of this House to suggest that it was a bungled arrangement on the part of that particular Minister to export the butter from this country and to import foreign butter at a higher price.  If that is a matter that should not be raised here, I do not know what should be.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Senator Hawkins could be accused of unfair criticism or of any vulgar histrionics in his speech.  That charge might more easily be levied against certain Ministers&mdash;and not against the Minister who is here at present. Since vulgar exaggerated statements which have no foundation in fact can be made by Ministers, is it any wonder that members of this House, when they get a chance of replying, are bound to criticise these statements? One of the latest was a statement which I read in two newspapers in connection with the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association. It was reported in the newspapers that the Minister for Agriculture would not receive those people at the end of a 40-foot pole and that they were a Fianna Fáil ramp.  I happen to know the chairman of that organisation. He is from my part of the country and he is from the same county as Senator Baxter, who has a <Col N="856" /> keen interest in milk production, just as I have myself.  Mr. Fletcher of Killeshandra is the chairman of that organisation.  He may be a most excellent man in many ways, but I do not think that activity on behalf of Fianna Fáil would be a privilege that he would lay claim to.  I am sure he was not too happy when he read these statements which were reported in the newspapers to have been made by the Minister for Agriculture.  That sort of thing is bound to poison discussion and it is bound to make people reply in no uncertain manner.  I know the gentleman in question and I think that that statement was quite unfair.  With regard to the suggestion that the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association is an organised political ramp, it is difficult to understand what exactly the Minister meant when he used the word &ldquo;ramp&rdquo;.  I suppose it is better for all of us to take our own meaning.</P>

      <P>I do not say that, but I say that I do not think that Fianna Fáil could claim the gentleman in question as being a very ardent supporter of that Party.  I am not here particularly to make a case for Fianna Fáil.  I am interested in the activities of that organisation to a very mild extent and I cannot but think that the type of statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in that connection is quite wrong.  Have the farmers, or a particular branch of farming, not a right to band themselves together in a vocational organisation and to make a case for their particular branch of agriculture, irrespective of their political views?  Surely they are as much entitled to do so as are the members of the Medical Association, the members of trade unions in this country and the Bank Officials' Association. When any particular branch of agriculture band themselves together in that way, surely they deserve somewhat better treatment than to be painted as people who are trying to pull off a political stunt?  I am sure the Minister will agree quite readily <Col N="857" /> that they are entitled to a little more consideration than that.</P>
      <P>Since so much has been said about eggs I wonder if it is safe for me to mention them at all.  When the price of eggs was relatively fairly good and the price of feeding stuffs not as high as to-day, Senator Baxter applauded the Minister and now that things have gone in the other direction it was amusing to hear him trying to place the blame on the Minister's predecessor. In the long run the people of the country will be the best judges of whether the responsibility rests with the present or the previous Minister.</P>

    <P>Local authorities are now asked to produce a three-year supply of turf for their own requirements, and as a member of one I would tell the Minister that the local authorities irrespective of their political formation are not too happy about it.  Any surplus turf produced by county councils during the emergency was sold to Fuel Importers, and there was some indemnification with regard to price.  Now local authorities are specifically directed, to use the terms of the Department, not to farm out the work.  I believe it would be better for them to boost private production by maintaining roads leading into bogs and by drainage. They could assure the producers that they would get a good price and that the turf would not be left on their hands.  This would be better than the invidious position they are in at present, as the county councils have no indemnity now from the Government. This method would be more economic for the county councils, and the producers would be working for <Col N="858" /> themselves.  If the turf was of good quality the officers of the county council could take it, but if it were improperly harvested they could leave it with the producer until it was harvested.</P>
    <P>People in the West think that this scheme is designed to make self-employed people employees of the county council, and also to make them organisable workers.  Bord na Móna is prepared to pay a wage higher than is normally paid by county councils, because they are better organised and more concentrated.  Bord na Móna operates mainly in County Kildare, and if Kildare County Council proposed to produce turf on their own account, paying a lower wage, the Minister may guess how long the workers would work for them.  The Minister is a man of some experience, more experience in many things than I have, and he can also guess if the workers in Kildare struck for higher wages and their demands were met, how long it would be until a similar demand was made to Leitrim, Sligo and Longford County Councils.  This seems to be an attempt to make present proprietors workers for local authorities in such a way that they will become organisable from a labour point of view, and that, in my opinion, is not a good thing.  Private production would be far better.  You would get a better article, and a better output, as the people would be working for themselves.</P>
