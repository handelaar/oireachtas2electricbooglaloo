    <P>I have to acquaint the House that I have received a letter from Deputy J. Finan informing me that he has been elected a member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have also received a letter from the Department of External Affairs expressing the gratitude of the Portuguese Chargé d'Affaires to Seanad Éireann for their resolution of sympathy on the occasion of the death of President Carmona.</P>

    <Title>Collection of Taxes (Confirmation) Bill, 1951 (  Certified Money Bill ) Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises from the occurrence of a general election in the period between the Budget and the passing of the original Financial Resolutions and the passing of the Finance Bill.  The House will understand that it is not part of the ordinary procedure of the Oireachtas in regard to Finance Bills that we should have a Bill of this sort, but certain of the resolution to which I have referred were given effect for a limited period under the Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, which Act provides that, in the event of a dissolution, certain of these resolutions would cease to have statutory effect.  It is necessary, therefore, to have a measure of this sort enacted by the Oireachtas in order to give continuing effect to the resolutions, to revive them and also to regularise and make legal everything which was done under the Resolutions during the period between the dissolution of one Dáil and the meeting of the next.  It is desirable that the Bill should be enacted at the earliest possible moment and I ask the Seanad to give me not only the Second Reading but all Stages to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonable that the Minister should get all stages to-day.  The Bill merely puts the Budget Resolutions back in the position they were in before the dissolution. I do not know whether the particular section of the 1927 Act was inserted to keep Governments from dissolving in the period between the Resolutions and the passing of the Finance Bill, but it has occurred on more than one occasion.  This is, in effect, a machinery Bill to enable taxes to be collected and the Dáil to get on to the Finance Bill which will be open for discussion when it comes up.  I agree with the Minister that we should pass all stages of the Bill to-day.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>
      <P>Bill passed through Committee, and reported without recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make an inquiry at this stage?  Must we always have legislation <i>ad hoc</i> on a matter of this kind?  Would it not be better to have some kind of legislation which would always cope with a situation like this&mdash;I am not quite clear as to whether that would be feasible&mdash;and save us from bringing in more Bills of this nature at a later period when the same situation arises?  Can I have the Minister's views on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that I made it quite clear to the Seanad that the need for this Bill arises out of a provision of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927&mdash;Senator Hayes also dwelt on that fact&mdash;and in order to obviate the need for a measure of this sort it would be necessary for us to amend the original Act, that Collection of Taxes Act, by deleting the proviso that the Financial Resolutions would cease to have statutory effect in the event of a dissolution occurring before they had been reported and embodied in the Finance Act.  As the Senator will see, there may be objections to that course and, while it would have the advantage of relieving both Houses of the Oireachtas of the need to pass a Confirmation Bill, in the circumstances in which we are dealing with this measure there would be, I think, on the other hand, rather more serious objection to deleting the provision from the Act of 1927, that is, from a constitutional point of view.</P>

    <Title>Government Loans (Conversion) Bill, 1951  (  Certified Money Bill )&mdash;  Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessitated by the fact that our predecessors in government decided to convert four national loans which may <Col N="1122" /> be redeemed at the option of the Government some time in the year 1950. The decision to carry through this conversion operation was taken by our predecessors, the conversion offer was made on the 8th June and the time for making decisions as between redemption and conversion will formally end on the 7th of next month.  The principal object of the Bill is to clear the way for trustees, executors and administrators to accept the conversion offer.  Certain of the stocks are of course, an authorised trustee investment under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, but in case a trustee should be in any doubt as to his right to accept this stock rather than accept cash and then look around for a more acceptable investment, the Act will provide that these trustees and others, acting in a fiduciary capacity, shall have express authority to accept the conversion.</P>
      <P>That is the principal purpose of the Bill and I shall be very grateful again if the House would be good enough to give me, not only the Second Reading to-day, but all stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which the previous Government would have introduced if it had been in office and it illustrates the principle that in connection with people who loan money to the State there can be continuity of Government policy.  For this reason, I again agree with the Minister&mdash;we are having a marvellous time in agreeing to-day&mdash;not only about the Second Stage, but the other stages.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed, to take the remaining stages now.</P>

      <Col N="1123" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm an order under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act which was made by our predecessors, enlarging and expanding the scope of an originally protective duty on electrical storage water heaters.  These electrical water heaters are manufactured by the A.E.T. in Dunleer, County Louth.  That firm has enjoyed protection for electrical water heaters and electrical storage heaters up to a capacity of 28 gallons.  They have recently enlarged their activities and are now in a position to produce these storage heaters in sizes up to 100 gallons capacity and we are informed that they are in a position to meet the full requirements of the market for these sizes.  Accordingly, it has been decided that the scope of the duty should be extended now to cover the range of sizes which the company is in a position to produce.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take the remaining Stages now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it too late to ask the Minister whether he has any assurance that, if this duty is imposed on imported water heaters, the home-manufactured articles will be sold at competitive prices?  Have we any guarantee that when the firm has got this monopoly the prices to the consumer will not become prohibitive?  I am in favour of protection wherever it can reasonably be given, but I should like an assurance that when you do give protection you will get an efficient article at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if only one firm is concerned in the manufacture <Col N="1124" /> of these articles?  Is one firm getting the virtual monopoly in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that I have not put the Seanad under a misapprehension as to the actual position of the firm to which I referred as the manufacturer of these articles.  At the moment only one firm manufactures electric storage water heaters up to a capacity of 100 gallons, but that firm has no monopoly except such as arises from the fact that no other firm had the enterprise to go into production and compete for the Irish market.</P>
      <P>On the point about which Senator O'Farrell asked for some information, I should like to say that in consequence of the expansion of its activities as a result of this additional protection, this firm actually reduced its prices in May last so that they compare very favourably with the prices charged in February, 1950.  It has been able to do that, notwithstanding the fact of which the House is, no doubt, aware, that there have been considerable increases in the prices of copper and other raw materials which this firm requires for its products.  The present position, I understand, is that the home-manufactured article compares very favourably indeed in price with the imported article.  In fact, the larger-sized storage heater which the firm is selling here is being sold at two-thirds of the price at which a corresponding article was listed in the catalogue of outside manufacturers.</P>

      <P>I am very thankful to the Minister for his explanation. The reason I asked the question was, first of all, to get the information I have got and, secondly, to anticipate any adverse comment that might be made.  The tendency sometimes exists to say of protection that, sheltered behind that protection, one finds inefficiency and over-charging.  I do not share that view, and I wanted to give the Minister the opportunity of saying that this state of affairs does not exist in this case.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the Bill be returned to the Dáil.</P>
