The Minister for Education will be in attendance.  I think Senator Counihan is not available, so that motions Nos. 3 and 4 will not be taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; in <Col N="568" /> line 45, to the end of the sub-section and substitute the following words: &ldquo;the passing of this Act shall cease to hold office on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is merely a drafting amendment.  I think it will be an improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the amendment, I understand from the other section that immediately on the passing of this Bill the city manager takes over and, therefore, the committee will not exist.  I suggest that Senator Quirke's amendment be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of the Bill is that on this Bill becoming an Act, the present committee ceases to hold office.  The powers and duties are transferred to the city manager and on the appointed day the new committee will take over.  Senator Quirke's amendment is necessary to cover the position during the interim.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment because it is considered that it brings the section into line.  Section 2, sub-section (2), would then read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;During the period commencing on the date of the passing of this Act and ending on the appointed day all the powers, duties ....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg leave to state that I am not moving the first amendment standing in my name.  I know that in those circumstances I am not in a position to discuss the amendment <Col N="569" /> in any way, but I think the House deserves an explanation as to my reason for withdrawing that amendment. My idea in introducing this amendment was to provide, so far as possible, a safeguard for some of my professional brethren.  I thought they might be harshly treated under this section and by inference perhaps it might defend the present committee in certain of their activities.  In view of the document which emanated from the committee and published in to-day's Press, I fear I cannot go any further with that proposed amendment. I am supporting this Bill.  It is a sound Bill and is going to be an effective Bill.  It will succeed in removing certain irregularities and systemising the state of affairs existing in the Meath Hospital.  In this document which emanated from the committee this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 10, to delete the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;staff&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a purely technical amendment. Sub-section (2) states that on the occurrence of certain vacancies on the medical board certain statutory methods have to be employed for filling the vacancies.  The medical boards of the general hospitals in traditional and in common usage consist of the senior surgeons and physicians in those hospitals.  The board does not include assistant surgeons or specialists, for the reason that these hospitals are not specialist hospitals but general hospitals. The section, as it stands, therefore, does not direct the authorities of the hospital in the methods they employ in <Col N="570" /> appointing, for instance, assistants or specialists.  Nowhere in the section is there any provision for the appointment of assistants or specialists.  The term &ldquo;staff of a hospital&rdquo; means all the medical men connected with the working of the hospital.  It includes the board, but the term &ldquo;board&rdquo; does not include the staff, and I think that the substitution of the word &ldquo;staff&rdquo; for &ldquo;board&rdquo; would cover the intention in the mind of the draftsman.  I think it is merely a question of drawing his attention to the definite distinction between the medical board of a hospital and the medical staff.  The section provides the machinery for the election of members of a board, but does not take any cognisance of vacancies in the general medical staff, including assistants and specialists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I consulted the Chairman of the Dáil Committee on this matter, and also the draftsman. The intention of sub-section (2) is to deal with the medical board, that is, the senior honorary life physicians and surgeons of the hospital.  Heretofore, vacancies on the board were not advertised. Sub-section (2) provides that, in future, they will be advertised and that the members of the medical board will have an opportunity of making recommendations to the committee and that the committee will then appoint to the board.  That sub-section deals with the board exclusively.</P>
      <P>On the other question raised by Senator Barniville, the question of the staff, these assistants and other physicians and surgeons who are on the staff but not on the board, the committee constituted under this Bill will have power to appoint them.  That power is in the Act of 1898 and it is quite clear that the committee will have power to appoint staff.  This sub-section introduces a new matter with regard to the board, that the vacancy will have to be advertised, and, having considered a report of the medical board, the committee will make the appointment in future.  The medical board heretofore made the appointment themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from that statement of Senator Hayes that, <Col N="571" /> in future, all appointments to the staff will be made by the joint committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHayes1927" hpid="Mr. S. Hayes Mr. S. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What then is the position of the existing committee? According to the courts and various statements made in the Dáil, these people have been properly appointed and they are not to have any say in the making of medical appointments. Are we to get back again to the old position in which we had appointments made by methods about which we do not like to talk?  Are we to have a position that the people already constituting the committee are to have no say at all in appointments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the Senator's question is relevant to this sub-section.  The sub-section deals with appointments to the medical board and quite clearly gives to the committee power to appoint to a vacancy on the medical board after considering the report from the medical board, which seems to be in accordance with common sense.  With regard to the staff generally, as Senator Colgan has indicated, the committee will appoint the staff by such methods as they may think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure about this.  It distinctly states here that the medical board shall consist of the physicians and surgeons of the hospital.  Am I to take it that assistants to these physicians and surgeons are part and parcel of the medical board?  It is questionable. What I want to see is the joint committee having power to appoint all staff, medical and otherwise.  I do not want a position, as I am afraid will be the case, in which, if we leave in &ldquo;board&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;staff&rdquo;, certain doctors&mdash;specialists or assistants &mdash;can be brought into the hospital without the authority of the joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing can be done in this hospital when this joint committee has been appointed without the authority of the joint committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee is set up to govern the hospital.  This sub-section is a limitation of the power heretofore exercised by the medical board and transfers the power of appointment from the board to the committee of the hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the medical board is defined as the physicians and surgeons of the hospital. Is that term all-embracing in so far as medical and surgical staff are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; if it is not, it means that somebody can be appointed without the authority of the board, because the committee only gets authority to appoint the medical board.  There obviously will be&mdash;I am not a medical man, but Senator Barniville will probably put us right with regard to this&mdash;certain types of people in the hospital, doctors and surgeons, who are not part and parcel of the medical board and who will come for a period and go after a while.  There will be others with special qualifications who will be brought in.  I am afraid that under this Bill what happened before will be allowed to continue and that people will be appointed to the hospital without the knowledge of the joint committee who will be told that under the legislation they have no concern with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator reads the Bill as a whole, he will see that it is perfectly clear that the committee has complete power over the hospital, subject only to law and to any restrictions imposed by this Bill and it is clear also, if he looks at Section 7, that the joint committee can make by-laws which would be binding.  The one outstanding exception is that, if they want to appoint a person who is to be a member of the medical board, they still appoint him, but, before doing so, they must carry out the provisions of Section <Col N="573" /> 3.  In other words all appointments are made by the committee, including the medical board, but there is a restriction in relation to the medical board in that they are bound by the Bill to advertise and hear what the medical board has to say about those who apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Senator for the logical way he has put it, but I suggest that logic is not law, and it is not what we think here or feel that matters but what the interpretation of the sub-section subsequently will be.  I am not satisfied yet, even though the intention of us all is to give complete control to the joint committee.  I am not satisfied that, under this provision, the joint committee has complete control over the medical staff.  It has only got control in relation to advertising and recommendation from the medical board.  It has power only in relation to the medical board and not in relation to other personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands means that, where a vacancy occurs on the medical board, a certain procedure must be adopted.  The vacancy must be advertised, an examination held and the person or persons to be appointed recommended to the committee by the medical board.  The amendment goes much further and suggests that any persons appointed to the staff should be appointed in the same manner, that is, advertising of the post, recommendation by the medical board and appointment by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Colgan wants is to have it assured under the Bill that the committee of the hospital shall be supreme in all matters of appointment.  Under sub-section (2), it seems to me that that is assured.  I can quite understand the committee acting in this way: if a vacancy occurs in the hospital, it would expect the medical board to consider that vacancy, to consider what qualifications should be expected of an applicant for the position on the board, and, having considered the qualifications and having considered the <Col N="574" /> applicants, the board would make a recommendation to the committee of the hospital.  I take it that the committee under this section is not bound to accept the recommendation of the medical board.  It will have to pay attention to their recommendations, but, if it thinks well of it, it need not appoint any person recommended by the medical board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the position, I do not think there is any reason for us to have any fears or feel uneasy about the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could give Senator Colgan this further information which might assist him.  Sub-section (2) does not contain all the powers of the committee of the hospital. It merely concerns one particular thing, namely, the appointment of members to the medical board.  As a matter of fact, it makes a change&mdash;of which I think Senator Colgan is entirely in favour&mdash;with regard to the appointment of members of the medical board.  But the power of the committee over the staff is inherent in the committee under the Act of 1898 and, under Section 17, it can make such regulations as it pleases for the governing of the hospital, including the appointment of staff.  I understand that this sub-section was inserted as a result of the decision of the committee in the Dáil that the medical board could not continue to reproduce itself, that vacancies must be advertised and that the medical board would make recommendations but, as Senator Ó Buachalla has said, these need not be accepted.  With regard to the staff, there is no suggestion that anybody but the committee can appoint the staff.  Under the 1898 Act and under this Bill the appointment of staff is a matter for the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Senator Hayes to define, and it would not be easy to do so, what is &ldquo;staff&rdquo; and what is not &ldquo;staff&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that it does not matter how they are defined.  It is quite clear in the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryBarniville" hpid="Dr. Barniville Dr. Barniville">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Barniville</NameTxt>
      <P>These last remarks of Senator Hayes have perturbed me more than anything else which he has said previously&mdash;that the committee is all-powerful.  Surely they are governed by some statutory direction.  I sympathise with Senator Colgan's doubts and difficulties and I do not think that Senator Hayes's reply has been in any way satisfactory.  This section deals with vacancies arising on the board. Vacancies arising on the general staff must be dealt with in the same way. We are told that the committee will be all-powerful.  That means that they can make these appointments without going through the machinery laid down for appointment to vacancies on the board.  In other words, to reduce it to absurdity, it is quite possible that an all-powerful committee might hear of a very brilliant man in America&mdash;a particularly good man in his own department&mdash;and they might take it upon themselves that they had sufficient influence to invite him as assistant to the Meath Hospital, without going through the statutory methods laid down under this section for appointments to the medical board. That is the sort of thing I want to avoid.  If this committee is all-powerful it should, nevertheless, carry out the appointment of all members of the staff of the Meath Hospital according to certain statutory regulations, similar to or identical with those they have to go through in respect of the appointment of members to the medical board.  I want to safeguard the appointment of specialists and assistants in the Meath Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In my endeavour to satisfy Senator Colgan, I went too far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not satisfy anybody. This section concerns only the medical board.  The appointment of staff, I assume, will be done by the joint committee, in consultation with the medical board, with the senior surgeons and physicians of the hospital.  A <Col N="576" /> committee which does otherwise must be very extraordinary and unusual.  I know that the committee has power to appoint the staff and I assume that they will appoint them after consultation with the medical board.  But this particular sub-section was inserted by the Committee in the Dáil in order to deal with the question of the medical board which, under a section of the Act of 1815, was able to reproduce itself. This sub-section deals with that point. It does not concern the staff at all. Senator Ó Buachalla wants the insertion of a similar section with regard to the staff.  Is that what he wants? Surely there is hardly any doubt that a committee, running a hospital, would not appoint doctors without consulting the medical board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryBarniville" hpid="Dr. Barniville Dr. Barniville">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Barniville</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Barniville and myself have grave doubts as to whether this section will ensure that the point which we are making will be covered, namely, that nobody can work in the Meath Hospital or do any business whatsoever there without the authority and knowledge of the joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about assistants and specialists but no one can answer my question.  I do not believe that they are covered by the term.  You will have the position that people will be brought in to assist physicians and surgeons&mdash;people who will, probably, be quite all right in their own way. However, it is suggested that if that is done it should be done with the authority and, particularly, with the knowledge of the joint committee.  As I see it, the word &ldquo;staff&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;board&rdquo; is simply for greater clarification and to ensure that all people who are acting professionally in the Meath Hospital, and others&mdash;even the porter or the engine driver&mdash;will be there with the authority and knowledge of the joint committee.  I suggest that under this section as it is at present drafted any doctor in the <Col N="577" /> Meath Hospital could bring in an assistant to help him and he could have him there for months and years&mdash; and he could snap his fingers at the joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that two points have been raised which are queering the pitch.  One is the uneasiness of Senator Colgan that the committee will not have a final say in all the appointments.  I am not going to try and persuade him in regard to that matter.  I am satisfied that, in every appointment, the committee has the final say.  Senator Barniville's point is somewhat different.  He recognises that it is desirable that there should be advertisement and consultation with the medical board before any appointment is made on the board.  If I understand him correctly, he also wants to provide that where there is appointment to the staff the same procedure should be followed.  I think that is what Senator Barniville wanted to secure by this amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator M. Hayes, who is a purist in these matters, says it is necessary to put in a section dealing with the medical board and the more correct way to deal with this matter would be to put in a different section covering staff.  I think that the better way to deal with it would be to put in the words &ldquo;for medical staff or other staff notwithstanding&rdquo;.  I believe the House would be wise in putting in the words I have mentioned; then if it is necessary the matter could be dealt with in a more elaborate form at a later stage. That would ensure that where appointments of staff are being made they will have to be advertised and the medical board will have to be consulted.  That would not take away, but rather it would ensure that the committee would have control of appointments.</P>

      <P>This sub-section was put in because there happens to be an Act of 1815 dealing with the Meath Hospital.  In that Act there is provision made whereby the medical board of the institution are the physicians <Col N="578" /> and surgeons of the hospital or infirmary, and they have full powers to make appointments in their own ranks. This sub-section is put in to prevent that from happening again.  It does not concern staff nor does it take from the powers of the committee.  It is simply put in to deal with the position arising under the Act of 1815.  The committee has full power over the staff, and I think the matter raised in the amendment should be dealt with in another way.  I am satisfied that this sub-section should be left in its present form to accomplish the things it is intended to accomplish.  I think that by the Act of 1898 and this present Bill the committee has full powers over all staff going into the hospital.  Senator Barniville is apparently afraid the committee will appoint members of the medical staff without consulting the board.</P>

    <P>I think this is a matter which was overlooked by the Select Committee when they were considering this Bill. They thought it well to have the joint council of county councils a nominating body to this board.  I believe it was an oversight that they did not include in the nominating bodies the Association of Municipal Authorities who are a nominating body to this House just in the same way as a joint council of county councils.  We think in view of that that the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland should also have the powers of a nominating body on this joint board.  I think Senators should unanimously agree to this amendment.  After all the county councils in this country contribute a very large sum of money to the maintenance and upkeep of hospitals in the City of Dublin including the Meath Hospital and those who pay the piper should have some means of calling a tune.  Many of the members of this House come from rural Ireland and I would ask for their support of this amendment.  There is no reason why it should not be accepted by the House.  As I have said I think it was merely something that was overlooked by the Select Committee.</P>

That is a grave reflection, I think, on the people in the Meath Hospital.  I am surprised to hear there is a large number, but it must be rather large when Senator O'Callaghan insists on having representation from Cork County and Borough Council.  I am astonished to hear of people coming to Dublin for serious operations or additional interviews with physicians as we have two very fine county hospitals in Cork City, and some very famous physicians and surgeons there too.  I do not at all agree with my fellow countyman that we require a whole lot of medical and surgical help from Dublin.  There are famous specialists in Dublin I know, but there are some famous specialists in Cork, too, and I have never heard yet that the trek of patients from Cork City and County is of such a volume that it would necessitate an amendment in the Bill to provide for the councils of Cork.</P>

      <P>The Senator's mind is big enough, I am sure, to see that the country does not end at the end of the old tram lines.  Because of the lack of facilities the congested districts of rural Ireland have to send patients to Dublin.  Otherwise there would be no need for all the hospitals and institutions there are in Dublin at the moment.  It is necessary because you will have an accumulation of surgical and medical skill in a city like this which you will not have elsewhere. Many patients are sent by local authorities at the public expense of the ratepayers in those counties.</P>

I press once again that there is a distinction between an <i>ad hoc</i> payment for each patient and a general contribution from the rates to the hospital. The principle of election at the moment seems to be that those bodies which make a direct contribution to the hospital are represented.  Why should we introduce the other class, those who perhaps have to come to the hospital but pay simply <i>ad hoc</i>?  I may be wrong in that.

The problem we have to resolve it to determine how many public health authorities are not represented on the General Council of County Councils, who send patients and who pay for them out of public funds.  How many of these authorities are there?  Is Dún Laoghaire an independent health authority apart from the Dublin Corporation?  Somebody should be able to tell us that.

Senator Fitzsimons knows that his county council administers the health services in the urban areas.  In so far as urban authorities have their health services administered for them by the county councils, those municipal authorities are represented through the General Council of County Councils.

      <P>Some of the Dublin Senators may not be aware of the fact that the Dublin hospitals serve the country to an extent which is not appreciated or understood by Dublin residents.  There is a particular hospital in the city in which at the moment there may be 20 patients from my county, paid for by the Cavan health authority.  Senator Fitzsimons may have knowledge of many Meath patients being treated in the Meath Hospital.  I am inclined to think that in so far as these municipal health authorities, independent health authorities, make a contribution from the rates to the maintenance of patients in a Dublin hospital, they ought to have some opportunity of having a voice in the control.  The difficulty is to measure how much they should have, whether one or two members. It is obvious that they are not completely covered by the section giving representation to the General Council of County Councils.</P>

      <P>I think there is a lot to be said for Senator Fitzsimons's amendment and for Senator Clarkin's amendment, but I can see considerable difficulties, too.  Senator Stanford was not quite right in what he suggested was the position.  Some people from the area covered by a local authority pay their own expenses.  In some cases, the local authority pays all the expenses; in other cases, they pay a portion, in proportion to the financial position of the person concerned. There is a good deal to be said for giving representation to the municipal authority, but if we decide to do so, as Senator Fitzsimons said, the question might arise then about the various municipal authorities who are not already included in the Municipal Authorities Association.  They may say that if town No. 1 is represented, town No. 6 should get separate representation also.  There is something to be said for the amendment and it warrants examination.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a case here of much ado about nothing. What we are really concerned with is the efficiency of the hospital, to see that patients can go there.  Even if we add these two, I do not believe it will make a fundamental difference.  The only reason why I am inclined to oppose the amendment is that I think Senator Quirke is right, that if you start to work it out on pure theory it will involve difficulties.  This is a Private Members' Bill and was considered in Select Committee.  It would be most unfortunate if it were held up now, to be readopted in the Dáil and come back again to us, on a matter which is not fundamental.  Whether these two are added or not, it will mean nothing to the effectiveness of the committee.  In the circumstances, I would vote against the amendment, though I have no strong feeling in the matter, nor can I see grounds for enthusiasm in respect of having two additional members.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that you cannot work it out on abstract theory.  Even if we had all the information&mdash;and there is no one here who can give a first-hand contribution&mdash;as Senator Quirke says, this cannot be worked on abstract theory.

The two people appointed under it, if they do no good would do no harm. As Senator Douglas said, it is a trifling matter.  People resident in Dublin may have had active interest in the Meath Hospital stimulated for a while. There are people in the country who have not had an active interest, but now that the board is being reconstituted under this Bill, it is only reasonable to expect a desire amongst representatives in this House who come from the country, that reasonable representation should be given to such <Col N="587" /> authorities, as is set out in this amendment.

I do not think that you will have endless jockeying for position between Naas and Longford or between any two towns.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Baxter's point, I think he is quite right.  I know that he, like myself, has no particular interest in the municipal bodies, but as to the amount of representation, whether it should be one or two, it would be rather undesirable to have one representative from the municipal bodies and two from the General Council of County Councils. There is bound to be a certain amount of friendly rivalry between the two bodies, and it would hardly be a good standard to set.</P>

The Dublin County Council contributed a large sum of money at one time, I think £5,000.  It is now contributing £1,000.  The Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation are given representation.  I doubt that many people come from Cork City to Dublin, although some do for one particular specialised operation which takes place in the Meath Hospital under a surgeon whose name has already been mentioned.  However, the matter is not of any great importance.  I would be inclined to draw a different conclusion from the last Senator's remarks.

There is divided opinion as to whether we should have one or two from each of these bodies.  I would suggest that we leave the Bill as it is and that the General Council of County Councils, when nominating their two members, nominate one of them even from their own members who is a member of one of the municipal authorities.  That would solve a lot of our difficulties, as both bodies would then be fully represented.</P>

I think there is no reason why this House should not be unanimous and give us the two I am pleading for.</P>

    <P>Provision is made in this Bill for the setting up of a committee consisting of <Col N="590" /> 23 members to govern this hospital.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has given the answer himself.  Section 17 empowers the joint committee to make by-laws, rules or regulations with regard to patients &ldquo;and for the better government of the hospital or any matter relating thereto&rdquo;.  It is presumed that they also have power to fix a quorum, and, for my own part, I feel that, when we set up any kind of body, the more freedom we leave it with regard to its own procedure and the less rules we lay down in the statute, the better.  The committee will be in a better position to determine what quorum it wants.  I rather think that seven is the number they would select, but I would rather leave them freedom with regard to it than to impose it upon them in the Bill. Perhaps it is a different way of looking at the same thing.  Senator Hawkins merely wants to improve the Bill, but the committee will have power to elect its chairman and its vice-chairman and will have power to make its own rules and it should be left to fix its own quorum.</P>

If that were the case, it is a pity that something could not be done about it.  On the other hand, I am sure that the Select Committee must have noticed the apparent weakness of this sub-section.  If it did, and if it considered it, I should be prepared to let it go, but it does not seem reasonable that people should have the right to buy a right to vote, which is what seems to me to follow from the section. Whether people would do that, in view of the change in the method of management and so on, is another matter.</P>

      <P>We must consider the practical implications of this.  It was simply a way of raising funds for the hospital, only it became rather too competitive at a certain stage and that is perhaps why the changes were introduced, but it is the practice in all hospitals to induce people to subscribe by giving them a modicum of power.  If the modicum of power becomes something rather more, perhaps a change has to be made, but in this case there seems to be no fear that there will be any more than a modicum of power.  It is merely a decoy to extract fees of two guineas on a fairly large scale and that seems harmless enough.</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the old law and I am not certain what the position is, but I am inclined to think that Section 17 would empower the committee to make the subscription five guineas or ten guineas, if they thought fit.  I am raising that as a point and not giving an opinion.  The real crux of the matter is the likeli hood of people suddenly subscribing two guineas, five guineas or ten guineas to get four people elected and one feels that one need not worry very much about that.  The Senator would be perfectly right in other conditions and I think his point is one of some interest.  It is not clear in the measure how it is provided, and, if it is not clear, it must be governed by the old Act&mdash;and I do not think any of us would be able to get through it in time &mdash;and, if not, it is covered by Section 17.</P>

      <P>I made some mild protest <Col N="593" /> about this section on the Second Reading, and the more I study it, the more absurd it seems to me.  It may be that the circumstances which brought about the introduction of this measure made inevitable the production of some grotesque plan like this, because that is really all it is.  Let somebody else defend it as being worth while or necessary.  We have a situation where these subscribers or governors are to be in a position to nominate four representatives on the joint committee or board of management. Four people, I suggest, can pay their subscriptions and these four people can be constituted an electorate and can nominate themselves to this joint committee, so far as the section goes.</P>
      <P>I can see Senator Stanford's point, and I accept that it is a factual presentation of the whole conception of the government of the hospital in the past, but I am sure he will agree that that is with the past and that we are not very likely now to have very many people coming forward with their two guineas subscription, even in an election year. The whole constitution of the board is now altered by this legislation, and while, in the first year, you might have a little of the competitive spirit left, by degrees, the number of people presenting themselves and making a claim to be governors will decline; but the position created under this legislation is that there is no stipulation as to how many of an electorate will be entitled to elect four people to the board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons did not manage to convince the House of the necessity for municipal representation on this body, though quite conceivably the municipal authorities in whom he was interested might make a very considerable financial contribution to the funds of the hospital.  There is nothing in that section to indicate what financial contribution these governors may make or how many governors there are to be.  I do not withdraw what I have said about the section either on the Second Reading or now.  It may be that you will have to present something like this to the Oireachtas and put something like this in the Bill, but <Col N="594" /> I think there ought to be some opportunity of surveying the situation after a time.  Senator Hawkins referred to some time limit with regard to subscriptions, but I think that there ought to be a limit of another kind, namely, that this section would operate only for a number of years and on condition that there were so many subscribers as governors.  Otherwise I do not think there is any necessity for it at all.  I suggest that you can have a thoroughly unsatisfactory and undemocratic position.</P>

I hold that the only justification there could be for the retention of such a provision in the Bill would be the setting out of a minimum electorate that could select four members on this committee.  In the absence of such a provision, I would be in agreement with Senator Baxter that this sub-section should be deleted.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;And be it further enacted, That every Donor of any Sum not less than Twenty Guineas shall from the Time of such Donation become a Member of the Body Corporate, and Governor of said Meath Hospital and County of Dublin Infirmary, for the Term of his or her natural Life; and every Person who shall subscribe and pay any Sum not less than Two Guineas annually, for the Use of said Hospital or Infirmary, ....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know what &ldquo;annual&rdquo; means. I think you would probably have to go to the courts about it.  I presume it can be proved after the payment of two subscriptions or an undertaking to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Hawkins.  I will instance one case in particular that will illustrate the matter.  There are two county infirmaries in Cork City.  The <Col N="595" /> Cork County Council and the Cork Borough Council subscribe a sum of £700 each to these institutions.  To become a trustee of either institution, you must be a subscriber.  I have personal experience of what I am going to tell the House now.  One becomes a subscriber on payment of a sum of anything from one guinea to 20 guineas to either of these institutions.  At its general meeting, the hospital proceeds to elect the general management committee.  The subscribers or trustees are represented in person and the election is proceeded with.  Some time before the second last election in the North Cork Infirmary, because the medical officers engaged there were rather displeased with the appointment made by the elected representatives plus the trustees at a previous meeting, a number of medical officers attached to the institution decided that they would become trustees.  They paid their guinea or two in order to become trustees.  They subscribed just a few weeks preceding the election of the committee of management and, because of the subscription of a guinea or two, they became trustees and electors.  The result was that they gained their object in getting rid of one or two persons who, by the way, had voted for a doctor whom they did not like.  I think it would be very wise to support any step which will tend to get rid of a position such as that which I have instanced, whether it be in relation to the Meath Hospital or any other hospital in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the view which Senator Professor Stanford takes, namely, that there is nothing wrong in giving the right to select these four members to people who contribute to the funds of the hospital.  It is quite an ordinary method, in a great number of organisations, of giving power to people in elections.  I am a member of quite a number of organisations and I have the right to vote in these organisations because I contribute a certain sum per annum.  Even in respect of the society which I represent in this House, I can be licentiated without paying anything but if I wish to vote in that <Col N="596" /> society I can do so if I pay an annual subscription.  Similarly, in regard to a number of other societies to which I belong.  I believe that people should be given something against a subscription which they make towards the funds of a society and I think it is just as well that people of that description should have the selection of the four people in question.  I do not think that there will be terrific abuses if the section is left as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a great weakness in this section, namely, that while a person becomes a subscriber and is thereby entitled to vote, he or she need pay the sum of two guineas only in the year of election.  Anyone on the list will be entitled to vote on the date fixed. According to the Act, there will be another election in 1954.  There is nothing to prevent anybody from paying the subscription, or having it paid, this year.  Next year, they need not pay anything but it is essential to pay in 1954 in order to qualify.  I suppose it is not possible to provide for every eventuality.  It has been said that only four governors will be elected.  Of course, there is also the consideration of whether it would be worth anyone's while to subscribe a large amount of money to elect four, when they will not get control on the board.  What we are actually doing is depleting the revenue of the hospital by allowing, under the Act, people to subscribe each election year to the funds of the hospital though they need not pay any subscription towards the funds of that hospital in any other year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>We want the hospital to get as many voluntary subscriptions as possible and this does encourage people, to a certain degree, to give voluntary subscriptions.  I understand that a large body of people have paid subscriptions for the current year and, in a sense, we would be disfranchising them entirely if we did not leave in a clause of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are a few people who, without having any desire to control or to have complete power, would take an interest in the running of the hospital as one voter out of 25, or whatever it is, and, if they have some chance of <Col N="597" /> getting on the board, to serve and not to lead.  I believe there are many who want to serve on boards rather than to control them.  If they are prevented from doing so by this clause, I think the morale may suffer.  There is the further point that the life governors will also be disfranchised.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Senator Stanford in the hope that people will continue to subscribe voluntarily to this hospital as in the past and to an even greater extent.  I want to say, in reference to the section, that I have no uneasiness whatever with regard to it.  It is possible that people would pay subscriptions in order to buy the right to vote and in that way there is a possibility of abuse, but the probability of abuse is very, very remote.  I think that since membership &mdash;governors and governesses&mdash;is defined in the Bill, there is still less reason for uneasiness.  I was aware that, under an old Act, there was a difficulty that it did not provide for the payment of subscriptions each year.  There was no prescribed number of subscriptions to be paid in order to secure the right to vote.  I think people who give voluntary subscriptions to hospitals should have some representation on the board of the hospital, because people who so subscribe will have an interest in the management and it is only right that they should have some opportunity of expressing their views on the management and matters generally relating to the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the Second Stage that we should endeavour, in bringing things up to date and in making them efficient, not to be neglectful of their history.  The truth is that this Bill had to take account of an Act of Grattan's Parliament and an Act of 1815.  This particular section has to be taken with the Act of 1815, which provides that a person paying 20 guineas towards the hospital would be a life governor and a person paying £2 2s. 0d. per year had also rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil Select Committee dealing with this matter felt that they ought to leave that there, and as far as I am concerned I agree with them.  This section is continuing the old practice. That, in itself, is one thing in its favour.  Senators Stanford and Ó Buachalla have made appeal that we should encourage people to take an interest in the hospital, and if people are prepared to pay a couple of guineas a year towards it then they should have some share in the government of the hospital.  There are people who have the time on their hands and can help in matters of that sort.  We have them for instance on a great many committees like the vocational education committee.  They have done a lot of good work on such committees proving themselves quite useful, and have got on very successfully and on excellent terms with the elected representatives of public bodies with whom they are working.  For that reason this provision is desirable.  There is no suggestion that a number of subscribers could get control of a hospital, because even if united they could not secure more than four people out of a total representation of 23.  It would not be worth anybody's while to buy votes and become one of a committee of 23 persons. There is no danger of people paying subscriptions only in the year in which there is an election as has been suggested, and I do not think that that is worth providing for.  Here you are taking an old institution governed by old Acts of Parliament and bringing it up-to-date, reserving some part of the old machinery which <Col N="599" /> may be useful and using it democratically in the circumstances of the present day.  I would suggest, therefore, that we should leave Section 10 as it is.</P>

I am still satisfied that you will have people paying the £2 2s. 0d. only in an election year, while I would not say that they are doing it merely for getting their friends on the committee or voting for some particular person.</P>

If people desire to pay a subscription in order to control and manage this institution it would be a pity to stop them.  If people only paid in the election year, however, their desire would not, I think, be the better running of the hospital but rather representation without taxation. Because Senator O'Callaghan made a case for the representation of Cork, I can see a number of people from Cork paying a subscription to ensure that Cork will be represented.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (5), line, 38, to delete the words &ldquo;In the first election year&rdquo;; in lines 40 and 41 to delete the words &ldquo;in the first election year,&rdquo; and in lines 43 and 44 to delete the words &ldquo;in any election year (other than the first election year).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason I introduced this amendment is that no provision has been made for subsequent elections and if it is a good idea to have the first election by this method of proportional representation and postal voting I see every reason why that system should be continued.  I hope that the amendment will be accepted because it will improve the Bill considerably.</P>

      <P>I would like to indicate that there were two amendments in my name and another in the name of Senator Quirke leading to a considerable improvement in the Bill which I accepted.  I am not obliged to put down an amendment.  If this amendment were put in sub-section (5) would read:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  The Hospital Corporation members shall be elected on the proportional representation system by postal vote of the persons qualified <Col N="601" /> to vote at the election; the election shall be conducted and carried out by a person appointed for the purpose by the Dublin City Manager in accordance with rules made by the Dublin City Manager; the Hospital Corporation members shall be elected by vote of the persons qualified to vote at the election and the election shall be conducted and carried out by a person appointed for the purpose by the joint committee in accordance with rules made by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>I think that the words &ldquo;in the first election year&rdquo; should be deleted in line 38 but left in line 41 because that is plainly the intention.</P>

      <P>On the section, I do not see the necessity for all this hedging around with rules and regulations the election of four members of the committee of the hospital.  While proportional representation can be considered democratic I am not satisfied that postal voting is democratic as it is open to too much abuse. In this hospital there are life voters who have been such for many years. Many of them do not reside in the State at all.  These people who have no longer any interest in the Meath Hospital will be expected to vote by post and these are the people who will elect four governors.  The section is a <Col N="602" /> big improvement on the elaborate machinery of the original Bill but I still think that the postal voting system is not necessary, to say the least of it.  There may be an argument in its favour in the first year in view of the history of the past couple of years but I see no reason for enforcing it for all subsequent elections.  The method is wrong, it cannot be considered democratic and should not be in the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 25 to the end of the sub-section and substitute the following words: &ldquo;the appointment was made, the joint committee may review such appointment and without assigning any reason therefor, may declare the appointment null and void.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As a layman reading this Bill I felt that the wording of this section might lead other laymen like myself to a wrong conclusion.  The wording of the section might lead one to expect that in the Select Committee which considered this Bill there was a personal animus against certain individuals.  I am ready to accept that the sole purpose of this section is to give as complete freedom as possible to the new committee in the management of the hospital.  The sole purpose of my amendment is to prevent any misconception on the part of the general public that there was any sinister purpose in this section, to make it quite clear that its purpose is to leave the committee, democratically elected under this Bill when it becomes an Act, free to do as they think fit within the ambit of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> I am not enamoured of my amendment. Looking at the marginal note, it was a shock to me to see the words &ldquo;removal from office of certain persons.&rdquo;  Surely that might be casting a reflection on individuals, whereas the purpose of the section is to nullify an appointment.  That was the sole purpose I had in moving this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more in favour of Senator Orpen's amendment than I am of the section, but I think both the section and the amendment should be dropped.  This is a good Bill, but Section 14 is a blot on it, as it seeks to dismiss four brilliant medical men, who are orphans in this city, with no background here except what their brilliance and their ability entitles them to.  It is wrong to legislate in that way.  It is undemocratic and objectionable from every point of view. I do not wish to say anything further on the matter, but if I have to choose between the section and the amendment, I will choose the amendment, though I prefer the deletion of the section altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If one has to choose between the amendment and the section, I would choose the section. The amendment suggests that the committee may review the appointments and without assigning any reason may declare an appointment null and void. The section, on the other hand, gives authority to the new committee, in their discretion, to dispense with the services of anyone appointed since a particular date.  The members of the Select Committee which agreed on this section did not so agree in order to have incorporated in an Act of Parliament an injustice to any body of persons or to any individual.  The members of the Committee have the highest appreciation for the persons who have been referred to here and in the other House, but we should have regard to the circumstances under which this Bill has come before us and under which the appointments were made.  We must have regard to the circumstances which first brought about the introduction of the Bill.  Then the Bill was referred to a Select Committee <Col N="604" /> of all Parties in the House, men long associated with the life of the city and with hospitals and many of them with this particular hospital.</P>
      <P>The joint committee at present running this particular hospital were quite well aware that a Bill was going through this Parliament and they set about doing certain things.  One must always take precautions that when persons are about to leave office they should not be encouraged to place what might be termed a burden on the persons who are coming in to take over the functions of which they will be relieved.  It is not because of particular individuals having been appointed; it is because of the manner in which appointments were made and the period in which they were made, that the Select Committee recommended the incorporation of this section in the Bill.  We in this House should have a particular regard for the functions of this House and no group of people outside, no matter how good their intentions may be, may by any act cut across or place obstacles in the way of legislation that may be passed here.  We should take a strong stand against any such attempt and for that reason I am prepared to support the section rather than the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the section and think it should not be left in the Bill. As you know, I fell out with the joint committee over the appointment of these doctors.  I worked well with them for two years, but on these appointments I resigned membership of the committee, as I felt, at the time at any rate, that these appointments would mean an injustice to the men already in positions there.  I do not see that we can remedy one possible injustice by doing another one.  It may be correct that the old committee did something they should not have done, and when they saw this legislation coming they should not have done anything which would result, as it has resulted, in this clause being put into the Bill.  Despite what speakers have said here and in the other House, in this clause nothing is being done against the old committee&mdash;they have been dealt with in another section and <Col N="605" /> have been put out of power&mdash;but we are penalising people who had nothing to do with the committee that existed in the hospital.  I believe it is correct to say that no members of the joint committee knew any of these doctors individually.  They were appointed on their merits.  We are attempting now to deprive them of those positions and I doubt very much if we will be able to do it.  It is all very well to shake one's head, but that is in the Bill.  The committee that will attempt to remove them will be a courageous committee, in view of the feeling engendered not only in the Oireachtas but all over the country.</P>
      <P>The Irish people are opposed to injustice, whether it comes from the right or left, and if they feel there is an injustice being done to these men, they will resent it.  I certainly oppose this section because it is an attempt to put these men &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; and a suggestion to the committee if they are so disposed when they come into office to sack them.  The law protects a boy-messenger from summary dismissal without reason.  We are dealing here with one of the noblest professions in the country, and we are indicating in the section that these men can be dismissed without any reason being assigned.  I think it is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Senator Hawkins, prefer the wording of the section to the wording of Senator Orpen's amendment.  I see no injustice in the section.  In order that the section should be understood, we should consider some of the dates which are relevant, because the section itself contains a date.  The section provides, where a person was appointed after 6th December to any office, then the new joint committee may, without assigning any reason, dismiss or remove him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The date 6th December was chosen unanimously by the Dáil Select Committee, because on that day the Meath Hospital Bill got its Second Reading in the Dáil.  It got that Second Reading unanimously.  The meaning of the Second Reading was that the Dáil was <Col N="606" /> unanimously of opinion that a new committee ought to be appointed to govern the Meath Hospital.  Details of the Bill might be changed and, in fact, were changed, but, beyond all doubt, the meaning of the decision of the other House, come to unanimously, was that the committee that was governing the hospital on 6th December of last year was going to be replaced by another committee under the provisions of an Act passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On 7th December, a Select Committee, consisting of 15 members drawn from all sides of the House, was appointed. On 14th December, that committee began its deliberations. Eight days later, the outgoing committee of the Meath Hospital, a committee which knew it was outgoing, advertised four medical posts.  That decision to advertise four medical posts was not unanimous on the part of the Meath Hospital Committee.  It was alluded to in the other House as a hair-line decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the committee was not united on the question as to whether there were actual vacancies or whether they ought to be filled.  When the advertisement was issued, the medical board of the hospital followed it by an advertisement stating that they had not been consulted about the appointments. Their advertisement appeared in the medical journals with the advertisement from the Meath Hospital Committee.  All the people who were candidates were aware of the facts that I have outlined.  There can be no doubt whatever that, when an outgoing or expiring committee takes that kind of action, there is power in the Oireachtas to see that the decision of the Oireachtas will not be thwarted. That is what is being done in this <Col N="607" /> section and that is not an injustice to anybody.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, there is the point that more candidates might have applied but for the fact that they knew that there was discord in the Meath Hospital as between the medical staffs and the management committee.  More people might have applied and there might have been better competition.  In fact, certain people applied, and these people were told on the day of the interview, every single one of them, that this particular section was in the Bill, because, in the interval between the issuing of the advertisement and the summoning of candidates for interview, the Select Committee of the Dáil, 15 people representing the whole Dáil, unanimously passed this particular section&mdash; it was then Section 12 but it is this section&mdash;not because they wanted to do an injustice to anybody but because they considered&mdash;and I submit they were right&mdash;that since they had begun to appoint a new committee to govern the Meath Hospital, the existing committee should not, apart from its legal rights, proceed to do this particular thing.  There were members of the hospital committee who thought the same as the Dáil Committee.</P>
      <P>Every candidate for these posts was shown, on the day of the interview, the terms of this particular section. Nobody is being treated unjustly or subjected to any sudden changes. They were aware of all this.  That being so, I should explain what the section means.  The section does not propose to dismiss anybody.  The section gives power to the new committee to reconsider this whole matter and, if you like, if places the four people concerned completely within the power of the new committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with those who have stated that there is no reflection intended upon the qualifications of the people appointed.  We are not concerned with that, but we are concerned with the method of their appointment and with vindicating the right of the two Houses of the Oireachtas to pass legislation and to see that, in passing that legislation, they shall not be <Col N="608" /> thwarted by anybody.  The proposal is that the new committee shall have power, undoubted power, to reconsider this whole question.  There are several things they may do, but before I suggest what they might do, I ought to tell the House who they are.  They are five people from the Dublin Corporation, six from the Dublin Country Council, two from the General Council of County Councils, four members of the medical board, four people elected by subscribers and two co-opted.  It is extremely unlikely that any such committee will perpetrate an injustice against anybody, and least of all against four doctors who, I accept, are competent and some of whom are very well known.  All we are asking the House to do is to allow the new committee to manage its own affairs and not to put it in the position that it will have been forestalled by the old committee in the last moments of its existence.  I think that is a reasonable thing to ask; I do not think it will cause any injustice to anybody; and I suggest that we should pass the section in its present form.</P>
    <P>We are not reflecting upon anybody, except upon the wisdom of a committee which, in its last days, proceeded to fill vacancies in a hospital without consultation with the medical board. There must be harmony in any institution of that kind.  What was in the minds of the Committee of the Dáil was the interest of the patients.  It is in the interests of the patients that there should be harmony and that appointments should be made in a particular way by the committee, if any appointments are to be made.  If the new committee decides there is not need for any extra surgeons to the hospital, then, presumably, the newly appointed men will go out of office.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, they decide that there are vacancies, then presumably they will advertise these vacancies and these people can be candidates and they will get, I am sure, as everybody else will get, a fair field and no favour.  That is the complete meaning of Section 14 and we should pass it.  If we did not pass it, we would be doing something which, as a House of Parliament, we ought <Col N="609" /> not to do.  The section does not dismiss anybody and does not perpetrate any injustice against anybody.  It merely leaves the new committee, when it meets, in the position of being able to decided about these appointments completely untrammelled by any previous proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>For me, there are three reasons why the section should be left as it is.  First, I think the case made mainly by Senator Hayes and also by Senator Hawkins is unanswerable.  There is no need to go into the details as they have put them before the House.  It seems to me that, on a constitutional issue, there is nothing we can do about it other than accept the section as it stands.  A second reason is the case made by Senator Colgan against the section.  He has indicated that he broke with the board because of the board's decision to proceed with these appointments in view of the circumstances.  I think the Senator has made a case for the retention of this section.</P>
      <P>The third reason for maintaining the section seems to me to lie in the amendment proposed by Senator Orpen.  The difference between the section and the amendment is that Senator Orpen would like the word &ldquo;review&rdquo; inserted; in other words, that the joint committee may review the appointments, and, without assigning any reason, dismiss and remove the appointed person from his office. What exactly does the word &ldquo;review&rdquo; mean?  Surely this new committee will not act in an irresponsible manner and will not act as a body of lunatics?  This matter will come before it and it will investigate it.  How long that investigation will go on, we do not know. Exactly what ground it will cover, we do not know, but the joint committee can fix anything it likes by way of review and that settles the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Orpen could be a little more precise and tell us what he means by the word &ldquo;review&rdquo; and how he would indicate to the board its procedure on the matter, we might get somewhere with it, but merely to insert the word &ldquo;review&rdquo; and say that that is a good enough reason for amending the section, to me does not make sense. Consider the section and consider the <Col N="610" /> amendment&mdash;on balance, it is better to leave the section as it is.  As Senator Hayes and Senator Hawkins pointed out, it does not follow from the section that these people will be dismissed, but I think it is essential that the board should have the right to dismiss them, if it thinks fit, and especially in view of the circumstances outlined by Senator Hayes.  I hope the section will be left in the Bill as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHayes1927" hpid="Mr. S. Hayes Mr. S. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to raise any questions about the past administration of the Meath Hospital, except to say that it appears to have been run on most undemocratic lines and reform was absolutely essential. With regard to the references made by Senator Hayes to these appointments, I want to say that they would not convince anybody.  Everybody will realise that this Bill is the work of vicious and panic-stricken people and that were it not for the fact that they were possibly taken on the wrong foot by a committee, which, in the courts of law, was adjudged to be a right and proper committee and correct in the action it took, this Bill would never have been thought of or introduced.  From what has transpired during the week in the daily papers, we know that the running of this institution represented a very serious state of affairs, that it was run on purely class lines.  As Professor O'Rahilly pointed out during the week, we have University College which everybody connected with it claims to be one of the most democratic medical institutions in the country.  It has been in existence for 33 years, but no graduate of that university has ever got the opportunity of being selected or elected as a member of the board of that hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several matters have been brought in to prejudice the case in respect of the appointment recently of four doctors, and it has been suggested that, because they are four Corkmen, the appointments were all wrong. Everybody realises that Cork is about one-eight of the whole country, and that it is as big as six Leinster counties put together.  It is only reasonable to expect that, in the matter of appointments of this type, Cork people, being brainy, intelligent and keen, will come to the top as they have <Col N="611" /> done on various other occasions, so far as public appointments are concerned. Everybody will realise also that the Minister for Health was very much lacking in his approach to this whole problem and that his neglect is a very serious matter for the institution and for the country generally.  Any thinking person must admit that a public inquiry should have been held into the running of this institution and into the appointments of the old board.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that this measure is a vicious measure which should not be enacted.  Senator Hayes said that, when they saw this Bill coming forward, the committee made these appointments urgently, and he pointed the finger of scorn at them and suggested that they should not have been made.  One might as well suggest, in relation to the Local Government Bill at present before the Dáil, that the county managers should not have done anything as county managers in the past six months.  You can do anything by legislation, but why stop at a particular point if you propose to legislate for a particular privileged class in this manner and deprive other people of their vested rights?  It is a very serious thing.  You might as well adopt the same principle as the United States&mdash;get rid of all public appointments and all staffs.  The next thing is that legislation of this very particular type may be extended to district justices and properly established civil servants.</P>
    <P>In referring to what has been done in America I must say that some of the precedents established by America and Britain in their holy horror of those who do not adopt the principle of civilised war make one want to point out that the expression &ldquo;civilised war&rdquo; is contradictory in terms.  I protest against this measure.  It is most undemocratic.  It endangers the roots of all authority and democracy in the country.  If hospitals down the country were conducted in this way, inquiries would have been instituted by the Minister long ago.  I cannot for a moment visualise why he is lacking in his duty in this connection because that inquiry should have taken <Col N="612" /> place.  This section should be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>A Senator has said that this section has been supported by unanswerable arguments by Senator Hayes and Senator Hawkins.  My difficulty is that neither of them gives any answer to the question which must be agitating the minds of a great many of us.  We are being asked to pass legislation which will reflect on people who were legally appointed by a legally constituted body.  We are now being asked to give power for the removal, without the reason stated, of the persons who were legally appointed.  To my mind, the amendment is even worse because it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...declare the appointment null and void.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That seems to me to be a great offence against justice.</P>
      <P>During the course of this discussion it emerged that the four persons appointed&mdash;and, mind you, the section deals only with the removal from office of certain persons&mdash;were very highly competent.  This matter is most unfortunate.  It has been suggested both in the Dáil and in this House that these people will probably be continued in their office.  Why, then, should we put a stigma on them?  Why should we inflict the stigma on professional men?  Why, if they were elected by a legally constituted committee, should subsequent legislation seek to undo their appointment.  I suppose that legislation is progressive but it can do a grave injustice in fixing a stigma on these four persons who have been appointed.  I should like an answer to that question before I vote for this section.</P>

      <P>When I first read the amendment I felt that I should like to support it.  I did so in the belief that it more or less took the rough edge off Section 14.  On thinking over the matter again, and having heard some of the speeches, I shall now certainly support the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to find people defending either Catholics or Corkmen in any company in which I happen to be <Col N="613" /> present.  Neither do I like to find people defending either Masons or members of a municipal authority in any company in which I happen to be present.  In the discussion of this Bill we are, more than ordinarily, a bunch of Irishmen trying to do the best we can for an Irish hospital.  Unquesetionably, some extraordinary statements have been made.  I have been taken to task in the papers for a speech I made last week in which I said that the four men who were appointed were Corkmen. I said that I believed it was an extraordinary coincidence and that, were it not for that coincedence, many of the speeches which have been made would not have been made at all. What I said was changed about here and there and was finally produced as an attempt by me to suggest that there was Cork influence in the appointment of the doctors.  I did not say any such thing.  If there is anybody in this House who is not a Corkman and who is a better friend of Corkmen than I am, I should like to meet him.  I have the greatest respect in the world for Corkmen and I agree 100 per cent. with Senator Sean Hayes when he says that because of their ability, energy and other good qualities they have succeeded in getting to the top in many professions and many walks of life.</P>
    <P>To suggest that an attempt has been made in this section to cast a reflecttion on the four men who have been appointed is a gross exaggeration of the position.  It is very regrettable that the names of the four men in question became known.  I am not in any position to judge whether a man is a good doctor or a bad doctor.  I have had discussions, however with men who, in my opinion, would be in a position to judge and they tell me that the four persons in question could not be stopped from getting the positions they have got in any ordinary examination in which they would be judged along ordinary standards.  I believe that they are four first class men.  Far from attaching any stigma, I believe that, as a result of the speeches which have been made in this House and in the Dáil, they will have a terrible job in living up to the reputation which <Col N="614" /> they have got.  I believe they will live up to the good reputation which they have got.  I happen to know one of the men in question very slightly.  Though I do not know the others I believe that they are as good and as nice as the man I know.  I believe they are excellent members of the profession.</P>
    <P>Senator S. Hayes says that the Bill was introduced on the proposition of vicious, panic-stricken people.  The people who considered this Bill were three ex-Lords Mayor of Dublin Corporation and a man who, according to some people in the Dáil, will also be a Lord Mayor&mdash;personally I hope he will not be&mdash;and I do not think that these men would do anything that was not right while they were engaged on their discussions.  Throughout the whole time they had been in constant touch with their own Parties in connection with this Bill.  Therefore, we must assume that these four men were in agreement, and the Dáil, as far as the principle of the Bill was concerned, was in 100 per cent. agreement with it. There must, therefore, be something wrong about which we know nothing. I have gone to a lot of trouble to find out what all the talk that is going on is about, but I cannot find anything. The suggestion that something desperate is going to happen when this Bill becomes law is absolute nonsense.  In fact, what the actual position will be is that 23 men will be in control of the hospital.  These 23 men under this section are being given power, if they so desire, to despense with the services of the four doctors concerned.</P>
    <P>The suggestion which has been made in actual plain fact is that amongst these 23 men there are four particularly dangerous characters.  These four men must be a lot better men than I think they are and more powerful than I believe they are if it is to be suggested that they can sway the other 19, all of whom are members of local authorities, to do anything which in the opinion of the 19 men would be unjust.  I do not think there is any danger whatever of such a thing happening. I believe that if and when this Bill becomes law, we will have a measure as democratically constructed <Col N="615" /> as anything could possibly be in so far as the Oireachtas is concerned.  I am amazed at some of the statements which have been made and I am very sorry that personalities have been brought into the discussion.  I would appeal to those who are in opposition to the section to withdraw their opposition. I believe that we are doing a good piece of work according to our own rights.  If some people think otherwise, then they have not convinced me that we are doing anything wrong and until they do so, I am standing by this Bill as we have so far amended it.</P>

      <P>I want to say that I am in complete agreement with what Senators Hayes, Clarkin and Hawkins have said on the main principles of this Bill.  I also agree with Senator Barniville in regard to the amendment of Senator Orpen, which might be desirable in other circumstances but in its phraseology is not as desirable in this Bill and which might, istead of making the position better, make it worse.</P>
      <P>I only want to say that I do not believe any of the staff are going to lose their appointments but I believe that as a result of this section being passed, as I believe it will be, the position of these people will be all the better because they will have been appointed by a board democratically appointed and with full powers.  It would be unfortunate if any persons appointed in the atmosphere of controversy and in the circumstances so clearly stated by Senator Hayes, were to be left in their positions with the suggestion that they had not been properly appointed.  I think this is essentially a matter of principle and its effects will be for greater harmony in the future.</P>

      <P>I am impressed by what Senator Orpen has stated in regard to the marginal note.  The circumstances as regards the hospital and the Bill are very delicate and I entirely agree with Senator Hayes when he says that the first interests should be those of the patients.  Those interests are best served by complete harmony amongst the staff.  I do not think there <Col N="616" /> has been anything said here this afternoon to which there could have been any great objection.  I am very anxious not to hurt the feelings of anybody concerned.  I know a great many of the people and the circumstances of the controversy and I speak purely personally on these matters.</P>
      <P>As one of the representatives of the National University, I feel bound to say something when the interests of graduates of my own university are affected.  I do not wish to enter into the controversy of the rights and wrongs of this matter.  I think that when the interests of graduates of the university are affected, adversely or otherwise, and particularly in a Bill, it is perfectly fair and right that the representatives of that university should look after their interests and try to ensure that any threatened injury that the graduates are going to suffer should be looked after in a proper manner.  It is purely with that intention I am intervening in this debate.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the history of this unfortunate affair.  It has been sufficiently rehearsed in the Dáil and this House.  We are all aware of the recent history of the Meath Hospital and of the sequence of the events that has led to these appointments and to the Bill.  There is no doubt at all about the facts of the situation, but equally there is not doubt at all that the situation which has arisen is one that calls for a remedy.  The remedy which is being applied is indeed drastic because it amounts, in fact, to power to rescind contracts with this graduates of ours which, at the time, were legally made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt about legal appointments being made and now these gentlemen, rightly or wrongly, for reasons which may or may not appeal to the majority of us, are having their appointments reviewed, cancelled or reconsidered <i>ex post facto.</i>  Everybody will agree that <i>ex post facto</i> legislation must always be regarded with the greatest suspicion, and that a change in people's legal position made <i>ex post facto</i> must always be done with the greatest care to safeguard their interests.  As said by previous speakers, it is a dangerous principle, a desperate <Col N="617" /> remedy.  Desperate remedies may be necessary occasionally, but that does not get away from the fact that they are remedies which should be reduced to a minimum and should be applied with all due caution.  Therefore I would suggest that if we pass the section or the amendment&mdash;because really I do not see very much difference between the two&mdash;some words might be inserted to safeguard in some way or another the people whose positions are being reviewed so that they would have the benefit of some inquiry, some protection.  Some words should be inserted taking away the purely capricious irresponsible power contained in the Bill.  I mean no reflection on the present gentlemen appointed, but in the interests of the people who are legally in the position and who are exposed to dismissal, this decision should be taken with a certain amount of determination.</P>
    <P>This in an extraordinary measure.  It may be necessary in an unusual situation, but extraordinary measures should be hedged around with all precaution. I further hope that the treatment of these gentlemen will be characterised by fairness and equity, and over and above all that there will not be any hangover from the unfortunate controversy which we hope this Bill will bring to an end.</P>
    <P>The last thing I would like to say is that, in so far as it has been frequently alleged that injustices have been perpetrated in the conduct of the hospital in recent months and in so far as that may have a foundation in fact and in so far as it may be true&mdash;I do not pretend to say what I think in this very controversial matter as we have had contradictions by the people immediately concerned of each other's statements&mdash;that certain people were victimised when they were not reappointed but dismissed, I prefer to see justice done by the restoration of the people who were deprived of their appointments than by a continued deprivation of them.</P>
    <P>Some approach along those lines might at least be suggested to the committee.  The very fact of this discussion may in itself lead the committee <Col N="618" /> to adopt this line.  It is in the hope of doing that, in the hope of creating better feeling and not worse feeling and of undoing an injustice by positive rather than negative measures, that I am making this contribution.</P>

      <P>Knowing none of the people concerned, no member of the committee, none of the people appointed, my approach is some what more detached than that of the people who were in the midst of this controversy here in Dublin.  My view is that a great a deal of prejudice surrounds the whole case.  Although I have listened to Senator Hayes and other speakers, it seems to me that the Dáil Committee, approached the problem with a considerable amount of prejudice and that that is why the section is in the Bill, An interrupter suggests &ldquo;flouting&rdquo; but that is not a true presentation of facts.  This committee represented the whole Dáil and different parties in the City of Dublin. I am a member of a political Party and I have no recollection of any Party discussions when these consultations were going on.  The whole matter was discussed with freedom in the other House and, indeed, here too.  While it is true that there was general agreement on the principle that a new plan of government for the hospital was necessary, there was not agreement on this section, in the other House; there was a division.  I have forgotten what the majority was but the number separating the &ldquo;Tá's&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Níl's&rdquo; was not so very great at all.</P>

      <P>Although the committee was drawn from all Parties there was vigorous opposition on this essential point to the opinion of the committee as contained in this section. This is something I do not understand. Senator Mrs. Concannon queried whether the committee was properly elected or not.  If their existence was legal is seems to me a strange attitude on the part of the Oireachtas to challenge one decision of theirs.  If by power vesste in them by the Oireachtas the new committee can challenge one decision why not give them authority to challenge every decision?  I do not <Col N="619" /> know anything about any decision but if they can challenge the appointments they should have an apportunity of challenging every decision of that committee from the beginning to the end of their term of office.  Why is authority given to the committee in this partial manner?  Why is it not complete and absolute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is not intended that the power which the committee is given to eject these graduates of the National University should be excercised by them, what are we to do at all?  I do not think there is anything more absured than making a pretence of giving power to a committee and saying at the same time that you do not think they will use it.  That is how it seems to me.  I may be rather difficult to enlighten but that is what I take from the speeches of Senators Douglas and O'Brien.  Their case was that although this power has been vested in the new committee it is not a power that is likely to be exercised unjustily. I do not know what that means.  If it is the idea of Senator Douglas and others, very just and charitable men, that this power is not to be exercised by the committee, there is no sense in giving it to them at all.  I would draw the attention of the House to the fact with regard to the committee which is going out of existence that its legality has not been actually challenged.  I do not think that anybody here said that they had done something illegal.  If they did something during the last days of their existeance, I would point out that Governments have gone out of power and on the eve of going out they have made important appointments&mdash;not one Government but different Governments&mdash;yet it was never proposed that the new Government coming into office should reverse those appointments, whether it was that of a judge or promotion in some branch of the Government service.  I do not know what line will be pursued by the new committee in regard to these people.  All this controversy is very unfortunate.  If they take the decision which some people imagine will be taken and these doctors are turned out of the hospital, it may start a controversy <Col N="620" /> of which we may not see the end and I do not think the Oireachtas would come out unscathed.  if the power vested in these people to do something like this is exercised.</P>
    <P>Are we doing the wise thing?  Someone argued in the other House that the whole constitutional position might be challenged on this section, in so far as it would deprive individuals of rights which they enjoy under agreements. We have heard a great deal about analogous positions in the past. In being asked to support this section, I am asked to do something that is against my better instincts.  Another section I have discussed arises out of the history of the whole situation. To a considerable extent it is not even defensible.  That may be argued on this, but I do not think that its inclusion makes this Bill better or makes the atmosphere surrounding the whole hospital and its government in the future any happier than it is at present. I do not know whether the new committee is to excercise these powers or not, but I would prefer that they would not have them to exercise.</P>

      <P>I did not quite understand the Bill, but from listening carefully to the remarks made I cannot understand why those four men should come under the supervision of the instigators of the Bill, or why they should be singled out.

      <P>I have no bother in making up my mind to support the section.  All the knowledge I have of this measure and of what led up to its introduction has been gathered from people not connected with this hospital. I do not know any of the four people appointed or anything about them. From my examination of the position, I believe the old committee tried to do something which they knew might be regarded as wrong by the incoming committee, and they were having a last kick before they were ousted from office.  Unless a case were made that these men were urgently needed, I think the making of these appointments was very wrong.  I have an idea from <Col N="621" /> the wording of the section that other appointments might have been made but for the section.  It says: &ldquo;appointed to any office&rdquo;.  There is no particular mention of these four.  If these four appointments were allowed to go through without question, there was every possibility that other appointments might be made or other commitments entered into by the outgoing committee.  In view of the fact that the Bill was introduced before the committee made these appointments, in my opinion it is the new committee which should be entitled to decide the selections.  I think it was said that if it were not for the fact that a number of other medical men knew that this clause might be inserted, there would have been other applications, and that on account of that knowledge certain men did not make application and so were not considered.  That is one reason why we should give the new committee power to review these appointments. I have no hesitation in supporting the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied, after the concise and convincing outline given by Senator Hayes of the background to this Bill, that it would be inadvisable to interfere in any way with Section 14.  Senator Baxter is worried as to what the committee may do or may not do.  They are given power&mdash;and, I hold, justly given power &mdash;to do certain things.  Such a committee will be able to exercise discretionary power and I am satisfied that anything they do will be done in the best interests of the patients of the hospital.  A committee representative of every section of the community, called together at the outset to discuss the terms of a Bill that would meet this situation, must have studied all the circumstances and conditions in the administration of the Meath Hospital and any recommendation coming from such a committee should be seriously entertained and altered only after very mature consideration.  People in the know have informed me that this Bill is a good one, that any interference with it, any drastic alteration of its terms, would not be in the interests of the patients who have to be looked after there.  On that account, it would <Col N="622" /> be inadvisable even to modify in the slightest manner the power given in Section 14.  Personally, I will not support any motion calculated to alter the powers set out in that particular section.</P>

      <P>As a representative of one of the universities I was a little perturbed by what Senator O'Brien said, he cause I hold very strongly that the universities should stand together on these points, as far as possible.  I turn to what the Chancellor of the National University said in the Dáil on 22nd February, 1951.  He was quite firm in saying this clause should stand.  He said that since it was announced that this Bill was before the House, the committee of the Meathe Hospital should have regarded themselves as a caretaking committee.  Those are his own words.  He went on to say that, very likely, when these posts were advertised, many other medical candidates who would have been very suitable may have held back from applying because of the existing situation.  So when the Chancellor of the National University speaks in these terms and says that the only logical and proper course is to accept the unanimous recommendation of the committee, I think, as a representative of the other university, that the intersets of graduates are not being seriously impaired.</P>

It can be altered, I had written down the exact alteration suggested by Senator Mrs. Concannon to make the marginal note on Section 14 the same as that on Section 17: &ldquo;Power of joint committee to remove persons from office.&rdquo;  I agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon. We can alter the marginal note.</P>
      <P>On the whole question, there is the point made by Senator Baxter that, some how or other, people have a peculiar bias in this matter because they are living in the midst of the trouble. I am living in Dublin, but I am very far from being in the midst of the trouble.  I kept well away from it.  I look at this matter with just as calm and objective a mind as Senator Baxter or any other Senator.  I was very impressed that such an extraordinary combination of Deputies interested in Dublin and its hospital should have taken these steps to bring a Bill into the Dáil.  I agree with Senator Quirke that the combination of people which included Deputy Peadar Doyle, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan of the Labour Party and Deputy John McCann of the Fianna Fáil Party were certainly not vicious nor panic-strciken nor baiased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to graduates of the National University of Ireland, I do not yield either to Senator George O'Brien or anybody else in my interests in, and anxiety for, graduates of my university.  But graduates of my university are able to stand on thier own feet.  The graduates of the medical schools in particular have proved that that is so, not only at home but abroad.  There is no attack in this section upon the graduates of the National University and there is no necessity for these graduates to be defended.  There is no relevancy in the fact that the four persons appointed happen to be graduates of National University.  What is suggested here is that they should be placed in the power of the new committee and I cannot conceive of any committee of the Meath Hospital under this Bill having any bias against graduates of the National University, or doing anything but treating them, <Col N="624" /> wherever they find them, with the greatest possible eveness, fairness and justice.</P>

      <P>We are discussing graduates of the National University.  I do know something about them.  There is no such thing as coming upon anybody unawares, because everybody who was a candidate for a post since 6th December was aware that a new committee was being appointed and they were also made aware of the existence of this particular section.  They were made aware individually.  It was brought to their notice, so nobody can say they were taken unawares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to legal appointments, it is quite possible that people would be legally appointed in circumstances. which would necessitate a review of the appointments.  There can be no doubt about that, but no injustice and no stigma rests upon anybody, who, in the excersie of his judgement and freedom, went up for one of these appointments. There were other people who exercised their freedom and judgement and did not go for the appointments. It is quite conceivable that a doctor would say:&ldquo;I am not going to intervene in a dispute between the medical board of the hospital and the lay committee and I am not going to submit my qualifications to a lay committee for appointment.&rdquo;  That is quite conceivable. There are two points of view.  There can be no doubt that there might have been better competition if the situation had been one of harmony between the medical staffs and the governing committee.  Whether the results would have been different or not I do not know.  I have no qualification whatever to judge of the capacity or capabilities of doctors.  I am casting no reflections on these people.  I am assured by colleagues of mine that they are persons of high qualifications but it is a very interesting thing that, living as I do in the midst of medical graduates and medical professors, nobody spoke to me to ask me to have this section deleted. We should realise precisely what we are doing.  We are handing over to <Col N="625" /> the new committee appointed under this Bill, a committee consisting mainly of representatives of local bodies, power to review appointments.  I think that is fair and, in all the circumstances, reasonable and I am personally confident that it will not work in any way as an injustice on anybody.</P>

      <P>This scheme is intended to amend the original scheme which came into operation from the 1st</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> August, 1929, under the Teachers' (Superannuation) Act, 1928.  As Senators are aware, it is a contributory scheme.  The amendment now before the Seanad is intended to introduce substantial changes in the benefits to be obtained under the scheme, to arrange for additional payments in relation to these benefits and to enable those who are not already members to come into the scheme.</P>
    <P>The secondary schools are private institutions that are practically entirely financed by capitation grants based on the number of pupils attending under certain conditions.  Salaries are paid to secondary teachers and are composed of a basic salary and an incremental salary.  The basic salary is that part of the salary which is paid by the schools to the teacher. The minimum payments are £180 a year in the case of women teachers and £200 a year in the case of men. The incremental salaries are paid by the State.  The present range of incremental salaries runs from the first increment of £160 a year to a maximum £470 a year in the case of a married man.  In the case of a woman or an unmarried man the incremental salary runs from an initial increment of £100 a year to £320 a year.  Included in what is called the &ldquo;standard salary&rdquo; is payment in respect of an honours degree and payment in respect of teaching through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>The payments that are made towards the pensions scheme by the teachers are related to the salaries, that is, the salary as composed of the basic salary and the incremental salary.  Under the scheme as it exists at present, and which it is now intended to amend, a certain number of benefits are arranged for.  Provision is made under the scheme for the following benefits&mdash; a pension, a death gratuity, a short service gratuity and a disability gratuity.  I will compare the present benefits with the proposed benefits under the new scheme.  The existing scheme provides for a pension which is based on certain service&mdash;in some cases pre-1st August, 1929, and in certain cases post-1st August, 1929.  Under the present scheme, service after 1st August, 1929, is contributory service. <Col N="628" /> Service before that is non-contributory service.  The pension is based on an average of the last three years of salary.  That average is taken and, in respect of service pre-1st August, 1929, 1/100th of the average pensionable service is taken for each year of service: for years of service after 1st August, 1929, 1/80th is taken.  Therefore, the pension is based on the average of the last three years of salary, reckoning, for pension purposes, service before 1st August, 1929, at 1/100th and after 1st August, 1929, at 1/80th.  Under the new scheme, the pension will be based and reckoned in the same way. Under the existing schemes also, there is a death gratuity.  The death gratuity consists simply of a refund of the contributions already paid by the teacher, together with compound interest at the rate of 3 per cent.  In future the death benefit will be under a lump sum arrangement where there is not less than five year's service&mdash; either a year's pensionable salary or a lump sum based upon service, whichever is the greater. If a teacher has more than 30 years' service then he will get a full gratuity that will be larger than the years of pensionable service.  Under the existing scheme there is a short service gratuity.  That is when a person leaves teaching after a short period of service there is a refund of the contribution paid but without any interest.  Under the new scheme there will be the same provision but there will be an increase in the short service gratuity, where a person retires as a result of disablement. Under the present scheme there is a disability pension after ten years, payable on pension basis.  The same will obtain under the new scheme so that the present scheme includes benefits over and above what were paid before by the introduction of a lump sum on retirement, death gratuity which, instead of being merely a refund with compound interest of the contributions paid, will be a year's pensionable salary.</P>
    <P>Then there is instead a short service gratuity in the case of a teacher with less than ten years, who goes out of the service because of disability.  Instead of getting a refund of payments without <Col N="629" /> interest he will get a disability gratuity of one-twelfth for each year of service together with a sum he would have earned in the lump sum.  In addition, new benefits include a marriage gratuity which will be payable on marriage to women teachers leaving teaching and which will be paid to all women who have six years' service.  One-twelfth of the retiring salary will be paid for each year of service.  The minimum being six years and the maximum 12.</P>
    <P>In order to make provision for the granting of these benefits it is necessary to increase the contributions.  At the present moment the contribution that is made to bring the teacher under the existing scheme consists of a payment made by the school and a payment made by the teacher.  I have said that a teacher's salary is made up of basic and incremental salary. The school pays 2½ per cent.  On the basic salary up to £100 in the case of women and £200 in the case of men. The teacher pays 4 per cent. of the full basic and incremental salary.  In future, from the introduction of the scheme the 4 per cent. paid by the teacher will become 5 per cent. and the increase of 1 per cent. will cover the increased benefits, but it is intended to allow teachers who have not come under the scheme on the one hand to pay back contributions so as to make their past service available for pension purpose and it is intended to enable teachers who want to come in under the full gratuity and lump sum to make payment in respect of back years, to allow them to make the six years eligible when assessing full gratuity or lump sum.</P>
    <P>There are five classes of teachers to be considered in this matter: the first set are those under the original scheme introduced from the 1st August, 1929, and the teachers who were teaching at that particular time and who wanted to come in under it.  The change with regard to them will be that from the 1st August, 1951, instead of paying 4 per cent.  On the basic and incremental salary they will pay 5 per cent., but if they want their present and past services that will bring them in for full pension and gratuity from the 1st <Col N="630" /> August, 1950, taken into account, for gratuity purposes, they will have to pay 1½ per cent. of their 1950-51 salary for every year of their service which they wish to have to regarded for gratuity purposes.  Teachers of that class who pay back their gratuity payments back to the 1st August, 1929, with-will be allowed to have for gratuity purposes any year's service that they gave before the 1st August, 1929, with&mdash; out paying any contributions therefor.</P>
    <P>The second class of teachers who, while they came into the teaching service after August 1st, 1949, under the present pension scheme from the earliest possible date on which they became eligible, their position is that they will be enabled to add whatever back years they wish of service as years accounting for lump sum and death gratuity by paying 1½ per cent. of their 1950-51 salary.  They can select as many years out of their service as they wish, to bring them in under the gratuity scheme.</P>
    <P>The next class are teachers who entered the service again after 1st August, 1929, who are at present under this scheme but who have not enrolled under the scheme for the full length of their teaching service.  They will be enabled to bring their back services into the scheme for pension purposes by paying in respect of the basic salary they received after the relative years 6½ per cent. of basic and 4½ per cent. of their incremental salary after six years.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that up to the present the schools paid 2½ per cent. of their basic salary and the teachers 4 per cent. of the basic and incremental salary.  Teachers who want to bring back services that they have not covenanted will have to pay arrears of contribution after six years in respect of pension in so far as they wish to bring back years to count for gratuity. They will pay 1½ per cent. of their 1950-51 salary to bring them under the gratuity scheme.</P>
    <P>Then there are persons who are already in the service but have not come in under the present scheme. They, in the same way, will have to pay 6½ per cent. of their basic salary and 4 per cent. of the incremental <Col N="631" /> salary, if they mean to go back and come in under the pension services for the full period of their service and for their full period out of the scheme; they will have to pay 6½ per cent. of the basic and 4 per cent. of the incremental salary and for as many years as they wish to bring in under the gratuity scheme will pay 1½ per cent. on the 1950-51 basic and incremental salary.</P>
    <P>Teachers cannot covenant for longer service naturally under gratuity service than they covenant for under the pension service.</P>
    <P>The other class are those who come into the scheme after the 1st August, 1950, and they come in the same way as the others.  From the date they come in they pay 5 per cent. on their basic salaries and 5 per cent. on their incremental salaries.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides that teachers who retired between the 1st January, 1950, and 1st August, 1950, will be eligible to come into the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme also provides that when a woman teacher leaves the service taking a marriage gratuity, she will not be eligible to return as a teacher.</P>
    <P>These are the main points indicating the benefits of the new scheme and the contributions that they have to be made under it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme is a very important one and it is one that I would have liked a good deal more time to examine.  I confess that in the course of the proceedings <Col N="632" /> of the Seanad last week.  I read through the scheme and that, I admit, was not the proper way to examine it.  It was my intention to look at it later on.  When looking through it last week it occurred to me that there were certain points in it that did not seem to be quite fair to the secondary teachers.  However, I did not know whether they had agreed to these matters or not and I would have liked a little more time to canvass them and ask them if they were satisfied.</P>
    <P>I think we could never do enough for our teachers.  More than once I have pointed out that I have considerable experience of the work of the primary teachers and I have time and again complimented them on their work.  I am in a position to be able to judge pretty well of the work of secondary teachers as a good many of the pupils of secondary teachers come my way in University College, Galway, and I would like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the secondary teaching body for the excellence of the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>In introducing the scheme the Minister dealt with quite a number of points. Might I say in passing that many of these points were of a highly technical nature, and might I suggest that when a matter of so technical a nature as this is being introduced in future the Seanad be given some kind of White Paper, some detailed statement regarding the features of the scheme, its implications and its repercussions?  Some aspects of the scheme are quite acceptable, but quite a few, it seems to me, require further examination and the scheme itself requires amendment. Because I believe that the scheme is unfair, and very unfair in certain aspects, I would like the House not to pass this motion to-night.  I would like if the House, having heard the Minister and perhaps one or two Senators, would agree to postpone the motion to a later date and conclude the discussion then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I think that some aspects of the scheme raise issues of so grave a nature that the Seanad should not be asked to dispose of the motion of this evening.  Having heard the Minister and some of the objections to the scheme, the Seanad might be given an opportunity of looking into the Minister's remarks, and looking more carefully into the scheme as he has drafted it.</P>
      <P>I have become aware that the secondary teachers as a body are not satisfied with this scheme.  From all the discussions and statements in the recent past one would have thought that the teaching profession was in for a paradise on earth.  One would have thought that no issue could arise that could not readily be solved merely by approaching the Minister.  I do not think that the secondary teachers as a body are unreasonable.  Of all sections in the community, considering their work, their responsibilities, the cost of their training, I do not think there is any more reasonable body in the country than the secondary teachers.  Realising that, realising the great value of their work, I would be very sorry to see anything happen that would leave even the remotest cause for dissatisfaction among the members of that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exception may be taken to the scheme under three separate heads. If I mention these three heads to the Minister&mdash;he will be aware of them from his discussions with the teachers already&mdash;and outlined the objections to the features in question I will have done enough on this occasion.  In the first place, the teachers are concerned about the retrospective payments for retirement gratuity.  They are anxious to have this matter examined and, if at all possible, amended and the retrospective payments deleted altogether.  The second grave reason for dissatisfaction has to do with the basis of calculation of retirement gratuity.  I will indicate what is considered a reasonable solution of that aspect of the scheme.  The third reason for dissatisfaction is to be found in the section dealing with <Col N="634" /> married women teachers and their right to come back into the teaching service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first point, a teacher on the maximum of the scale is, under sub-section (f), required to contribute £235 during the next three years.  Provision is made for extending this payment over five years. Teachers on less than the maximum will contribute pro rata.  It is clear that, in all the circumstances, asking the teachers to make this contribution is very unfair.  It means a very heavy burden on them.  Two hundred and thirty-five pounds amounts to roughly £80 a year for three years or £47 a year if divided over five years.  The retrospective payment for the retiring gratuity is grossly unfair, in the opinion of the secondary teachers. Primary teachers get their retiring gratuity gratis.  It seems that in January, 1950, the Government granted all primary teachers a retiring gratuity and they had not to contribute anything towards it.</P>
    <P>The secondary teachers, under the Minister's scheme, are to be penalised in two ways.  In the first place they have to contribute for their pensions. They do not object to that, but they believe they will be penalised sufficiently in having to make that contribution. Then they are expected to pay retrospectively for their gratuities. That, it seems to me, is a reason for dissatisfaction and I hope that we will be able to do something to relieve them of that particular aspect of their burden.  Again, secondary teachers bear in mind the fact that civil servants and the primary teachers have a non-contributory scheme for both pension and gratuities.  I understand they are quite willing to remain contributory, without prejudice, for their pensions and, in the future, for their gratuities; but they believe&mdash;and I think they are right&mdash;that they should not be asked to make retrospective payments in connection with the retiring gratuity.</P>
    <P>They have this further point&mdash;and I think it is a reasonable one&mdash;that when they made their case for an increase in salary they made a case that was unanswerable, <Col N="635" /> but the effect of the retrospective payment to a teacher on the maximum of the scale of salary will be to undo, to nullify for the next five years, the increase in salary that has been granted.  A further point is that a married man who is on his maximum and who became a member of the pension scheme in 1929&mdash;which, as the Minister indicated, was the first year of the scheme&mdash;would now have 21 years' contributory service.  Even granted that he had a present maximum salary of £710 and that the present scheme came into operation in 1929 he would now have contributed only £150 towards his gratuity.  The maximum salary then, for purposes of comparison in case anyone is interested, was £410.  The amount contributed by a teacher not on the maximum would, of course, be considerably less.  All teachers who joined the scheme in 1929 are being asked to pay £235.  This is a grave injustice on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be as well if the scheme were dropped for maybe six months.  That is something the Minister might consider&mdash;to drop the scheme for the next six months and go into the whole matter again with the secondary teachers.  Or, if I had any influence with the secondary teachers, believing that they have a good case I would suggest that the whole matter go to arbitration.  So if Senator Baxter would support me in asking that the scheme be dropped for six months, I would appreciate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>A future teacher coming under the pension scheme and serving 40 years will have contributed £238 towards his gratuity.  Those with 21 years' service are now being asked to pay £235 plus an additional £120 or thereabouts for 19 years' future service. This gives an advantage to the future teachers of £120 over the existing members of the scheme&mdash;which is clearly <Col N="636" /> an injustice to the members of the present scheme.  I do not know what the number of people on the present scheme is, whether 700 or 500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 700.  I said on another occasion it was 500, but it is 700, out of a total of 2,100.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say that the scheme is open to approximately 2,100, but only 700 have decided to take advantage of it.  It seems to me that the amount of money which would be required to give relief to the existing teachers, to abolish this retrospective payment, is so small that the Minister should not object to it.  I wonder what the amount would be&mdash; certainly less than £3,000, I think. Certainly less than £3,000&mdash;between £2,000 and £3,000.  I mean the total. Let me explain what I have in mind. So many teachers will be dropping out year by year.  However, I would rather leave the question of the possible cost of giving relief to these people to be discussed by the Minister.  My own feeling is that it cannot be very great. It would be a small price for the contentment and the goodwill of such an important body as the secondary teachers of the State.  I should not, I suppose, have mentioned any figure, but perhaps the Minister would indicate what the cost might be.</P>

      <P>The people I would be concerned with are those who are members of the scheme at present <Col N="637" /> and who have been members of the scheme for a considerable time past. People coming in, of course, would be forming a new contract.  That, then, as I see it, is the objection to that aspect of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I might mention that any payments made by the secondary teachers in this connection would not rank for income-tax relief.  That is a further burden that would be imposed on the secondary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it certain that payments towards a pension fund do not give a rebate of income-tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that these retrospective payments would not rank for relief of income-tax.  Again, I cannot be quite sure.  I am mentioning these as objections and points for examination.  I mention them as matters that we might look into if given the time to do so.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is that the secondary teachers, as the law stands, cannot possibly get a full retiring gratuity. We have made regulations in the Department regulating entrance to the scheme as secondary teachers.  To the best of my knowledge, a person may not become a secondary teacher until he reaches the age of 21.  I know from experience that very few of the great many people graduating through the university and desiring to be secondary teachers manage to get in at 21 years of age.  I do not know what the average age might be.  It may be somewhere between 26 years and 27 years. Under the regulations, a teacher has to retire at the age of 65.  Let us take 65 as the retiring age.  A teacher getting in at 21 years of age is left with 44 years to qualify for a gratuity. It is thus clear that a person cannot get the full gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers themselves, as far as I know, have made a proposal to the Minister that would ease the position for them.  Their proposal is a reasonable one, and is that 42/28ths should be the basis of calculation as against the basis provided by the Minister in his scheme.  Paragraph 17 (b) of the scheme itself is one that struck me last week as being a strange sub-section. <Col N="638" /> I would like to see that deleted completely.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of approved teaching service before the relevant date, each year of contributing service in respect of which he pays the contribution of 1½ per cent. of the standard salary paid or deemed to have been paid to him during the relevant school year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The third point I mentioned was the position of lady teachers.  The position there also calls for revision.  I think that the lady teachers are unduly penalised.  I would like that whatever representations have been made&mdash;I am not familiar with them but I understand that this matter has been under discussion for some time with the Minister&mdash;by the secondary teachers should be put before the House.  The House should get the opportunity of examining them.  It should get an opportunity of examining the points I have mentioned.  I appreciate that the Minister will have difficulty with the Minister for Finance.  Might I say that in a country where our annual State expenditure is now running well over the £100,000,000 mark and where we are spending if not hundreds of millions but tens of millions on all kinds of schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say whether they are good or bad.  I am pointing out that we are spending tens of millions of pounds on all kinds of schemes.  The expenditure of a few thousand pounds on the part of the State in the interests of the secondary teachers is something we should not cavil at.  For these reasons, I would ask the Minister not to press us for the motion this evening but to give us an opportunity of further examining the scheme.  I would also ask that he might take a further opportunity himself of interviewing the secondary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Ó Buachalla's plea to the Minister that we get some more time to discuss this important matter.  It came as a great shock to me to learn that out of over 2,000 teachers there are <Col N="639" /> only 700 in the scheme.  There must be something wrong with the scheme. There seems to be something wrong with a scheme that only attracts one-third of the total number of secondary teachers into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there are. Unless you make the scheme attractive, teachers will not take part in it.  This retrospective clause which expects teachers to pay back 1½ per cent. of their salary is not going to make the scheme any more attractive than it is. It does not seem to me to be very attractive at the moment, having regard to the fact that only 700 out of 2,000 have accepted the scheme.  The salaries on the higher levels may be good in comparison with the salary generally paid, but, even on the higher levels, this retrospective payment is going to be a heavy burden, particularly on married men with families.  It is not going to tend towards making the scheme attractive, nor is it going to make of those already in the scheme a contented service.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister and to Senator Ó Buachalla, I felt it was a pity that something in the nature of an agreed scheme was not brought before the House.  A comparatively small number of people are involved and it should not have been impossible for the Minister and the teachers to sit down together and evolve a scheme which possibly would not be ideal but which at least would be acceptable. With a body of people like teachers whether primary, secondary or university, the first thing we must have is a contented frame of mind, because, when that is lacking, it does not make for an efficient secondary school system.  I understand that the national teachers get a gratuity without any contribution at all, and, from the information I have, the cost to the State of giving this gratuity to the secondary teachers on the same terms as those on which it is given to the national teachers and, I understand, to the Civil Service, would be a little over £2,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the plea for a postponement <Col N="640" /> of this matter, with a view to seeing if it is not possible to get something in the nature of agreement. That is something which the Minister would like, too.  I do not know whether he has tried to get agreement and has found it impossible, but I imagine that the differences between him and the secondary teachers are not insurmountable, and, if he has not got an agreed settlement up to the present, he ought to make another try.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators who have spoken, I feel at a certain disadvantage in talking about this scheme and I feel it all the more because I ought to be deeply interested.  As one of the members for the universities, a large part of my electorate consists of secondary teachers and I should have liked to have had a proper opportunity of studying the proposals.  I read the debate in the Dáil last week and that debate was adjourned until yesterday. I wonder what the Minister's final words about it were.  At first sight, many of the features seem very attractive, though it gives one pause to find that so many of the secondary teachers have not chosen to avail themselves of the pension scheme.  I hope that the additional benefits which this amended scheme promises will attract more. They certainly look attractive.  There is the retiring gratuity or sum on retirement&mdash;it is not really a gratuity because they have to pay for it.  That is a most useful provision, as are the sum payable after death and the marriage allowances for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are all very commendable features of the scheme, but it is a pity &mdash;I am speaking now in general terms &mdash;that the Minister and the teachers did not, as Senator Colgan suggested, come to an agreement.  We want our body of teachers to be contented, and when we do something for them we want to feel that we have met, so far as our resources permit, their legitimate wants and needs.  This retrospective payment about which there was so much discussion in the Dáil and here to-night, certainly, so far as one can judge&mdash;as I say, I am at a disadvantage, because I have not had an opportunity of studying the <Col N="641" /> scheme sufficiently&mdash;does appear to lay a heavy burden on married men who have reached their maximum and who, in order to get advantage of the full scheme, must undertake very heavy retrospective payments.</P>
    <P>Most of the points I intended to make have already been made, but what I want to impress on the Minister is that, when he does a thing, he should do it so well that everybody will be, if not satisfied, at least moderately satisfied.  It is regrettable that when the retirement gratuity for primary teachers was fixed it was not extended to all teachers.  The Minister knows that during the emergency a great many women were retired compulsorily at 60, before they could possibly have their full pensionable service, and a gratuity for these women at this time would be a godsend, when their small pensions are so devastated&mdash;that is the word for it&mdash; by the rising cost of living.  I wrote to the Minister the other day about one sad case&mdash;I do not know whether he got the letter or not&mdash;but I should like him to think of these poor women to whom, I feel, the Government I support did a grave injustice when they made them retire at 60 to meet a passing difficulty.  They should have got their full pensions and all teachers should get a retiring gratuity.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ensure that, when we pass this amended scheme, there will be no bad taste left in anybody's mouth and that we would make teachers contented as far as possible. The Minister has indicated that the teachers themselves are not very pleased with the scheme.  I have not had an opportunity of discussing it with them, but it is very important that the Minister and the teachers should agree upon a scheme that will not impose too heavy a burden on the public funds.  We are spending money rather recklessly in other directions and we could scarcely spend money on a better object than the provision of retirement pensions for secondary teachers.</P>

      <P>Up to the present, it has been entirely a matter of criticism of this scheme and I agree with some of what Senator Ó Buachalla <Col N="642" /> has said.  I think we have not had quite enough time to consider this motion, but perhaps we may trust to the Minister's wisdom in the matter.  As the governor of a secondary school in Dublin and as one directly interested in education, I should like to say one thing, that is, that, within the past ten years or so, there has been what amounts to a revolution in the status of secondary teachers in this country.  I will not say that they are entirely satisfied. It seems to be a grave political blunder for anyone, except a Government spokesman, ever to say that anyone is entirely satisfied, but I will at least say, from my experience as a governor of a school, that there has been a very marked improvement, and it is very greatly to the credit of the present Minister that that improvement has taken place.</P>
      <P>Speaking as one who trains honours graduates of the university, I should like to say that what I find now is that I can conscientiously recommend these honours graduates to take up secondary teaching, whereas 12 or 15 years ago I could not do so.  Now they are no longer the ill-paid dominies or ill-clad ushers in the school, but members, and able to hold up their heads as members, of a fairly well-paid profession. That is a very important thing in the life of our country.  It means a great deal to universities and others. I should like to offer congratulations to the Minister for going so far.  We hope he will go a little further but I do not think that we should have nothing but entirely captious criticism this evening.</P>
      <P>There is one question which I should like the Minister to answer.  I ask it simply for information.  What exactly is the honours qualification for the extra increments?  If the Minister could let me have that information offhand I should be most greatful.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether anybody in the House has spent as long teaching in a secondary school as I have.  I can remember when secondary teachers were the cinderellas of the teaching profession. Indeed, you could almost say that secondary teachers were the cinderellas of all workers in the country.  They were the worst paid, the worst treated, and they had insecurity of tenure lower than any other form of casual labour. That position has been very materially altered.  I was Minister for Education for a short time.  One of my ambitions was to introduce a scale of increments for secondary teachers.  At that time it was thought to be a matter of very great import.  I did not do it because I was not left there long enough.  It should be remembered that the note struck by Senator Professor Stanford is, after all, a note that should be struck.  There are natural complaints that always arise when people are given something and find that it is not enough.  Senator Liam Ó Buachalla supported a Government for 16 years and surely he is not in earnest when he says that a document signed by the Minister for Education and also by the Minister for Finance must not leave the remotest cause for dissatisfaction. Surely that is an idealistic and idyllic suggestion.  Surely it is hoping for too much to suggest that when the Minister for Finance signs his name to a document&mdash;whatever his name may be &mdash;the people who will benefit as a result of the signature of that document will be in the position of not having the remotest cause for dissatisfaction. That is a Utopian notion which we <Col N="644" /> cannot expect to realise.  Even the farmers are not satisfied&mdash;not to mention the teachers.</P>

      <P>They are very near it&mdash;and they are not as vocal as the other members of the community. They are nice quiet retiring people. At any rate, an incremental scheme was introduced for teachers in 1924 and a pensions scheme in 1929.  The position of secondary teachers is not as simple as the position of primary teachers, as Senator Liam Ó Buachalla and Senator Mrs. Concannon know. They are in the very peculiar position of being the employees of privately-controlled schools.  They are paid, as regards their increments and pensions, by the State, but, as regards their basic salary, by the school.  This is very complicated and it is not easy to make a pensions scheme easy to read and to grasp at a glance.  Since the present Minister came into office three new things mentioned in this particular scheme have been introduced, namely, death benefits, marriage gratuities and retiring allowances. There are many improvements in the position of secondary teachers which this particular Minister and this Government have to their credit&mdash; death benefit and marriage gratuity. There is also the matter of retiring allowance to their credit.  As well as that, married men, who had an initial increment of £80, have had that increment doubled to £160.  Instead of going from £80 to £410, their increments now start at £160 and go up to £470.  That is a substantial improvement on what was there before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that Senator Liam Ó Buachalla can hardly hope to press his point that the scheme should be dropped for six months.  If his suggestion were put into effect, certain people going on pension would surely lose, unless the scheme, when adopted, were made retrospective.  I have had some experience of the Department of Education.  It spends a great deal of money and it is constantly dealing with the Minister for Finance.  No Minister for Education <Col N="645" /> in any Government, no matter who he may be, can hope always to get for the teachers the things he wants for them.  Every possible scheme about teachers is a compromise between the Department of Education and the Department of Finance, or between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I do not know that six months' negotiation would help us.  Senator Liam Ó Buachalla asked what power had we with regard to this scheme.  As far as I know, we have power only to reject it.  We have no power to alter it. Presumably, the only alteration anybody wants to make is one which would involve an increased charge on public funds.  We have no power, nor have the members of the Dáil any power to do that.  The scheme is a very substantial improvement and it should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of retrospective payments.  It is easy for me&mdash; it is not quite as easy for me as it is for Senator Liam Ó Buachalla, in our present positions&mdash;or for any of us who are not Ministers to say that we think certain payments should be made. Retrospective payments are for retrospective benefits.  Nobody is compelled to take them.  A teacher going out on the 31st July this year would pay in, by way of arrears, something over £210. He would receive a lump sum of £660&mdash; a sum which he would not have been eligible for at all before this Minister came to improve the conditions of secondary teachers.  Therefore, the retrospective payments are for retrospective <Col N="646" /> benefits.  If they could be given without payment, so much the better.</P>
    <P>Nobody has more sympathy for the secondary teachers than I have.  I understand their position and the very important work which they do.  No scheme can be perfect.  This scheme is not perfect, but it can be claimed for it that it is a very important improvement on the situation as it existed before.  Unfortunately, the secondary teachers have a history and, as often occurs, out of the history arise certain difficulties.  Nevertheless, I think we should be glad that their position has been improved, even though it has not been made perfect.</P>
    <P>There is no use in delaying the putting of this good scheme into operation, in the hope that it will become better merely by talking to somebody. I feel that the resourcefulness of the Minister himself in argument and in contention with the Department of Finance has got all that can possibly be got in the matter.  We are not all able to do exactly everything we like to do.  Therefore, I think that this particular scheme should be put into operation and should not be delayed. Senators, having had the scheme for a week, could have studied it.  I do not know what benefit would accure to us by postponing it further.  We cannot amend it in the sense in which we should like to amend it.  Therefore, I think we ought to let it go and to let the teachers get the benefits under it.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that I agree with everything Senator Hayes has said and before the Seanad considers the suggestion of Senator Ó Buachalla to put the matter back for six months we should have some estimate of the opinion of secondary teachers who will benefit by this Bill. In the absence of a direction from the majority of these people I would be slow to follow the suggestion of Senator Ó Buachalla.  I think the majority of secondary teachers would be very disappointed if it was decided to shelve this scheme for another six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get from the Minister the exact amount which it would cost the State, if it bore <Col N="647" /> the retrospective payments which would have to be made in the case of those people who would opt into the scheme. The Minister has stated that there are 2,100 secondary teachers in the country and that only 700 of them are in the pension scheme.  As Senator Colgan has pointed out there must be something very wrong with the scheme when only 700 out of 2,100 have taken advantage of it.  I am convinced that the total cost to the State of bearing these retrospective contributions would be rather low but they are rather heavy on the teachers themselves.  As Senator Ó Buachalla has pointed out the making of these retrospective contributions would cancel out the increases that the teachers got over a period of five years.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister also to give consideration to the case of women teachers who have got married and because of situations arising in the normal course over which they have no control, find themselves in a worse position than that of an ex-teacher who has been widowed.  While a widow is entitled to go back to her position in such cases the other woman is not entitled to go back.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister a few questions.  I quite appreciate the improvement that has taken place in the case of the secondary teachers but my duty is to point out the difficulties of the scheme. The Minister stated that it would take <Col N="648" /> £50,000 to liquidate certain responsibilities. Does that cover all the applicants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it only covers those in the scheme.  In reply to Senator Hawkins it would take £195,000 to cover the back service for all those coming into the scheme, i.e., the 2,100.  It would take that amount to cover their back service before August, 1950, for retirement and gratuity.</P>
      <P>I appreciate very much the remarks of Senator Stanford and might I say that I quite appreciate the encouraging criticism from Senators Ó Buachalla, Mrs. Concannon and others who have spoken on behalf of the secondary teachers?</P>
      <P>I do think that teachers generally in the country are more understood and that throughout the country their work whether primary, secondary or vocational is fully appreciated.  I think that is more and more so in recent years, because the importance of education is being appreciated and the importance of the teacher and the type of service he or she is rendering is appreciated too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of this scheme have been criticised, but let me stand back a little.  The Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1928 made provision for the making of a scheme of superannuation for teachers generally.  There was a certain type of compulsory scheme for national teachers paid by themselves. There was no scheme for secondary teachers.  The primary teachers had a contributory scheme.  After the secondary teachers had their scheme made, apart altogether from the fact that the primary teacher had a contributory scheme, the circumstances in which the secondary teachers were, deterred them from a scheme which would be contributory when set up.  Their scheme was set up in 1929 and subsequently in 1934, I think it was, modified arrangements were made in regard to primary teachers, which took certain powers in the 1928 Act, giving a scheme for primary teachers' interests.  It was non-contributory as far as administration and machinery went but, in fact, there was a reduction in the salaries <Col N="649" /> of national teachers at that time to meet that scheme.  Vocational teachers under the Act of 1948 were brought compulsorily into the superannuation scheme and they, by statute, had to pay 5 per cent. of their salaries towards that scheme, so that the contributory scheme for secondary teachers has to be seen in that light.</P>
    <P>This scheme for superannuation has already been delayed for a considerable time.  I appreciate the difficulties of Senators and Deputies in taking the present scheme, reading it and understanding it.  Part of the delay in bringing the Bill before both Houses of the Oireachtas was the difficulties experienced in drafting the scheme which really arose out of contemporaneous discussions with representatives of the secondary teachers on the question of salaries also.  After dealing with the salaries questions and superannuation scheme for the primary teachers I turned to dealing with secondary teachers' positions and the question of new scales and the improvements of the superannuation scheme were discussed.  The new scales of salaries came into operation from 1st January, 1950, and you will see the benefit of this scheme came into operation on 1st August, 1950, but provision is made so that teachers who retire on or subsequent to the 1st January, 1950, will come under the scheme.</P>
    <P>On the question of delaying the matter further, having dealt with the primary teachers and their scales of superannuation and having dealt with the scales of secondary teachers and hoping to stabilise at any rate at this point and in relation to the present scales the superannuation scheme, provision has been made for setting up conciliation and arbitration machinery to deal with primary teachers and with the affairs of secondary teachers too.  A scheme of conciliation and arbitration has actually been agreed in relation to primary teachers and I am in the final stages of discussions with representatives of the various secondary teachers' organisations to settle their scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  The matters that would be referable to the conciliation are <Col N="650" /> scales, emoluments and the principles regarding superannuation.  The matters referable to arbitration following on successful conciliation would be scales of salaries and emoluments.  There are statutory and constitutional reasons why matters dealing with the direct scheme of superannuation could not be referred to arbitration, but the principles governing superannuation and retirement allowances can be discussed under the new scheme at conciliation level.  To delay the passage of this scheme therefore would serve no useful purpose at all.  It would create a situation in which teachers who retired during the year 1950 and who would be entitled to benefits under this scheme would possibly be deprived of these benefits and would have to wait, not until the new scheme had been set up, but until the case had been taken before conciliation machinery.</P>
    <P>People have expressed wonder at why only 700 out of 2,100 teachers were under the previous scheme, but when you consider how little was to be got out of the previous scheme and the number of secondary teachers who are members of religious orders you will have a certain explanation of that. There was nothing to be got under the previous scheme except the pension.  In respect of death, disability after less than ten years and in respect of short service you got nothing but your refund, and in the case of disability your refund with compound interest as well, so there is an excuse there.  The general type of benefit to be got under the new proposals would, I should say, attract a much greater number of people.</P>
    <P>The principal objection is that what are called retrospective payments are being asked for in respect of death and lump sum gratuities.  There is no compulsion on teachers to take advantage of that, but if they do want in respect of a lump sum or death gratuity to claim in respect of services in the past, then all that is being asked of them is that they make a covenant payment in respect of these years of service.  They will receive in actual payment some time something like three times the amount of money they will pay in.</P>

      <P>No, members of the old scheme are exactly the same as new members.  They are asked: &ldquo;How many years of your past service do you want to include for a lump sum gratuity either by way of death or retirement allowances?&rdquo;  The very same question is being put to the members of the present scheme as to the members who are given an opportunity of coming in.  There is no difference at all in that.  In respect of the year before 1st August, 1950, nobody will have credit for a year of service with regard to retirement or death allowances except they make the payment of 1½ per cent. in respect of that year.  The same applies to the people who are coming in as to the people who are already in. In so far as the word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo; is used, if you want to get credit for a year's service in the past you are asked to pay for it, and you are not asked to pay if you do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no compulsion to make use of your past service for your lump sum, but there is very considerable advantage in doing so, because, in respect of any year of service that is counted, you will receive when you come to retire or on death 1/30th of your pensionable year's service.  That is about 3½ per cent.  You are only asked to pay 1½ per cent. to convenant for that, so that&mdash;very many cases could be cited of what the result would be&mdash;briefly the result would be that you get £3 10s. 0d. for every £1 10s. 0d. that you have paid.  I do admit that there is a certain difficulty for certain people in making up that amount inside five years, but it is a contributory scheme.  The fund, I suppose, could be said to be burst to the extent that within the last ten years the State has had to pay £33,000 to keep up the payments.  During the calendar year 1950, £13,600 will come to be paid in respect of retirements alone.  In making these payments about one-third will be deducted for the purpose of covenanting for that, but the rest of it will be the net sum payable to people who retire.  Any <Col N="652" /> delay will prejudice that and I do not think it would bring a satisfactory result for anyone.</P>
    <P>Two other points have been made. The first is the case of a woman who accepts a marriage gratuity not being allowed back as long as her husband is alive.  Secondary teachers, however, are not compelled to retire on marriage.  In the case of civil servants, primary teachers and vocational teachers, when they accept a marriage gratuity they go and there is an inevitable equation of all these things that some people might like to avoid.  Nevertheless, the situation is there with regard to primary teachers, vocational teachers and civil servants.  There is being retained in this scheme for women teachers the right to remain on teaching although married and not accept a marriage gratuity.  To that extent, that concession is being retained to women secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>On the point that secondary teachers cannot get in on full recognised teaching staff until they may be 22, 23 or 24, there is no injustice in that.  If, in the Civil Service or any other walk of life, by serving for 45 years you are able to get 45/30ths of your retiring salary as a gratuity, you get that in respect of service rendered.  The secondary teacher on retiring will get the 40, 41 or 42/30ths, as the case may be, of his retiring salary, as a retiring grant on going out.  That is, they get what they have covenanted for in respect of service given.  In that way they are no different from professional employees who enter the Civil Service&mdash;maybe an engineer or an architect of 28 or 30 years of age&mdash;as, when they come to retiring age, they can get only a retiring allowance based on the number of years' service.  From the point of view of the Department of Finance, there is that analogy.  We are not able to get rid of that here.  The principle that is common to all these schemes is there, that you get 1/30th of your pensionable salary for every year that you have served, on retiring.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Seanad that all these matters have been most carefully gone over, even to a much <Col N="653" /> greater extent of time than I would like to have seen given to them.  I would like to have seen this scheme before the Seanad and Dáil long ago.  When you consider the principles on which it is put together and the advance that it makes in the facilities that it offers, and that it is being done in relation to a revision of salaries that took place last year and that came into operation from the 1st January, 1950, and that this is a cleaning up of things as far as I can clear them up on the eve of the introduction of a policy where the whole of these things go to conciliation and arbitration machinery, perhaps the Seanad will agree with me that the best thing is to let this Order pass, to leave these principles of benefit as they are being established and to leave the question of modifications to arise through the form of machinery which I hope will be set up as an agreed scheme of conciliation and arbitration within, say, the next fortnight or so.</P>

On the whole, I think that all the local bodies are properly catered for, that the committee is well <Col N="654" /> balanced and that there is no necessity to add to it.  I know it is not a vital point, but perhaps Senator Fitzsimons will agree that there is adequate representation for all local bodies and that we should see how the committee as it came from the other House would work.  I would ask Senator Fitzsimons not to press these amendments.</P>

      <P>I understand that Senator Hayes, who is piloting this Bill here, does not deem it wise to accept my amendment.  The whole of provincial and rural Ireland is not getting adequate representation on the Meath Hospital Committee.  Two people&mdash;leaving out the City and County of Dublin&mdash;from the remainder of the Twenty-Six Counties are not adequate.  I think this was a just request.  Now that Senator Hayes is piloting this Bill, I wonder if he would consider giving four members to the General Council of County Councils&mdash; one from Connaught, one from the three Ulster counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, one from Munster and one from Leinster.  I am not particular as to whether the four are from the General Council of County Councils or the municipal authorities' association, but I think two are not fair to the remainder of the Twenty-Six Counties when you have Dublin City and County represented.</P>

      <P>The hospital is, in the main, for Dublin City and County. I do not think there is any necessity for all-State representation.  The two representatives already are sufficient.  To tell the truth, I would like also to facilitate the passage of the Bill through the other House, by making as little change as possible.  In my opinion, the representation from the Dublin City Council, the Dublin Corporation and the General Council of County Councils is quite sufficient.  I doubt that the people would be anxious to come to Dublin.</P>

      <P>This Meath Hospital Bill has put us into unique positions. May I be permitted to read Senator Quirke's amendment as altered now? It will make the whole sub-section read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The hospital corporation members shall be elected on the proportional representation system by postal vote of the persons qualified to vote at the election.  In the first election year the election shall be conducted and carried out by a person appointed for the purpose by the Dublin City Manager in accordance with the rules made by the Dublin City Manager; in any election year (other than the first election year) the election shall be conducted and carried out by a person appointed for the purpose by the joint committee in accordance with rules made by the joint committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first election is left to the Dublin City Manager and thereafter subsequent elections are left to the joint committee, which will make rules for the conduct of the elections.</P>

      <P>It is a matter upon which the Seanad can congratulate itself that we were able to discuss this Bill without a single harsh word being spoken or without any reflection being made on any individual and without getting ourselves into the various difficult tangles which arose in connection with this matter in the other House. It has been stated that the only matter at issue was the interests of the patients.  The Dáil Committee did a very good job on this Bill and worked in a very good spirit indeed.  I think that I am expressing the views of everybody in this House when I express the hope that this very unique combination of effort will enable the hospital to continue the work it has been doing for 200 years past.  The Meath Hospital is an old building.  It is now being modernised.  We should remember that slick, modern efficiency is not the only thing necessary in a hospital.  There is also need for harmony, kindliness and self sacrifice&mdash;attributes which Irish doctors and Irish hospitals have never lacked.  We are hopeful that this Bill will enable the Meath Hospital to continue the good work it has been doing in the interests of the patients and the poor.</P>
