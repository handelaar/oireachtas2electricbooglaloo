      <P>It seems to me rather a pity that this Bill should go through automatically in this way. Sadly, curiously, there is no representative from the City of Waterford in the Seanad.  It is rather regrettable <Col N="26" /> that the fourth city of Ireland should not have a personal representative in the Seanad, and someone has just said that neither has it one in the Dáil, at least one who actually lives in the city.  As I spent a good many years of my life in the City of Waterford, I feel it would be an act of discourtesy to that ancient city to rush through a Bill of this kind without a word and I propose, with the indulgence of the Seanad, to say a word or two on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Ever since the Norsemen discovered the City of Waterford it has been amongst the leading ports of this country.  Having lived there myself I have had an opportunity of knowing that the Harbour Commissioners of Waterford have a very high reputation for efficiency and energy and as this Bill is a Bill to help them in their work something should be said on it.</P>
      <P>The Port of Waterford has its difficulties, in spite of its natural advantages. For one thing, there is a great deal of silting mud coming down from the rich country of Tipperary.  I do not know whether the Tipperary men have any grievance against Waterford on that account, but it gives a great deal of trouble to the Harbour Commissioners and, to judge from what I have seen of them in action, they cope with it by dredging and otherwise very efficiently.</P>
      <P>The winding channel of the Suir and the strong currents and tides in that estuary also cause difficulties to shipping. It should be put on record in this House how well, up to the present, the commissioners have coped with those difficulties.  Waterford is a well-managed port.  It serves almost a quarter of this country and any Bill or any movement which makes the work of the commissioners easier should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of it which I should like to mention.  We hear again and again of the evils of centralisation and there has been a tendency in recent years to bring almost all the main shipping of the Republic of Ireland to Dublin.  It has its advantages, but it has grave disadvantages also.  Recently, Dublin Port was paralysed when Waterford and Cork were both free for receiving <Col N="27" /> ships and, on that account, as a movement towards decentralisation and helping these provincial ports, the Bill also deserves support.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak at length on this, but I feel that the ancient and honourable <i>Urbs Intacta</i> deserves a word of commendation in this Seanad. To pass this Bill merely formally, to my mind, would be a slight on it.  I only wish there were a City of Waterford man here to speak more fully on it.  I would like to emphasise before this House that the City of Waterford continues to play a very honourable part in both the cultural life and the industrial life of the country and, simply as a tribute to that valuable port, I should like to add a word on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I understand that this is an agreed measure.  There has been no opposition to it from the Waterford end.  There is no opposition to it here.  I agree with Senator Stanford when he speaks about the importance of Waterford City.  Certainly, it is a city of great interest and in past centuries it has made a very big contribution to the life of this country. To pass this measure without any discussion on it&mdash;as we were about to do&mdash; indicates that we were all thoroughly in agreement with it.</P>
      <P>The difficulty about Waterford is that the channel is very winding.  Mud from County Tipperary comes down and chokes it up occasionally.  This makes it extremely difficult to operate and fairly heavy tonnage cannot get up the river.  This Bill intends, apparently, to extend the powers of the port authorities and it will enable them to drain the river more effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of the Waterford Harbour Commissioners. We requested the Minister to allow us to introduce this private Bill and he agreed to do all we asked him to do.  I did not intend to stand up here to-day and start a full-scale debate on Waterford Harbour, on the merits of decentralisation and on the making of Waterford Harbour and other harbours as important as Dublin Harbour.  If <Col N="28" /> we were to discuss all that on a private Bill of this kind some of us would not get home for the Christmas holidays.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Stanford said what he did say about Waterford because, undoubtedly, it is one of our most important ports.  Anybody who has read the newspapers over the week-end, and those of us who were at the opening of the new North Wharf at Waterford last Saturday, will realise that the people of Waterford are alive to the possibilities of their port and that the Government is willing to help.  The previous Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced this Order which we are confirming to-day.  We have received every consideration from the officials in connection with any representations which we made in connection with this Bill and even with regard to amendments. In every way they tried to facilitate us and to help with regard to any little difficulties which we may have had.</P>
      <P>There is one point of a general nature to which I should like to refer. We have now started our own merchant marine in this country.  I think we shall have to ask the central government to put our harbours in such a condition that the ships of our merchant marine will be able to use our ports.  At present ships of 9,500 tons can enter only one or two of our ports.  It is a great pity that such ships are not able to use all our ports because it would tend towards decentralisation.  We want Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford to have all the facilities which Dublin will have.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for giving us all stages of this Bill in one day.</P>

      <P>I feel like congratulating Senator Stanford for, if you like, departing from tradition in opening up a discussion on this Bill.  It is generally understood that a private Bill is an agreed measure, or if it is not an agreed measure it is referred to a Committee of both Houses.  I think that no harm but rather a certain amount of good has been done by opening up a short discussion such as that which we have had to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> Senator Stanford said that we have no representative from Waterford in the House.  That is scarcely correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if the citizens of Waterford City had the selection of a representative they would not hesitate to elect Senator Goulding.  He has represented Waterford County and City for a number of years, and I have no doubt that he will continue to do so for a further number of years.</P>
      <P>With regard to decentralisation of industry, I think that we have had a fair indication of the attitude of the present Government in that connection. Within the past week the Minister for Industry and Commerce has opened a north wharf in Waterford which will result, I feel sure, in adding considerably to the commerce of the city and of that part of the country, including, of course, Tipperary.  It is of the utmost importance that Waterford Port should be developed.  It is regrettable that the people who were nominated by the Government previous to the last one did not take their duties sufficiently seriously to attend a reasonable number of meetings of that particular body.  However, it is encouraging that they are now sitting up and taking notice&mdash;probably as a result of the attitude last week of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope we shall see a considerable development of the Port of Waterford.  There are some people here who may have heard their fathers talking about the time&mdash;about 100 years ago&mdash;when the Port of Waterford used to have no less than 60 ships in it at the same time.  It is regrettable that, over the years, the situation has changed so that to-day it is almost a matter for celebration or wonder that there is a ship at all in the Port of Waterford.  However, things are changing.  The developments which are taking place will, I believe, prove beneficial to the Port of Waterford.  I have in mind, in particular, the export of beef&mdash;frozen beef, chilled beef, beef in cans and in other forms rather than <Col N="30" /> beef on the hoof.  At one time Waterford had a big export of beef on the hoof.</P>
    <P>Now, I believe, it is coming back to its own and that it will have that particular type of trade in the future. Similarly, Waterford used to have large imports of coal.  During the years that industry, also, was knocked on the head.  There have been further developments, and I believe that, as a result of the policy of the development of Irish industry of every description, Waterford Port&mdash;if it has the backing of the Waterford Harbour Commissioners, the local authorities and so forth; certainly it has the backing of the Government&mdash;will develop, and will once more be in a condition similar to that in which it was 60 to 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the time when we will have for export from this country goods which were imported for a considerable number of years. Developments have been taking place, as a result of which goods are now being exported from this country which were being imported for practically the past 100 years.  I look forward to the day when, instead of importing coal, we shall have a development whereby the Port of Waterford and other ports will be busy with the export of turf from this country.  That may seem to be an exaggeration to-day, but I do not believe it is.  I hope the day will come when everything that can possibly be manufactured on a surplus basis in this country will be exported and that the exports will take place not only through Dublin, but also through Waterford, Cork, Galway, Sligo and so forth.</P>

      <P>Senator Stanford started something when he said that there was no representative of Waterford in the Seanad.  The place seems to be alive with Waterford men.  I happen to be a Waterford man, too, and there are a few more sitting behind me.  It is hardly necessary to point out that in the Seanad we do not have direct representation of cities and places because the Seanad is a vocational body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> I am sure the people of Waterford will be very pleased to hear that so much interest was taken in this Bill to-day.  Long ago, when I lived in Waterford, the port used to be alive with shipping.  Every evening ships could be seen coming into and going out of the harbour.  I hope that as a result of the steps now being taken by the Government under this Bill we shall see Waterford harbour restored to that happy position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Stanford for provoking this discussion. In matters relating to an agreed measure, we generally let things go through without any discussion.  I suggest that the discussion started by Senator Stanford has done no harm.</P>
      <P>One thing which I noticed very pointedly was that both Tipperary Senators&mdash;Senators Burke and Quirke &mdash;ignored his statement that the cause of the trouble to the Waterford people was the mud which came down from Tipperary.  We complain a lot of the fact, which is true, that Dublin is top heavy in relation to the rest of the country.  I think it should be the policy of any Government to develop our harbours, in whatever part of the country they are, to encourage trade to come to them and go out from them. That would probably help to keep people in occupations and make them reasonably satisfied to stay in their particular part of the country.  It is very easy to tell people to stay at home, but I suggest that one of the ways to keep them at home is by creating work and by encouraging trade into our various harbours.  We have some of the finest harbours in the world if they were developed.  I congratulate Senator Stanford for provoking this discussion which, I think, has been very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an agreed measure.  Not only is it an agreed measure but it was specifically requested by the Harbour Commissioners in Waterford, who are representative of Waterford Corporation, Chamber of Commerce, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and Live <Col N="32" /> Stock, Labour and fishing interests. Thus, it can truly be said to be an agreed measure.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford, who spoke first, connected the Bill largely with decentralisation. It, in fact, arises out of a specific instance of decentralisation in industry.  There is an extensive cardboard factory in the course of erection by the National Board and Paper Mills at Grannagh, County Kilkenny, which is outside the present limitation of the jurisdiction of the Waterford Harbour Commissioners. The commissioners desired to bring the landing piers for that site within their jurisdiction, and made application for this Order.  The Order is entitled as contained in the schedule to the Bill&mdash; Waterford (Extension of Harbour Limits) Harbour Works Order, 1951. Under the provision of Section 135, sub-section (1) of the Harbours Acts, 1946, the Order requires implementation by the Oireachtas before it has any effect.  The limits of the area of the jurisdiction of the Harbour Commissioners are being extended to the extent of about three miles along the landward side of the River Suir.  It takes in an area which, at the present time, extends beyond the site of this proposed new factory, but it will facilitate the commissioners, in the event of further industrial development along this area, to erect buoys, do the necessary dredging and in return therefor to collect the requisite dues that will come in from the shipping interests coming there.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything else I need add at this stage except to say that I am glad Senator MacFadden did not stand up and lay claim to be a Waterford man; otherwise we would have had to travel a lot of country before we got this Bill through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, may I inquire if it is not usual to give such information as we have just been given in introducing a Bill rather than at the end?  Further, I must say I reserve the right&mdash;and I am sure every other Senator reserves the right&mdash;to speak on a private Bill if he wishes so to do.  It seems to me that this policy of having an agreed <Col N="33" /> measure upon which nothing will be said is a most dangerous policy, and I personally will oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to give effect to Orders made by the predecessor of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce earlier this year, the first being the Imposition of Duties (No. 26) Order, 1951, which was made on the 20th April, 1951, and came into operation on the 27th of that month.  That Order refers to the imposition of duty on commodities which are abrasives.  These are manufactured by Abrasives, Limited, Kilmainham, Dublin, who employ about 35 persons.  The output of the company is increasing steadily and they are developing an export trade. It is estimated that the value of the home market for abrasives of the type being produced by Abrasives, Limited, is about £45,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second Order was made on 3rd May of this year and came into operation on 10th May.  That Order imposes <Col N="35" /> a duty on saws and saw blades which are manufactured by Sandersons of Newbridge, Limited.  The firm affords employment to some 28 persons.  The company commenced production in 1948 with the manufacture of files and hacksaw blades and these articles were afforded protection at the rate of 37½ per cent. full and 25 per cent. preferential. In January, 1950, the tariff was increased to 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential.  Early in 1951, the company commenced production of wood saws and applied to have the duty extended to include these articles. The Orders which have been made by the predecessor of the present Minister will have effect only for eight months, as the House is aware, and, unless this legislation is passed, will cease to have effect at the end of that period, and I ask the House to give all stages of the Bill to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that this Bill would have been recommended by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is an old friend as well as an old opponent of mine.  I have pleasant recollections of numerous debates in which we both took part on former occasions, and I had looked on this occasion as a means of making a kind of range-finding speech to find out whether during the three years he and I were, so to speak, in the political wilderness he had added to his stock of political wisdom and I, perhaps, had added a little to mine, and whether we had come nearer together or had, perhaps, drifted apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with a Bill like this it would be desirable to have some explanation of the general economic policy which the Government is pursuing in introducing measures of this kind.  It is not the only one we have had over many years and it is typical of many we have had.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not responsible for having introduced this particular tax. I think it was introduced by the previous Government in the month of April but the present Government cannot escape responsibility for confirming that duty now, and if I have any criticism to make of the economic policy underlying this and similar measures, <Col N="36" /> that criticism is directed just as much against the present Government as against the former Government or vice versa.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration for the Minister for Industry and Commerce which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will share, but if he has a fault at all it is a fault he shares with the poets and, in particular, with the great lyric poet, Pindar, who on one occasion was advised by a lady friend to sow with the hand and not with the whole sack. In his diligence at sowing new industries throughout the country the Minister has been inclined to be rather diffuse and indiscriminate and I should like to repeat Corinna's advice to Pindar in reference to the Minister.  I suggest that discrimination should be exercised in the choice of new industries, and in particular, every effort should be made to see that they fit in with the general national economy, and will add to the real income of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Pursuing the same analogy, I might compare, not perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, but the Minister with the Sower in the Parable.  I have often wondered why the sower in that famous parable in the New Testament allowed so much seed to fall anywhere on the roadside or in the ditches or hedges instead of on the good well-tilled-ground.  I think that, if careful examination is made, it will probably be discovered that the sower was using a sack which was moth-eaten or full of mouseholes and I sometimes suspect that the sack in which the Minister carries his industrial seeds contains a number of mouseholes or is moth-eaten, with the result that he sometimes drops industries inadvertently without due regard for the general circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>However, I am only too glad to recognise that some seeds fell on good ground and that in the course of the past ten or 20 years we have had established a few industries which were well worth while and which are a source of real strength to our economy; but on the other hand there are one or two instances in which we have encouraged the development of <Col N="37" /> certain industries, which no doubt added to our industrial output but diminished our agricultural output by as much as, and perhaps by a greater amount, than they added to our industrial output.  I should like to give an example of that kind of thing, because it has come under my own notice that there is in a town in the Midlands a factory producing wallboard which uses, as its raw material, straw, and one result of that factory's operations has been to bribe the farmers in all that neighbourhood to sell their straw for money to that factory, instead of having it tramped into manure and returned to the ground to fertilise it for future crops.  In other words, the farmers have been bribed, as a result of that industry, to sell and to undermine the permanent fertility of their soil.  That, as any agriculturalist will tell you, is a thoroughly objectionable thing and a policy which we should by no means favour.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the matter.  On the whole, we have been too much inclined to establish new industries in the east central region of the country, which is a region of great potential agricultural improvement but rather short of manpower. There is a real shortage of agricultural manpower in some of the best farming areas in the east central counties largely as a result of the competition for labour resulting from these new industries now established in so many of our provincial towns. In fact, I know cases in which farmers' sons, who should be working on the family farms which are half neglected, are instead cycling seven, eight and ten miles to work in factories in the neighbouring town, and a farmer here and there might be found who neglects his own farm, who lets it on the 11-months system and makes a living working in one of these new factories.</P>
    <P>Any industrial policy which has the incidental result of bringing about the neglect of agriculture is taking away as much from the national income with the one hand as it adds to it with the other, and we should use a wiser discrimination with regard to that kind of development.  On the other hand, take, for example, the <Col N="38" /> case of beet.  There was a time when I was highly critical of the whole beet policy pursued by this and the former Government, but on the whole, I think that world economic circumstances have changed, and have justified in the event the policy which was pursued in establishing beet growing here and aiming at producing most of our sugar supplies from our own resources; but, in this very area I have in mind, where there are numerous factories in the local country towns, the beet-growing efforts of the farmers are restricted and inhibited because they cannot count on the necessary labour to harvest additional areas of beet and the reason they cannot get that labour is that people are cycling seven, eight and ten miles to a neighbouring town to work in factories instead of working on the land; so that, if you want more beet, you will have to go slow in the matter of establishing new industries in these east central urban centres.</P>
    <P>In fact, I would say: &ldquo;Pipe down on industrial development so far as the fertile agricultural regions are concerned, which are short of man-power,&rdquo; but I would go on to add: &ldquo;Pipe up on industrial development in the congested districts,&rdquo; where I would welcome the prospect of the Government seriously tackling the question of industrialisation, especially in the Gaeltacht areas.  There is one qualification I have to make.  Even in the rich agricultural areas which are short of man-power, I welcome the present tendency to develop new industries directly related to the processing of our own agricultural raw materials.  In particular, I have in mind the present strongly-marked tendency towards meat processing factories to replace the former practice, which was almost universal, of exporting cattle on the hoof.  That is one exception to the undesirability of establishing new industries in the rich east central agricultural regions.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost sympathy with any policy which may be devised to give a thoroughly sound economic basis to the people of the Gaeltacht and the congested areas.  There you have a situation in which agricultural resources are all too scant and man-power has <Col N="39" /> hitherto been all too numerous.  Now we are facing a situation in which the man-power will disappear unless we provide a means of making a tolerable living for the people of the Gaeltacht and diminish the necessity under which many find themselves of either migrating or emigrating.  I do not think that the policy of industrialising the Gaeltacht is by any means a chimerical dream.  It has been done, and done successfully, in one important part of the Gaeltacht, in Templecrone in South Donegal, where Paddy Gallagher has worked miracles in developing the whole industrial life of the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>If we could by some magic create numerous Paddy Gallaghers throughout the whole of the Gaeltacht, we could transform the whole of that part of the country within one generation. The Minister has elsewhere complained that, whereas industrial output has increased by a substantial percentage in the last ten or 20 years, agricultural output is barely back at pre-war level.  I admit that fact and I also deplore it.  I suggest that to some extent this indiscriminate policy, to which I have referred, is to blame for the fact that agricultural output has failed to expand, and that he has been taking away from agriculture with the one hand what he gave to industry with the other.  In general, I would like to assure the House that I, too, am in favour of a wise policy of agricultural plus industrial development going hand in hand together, with the big brother, agriculture, leading the way, of course.</P>
    <P>I apologise if I have said too much about agriculture.  I spent my temporary exile from this House in writing a book about agriculture.  I hope it will have the result of preventing me from making long speeches about it in the future, as I will be able to refer Senators to the appropriate chapter and page of that book instead.  A copy of it will, no doubt, be found in the Library.  I hope I have trodden on the coat of the Parliamentary Secretary or of certain other members of the House, who may be disposed to add their contribution to this debate, <Col N="40" /> and so let us have a real debate about one of the most important aspects of our economic policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer to the remarks we have heard in the Dáil where, coincident with the desire for more industries and more enterprise on the part of our much maligned industrialists, prominent members in the Dáil have urged that there should be a more stringent review of the industries themselves.  Surely it is illogical to expect enterprising people to start industries&mdash;and many of them are just as ardent for industrial development, apart from the monetary return, as their critics are&mdash;unless they are permitted to initiate and develop their industries without constant carping and, I say quite deliberately, ill-informed criticism, so ill-informed as to amount to venom, with no other effect than to injure the industries concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnston has spoken about industrialisation generally.  We have a Department of State which exercises a very strict surveillance over protected industries and to which all people engaged in those industries have to submit the most detailed information. That should be accepted and the industries generally should not be subjected to ill-informed and venomous attacks, based upon insufficient information, which do no good to anyone and instead produce splash headlines in the papers, reckless of the injury they do to the industry generally.  I could say very much more about this, but perhaps the point I have made is sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us when replying if all types of saws are included in the restrictions which have been imposed.  I had occasion recently to be interested in procuring a circular saw and found it difficult to get even a second-hand one.  I hope that no <Col N="41" /> import duties are being imposed on circular saws.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnston made some very interesting remarks about agriculture mainly.  I think he indicated that there should be some restrictions on midland farmers selling their straw to mills in the neighbourhood.  It would be a bad thing to place any restrictions on farmers in connection with the disposal of their straw.  Any effort in that direction would tend to lower production and that would be a wrong policy.</P>
      <P>He also referred to beet growing, though I am not sure what angle he took on it.  It would not be out of place for me to say that £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 has been spent in the importation of sugar during the last four or five years, and practically £1,000,000 more has been paid out in the last four or five years to farmers in other countries for producing sugar, refined and unrefined agricultural commodities, for us which we could produce at home.  The Senator also referred to the Gaeltacht.  There is one industry that could very well be taken up there, namely, the growing of potatoes.  The people in the Gaeltacht know how to grow potatoes and it would be a profitable business for them.  I make the suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary knowing that he will be interested in getting suggestions of that kind.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary two questions, the second of which may not arise.  Will this measure mean an increase in the prices of the articles which would be protected under it and are any official steps being taken to prevent an increase in price as a result of this duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is paradoxical, and I suppose it is really complimentary in a sense, that it has taken the representatives of Trinity College to arouse a debate in the Seanad.  It is paradoxical perhaps that both should have this flow of words.  I am not quite sure, not being entirely conversant as yet with the procedure of the House, whether Senator Professor Johnston is entirely in order.  In a sense it is rather unfair to infer that any Minister for Industry and Commerce has approved <Col N="42" /> of the type of industry which fell out of the hole in the bag as such.  The Minister cannot under the Control of Manufacturers Act stop any group of Irish industrialists from starting an industry so long as it complies with that.  He may disapprove if you ask him privately, but in so far as official recognition is concerned he must give it.</P>
      <P>If such an industry starts, as Senator Johnston says, it is not the Minister's fault.  Probably some industrialists are wise to the affair and poor unfortunate farmers are easy to bribe&mdash;to the detriment of the soil.  Personally however I do not believe that farmers are so foolish.  No farmers would be so foolish as to sell their produce to produce industrial articles at a less price to themselves or with less good results than they would get from it themselves. On the other hand I agree with Senator Johnston in his point of view that our whole industrial policy should be related to some extent or correlated with our agricultural policy and I do not think that any of our industrialists could object to that correlation.</P>
      <P>In so far as our industries here are not all that they might be, that suggestion of my very near neighbour's comes perilously near to making innuendoes and we have heard something of that from another quarter. This form of implied censure might be done without, I think.  This has been an industrial country for only 25 years and yet the most ardent Republicans and dyed-in-the-wool Irishmen cynically criticise some unfortunate man who comes up from the country like myself and gets a few pounds as a result of that.  They would rather see an Englishman, a Scotchman or a Dutchman get it.  I would appeal to the Minister, whatever attitude he has, not to follow the example from other quarters.  There are some men who make mistakes. There are some black sheep and there always will be&mdash;perhaps there are some in this House at the moment&mdash;but on the whole Irish industry is doing a fair job and if some industries are being developed which are not entirely in the interests of the nation it is not the Minister who is to be blamed but the people who started something which even the Parliamentary Secretary himself could not solve or excuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask something which is very much in order.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether there is any way of seeing that the quality of these goods is kept up to standard.  I think that very often if you give a protective duty of 75 per cent. on an article like saws those saws may not be sufficiently well made to allow craftsmen to work them in a proper way.  I know that all tradesmen, whether they be carpenters, in the meat trade or anything else, are very keen on having first quality tools.  If we could devise some way of ensuring that the articles, particularly those subject to protection, will be at least equal to the standard of the imported article it would be a great safeguard.  I feel that the way is very often wide open for people to have sub-standard articles.  I do not want to cast any reflection on the items referred to in the Orders but say that in a general way.  We should have general protection in a general way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnston, in opening, asked for an indication of general Government economic policy. I presume that he was referring in particular to the Government's policy with regard to decentralisation of industry and the House will get a full opportunity of discussing that when the Minister presents before the House the Undeveloped Areas Bill which is designed for the establishment of industries in areas of low density of population and particularly, in so far as I can achieve it as Parliamentary Secretary whose special care it will be to look after the Gaeltacht and congested areas, as many new industries and expanded industries in the congested and Gaeltacht areas as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into every aspect of the question except to refer to the Senator's parable about the sack with the mousehole lest he might have created the impression that it is for the Minister and the Government to decide where industries are to be established. I am sure that every member will agree that it would be a sad day for industrial life if the Government were to say where industries must be established or set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> The Government at the present time can do no more than encourage industry to set up in centres as far removed from the centres of dense population as possible.  The Bill to which I have referred, the Undeveloped Areas Bill, will give facilities which are designed towards that end. I believe that that is the furthest it would be desirable in a democratic country for the Government to go.</P>
    <P>With regard to the location of the particular industry to which the Senator has referred, I believe that it is a good thing even though it be almost within the Pale.  That factory was set up in some part of the Midlands and it is a good thing that it is able to be run by the use of native raw materials such as straw.  Straw, as the Senator pointed out, is grown very widely around that factory and a lot of it, naturally, is brought in there, as it forms one of the basic raw materials of the output of that factory.  It is a good trend to use the raw materials produced here at home, and I believe personally that we have other raw materials which are not used to the fullest in the industries of this country. We hope that that trend indicated by the establishment of factories in the areas to which the Senator referred and in other areas will continue, particularly in so far as they can be based on native raw materials.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Callaghan asked whether the Orders referred to circular saws. There is a distinction.  The firm which makes the saws at the present time can only make saws of 48 inches or less, so there will be no duty on circular saws in excess of 48 inches.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a licensing provision attached to this duty.  The Minister may recommend that in the event of the firm being unable to supply a particular type of saw, the duty will be raised in respect of that saw.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of price, raised by Senator Professor Stanford, I believe that the price here in regard to saws is about 25 per cent. in excess of that in England but I am happy to say that, with regard to the abrasives, in practically all cases the <Col N="45" /> prices charged here are on a par with those charged by the most famed and well-established industries in Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I comment on that?  Is there anything to prevent these people running up the price once they get the tariff?  That is really the point of my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said with regard to saws, there is attaching to the duty a licensing provision.  If the Minister sees that these protected goods are commanding prohibitive prices, the Minister, in effect, even though he has to go through the Revenue Commissioners, can allow the import of goods in order to keep prices down, by the issue of duty-free licences.  As well as that, the accounts of these firms, as most industrialists know, are subject to review by the prices section of the Department and the prices section has had before it the accounts of these two particular firms who are benefiting under these Orders.  So. I take it, on all sides and on all points there is sufficient assurance that the standard of work to be turned out by these firms and the prices to be charged will be kept well under control so as to ensure that the Irish people will get a good commodity at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything else that requires answering.  If there is any point that I can answer, I will be glad to reply to any Senator.</P>
