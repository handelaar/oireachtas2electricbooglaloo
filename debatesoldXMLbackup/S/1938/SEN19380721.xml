      <P>The arrangement come to yesterday regarding to-day's business, that the stages of all Bills would be concluded to-day, was conditional on certain Bills being received from the Dáil last night.  One of the Bills only was received, the Old Age Pensions Bill, and it appears on to-day's Order Paper.  The remaining Bills, namely, the Presidential Establishment Bill, the Industrial Alcohol (No. 2) Bill and the Telephone Capital Bill will, I am informed, reach us to-day.  In the circumstances, it is for the House to say whether it will meet to-morrow or on Wednesday next to consider them.  Perhaps Senators would be good enough to let me have their views.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to think that for the good name of the House, we ought to meet next Wednesday unless there are very good reasons against it.  Otherwise it would give the impression that we were simply trying to get away because there happens to be an election on.  There is a point at which you get to what is indecent haste and, I think, it is probably much better to meet next Wednesday.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That, in the opinion of the Seanad, a small commission should be appointed by the Government to examine and report on the possibility of extending vocational organisation by legislative or administrative action.&mdash;Senators MacDermot and Tierney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very sorry I was not able to be here to listen to the speeches delivered by the proposer and seconder of the motion, and if other Senators wish to speak on the motion I should prefer to wait and hear what they have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that we understood that the Taoiseach would have an opportunity now, so as not to take up his time, and those of us who intended to take part in the debate were reckoning on its taking place after the Bills on the Order Paper had been disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, it is simply a question of saying that I am in favour of the motion, because, whatever view may be taken of it, I cannot see that any harm can be done in having a commission set up to examine the question.  It does not commit anyone in advance to any particular viewpoint or to any of the findings, because we have no idea what they may be.  The resolution, as it stands here, is &ldquo;That, in the opinion of the Seanad, a small commission should be appointed by the Government to examine and report on the <Col N="439" /> possibility of extending vocational organisation by legislative or administrative action.&rdquo;  The only question is whether it should not be somewhat wider in its terms of reference than it is&mdash;whether there might not be some other methods of encouragement.  I am sure, however, that whatever methods of encouragement might be adopted by the Government could be included in the two terms &ldquo;legislative&rdquo; or &ldquo;administrative.&rdquo;  Personally, I have no objection, and no member of the Government, so far as I am aware, has any objection to such a commission being set up.  It would be of great importance that this matter should be examined home to see how far the fundamental ideas are capable of being applied in our country and in what direction they might be best applied. If it is simply a question of our view, we have no reason at all to object to this motion being passed, and, if it is passed, we will implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give us any idea as to what type of commission he thinks would be suitable? I think that only one of the speakers on the motion made any suggestion on the matter.  In the absence of any statement to the contrary, it seems to me that what is contemplated is that the Government should appoint a commission.  I take it that is what the Taoiseach understands from it and I wonder what kind of a commission either the movers or the Taoiseach have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty about the motion is that the mover, and probably to some degree the seconder, hung this on to the question of a better Seanad.  I do not think that is implicit in the motion itself.  It was suggested&mdash; I may be wrong&mdash;that it is due to the defects of our vocational organisation that the Seanad is not of the character some people would like to see it.  I do not agree with that.  I think, so far as vocational organisation is concerned, that there is no serious fault to be found in its approach to a Seanad.  It is the method of election that has been at fault.  The vocational organisations put on the panel quite a lot of what I <Col N="440" /> personally considered satisfactory candidates, but in many cases they could not survive the process of election.</P>
      <P>On the general question of vocational organisation, that is another matter and it opens up a very big question indeed which will require a lot of thought and, I suggest, a very big change in public opinion before it can take practical form.  If I might suggest it, the best example we have of the full operation of vocational organisation is that in the Church of Ireland. There is no doubt that the peculiar conditions there lend themselves to cohesion. But, in that body, you have certain powers of legislation very much in the sense of a self-governing vocational body.  I see great difficulties in extending that to the agricultural industry, but so far as the approach can be made, it is along those lines I think that you should try to work, to build up a vocational organisation of such a form that a large number of questions within the sphere of agriculture could be referred to what you might call an agricultural Parliament, no doubt with overriding powers and veto by the Dáil.  The same with industry.  Of course, as we all know, that is very remote.  We can only work to that in a very slow and tentative manner, but that would be the ideal at which we should aim.  So far as a commission could help in thinking out all that, it would be all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason I did not wish to speak until we had some indication of the view of the Government was that, if they were not prepared to accept the general idea of a commission, alternative suggestions might be made.  I am glad that the Taoiseach indicated that, at any rate, the idea would be favourably considered.  It seems to me that Senator Tierney was quite right when he said that the two questions, the question of extending vocational organisation in the country, and the question of a Seanad which might be elected more or less on vocational lines were two distinct questions. I would not like to see them mixed up in the reference to any commission.  I read very carefully the two speeches made and was particularly impressed <Col N="441" /> by the line taken by Senator Tierney. I, at any rate, did not get his ideas as clearly from listening to him as from reading carefully his speech, which I think is worthy of study whether you agree with it or not.</P>
      <P>There are considerable practical difficulties, almost insurmountable difficulties, but if a suitable commission was prepared to give time to study the problem, apart from the question of a vocational Seanad, I think it might be of considerable value.  At any rate, having regard to the general ideals which were accepted fairly well by all sides in this country some 15, 16, 17, 18 years ago, it seems to me that there is a duty upon us to consider the problems put forward in this resolution, and more particularly in the speeches on the resolution.  I would hope that, so far as possible, persons like most of us here who have taken an active part in politics, if not excluded from the commission, would be very definitely in a minority, because I think it is a matter on which we would have to get entirely away from politics as we have known them in the last 15 years.  We have a number of divisions which seem to be largely unnatural.</P>
      <P>I should like to see those of us who may happen to be here after the next election appointing a committee of our own to consider amendments or improvements in the method of election, which was referred to by Senator Sir John Keane.  I think that that would be a thing apart, and that it would not be necessary to wait in respect of it until you had a detailed report from a commission of this kind.  That is one of the reasons why I should like to see the two things kept distinct.  An expansion of vocationalism would have to be brought about by a policy carried over a considerable number of years. There would be a lot of difficulties to be surmounted, and I do not think you should necessarily wait until that is achieved before making an attempt to rectify the things which have not worked very well in connection with the election of the Seanad.  I am glad that the Government is prepared to accept the principle of this resolution, and I think that the Seanad should approve of it without a division.</P>

      <P>The extension of vocational organisation is very desirable. It may, or may not, give us a better Seanad.  It may, or may not, give us a better Dáil.  If carried to its logical conclusion, it may deprive this House of the services of the proposer and seconder of this motion.  That, of course, would be a step in the wrong direction.  What I propose to say, I want to direct to two vocational organisations in connection with agriculture &mdash;the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society and the Beetgrowers' Association. I shall first deal with a small portion of the work carried on by the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society. Anybody going through the City of Dublin will see the tramcars and buses decorated with &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; slogans.</P>
      <P>That was brought about by representations made to the Minister for Agriculture by the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society.  The drink-more-milk campaign will have a very great effect on the health of the nation.  It will do away with patent medicines and doctors' bills.  People will have more money to spend and they will be more cheerful.  It may even bring about the setting up of a milk bar in Leinster House where, under the influence of milk cocktails, Party bitterness will entirely disappear and a new spirit will supplant the old.  I am just relating this small section of the work of the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society to illustrate the good that an association of that kind might do for the State and for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, then, the Beet Growers' Association, which some people seem to overlook.  It has a membership of 30,000 beet growers and speaks for some thousands of grain growers. Most of the beet growers in the West of Ireland are small farmers.  The average acreage is about one and a half per grower.  It is a little more in other areas.  I tell you that to illustrate the fact that the labour used is family labour; not paid labour.  In the other areas, the acreage is a little bit greater but not much.  Seventy-five per cent of the beet grown in this country is grown by family help.  The difficulty with the beet growers is the question of price and not the setting up to <Col N="443" /> guilds or organisations of any kind. The Beet Growers' Association have had considerable difficulty in getting a price to which they would be agreeable. Some experts seem to have advised the Government that sufficient acreage would be got at the price which is being offered.  That advice was wrong and it has done considerable harm to the industry.  There is a shrinkage of 12,000 acres in this year's beet crop and, unless the crop is a very bountiful one this season, it will be very difficult to get beet for 1939.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach is here because we have not had an opportunity of telling him what the position is. The powers that be say that the man who lends his money is entitled to his due reward.  They say that the factory worker is entitled to get what he gets. They say that the cost of sugar must not be increased to the public and that the State cannot give any further help. They say that, after full provision is made for depreciation and reserves, the beet grower can get the rest.  The position is an anxious one for the beet grower who is anxious to get the industry going.  He finds himself at the wrong end of the stick.  We have been discussing the formation of guilds and several ways and means of getting a price that will induce the farmer to grow beet.  We have in the current issue of the <i>Beet Growers' Journal</i> an article from a very distinguished churchman on the formation of guilds in connection with the Beet Growers' Association.  That journal was sent to 30,000 or 35,000 growers and was read by them and their families.  In that way, we have done a lot to educate public opinion about the formation of vocational bodies.  A motion will be discussed at the annual meeting in connection with this matter and any member of this House who cares to go and listen to it will be provided with a seat in the distinguished strangers' gallery. Three factors, in my view, govern the sugar industry.  One is the man who lends his money&mdash;in other words, the capitalist.  I do not call him a capitalist because plenty of small men lent small sums for the setting up of the industry.  Then, there is the factory worker and, then, the beet grower.  A <Col N="444" /> vocational body composed of these three factors would seem to be a desirable way of controlling the industry but the difficulty the beet grower has is that he will be coming in as the underdog.  He regards the other people as being well away and he does not regard himself as being on the same plane.  The only difficulty we have in connection with the setting up of that guild to control the sugar industry is the question of price.  I hold that the beet grower is the backbone of the industry and that he should not play second fiddle to any of the other component parts.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a commission may not be the right means of developing vocational organisation.  I know the way the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society was set up.  It was got going by half a dozen people who put their backs into the work.  If we had sufficient civic spirit, and if we had a little more national pride, there might not be any need of a commission to deal with vocational organisation. Vocational organisation is very desirable, but whether or not the setting up of a commission is the proper means of approaching it, I leave the House to judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself largely in agreement with Senator Sir John Keane, so far as this motion is concerned, in so far as he says that too much stress was laid on the system of electing the Seanad.  This question of a system of election for this House was under discussion for several months. During that time, very little in the way of suggestion that was of any use came from any quarter.  As always happens, the best hurlers are on the ditch.  If anybody can suggest a better method than the method which has been in operation up to now, I am sure the Government will be quite pleased.  The present system is far from perfect, but I believe that it is the best system that could be found under existing conditions. I am not against the setting up of a commission, for the reason that I believe that the discussion of this motion will create a better atmosphere so far as the development of vocational organisation is concerned.  With all due respect to the proposer and seconder, <Col N="445" /> I think that the motion is not properly worded.  I do not believe that vocational organisation can be developed by legislative means.  I believe that it will have to be a natural growth.  The atmosphere at present is more favourable to this purpose than it has ever been for the simple reason that vocational organisation should be the natural outcome of the activities of a native Government. As a result of this commission and as a result of the activities of some of the Senators who have been sent here by vocational bodies, that atmosphere will spread and, even within the next year or two years, even if we did nothing further about the matter, we should have considerable development in that direction.</P>
      <P>I think that there was very little of value in the speeches made by the proposer and seconder of the motion.  They rambled from the subject.  I believe that a commission can do very little of itself to achieve our purpose, but that the setting up of a commission, combined with the discussion we have had, will induce people to talk about the matter.  They will find that useful work has been done by some of the Senators sent here by various bodies and they will realise that it is up to them to organise themselves into groups and send men here who will look after their interests.  At the same time, some of the men sent here would be well advised to keep away from politics.  Political speeches in this House by men sent here by vocational bodies will have a tendency to prevent development of opinion in the direction which we seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCondon" hpid="Mr. Condon Mr. Condon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Condon</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this a most fascinating subject, particularly as we can all talk with extraordinary wisdom about it, seeing that few people know very much concerning it.  So far, the speeches have been good.  There was, certainly, a shock for all of us in the proposing of the motion.  We are used to shocks in this House after the major shock of the dissolution of the Dáil, which meant that we, as a body, were about to be dissolved before we were familiar with the upholstery of the place.  After that, we can get over any shocks.  The seconder of the <Col N="446" /> motion ought to have got a shock when he heard all that was said by the proposer as to what he considered the gravamen of the resolution.  It seemed to me as if Senator MacDermot wanted the mountain to go into labour to produce a mouse&mdash;a new mouse.  He was much distressed about the character of this House.  Evidently, sensitive people, with high vocational qualifications, could not bring themselves to do the ordinary, vulgar things that have to be done to become members of this House.  They could not be expected to go out in public and canvass or do anything like that.</P>
      <P>If I am a member of the electoral college, I can see, and so can Senator MacDermot, circulars on my table every morning from some of these vocational experts, these people who were so busy and so remote from the people, so removed from the ordinary vulgarities of life.  Anyone who receives these circulars will note how these very remote people can speak of their own exceptional qualifications and hold forth on the benefit it would be to the nation to have them elected to this Seanad.  If Senator MacDermot had read some of these circulars he might, perhaps, change his mind.  I tell the Senator that these people are not at all so remote from the ordinary vulgarities of life as has been suggested.  I know they are very valuable people, but there is no doubt that if there is any possibility of their getting here by any means then they will get here.  But these are the men that the Senator had in mind when he was speaking of a vocational Seanad.  That is really what it means, the mountain in labour and it produced a very trifling thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacDermot's speech was very discursive.  I think in that speech he dealt with all subjects.  Indeed he omitted very few things.  He did not touch on bimetallism nor on the breeds of poultry but he dealt with nearly every other subject one could think of. He touched on the Pope, and I was afraid for a time that he was going to take serious action with regard to His Holiness.  However, in the end he was very nice to the Pope, and I am sure His Holiness will be very glad when he hears about it.  We have been told <Col N="447" /> that the Pope's Encyclicals have been very widely read, but that they had been misunderstood.  Anyone who had not read these circulars and was not acquainted with what was in them would begin to think that they were such mysterious things that the ordinary man could not possibly understand them.  Now the fact is that the Pope's Encyclicals were entirely inspired by concern for the people.  They were written in such a way that even the common people could understand them &mdash;they were so immensely clear.  In these Encyclicals the Pope said really necessary things, and he said them in a plain way.  I have read them and I am familiar with them.  There is nothing in them that an ordinary person could not understand.</P>
    <P>When the first Encyclical was published over 40 years ago it received as much attention that time as if it had been written by me.  Then the world had not broken the skin of the Dead Sea fruit.  The world had not known the Great War.  The world had not understood how wretched the organisation of society was and what terrible possibilities for evil lay in society as it then existed.  As I say at that time the world had not broken the skin of the Dead Sea fruit, and this great Encyclical was almost wholly ignored. It required a further Encyclical from the present Pope, Pius XI, to draw further attention to it.  He suggested that the vocational organisation of society might be remedied.  He drew attention to some of the dreadful things that were about us.  If one turns from the fashion parades in Grafton Street or George's Street, examines the position in the slums and inquires into the life that obtains there, he will understand something about the Pope's Encyclicals.  The conditions are bad in our slums but they are a thousand times worse and more infamous in countries that are very much richer than ours.  In some of those very rich countries people are born into conditions that are certain to ensure that they will be maimed in mind, body and morals for the rest of their lives.  Hundreds and thousands and even millions are born into such conditions as these all the time while <Col N="448" /> we have been preaching Christianity.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot's concern seemed to be with getting ideal electors.  I do not know where these ideal electors are to be got except down in the Kildare Street Club.  But when we get these ideal electors the Labour Party will not exist any longer. That appears to me the big thing that he sees in this motion.  The Labour Party and the Farmers' Party will disappear.  I think that in itself would be a disaster.  No matter what vocational conditions obtain human nature will not change.  There will always be greed and avarice in the world.  Once we had the Guild system. The Guilds became vicious, so that greed and avarice and other abuses grew up in them, and they needed correction.  It may be just the same with this vocational organism that we hope to see established in the future.</P>
    <P>I think it is absolutely necessary that society should organise itself on absolutely different lines from the present.  Most of the people to-day are simply living under serf conditions or in slave conditions.  The people who are depending on casual labour are in a slave condition.  Let us consider the position of these people, and if we do we will find their position is really worse than that which existed under the old slave conditions. I remember it was a shock to us all when we read long ago that John Mitchel had taken the part of the Confederates in the American Civil War.  In that Civil War John Mitchel was on the side of the South. He wanted to maintain the slavery system.  Now, Mitchel was an enlightened man and a great lover of freedom, but he gave his reasons for the stand he took up on the American Civil War.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here you have a mass of black labour which at present represents so much chattels to the men who own it.  These new people in the North who discovered that slavery is such a dreadful thing want the slave owner to free his slaves in order that they are to be thrown into an already over-crowded labour market where the slave will have no <Col N="449" /> value except that when he is worn out he will be replaced by another man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>John Mitchel's reasoning on that occasion was borne out subsequently by John Ruskin.  In that matter John Mitchel showed himself a man of extraordinary vision.</P>
    <P>To-day you have in the world much worse conditions than the slave conditions of the American negroes.  Now, in this State of ours we have a wholly undeveloped country.  In anything that we have to decide to do in the future it would be well that we should remember that the normal development of Ireland had been obstructed for centuries.  As G.K. Chesterton described it, the whole trouble was that we had no government here.  It was not a case of having a bad Government or a good Government.  What we suffered from was really the determination of another people to annihilate and wipe out our people.  That was their policy for centuries and that policy had had its reactions.  In a hundred years our population had been reduced by something like 50 per cent. We have counties like Meath that I represent with a population of half what it was 50 years ago.  Now that country is wholly undeveloped.</P>
    <P>Every month one can read in one of the most useful publications published here in Ireland a series of articles showing the difference between the use we make of our land and the use that Belgium is making of its land.  Belgium has something like 7,000,000 acres of land.  It has over 1,000,000 holdings. We have 17,000,000 acres of land, that is 10,000,000 acres more than Belgium, and we have 230,000 holdings.  We have one-quarter of the number of holdings and 10,000,000 acres more land.  What is really happening in the country is that extremely little use is being made of our natural wealth.  But we need not turn in an emergency way to vocationalism or anything else to remedy that.  We have, I know, big leeway to make up.  As I say we have prime land practically undeveloped. We are producing only one-quarter of the wheat which we require for our people.  Yet we have something like 100,000 people unemployed and the <Col N="450" /> people from the rural parts are crowding into the towns.  We were told yesterday that the country workers are crowding into the towns.  There is for that a very good reason and that is that the people who hold the land have no intention of employing labour on it.  Their whole purpose seems to be something on the principle that obtained in the consolidation of farms, 80 or 100 years ago when village after village was wiped out and the land laid out in such a way that cattle could be turned on to it and need not be seen more than three times in the course of a year.  That is the use that is being made of our land.</P>
    <P>The first thing I would ask the National Government to deal with is to see that the whole land of Ireland be put to the service of the people; that the people should be put back on it and should be given a chance of living a normal life in the country places.  We have no normal life in the country places.  Take the education of our young people.  Most of the young people go to the elementary schools until they are 14 years of age.  Just then when they are in a position to learn something, when they are just trained in the technique of learning they are taken away from the schools.  From that until the very end of their careers there is not a soul to bother about them.  That is true of 99 per cent. of them.  There is a shameful wastage of the best of material.  This sort of thing is, in a large measure, the cause of the wrongness of mind of so many of these people.  These unfortunate people develop on entirely wrong and wretched lines.  They have wretched sources for their development.  There are so many injurious papers and then there is the wireless business that is utterly unhelpful to these people.  They are abandoned at the age of 14 to become ignorant slaves and certainly not getting much of an opportunity to live virtuous lives.  That is a problem on which this nation should concentrate.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about vocational education or technical education, Senator Tierney was alarmed for fear we should take his resolution as meaning technical education. Technical education was one of <Col N="451" /> the things that were introduced into this country many years ago.  Ninety per cent. of the people associated with it were shams.  Such things as lace-making and sprigging were taught and things that were utterly wasteful.  That was really of no service to the country and it touched only a very slight fraction of our people.  It did not touch at all the people who leave our elementary schools at the age when they should be taken up by a Government and made into useful citizens. These young people were really abandoned; there is no doubt about that. I am interested in this proposal in one respect.  We are said to be in need of a different Seanad from the one we have got.  Now the one we have is an admirable one but I am sure it will be changed in a few weeks' time.</P>
    <P>What we really want are correctives to the present organisation of society under which a big number of our people are simply committed or condemned to lives of shame, misery and suffering.  There is no doubt about that. That is the horror the Pope foresaw when he suggested that correctives be applied 40 years ago.  If the world had listened to him then things might have been different.  Instead he was treated with contempt.  Then the full horror came along; the masses of the people revolted and we have these terrible scenes which we hear of nowadays, these terrible conditions that obtain in Spain and Russia, which were brought about by popular revolt but which the originators of the revolt never foresaw. They started out with the idea of securing freedom for the people who had been ground to the dust.  These horrors may possibly be in store for us in Ireland if we ignore our trust and our duty.</P>
    <P>I certainly think that this subject should be examined in the fullest possible way, examined in every possible detail, to see if it is at all possible to spare our country from the horrors which other countries have suffered. We must remember that the masses of the people were ignored as dirt.  There was absolutely no concern for them. In recent years some little concern has been shown.  We have got down to the <Col N="452" /> matter of the minimum wage for agricultural labourers but still we have people quarrelling about it.  We have got down to the question of looking after widows and orphans and there are people quarrelling about that, describing it as an unspeakable burden. We have shown a little bit of humanity in our government but we have heaps of protests.  Well, we have an example of the unspeakable horrors which have been brought about in other countries by the fact that the sufferings of the people were ignored.  The fact that this reorganisation of society has been recommended by His Holiness should give us a lead, for His Holiness has centuries of wisdom, a tradition of wisdom, behind him in these matters, and his lightest word is worthy of consideration. I do not want to enter into the various considerations so singularly ably put forward by Professor Tierney but I think it will be generally agreed that we should have an exhaustive enquiry into the possibilities of the reorganisation of society along some other than the present system, under which the masses of the people are simply being exploited to the advantage of a few.</P>

      <P>I agree with the proposer of this resolution that the question of promoting vocational organisation in this country is quite separate from the question of the best method of constituting this Seanad. At the same time, I cannot help feeling that if the existing vocational bodies were given the right to elect, as well as the right to nominate to this House, nothing would contribute more effectively to the growth of vocational organisation in the country. I remember as an example of that, in connection with the recent elections to the Seanad, I heard for the first time of the existence of a body known as the Limerick Cottiers' Association.  It was brought into existence not because it was given the right to elect, but because it was given the right to nominate to this body.  I think on that analogy that when a smaller right than the right to elect, the right to nominate, produced such an effective result, the <Col N="453" /> right to elect would produce even more effective results in inducing professional and other bodies to attempt vocational organisation.  I think that a vocational body, if it had the right to elect, would be likely to use that right in a somewhat less partisan manner than is inevitable when the right to elect is given to an electoral college in which the elements of Party organisation are necessarily present.  Mind you, I am not deprecating in any way the existence of Party organisation because I think Party action is a necessary adjunct to the machinery of democratic government. When you have a democratically-elected machine functioning you are bound to have Party organisation and a Party spirit and it is so necessary to the working of democratic government that I would not regard it as an evil.  But everything reacts in accordance with its nature.  There is an Irish proverb which says: &ldquo;What can you expect from a pig but a grunt?&rdquo; What can you expect from a democratic popular assembly, given the right to form an important part of the electoral college, but that when they come to elect Senators, they are bound to be influenced by Party considerations, and that they are not likely to choose precisely the same people as the vocational body itself would choose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think most people outside of this House would agree that it is desirable that the element of Party spirit, which is necessarily strong in the other House, should be kept as far as possible out of this House.  In a democratic assembly the various sections of the community there represented engage in a struggle in which the interests commanding a majority, generally speaking, get their own way.  If it so be that the interests which triumph are also the interest of the nation as a whole, it is well, but it is quite conceivable that the interests which triumph in that democratic assembly may not be exactly coincident with the interests of the nation as a whole.  It is, therefore, desirable that there should be a corrective to that spirit, and I think no better idea for correcting that <Col N="454" /> partisan spirit has been arrived at than the idea of developing the vocational spirit which, as I say, is quite separate and distinct from the partisan spirit.</P>
    <P>The object of vocational representation is not that the people represented should further their special interests or should attempt to get away with anything which is in their sectional interest and is not in the interests of the nation as a whole.  The object is that they should contribute their specialised knowledge to the deliberations of the Seanad; that they should seek, as far as possible, to enlighten public opinion and the Oireachtas as a whole, as regards the lines along which national interests must be pursued as against interests which are clearly partisan.  I have nothing but admiration for the personal relationships which exist between us in this part of the House and you on the other sides of the House, but, at the same time, I cannot help wishing that the Party spirit was rather less evident. Occasionally it breaks out, although we may strive to restrain it.  If the Party spirit were rather less evident, and the vocational spirit rather more evident, then the general tone of this assembly would be improved.  Sir, I do not want to appear to be reading a lecture, but I do want to urge that we should consider the question of attempting vocational organisation, and, at the same time, not lose sight of the possibility of improving the general lines along which this House is at present constituted.</P>

      <P>I am not inclined to oppose the setting up of this commission, but I must say that I am not of opinion that there is any practical solution for this great problem of vocational organisation.  Senator Douglas, to my mind, got very near to the kernel of the situation when he said that it was not possible to get away from political questions in public life.  References have been made to trade unions and to their place in vocational organisation. Trade unionism was founded for a certain purpose, and it did achieve a large amount of good.  It has, as some people are inclined to put it, taken the workers up off their knees, <Col N="455" /> but is it not strange to find that, as it developed and as time went on, quite a small number of people could use the organisation, formed for the purpose for which it was, for purely political purposes?  I am saying that because I believe that it is absolutely true. Other organisations formed for other purposes will undoubtedly be used in the same way under present circumstances in this country, because we cannot at this stage get away from political matters.  Perhaps, in some years to come, in ten or 20 years' time, we shall have reached a stage when a practical solution can be found.  As I say, I am not opposing the setting up of a commission, but I believe that such a commission would find itself up against difficulties and snags, and that it will have to realise the difficulty of developing vocational organisations here to any great purpose.</P>
      <P>If, in this country, the people as a whole, had a similar attitude to national questions as the people in other countries, England, for example, if we had the whole people here giving unswerving loyalty to their own country, that loyalty which supersedes every other consideration, then I would say that it would be quite an easy matter to find a solution of this problem and to have vocational organisation in a real, practical way but I say that you have not the whole of our people giving that unswerving loyalty and devotion to their country which is necessary for that purpose.  Senator Johnston mentioned that there was a possibility that vocational bodies might be less partisan.  I should like to think that that were possible but I am afraid for the reason that I have stated that it is not possible.  When we reach the stage where loyalty to the country will be the first consideration, then we will be nearer to the period when the people who are interested in this subject will realise their ambitions.  I do not wish to oppose the motion.  I should be glad to see this commission working although I have not very great hopes for success in that direction at the present time.</P>

      <P>This motion I feel is not happily worded.  I think it <Col N="456" /> would be more acceptable if it suggested that the Act as it now exists might be examined with the object of including amongst the nominating bodies vocational bodies which have not the right to nominate now.  I am thinking of one or two vocational bodies that have been in existence for a very long time.  For example, there is the nursing council which was established in 1919.  It is a statutory body, and I think that it is, without exception, the best organised vocational body in Ireland to-day.  Yet, for some reason it has not the right to nominate. It has a membership of 16,000.  From the moment that a nurse starts her training to the day she leaves it, she is under the supervision of that vocational body.  Her examinations, her registration and everything is looked after.  We have a body like that with no right to nominate.  Against that you have a veterinary vocational body with the right to nominate.  It seems strange to me, at any rate, that the people who look after the animals of the country are regarded as being more important than the people who look after human beings.</P>
      <P>You have other bodies, in which I am interested that have not the right to nominate.  You have the Amalgamated Society of Social Services.  This society of women is representative of quite a big number of social service bodies.  They have not the right to nominate.  Against that you have the Mount Street Club which has the right to nominate.</P>
      <P>Listening to all the speeches that were made on this motion my only regret is that some of them were not broadcast so that we could have them discussed afterwards.  If the speakers had written out their speeches and issued them in advance, I think I would have enjoyed them more than I did listening to them.  If the commission which it is suggested should be appointed were given power to include in the scope of its inquiries the vocational bodies that should have the right to nominate, then I think we might get a Seanad more representative of the vocational bodies of the country than the one we have at the moment.</P>

      <P>I should like first to express my gratification that the Taoiseach is prepared to accept this motion and to consider the appointment of a commission.  Senator Hayes inquired what kind of a commission was contemplated.  As far as I am concerned, I have already said that I would like to see the commission a small one, and to see it very largely composed of enthusiasts for the vocational idea.  As the Taoiseach said, nothing that such a commission suggests commits us in any way, but the people who have gone most deeply into the subject are the people, I think, on whom the burden should be in the main laid to suggest a practical application of their ideas.  I think there are several distinguished men in this country, several of them clerics, such as Father Coyne, the well-known Jesuit, who have written on the matter with great ability and thought on it very deeply.  I would put such men on the commission.  I would appoint with them a good lawyer and a good practical business man, and a man or woman familiar with labour conditions and perhaps someone else who is more of a general politician.  Thus you would have four men who are not experts on this particular subject who would address their minds to it from a practical point of view, and with them you would have perhaps six or seven men who have thought on it very deeply, who are enthusiasts about it and wish to see their ideas applied. This is going to give them the opportunity of putting their ideas into practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Condon has accused me of having rambled over too wide a field in the speech in which I introduced the motion.  Looking back over it, I find that it is not a very long speech though it may have seemed so to the unhappy Senators listening to me.  I occupied less than half an hour in speaking, and I personally cannot find one single irrelevant word in the speech.  Of course, it may be considered that I devoted too large a proportion of it to the effect of this vocational idea on the Seanad.  That is a <Col N="458" /> matter on which we can afford to differ, but, as I have said, I cannot find anything irrelevant in it.  I had to listen to Senator Condon discuss negro slavery in America, the blighting effect of British rule in this country, our present land system and the need for a drastic reform of it, and finally, the necessity for completely changing our educational system.  Listening to him, I began to wonder what exactly is the standard of relevance that Senator Condon is in the habit of applying.</P>
    <P>The same Senator took me to task for having suggested that Papal Encyclicals receive a good deal more praise in this country than they do serious consideration, and for having ventured the opinion that rather more might have been done than has been done to give them practical effect. I am unable to see how anybody can seriously contest a word advanced on that subject.  There has been immense praise for the ideas in these encyclicals, and abuse of other countries&mdash;France, England and Europe in general&mdash;for not having taken sufficient notice of them.  I ask what notice have we taken of them here in Ireland except to praise them, and even to-day I find Senators, a good many of them, lukewarm about the mere proposition to set up a commission to examine the possibility of giving them any practical effect.  Surely that is the very least we ought to do if we mean a word of our praise of Papal Encyclicals or of our condemnation of the world as a whole for not paying sufficient notice to them.  Perhaps some Senators take the view that there is nothing in these matters that can be done by Government action; that these vocational bodies must grow up spontaneously from the soil or not come into being at all.  I can see no reason for taking that view.  I certainly do not think that the Government can force them on the country like a straight jacket, but I do think that the Government can do something perhaps by legislation, perhaps by administrative action, or perhaps by encouragement and propaganda.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, in our original Constitution 16 years ago, we went to <Col N="459" /> the trouble of putting in a provision saying that the Oireachtas may set up vocational councils representing branches of the social and economic life of the nation, and that possibly some powers of the Parliament might be delegated to such councils.  Again, we went to the trouble in our present Constitution of repeating that almost verbatim.  If there is any sense at all in putting such things into our Constitution surely it is time that we gave them some sort of sequel such as is now suggested by Senator Tierney and myself by setting up this commission to examine the subject.  Surely there is nothing extravagent or visionary in such a proposal.  It is not a proposal that should have been listened to with the scepticism, if not hostility, with which it apparently has been listened to by some Senators.</P>
    <P>As regards the bearing of this Motion on the question of the Seanad, I quite agree that the composition of the Seanad is, in a sense, a separate subject, and that the composition of the Seanad, if it needs to be dealt with by legislation, could be dealt with without any such Commission as this being set up; and possibly it may be so dealt with even during the course of this Commission's sitting.  I venture to draw attention once again to Article 19 of our new Constitution, that Article that many Senators seem to overlook. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provision may be made by law for the direct election by any functional or vocational group or association or council of so many members of Seanad Eireann as may be fixed by such law in substitution for an equal number of the members to be elected from the corresponding panels of candidates constituted under Article 18 of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>Now, that is in our Constitution, and what is the sense of suggesting that it is some sort of a plot emanating from the Kildare Street Club, as I think Senator Condon indicated, to propose that something should be done about that?  Some of the Fianna Fáil Senator do not seem to be familiar at all with the policy of their own <Col N="460" /> Party.  They do not seem to realise that the Minority Report of the Second Chamber Commission, which recommended the adoption of this idea, was accepted in principle by the Fianna Fail Government.  I have no desire to do more than to contribute what I can to the making of the Fianna Fail policy a reality, and to bring it more perfectly into effect in these matters than it has yet been brought into effect. Obviously, if a Commission is set up to consider the question of extending the Vocational Organisations, that will have a bearing on the Article in the Constitution which says that in the future such Vocational Organisations may be given the right or direct representation.</P>
    <P>I said frankly enough that perhaps may principal interest in this motion was to lay a firm foundation for a vocational Seanad.  I also agreed that it had wider aspects, and apparently I said more about those wider aspects than some Senators seem to like; but to those who are enthusiastic about those wider aspects, and who rather deprecate any talk of the bearing of this motion on the constitution of the Seanad, I would say that surely they ought to think it a great help for one to go even a little way on the right road with them and to show a desire to tread that road.  There is room for difference of opinion as to how far it will turn out practicable here in democratic Ireland for Parliament to delegate powers of more or less legisative character to Vocational bodies. There is room for great difference of opinion about that, and I personally have an open mind about it.  I do not know whether we can succeed in making this complete re-organisation of society that Senator Tierney, for instance, has in mind.</P>
    <P>But, whatever view we take about that, whether we are optimistic or pessimistic about it, at any rate it ought to be regarded as helpful to go a little way along the road and it will not take any very extraordinary or enormous development of the vocational idea to provide a firm foundation for a vocational Seanad.  If we get as far as that, then we can consider going still further and giving <Col N="461" /> larger powers to vocational bodies.  As Senator Johnson said, the mere fact of giving direct representation to such bodies would certainly have a tendency to encourage them to come into being and would also, I think, have a tendency to get rid of some of the undesirable duplication that exists in certain departments of our life, because, as I said the other day, while there are branches of the national life where no vocational bodies exist, there are some others where too many exist and where the difficulty would be to reconcile their conflicting claims to send representatives here to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question of how far the present system of electing the Seanad is satisfactory or not.  I said a certain amount on it the other day but I would like to stress the point that I did not use the word &ldquo;vulgarity&rdquo; in connection with that as I think Senator Conway rather implied that I had.  I did say that some men of the vocational type were not suited to electoral campaigns, and I do not think anybody can deny that that stands not only for electoral campaigns on public platforms but for electoral campaigns in the corridors of Leinster House.  I do not think that the present Seanad Electoral Act is a good Act; I had not an opportunity of taking part in the discussions on it because I did not happen to be a member of the Legislature when it was under consideration; but I do not think it is a good Act and I think that there are dangers inherent in it which might become in the future very formidable.</P>
    <P>I think that anyone who reflects for a little bit on what could take place will say that it opens the door to corruption. It would be quite possible for unscrupulous men to get themselves elected by bribery when it is only a question, say, of needing to purchase half-a-dozen votes to enter the House. I am, however, far from saying that such a thing would be conceivable at the present moment, but I do think that we ought not to rest content with a system that makes corruption easy and that is one of the objections to the present system.  I will say no more about the Seanad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> I submit that the ideas which are referred to in this motion are of such fundamental and world-wide importance that we have been guilty of neglect of duty in not having done more about them.  The excuse can be offered that we have been occupied with other matters very vital to this country, and that one has not got time to think of everything and do everything; but now that some of the burning topics have been put out of the way, and that, pacé Senator Hughes, we are, throughout the country united in our loyalty to the State, I feel that the time has come when we ought to turn our hands to seeing what can be done to carry out these ideas or put them, at any rate, to the test.</P>

      <P>There is one Bill which I am particularly <Col N="463" /> anxious should be given if the Seanad can see its way to do so.  That is the Bill relating to the Presidential Establishment.  The introduction of that Bill was somewhat delayed, and it is one that we are particularly anxious about, if the Seanad would be willing to facilitate us.  The proposals in the Bill, as the House will understand, are founded entirely on the recommendations made by the very representative commission set up a considerable time ago.  I have not the exact date, but it was early in 1937. For a variety of reasons it has not been possible to get this Bill before the Oireachtas until quite recently.  I had hoped that we should have all stages in the Dáil last night and that the Bill would be on the Agenda of the Seanad in the ordinary way this morning.</P>
      <P>I may say that one of the reasons why we are anxious that the Bill should become law at the earliest possible opportunity is that we have no statutory authority to provide for the President the emoluments and allowances referred to in the Constitution. We have in fact been meeting certain of the expenses of that establishment out of the Contingency Fund.  That was entirely unavoidable. Naturally, as Minister for Finance, I am anxious that that practice should not continue longer than is absolutely necessary and therefore I should be glad to get all the stages of the Bill through as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>There are only two proposals before you, Sir. Senator MacDermot's is to meet to-morrow to do the Industrial Alcohol Bill and the Telephone Capital Bill.  Senator MacGinley's proposal is to do the Presidential Establishment Bill to-day and adjourn until next Wednesday.  For myself, I am in complete agreement with the Minister that the Presidential Establishment Bill should certainly be passed as soon as possible, if not to-day, then to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I think we would agree to dealing with those Bills urgently as long as it is not to be taken as creating a precedent.  In the old Seanad we were faced frequently, without the abnormal circumstances of the present time, with a rush of Bills at the end, but as a matter of abnormal procedure I would be prepared to accept the Presidential Bill now.  Under normal circumstances I think it is largely agreed that Bills should go through this House in about a fortnight.  I think, however, that we have to face the fact now that, owing to the general election and the circumstances of this House, there is likely to be some urgency, but it is entirely a matter for the convenience of the House.  On previous occasions we have found it difficult to get a quorum on Friday morning, but if Senators could attend to-morrow I would be quite satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two to express my disappointment at the way the Minister met the case, a reasonable case, which I believe I put before the House last night.  Now, the Minister went so far as to indicate that he realised as well as I realised that there is a problem. In fact the Minister's speech suggested to me that he regarded the problem as being one of such gravity, of such seriousness and of such tremendous size that the Government could not take the responsibility of tackling it because of the risks entailed.  He did not attempt to deny that there was a problem.  I put it to him again that this problem is going to remain.  I put it to him also that, if he tried to get under it, as some of us have, he will realise what a very disturbing <Col N="467" /> problem this is.  Apart altogether from its consequences to our economic life, in the sense, so to speak, that productivity is very considerably lower because of this lack of capital, on the land, and apart altogether from the consequences of reduced production on our purchasing capacity in town and in country, there is the other disturbing factor, the social problem, of the people on the land who are not fully occupied on the land; in fact, who are not half-time occupied on the land and whose thoughts are turned from it.</P>
      <P>I am thinking particularly of the many small farmers whose plight I have tried to depict to the House.  I am not thinking of the man with a hundred acres so much as of the thousands of small farmers who are in the position which I know them to be in, and whose boys and girls, so far as it is possible to do it, ought to be brought up to work the soil as their fathers did before them.  But to-day, because the means are not with them, quite a number of the boys are turning away from work on the land.  I know many of them; every Senator from the country knows them as well as I do.  Some boys are signing on in the labour exchanges and getting a few shillings per week dole during the winter months.  A very large number of girls are leaving the country.</P>
      <P>The great trouble that I see is that this problem cannot be tackled by anybody but the Government.  Is there anything worse in a country than people whose minds cannot be concentrated on the work there is to do?  You know the mischief that idle hands can make. They are a disturbing factor in our social and economic life.  They are out, so to speak, for a full life, and because they cannot get it from their little possessions at home, they are out to get it some way, and the consequence is that the Minister has to make provision in various forms from the Exchequer to meet demands that would not have to be met if the Minister would take the risks which I suggest he ought to take and provide capital to enable our land to be worked to the full by the people born on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> The trouble I see is that, in my judgment, this problem is going to become more accentuated as time goes on.  Senator Condon yesterday evening, according to the Minister's standards, apparently answered my case.  I do not accept it that Senator Condon answered my case at all.  I gave a number of figures which I suggested represented a picture of the country.  I suggested that these figures indicated that the country is less wealthy than it had been and I am not bothering to discuss the causes now.  I suggested that that situation was common not only among the big farmers in Meath, of whom Senator Condon spoke, but amongst the small farmers in my own county.</P>
    <P>Senator Condon apparently thought he had answered my whole case by speaking, I think, of a cabin farmer who went to Meath and secured 25 acres of land, who at one time had only one four-footed beast on the land, and who was able to declare a short time ago at a meeting of the Meath County Council that he had his land fully stocked and was putting money in the bank.  He was a most remarkable man, if he were able to achieve as much as that.  I am puzzled to know how he managed to get all this stock on his land.  One four-footed beast could not produce at all.  I suggest that he never could have got it on the land but for the economic war which reduced the price of stock to a point when it was almost there for throwing away.  I am wondering where he got the cash to buy.  Nobody here is going to tell me that he got it off the land.  He must have got it from somebody else.  I can take any Senator here to dozens and dozens of farmers in my county, supporters of the present Administration, whose plight is what I have suggested and who live only two miles from my own home.  With their horse and cart these men are trying to get work on the roads because there is no stock on their lands.  There is work on their land to do if they had the capital to work the land.  They are industrious, but they have not the means.  Who is going to provide it?  I say that nobody can do that but the Minister. <Col N="469" /> The Minister apparently thinks that the risks are very great.  I do not think they are so very great at all.  I do not think that it is beyond the wisdom and the capacity of the people here collectively to devise a scheme which will meet the present situation.  I suggest further that the longer this problem remains unsolved the more difficult it is going to be to solve it. There will be more waste in our economic and social life and the numbers of those who want to go away from our country will be greater.  We cannot afford to lose any of them.  We cannot afford to dissipate any of the resources left to us to employ, whether they be boys or girls or the soil of the country.  These are things that we have to try to hold possession of and enrich our land by making the efforts of all more fruitful than they are.</P>
    <P>I again urge on the Minister the point of view which I have tried to express.  It is not a Party point of view at all.  It is a point of view that is held strongly by very responsible supporters of the Administration which is in power, just as strongly as it is by me and a number who agree with me, and which is held equally strongly by men outside the political atmosphere altogether.  I believe that if the Minister took time during the Recess to go to men outside of this House and of the Dáil who are talking of these things and thinking of them, and asked them to tell him what there is in all this talk of theirs and what is the justification for it, he would get information which would be a revelation to him.  I am convinced that if the Minister will take his chance and pump more money into Irish agriculture more money will be put into circulation in this country, the purchasing capacity of our people as a whole will be very considerably increased, and the products of the new and old industries that the Minister is trying to put into life will increase in quantity, and in quality as well, because the people will be there to buy them with the money to buy them.</P>

I suggest that Senator Baxter is a worthy opponent of Mr. Corrigan, that he has flown through the clouds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>He has come here after the general election to try to convince us that the policy turned down during the general election is the right policy for the people, and appeals to the Minister to change his policy, to go around amongst the people and learn things which Senator Baxter has learned, or should have learned within the past four, five, six or seven years, for that matter.  One would imagine that the policy which the Minister has been advocating was the Minister's own personal and private affair, that nobody knew anything about it and that nobody could interfere.  The fact of the matter is, and Senator Baxter has as much reason to know it as anybody else, that not only did the Minister get the majority of the people to agree to his policy at the last election, but that 100,000 extra voters voted for that policy within the last couple of months at the election.  Senator Baxter comes along and trots out this same old stuff day after day.  I suggest that he will continue trotting it out until there is nobody left but himself.  I have the greatest respect for a man who fights for a lost cause, but I think the Senator would be well advised to take a headline from the other people of his Party, and not to keep insisting upon this thing, against the will and the advice of the people who really count for anything in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter comes along and says that this is not a Party point of view.  Perhaps he is going to start a new Party.  If he says it is not a Party policy, the policy of the Party to which he has been attached for some years, I say he is perfectly right.  But if he wants to start out with a new policy that is another matter.  If he tries to make out that he is not talking politics, I say that he has consistently talked nothing else but politics. He says that Senator Condon or the Minister has not replied to his statement. I feel sorry for Senator Baxter <Col N="471" /> if he thinks he has been slighted.  I say that the people have replied to his speech and to other speeches made like it during the last general election and that 100,000 more people are against Senator Baxter than there were a couple of months ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to this business of boys turning their thoughts away from the land, Senator Baxter knows well that at every stage in our history for the last 50 or 100 years or 200 years, in fact, a certain proportion of the boys on the farms turned their minds elsewhere for the reason that a small farm could not maintain all the boys reared on it.  In the past, they turned their minds to New York, Chicago and other big cities, but they are turning their minds now to the cities of their own country because this &ldquo;disastrous policy&rdquo; that we hear so much about of developing industry has succeeded in this country and because there is work for a certain proportion of those boys, and I hope there will be work for a greater proportion of them, in the cities.  Senator Baxter says that the Government should by now have found out that it was not such an easy matter to put this policy of industrial development into operation.  Senator Baxter ought to have found out before now that it is not such an easy matter to prevent a policy from coming into effective operation when he or anybody else sets out to oppose the will or policy of the people.  He is knocking his head against a stone wall and the sooner he realises it the better.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter also spoke about credits for farmers and said he believed in it.  Senator Baxter knows as much about that problem as most other people.  Many people who have been refused credit within the past two, three, or four years have been refused credit for the simple reason that men like Senator Baxter have considered them as not credit-worthy.  They have been refused credit because it has been decided by a body of sensible men who know the conditions in the country just as well as Senator Baxter or anybody else and, a good many times, on the personal report of Senator Baxter.</P>
    <P>On the question of interest, I do not <Col N="472" /> want to bring the business of any private company into this House but, when it is so brought in by a man who ought to know better, it is up to me or somebody else to reply.  It is not a question of whether the rate of interest will be 3 per cent, 5 per cent. or 6 per cent.  I am quite prepared to admit that it would be desirable if more money could be made available to the farmers.  I know the obstacles to doing that.  So does Senator Baxter, and so do most other people. It must be admitted that the difference between 3 per cent. and 5 per cent. is not going to alter things to any great extent.  The average loan being made at the present time is about £80, and the difference between 5 per cent. and 3 per cent. on £80 is about 30/-.  If Senator Baxter seeks to convince any body of sensible people that 30/- is going to mean life or death to a farmer, he either does not know what he is talking about or does not mean what he is talking about.  He says the Government should provide capital for the farming community. At the same time, he objects to the policy of land division.  He says that that policy is interfering with something which would be of far greater benefit.  In fact, the policy of land division is, in itself, a policy of credit to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter would like to create the impression that a man getting a farm is getting a present of £600 or £700.  He is getting no such thing. He is expected to pay back a certain amount of that money by way of rent over a period of years.  Neither Senator Baxter nor anybody else who talks about the rural population can, by any stretch of the imagination, condemn the policy of land division.  I believe that there is no better policy for the country, and I think that it is one of the numerous things which will have to be pursued more vigorously in the future than in the past if we are to maintain the agricultural community on the land.  We have had numerous speeches of this kind within the past four or five years but, so far as I can remember, not one sensible suggestion was made by Senator Baxter within the last couple of days or even within the last couple of years as to how that <Col N="473" /> situation might be remedied.  When the other Government was in power, they were not able to avail of all the suggestions made by Senator Baxter. Neither was this Government.</P>
    <P>If Senator Baxter and others get down to business and prepare a workable scheme which would be acceptable to a sensible Department of Government, such as the Department of Lands or the Department of Agriculture, that scheme would be welcomed by this Government&mdash;or by any other Government for that matter.  A good deal has to be done if we are to induce people to remain in the rural areas. It is very desirable that they should remain there.  But that is not a question of whether the rate of interest charged by any corporation should be 3 per cent. or 5 per cent.  Life must be made more attractive for the people. One of the things which would make life more attractive in the rural areas and which would go further than the difference between 3 per cent. and 5 per cent. would be the provision of electric light, whether by the Shannon scheme or any other scheme.  Any man who is in touch with the rural situation knows what a difference it would make if, on a winter's evening, people going to a village on business or for amusement found it lighted by electricity. That is not impossible and I believe it would go a long way towards meeting the situation.  The same remark applies to the setting up of halls and places of amusement for the people.  If Senator Baxter, and those usually associated with him, would study matters of that kind and try to work out some scheme, they would do far more good than by talking about such things as rates of interest.  That is all right in its own way but has very little to do with what we have been told about the flight of the people from the land.  People always fled from the land in certain proportions and probably always will flee.  When we met as an agricultural panel&mdash;we shall probably never meet again and I am sure the country will get along well without us&mdash;I put up certain schemes to Senator Baxter and Senator Baxter pooh-poohed them.</P>

      <P>I should like to intervene for a moment to advert to a theory put forward by Senator Quirke which I heard put forward by various leaders of his Party in other places. His theory is that, when a particular election has been won, those who have been defeated have no right to speak any more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke's theory is that when a particular Party have been beaten in an election they should accept everything the winning Party propose and give up talking, either in Parliament or out of it, about the things which they believe would help the people.  That is the essence of Senator Quirke's statement.  It is a statement which Senator Quirke would not have accepted at any period before 1932.  There was a time, for example, when various proposals which the Minister for Finance would not listen to now, if put to him, were propounded with great vigour, great energy, and, I may say, great ingenuity, by Deputy Seán MacEntee. The Minister for Finance does not now put forward the sort of proposals that Deputy MacEntee argued at that particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> I just want to protest&mdash;not that it is of any use&mdash;against this theory that, when a particular election is over, the Party who lost the election have no further right to put forward any scheme in which they believe.  For example, certain people went before the country on the basis that they would never enter a particular Parliament. Although they were beaten on that policy they persisted in it.  When they were beaten often enough they changed their minds and went into the Parliament.  The essence of Senator Quirke's speech is that some scheme to remedy the flight from the land is necessary, but that he does not believe in Senator Baxter's scheme.  The sum and substance of his speech, when we take the political content out of it, is that if we had the Shannon Scheme in more villages more people would stay in these villages.  Even though I do not live upon a farm I submit that that is a very poor remedy for the flight from the land.  The difference between 3 per cent. and 5 per cent. on £80&mdash;the mathematics of the Senator are, I think, inaccurate; the sum is less than 30/&mdash;would go a long way towards buying a petrol lamp, and a petrol lamp would solve the problem of lighting in most of the villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have industrial alcohol it will be much more difficult to buy petrol and my scheme will not work.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is putting obstacles in my way and in Deputy Quirke's way.  The idea that nobody must put forward a scheme because at a particular election his Party did not win is one with which we cannot agree.  Senator Quirke would be the last to agree to it if he happened to be in a minority, and nothing is more certain than that that will happen.  He said that people had always fled from the land.  The flight from the land had ceased in 1932.  It began again, and is now increasing inspite of the fact that we are supposed to have a policy in agriculture with which Senator Quirke is in entire agreement, and that we had an industrial policy which, he says, is finding employment in the cities and <Col N="476" /> towns for the children of farmers who cannot find work on the land.  In spite of that the disagreeable fact remains&mdash; it is not a political fact, but a common or garden fact&mdash;that people are fleeing from the land to the cities and making city problems more difficult to solve, whether these problems relate to unemployment, housing, or just the question of living.  The people are leaving the land and going across to England in search of work which they cannot get at home, and they would fly from the land even if they had light in every house, and if the Minister for Finance paid for it, if they had not work and could find it in England.</P>
      <P>Senator Quirke wants an end of the type of speech which is disagreeable to him, but in the course of his oratory he did not suggest a single thing which the Minister for Finance might do. While it may worry him to hear certain people talking politics, he adopts an old definition of politics which is very familiar to me: &ldquo;If you adopt my politics you are not talking politics, but if you adopt the other fellow's politics you should not be in a vocational House.&rdquo;  We are all quite good humoured with one another in stating our points of view here, but we are not accepting Senator Quirke's theory. You, A Chathaoirligh, have been very good to me because you have not intervened, although I have not said a word about the Finance Bill&mdash;any more than Senator Quirke did.  We ought to be able to discuss our position without stifling people who can claim to represent 400,000 voters.</P>

      <P>This Bill is designed to remedy a defect which crept into the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932.  Under the Act known as the Blind Persons Act, 1920, it was provided that pensions should be paid to blind persons attaining the age of 60 years.  This age qualification was reduced to 30 years by Section 6 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1932.  In addition to providing pensions for blind persons the Act of 1920 also made it complusory on local authorities to arrange for the welfare of blind persons ordinarily resident within their respective areas.  Arrangements which are commonly known as blind welfare schemes mainly take the form of monetary allowances to necessitous and blind persons living in their own houses.  In a minority of cases the allowances are by way of an augmentation of the wages paid by the authorities of certain institutions to blind persons who perform certain kinds of work in the institution, but who live at home.  In every case the allowance is increased if the recipient has dependent children.  As the law stands at present such allowances must be taken into account in full when calculating the means of a claimant for a pension, even though portion of this allowance may be intended for the maintenance of his dependent children.  The fact is that the welfare schemes cannot be fully utilised for the benefit of the blind person, because the amount of the blind pension is reduced in consequence of the children's allowance, and there is, furthermore, an undesirable inequality in the treatment of the claims for pensions as between those who have children and those who have no children. The Bill proposes to remedy this by providing for the exclusion in the calculation of the means of any sums paid by a local body in respect of a blind person.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>

Section 1 provides for the emoluments and allowances receivable by the President.  It has been drafted to show separately the amount represented in personal remuneration to the President.

    <P>&ldquo;We are aware, however, that the holder will be the first citizen of the land, that high and responsible functions are vested in him under the Constitution, and that he will be <Col N="479" /> debarred from holding any other office of profit or emolument.  Consequently the remuneration for the office should be such as to place him in a position of complete independence financially, and to enable him to maintain with dignity the high position of head of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the terms of the Constitution the Uachtarán will have an official residence in or near the City of Dublin.  We have assumed that the expenditure involved in the provision of the residence, of furniture and equipment and of the maintenance and upkeep of the house and any grounds attached thereto, including wages of labouring and gardening staff will be defrayed directly by the State.  Such arrangements, however, though to some extent they may be regarded as part of the emoluments or perquisites attaching to the office of Uachtarán, and should therefore, not be left out of consideration in assessing the total provision that might properly be made for that office, also impose upon the holder an obligation to maintain himself and his private establishment upon a commensurate scale.  Due note must be taken of this factor in determining the personal salary of the Uachtarán. ... We have also assumed that the Uachtarán will from the remuneration or allowances provided for him, be obliged to defray the cost of the domestic staff necessary for his residence and of all other charges involved in the maintenance of his private establishment on a considerable scale ... We are of opinion that the emoluments and allowances of the Uachtarán might properly be divided into three parts; personal remuneration; allowances the cost of his official establishment; and the provision and maintenance of his official residence ... bearing in mind that the expenditure by the State on the office of Uachtarán should neither be altogether disproportionate to the provision which we have recommended might suitably be <Col N="480" /> made for Ministerial salaries, nor be too great a burden on the public purse, we think that it would be proper for us to recommend that the total cost to the State of providing for the residence, establishment and expenses of the office of Uachtarán na hEireann, should not exceed £15,000 a year, approximately, of which £5,000 a year would be payable to the holder of the post as personal salary fully subject to taxation. Some of our number, however, were inclined to the view that, on the basis mentioned, the limit of total annual cost might be £20,000 and the salary £7,500.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have been guided by the fact that the majority of the committee were of opinion that approximately £15,000 a year might represent in the circumstances the reasonable cost of the Presidential establishment including, of course, the personal remuneration of the President.  It is upon that basis that the Bill has been drafted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amount to be allowed as allowances, expenses and maintenance of the household, it has been decided in view of the constitutional bar against reduction during the individual term of the post that at the outset the amount should not be higher than the minimum which the committee felt would permit the Presidential establishment to be maintained and the functions of the President to be fulfilled unostentatiously but nevertheless as befits that high office.  The conclusion has been arrived at that it would not be reasonable to allow less than £5,000 a year for this purpose and that figure has accordingly been inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is designed to give the necessary authority to provide for the expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President; for the equipment and maintenance of the official residence and for such incidentals as travelling, postage, telegrams, telephones and stationery, all used, of course, for official business.  These expenses, however, will fluctuate from time to time and for this reason apart from other considerations their inclusion in the irreducible amount of the emoluments and allowances is not <Col N="481" /> practicable.  I remind the House that the Oireachtas has already made the necessary Appropriation to meet the expenses authorised under Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The pension provisions for the President are incorporated in Section 3 of the Bill.  In this connection the following is an extract from the report received from the Committee of Inquiry:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We feel, however, that it is imperative on the State to provide against the contingency that a person on relinquishing office as Uachtarán might be obliged to live in circumstances which would be undesirable in the case of one who had previously occupied a position of such distinction in the community. In the consideration of this matter we have assumed that a person who has held the office of Uachtarán will, in the normal course, be precluded from returning to business or professional pursuits, and that it is most unlikely that he will take an active part in politics, with the consequent possibility of Ministerial or other Parliamentary office.  It will probably be found that, even in his retirement, the former Uachtarán will be obliged by circumstances over which he has no control to maintain his domestic establishment on a fairly considerable scale.  If these assumptions are correct, it seems clear that there is an obligation on the State to provide a pension of reasonable amount.  For the reasons indicated in the course of our remarks on the question of remuneration for the office, our recommendation in regard to pension is tentative and will, no doubt, be subject to review in the light of practical experience under the new Constitution.  Experience will also determine the conditions which might properly be attached to the award of such a pension ... Finally, the majority of the Committee agreed to recommend that, after holding office for seven years, the Uachtarán should be eligible to receive a pension of £1,200 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These recommendations as to the amount of the pension have been accepted but it has been held that it <Col N="482" /> would be unwise and inequitable to restrict the grant to persons who have served seven years or over in the office. If that restriction were inserted it would not be possible to grant a pension to persons who might have relinquished the office of President otherwise than under Article 12 of the Constitution. Neither could a pension be granted to a President who having served for less than seven years found himself obliged to resign and was not re-elected at the ensuing election.</P>

      <P>Could that occur? Is it possible or likely that the President would feel compelled to resign on the grounds of principle?  Would the Minister give an instance?</P>

      <P>Well, he might quite easily.  Under the Constitution he is charged with important functions in relation to legislation, and the Executive Council of the day, the Government, feels that he should be placed in a position of as great independence as possible in regard to the discharge of these important constitutional duties.  It seems very desirable that provision should be made for the granting of a pension upon such conditions as will ensure so far as possible for the President freedom from financial considerations in dealing with such affairs.  Sub-section 2 of Section 3 of the Bill provides that a second term in the Presidential office will not enable the holder to qualify for a second Presidential pension.  That refers to the case in which an ex-President has been re-elected.  He cannot get a second pension.  Section 5 of the Bill also provides that should an ex-President be elected to the Oireachtas then, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, of 1925, the Presidential pension shall be abated or reduced by the amount of the allowance which he receives as a member of the Dáil or Seanad.  The section provides also for the suspension of the pension in whole or in part in the event of an ex-President's re-employment and remuneration out of the public funds or of a concern or undertaking the payment from which the Government may deem to be <Col N="483" /> drawn from public funds.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the granting of a pension of £500 a year to the widow of a President or ex-President entitled to a pension.  Section 6 of the Bill creates the post of Secretary to the President, provides moneys for the office of secretaryship and provides also that the post shall be a permanent post in the Civil Service of the State; and that the holder of the office shall come within the benefits of the superannuation Acts.</P>
      <P>The provision in sub-section (4) of the section brings the post of Secretary to the President into line with all other Civil Service posts in regard to tenure and the determination of remuneration and conditions of service. It is necessary to make provision for clerical and other assistance in the office of the Secretary to the President and power to make such appointment is conferred by Section 7.  To ensure that no doubt shall arise as to the method of making these appointment Section 8 provides that they are subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Acts and every Act extending these Acts.</P>

      <P>I approve entirely of the provisions of this Bill and of the Second Reading.  I should like to recommend to the notice of Senator Quirke that this is an example of where facts and arguments have prevailed on the Minister to change his mind.  There was a time when the £10,000 paid to the occupant of the Viceregal Lodge was pasted on every dead wall and when it was made the subject of adverse comment by various people.  I am sure that Senator Quirke himself, if he examines his conscience, will find that he made a few speeches on it in the good old days.  Now we have exactly the same thing proposed, to my mind properly proposed.  Perhaps the only doubt one can have about it is whether adequate provision is being made for such an office as this. It is a sign of progress in the country, at any rate, that we have reached a situation where we do recognise that we have a State and that the head of the State for internal purposes, as the <Col N="484" /> President is under the Constitution, should be properly maintained and enabled to maintain a certain dignity. With regard to the expense of it, I think all workers in certain trades have realised long ago that the existence of a certain amount of entertaining, the spending of a certain amount of public money by the person occupying the office of President, does lead to further spending and to a further expansion of the purchasing power of other members of the community; so that, in one way or another, the actual burden upon the taxpayer and the actual expense to the State is not represented by the amount mentioned here but is, in fact, rather lower than the figures given in the Bill.  I approve of the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to attempt to enter into the labyrinthine mazes of Senator Quirke's or Senator Hayes's changes of mind.  I do not propose to discuss this Bill from the point of view of anything that happened in the past or the rights or wrongs of the payment of this allowance or of a Governor-General as against a President.  I feel however that it would be wrong to allow the opportunity of the Second Reading of this Bill to pass without making a few general remarks upon the whole question of the establishment of the Head of the State in this country.  There has been a certain amount of opposition expressed in the other House, and there is a good deal of opposition being expressed outside the Oireachtas as a whole, towards what is called wasting money on the establishment of the Head <Col N="486" /> of the State in this country at all. Now, my view about this Bill is that so far from being extravagant it hardly goes far enough, and I think it will probably be found, as times goes on, that if the Head of the State does his duty properly, as head of the Irish people, to the Irish people he will need more money for this establishment than is provided.</P>
      <P>We are inclined in this country for a great variety of reasons to adopt an idea of social life which, I think it can be said, has hardly a parallel in any other civilised country in the world. I do not believe there is any country, no matter how democratic it may be, where State functions are so few, where so little time or attention is devoted to, or so little money is spent on, State functions, or on public functions in general as, in this country.</P>
      <P>There has been a tendency, partly a natural tendency, for us to to assume that any kind of display is English display, to identify public functions or public show of any kind with a foreign element in this country and to pass by easy stages from that identification to a sort of un-stated theory that the native Irish people should not have any public display at all or that it is extravagant in some extraordinary way, to take part in public displays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Imperialist or capitalistic or something else of that kind.  Of course that tendency was quite natural in past times.  I am old enough to remember standing at the corner of Nassau Street watching the magnificent procession when a new Lord Lieutenant arrived.  He was escorted through lines of soldiers to the Viceregal Lodge.  Citizens who watched that sort of thing for generations, who felt that they were entirely excluded from it, as they were, that they could take no part in these displays without selling their very souls in order to do it, came to feel that all that sort of expenditure had nothing to do with them.  Over and above that, there has been a tendency during the short lifetime of our State to go a step further, to bring&mdash;very unnecessarily <Col N="487" /> and very injuriously&mdash; Party politics into this question, to take the view that because the Head of the State was the nominee of the Cumann na nGaedheal or some other Executive Council, the main body of the people had nothing to do with the Head of the State and that any expenditure he underwent in upholding the dignity of his office was a sort of infliction on the people.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, I remember seeing in a newspaper, which at that time was associated with the Minister's Party, I think, a statement that I was to be seen with friends sporting in cloth of gold in the Viceregal Lodge or at the Castle while the poor native speakers were starving in County Donegal.  That was the normal way of looking at the headship of the State and its appointments, right up to the introduction of this Bill.  I am not going back into that any further than to establish the fact that that point of view did exist and to my mind, whatever might be the rights or the wrongs of the question, it was a most unfortunate point of view.  It went to reinforce what I have called the natural instinct of the people to regard any public expenditure or public display as wrong and as an infliction on the poor whereas, of course, in any normal, healthily constituted State, the Head of the State belongs to the people and any expenditure that is undergone in seeing that the Head of the State lives in a dignified fashion and is enabled to maintain himself on an equal footing with the Head of any other State, is for the good of the poorer element of the community as well as for the good of the richer.  Until we get that idea into our heads, we are not going to have a healthy public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter goes a great deal further than is supposed, because you cannot have civilisation in any country without some form of social life.  Society is almost a synonym of civilisation, but the only people in this country who were supposed to move in society were the people who figured regularly in the <i>Tattler</i> and the <i>Sphere,</i> people who usually visited this country as they visited Cannes, Nice and Aix Les Bains, <Col N="488" /> or people who came here to take part in hunting or in racing.  To a large extent they were the only people who were allowed to have any social life. As for poor Michael Tierney, because he happens to be the son of a small farmer, if he dares to avail of whatever opportunities hard work has given him, if he dares to appear at any social function, he is going about in cloth of gold while the poor native speakers in Donegal are starving! We shall have that sort of attitude amongst the people generally until the Government make up their minds that a very definite, positive effort will have to be made to create some sort of healthy social life.  I am convinced that many of the social ills which affect many different classes spring from the fact that we have not any sort of normal, healthy social life in the country's capital, or in the larger towns or cities. I referred last week to all the complaints we have had about the cinema and about the abuse of dances run for money, and so on.  All these things are merely the diseased outbreak of forces which should be allowed a natural outlet in a normally constituted State, in a healthy State, where the people were healthily minded in regard to such matters.  Take a country like France, which went through a terrible revolution in order to establish a democracy, and which has the most extreme form of democracy that exists in the world to-day. At social functions in France, if any kind of an official turns up you see the most elaborate uniforms worn, and the most extravagant expenses incurred from our standpoint here.  We have practically no such expense at all.  We have practically no social functions. The other day, when the new President was inaugurated at the Castle, it was easy to see from the way in which that ceremony was carried out that our public men have become atrophied in that respect.  They are hardly able to go through the motions of social life, largely because they have got this half diseased idea into their heads: that any expenditure of time or money on such matters is an English affair and has nothing to do with them.  We have identified in some extraordinary fashion the outlook of the most rigid, the most <Col N="489" /> materialistic English shop-keeping puritanism with what we call Irish nationalism, which used to be a grand thing, an aristocratic thing, a thing to be honoured, a thing of public pride and public dignity.  We have got into such a condition in this country that we have come to regard that as something that is not native.  We look upon these things with the eye of the small shopkeeper, of those whose outlook is coloured by the most materialistic puritanism.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill is the beginning of a better state of things.  There is one suggestion that I would like to make.  It is that the greatest care should be taken in seeing that a special officer, with very special qualifications, shall be appointed to act as what I may call representation secretary to the President.  I do not believe that a more important office in the Civil Service than that could be made.  I do not think it is possible for any man occupying the position of President&mdash; perhaps an old man who has not had a very elaborate social life himself, and especially in view of the peculiar problems that arise in this country&mdash; for the occupant of the office himself to look after these matters.  These will be matters of extreme difficulty and delicacy, requiring a great deal of tact. In order to see that the representation aspect of the President's office is properly looked after, I think it would be worth while to appoint to this position the highest paid officer that you have in your Civil service so long as you can rely on him to do the thing properly. I do not mean that he should indulge in any kind of foolish extravagance or meaningless display and waste of money.  What I mean is that he should see that the office becomes the property of the Irish people, and that the people who take part in these social functions in the future will be the plain people of Ireland.  It will require the greatest skill, tact and knowledge to do that work properly.  I do not think that the President himself could ever be expected to do it. It would add enormusly to the burdens of his office if you were to put that work upon him.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that <Col N="490" /> the matter is well worthy of consideration. You should look for the best trained and the most experienced person that you can get in the Civil Service and give the work to him.  He will have to be a person who is accustomed to social life, not here perhaps but in other countries, where they have had some form of social life in the past. He will have to know who is the proper sort of person to be invited to functions and how each person should be treated.  He will have to move about among the guests and see that the people invited are properly attended to.  This is not a question of privilege but a question of seeing that the ordinary people of the country share in the benefits of this office&mdash;I do not mean in any external or mechanical sense&mdash;because if we cannot make the head of the State part of the life of the people, then we would be better off not to have the office at all.  In order to do what I am suggesting, you will need to get a very well trained and highly experienced person.  It was in order to make that suggestion and to emphasise it that I got up to speak on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of this Bill and gladly support it.  My principal reason for rising is to express substantial agreement with what Senator Tierney has said.  I had intended, before he rose, to speak on the Bill, and to refer to some of the matters that he dealt with in the first portion of his speech.  I do not want to go into the constituency of Senator Quirke or Senator Hayes.  To my mind, one of the mistakes that were made here at the beginning was that the idea got abroad that when the then head of the State was called, unfortunately, I think, a Governor-General, he was not a man of the people or a person chosen by the people's representatives&mdash;that he was not part and parcel of our independent State.  I think that was perhaps due to certain political misconceptions.  I think it was also due to the fact&mdash;and here, I know, I may be misunderstood&mdash;that certain classes of people in the country were allowed, more or less, to capture the office and the functions that surrounded it, with <Col N="491" /> the result that the ordinary people felt that the office had nothing to do with them.  They were ready to believe that he was the representative of another country and part and parcel of it.  Those of us who had anything to do with the first Constitution were, of course, convinced that that was not true.  The new President has been chosen by agreement, and the value of his office, apart altogether from the personality of Dr. Hyde, will very largely be this: if it makes our people feel this is our State, that we are part and parcel of the Government, and that the head of the State is one elected by ourselves, something to which we pay homage and which has nothing to do with Party, and that it provides freedom for the expression of opinion on all sides.  One of the reasons why I think this or any Government will have a difficulty in creating the position here referred to by Senator Tierney is that our people suffer from having their eyes turned entirely on England and on English institutions, which by a sort of inferiority complex they conclude must be better than our own.  That I believe to be false.  I also believe it is due to the fact that our people are not familiar with the practices in other democratic countries, particularly the small democratic countries.  If numbers of our people were to visit, for instance, the Scandinavian States, they would find that State functions are recognised there as of definite value.  I am not suggesting that we should necessarily follow them, but if you go to Denmark you will find all sorts of people attending functions at the palace.  You will find Ministers and their wives coming on bicycles to the palace.  The King moves about amonst his people, and if, for instance, he is out shopping, it is not considered good form to pay any attention to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing is very democratic: everything that you see makes you feel that it is a free State.  Of course, those countries have a tradition behind them that we cannot get immediately. In all those countries the value of State functions is recognised.  They <Col N="492" /> give an opportunity of distinguishing the State from the Government.  The Government, in all countries, has frequently to be objected to because certain of its actions are bound to be criticised, whereas you can make the head of the State something apart. For these reasons I approve of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself I am not at all certain that it will not be found necessary to spend a larger amount on the office than is here provided. I sympathise with the Government in the circumstances in which they found themselves.  They are possibly not to blame for this, because they had to choose the minority report and go as slowly as possible.  But at this stage, I do not think that people should be worrying about their consistency in the past.  We are doing something new, we should not apologise for it but should be prepared to stand over it.  This is something that had to be done.  I find some Deputies and Senators and even some people outside saying that, &ldquo;this is something that we had to do, something that we had to stand over and something which we are satisfied is for the good of the country,&rdquo; and saying all that in a sort of apologetic way. That, I think, should not be the attitude.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in the Bill that I should like to refer to.  It is not clear to me why the President of the day should not have a veto on the appointment of the Secretary for the time being.  If the President does not like him, it is true that he can be consulted, but it is well to remember that the Secretary's office will be an exceedingly important one, and that it is of the utmost importance that there should be the closest co-operation between the President and the Secretary. I am puzzled as to why this is to be a Government appointment.  I would like to know from the Minister what would happen if, when a new President is appointed, he finds that he does not get on particularly well with the Secretary.  If the policy is to be that the occupant of the office is to be an experienced Civil Servant, then in such a case I take it it would be possible to find another post for him in <Col N="493" /> the Civil Service.  But it seems to me essential, especially from the point of view that was stressed by Senator Tierney, that there should be the closest co-operation between the President for the time being and the Secretary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I agree with Senator Tierney that everything possible should be done to make this position one of great honour: to make the people feel that this is our State, something which we have built up, and above all to get them away from the idea of comparing what may happen here with what goes on in Buckingham Palace or in any other place.  The conditions here and in England, for instance, are totally different, but unfortunately you have many people who are inclined to compare everything we have with an English standard, a standard which we do not understand and do not have to understand.</P>

I do feel that the provision which has been made here will probably be found insufficient. On the other hand, it is in fact really determined by the constitutional prohibition against a reduction in the amount of the emoluments and the allowances of the President during his period of office, and while there is nothing to prohibit us from increasing those emoluments and allowances, should it be found necessary to do so, in face of that very definite prohibition we have had to take for the purpose of this Bill the lower figure which was recommended by the commission. I agree that this office is going to play a very important part in our national <Col N="494" /> life for the reasons to which Senator Douglas has referred.  It is desirable that the community as a whole should be able to distinguish between the State and the Executive of the day. In no country will you get unanimity about the merits of the Government. While I am glad to say, as a member of the Government, that we have a substantial majority in the country who think that we are, after all, possibly better governors than the alternative Party might have been; on the other hand, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there is a minority which, however wrongly or rightly, differs from that point of view and differs very strongly.  Accordingly it is desirable that all of us should have some common meeting ground, some one centre in our system to which all eyes can turn and say: &ldquo;There is the representative, above Party, of the Irish people and of the Irish State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This office has already, I think, exercised a very great influence on the public life of our country.  I know that differences have recently tended to be less exacerbated than they were. There is quite a new feeling, not so noticeable, perhaps, in this House, because the atmosphere has always been easier here, but elsewhere.  Not merely in the Seanad and in the Dáil, but throughout the country, I think, one can see that a great change has come over the whole disposition of the people towards each other, and I think that while that tendency was manifest even before the creation of this office, there is no doubt that it has been intensified by the fact that the leading Parties, which differed so bitterly and so strongly in the past from each other in regard to matters which were, perhaps, not so much questions of principle as questions of expediency, should have been able to come together and concur with each other in the selection of a person to represent the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that as time goes on, and the feeling spreads among the people, there will be a desire to place this high office of President in its proper setting.  It is difficult at the start, because we are untutored in these things, to know exactly what is best to be done, and sometimes a plant of <Col N="495" /> that sort requires a little tender care and certain judicious nursing at the beginning, but I have not any doubt that it will establish itself in our life and that all the benefits which Senator Tierney and Senator Douglas have envisaged will flow from it to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the question of the appointment of the Secretary to the President, there will undoubtedly be consultation, and I am not going to say that such consultation will, in fact, develop into a veto, but I have not any doubt that the Government of the day, bearing in mind what the office stands for, will defer as much as possible to the wishes of the President when a new appointment is being made.  On the other hand, we have got to have some safegard to ensure that with every succeeding President we shall not have a new Secretary to the Department of the President.</P>
    <P>I think that the person who occupies that position will have a part to play as a sort of liaison officer on occasions between the President and other people in the State and he will, undoubtedly, in that capacity acquire a great deal of experience which I hope will be the parent of wisdom, of a certain judicial wisdom and tact which will be essential if the office is going to function properly.  I know that elsewhere it has been recognised that with a change in the succession, it is not desirable to change those who are in the immediate circle of the head of the State and the Government have that view also in regard to the office of the Secretary to the President.  As to what might happen if the Secretary and the President found that their temperaments were incompatible, I am afraid we shall have to leave that to time to discover.  I would not, at any rate, endeavour to forecast what might be the solution should such a situation arise.  I do not think that there is anything more that I have to say in regard to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a select committee consisting of nine Senators be set up to inquire into the position of rural workers as regards employment, wages, housing, rent, education, the provision of properly-controlled halls and playing fields, and the allotment of land;</P>
      <P>That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records; and</P>
      <P>That the quorum of the committee be five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who for forty years has been associated with organised efforts to improve the condition of the rural worker and the genuine working farmer, I rise to move this motion standing in my name.  In almost every land the drift from the country to the town is the most marked of all our social problems. It is an unhealthy social sign. About 80 years ago, as one of my old colleagues was accustomed to stress, one-fifth only of our population lived in urban areas.  It would appear as if in another quarter of a century we will have a third of the population in Dublin alone.  The decline and the drift to the towns did not begin to-day or yesterday.  In a little over thirty years half a million of our people were cleared off the land and went to the emigrant ship or to the slums of the towns.  The clearances of Meath caused the slums of Dublin.  In the areas of rural Limerick and Tipperary to-day you have but one-fourth of those who were there 90 years ago. That is an accomplished fact.  The same conditions prevail in Meath, Kildare and Westmeath.  Wherever the fertile areas are, the people were driven off the land, and the richer districts are supporting the fewest people. Prosperity or national progress is not to be measured by the extensive unpeopled ranches or by the number of fat animals for export, but by the number of active, virile, intelligent people the country maintains in reasonable comfort and happiness.  Our strength is not to be measured in animals but in men.  Civilisation replaced the beast <Col N="497" /> by men, but the clearances reversed the process and replaced men by beasts.  The present Government and particularly our worthy Chief, are not to be blamed.</P>
    <P>Under difficulties they have been doing much for housing, for land distribution, and in helping the masses of our people, but, now that the economic war has been ended, much more needs to be done.  Our Government are now free to tackle more seriously the various home problems that need attention, and particularly the lot of the people on the land.  I do not deny that our urban population have serious problems of their own&mdash;the slums are still there, although big strides have been made in removing them.  Rents are far too high and ground rents in and around Dublin are appalling, and must soon be tackled.  Interest rates charged by the banks for housing loans are excessive.  The cost of commodities cannot be defended.  The producer and the consumer are both ground between the millstones of unscrupulous middlemen. The conditions for the growth of a healthy population, both as to food and housing, do not exist in working-class districts in Dublin.  Progress is being made, but the undoing of these great evils must of necessity be slow. I am out to deal with the rural workers, to keep their children, the bone and sinew of our race, in healthy surroundings, where their brawn and brains will be the asset of the nation.  In most cases they are the immediate descendants of those driven off the lands by merciless measures which no British statesman and no reactionary landlord would defend to-day.</P>
    <P>So much has been said on this question that it is hardly necessary for me to go into it again.  It has been discussed in this House by each and every member, but it is a well-known fact that the question of the land is one of the most important questions that the country must deal with.  We certainly think that unless you adopt some plan to break up the ranches and put the people on the land that you will not have a solution of this question.  It is a well-known fact that in Meath alone there are thousands of acres of land run over to-day, as in the past, by beasts, and that the people were <Col N="498" /> cleared off the land and that the bullocks are still taking their places. Even in Tipperary, in places around Cashel, it is a well-known fact that there are thousands of acres of land and no people, because the people were driven off them.</P>
    <P>I think that this subject has been discussed at such length in this House already and that it is unnecessary for me to deal with this subject any further.  There is another question on which I would like to speak, the question of cottier tenants.  A Cottage Purchase Bill has already been introduced, and for what it does we give every credit to the Government, and we certainly say that the principle underlying that Bill is good but that it does not go far enough.  The question of a 50 per cent. reduction is not in the Bill, and there is no sub-section in it which points to a 25 per cent. reduction. We certainly think that the Bill has not gone far enough to meet the wishes of the cottier tenants in that respect.  A 25 per cent. reduction to-day means that 3½d. is taken off the present rents of the cottages, whereas the tenants are asked to assume a liability that is thrown on the board of health of £56,000.  That sum is actually going for the cost of repairs as the cottages grow older.  Now, there is no doubt in the world but this is a statutory liability on the board of health to keep the cottages in repair.  It costs £56,000, but with the 25 per cent. reduction it means that only £32,000 is to be taken off the present rents, and the cottier tenants are asked to assume a burden of £24,000, which is to-day given to the board of health.</P>
    <P>There should be at least a 50 per cent. reduction.  It is a well-known fact, Sir, that cottage rents to-day are a lot dearer than they were in 1881.  Moreover, on the loan charges of the cottages you can see that there is £236,000, roughly speaking, a quarter of a million pounds, that is gone into retained annuities.  We certainly think that the cottier tenant has a right to be given a chance to get some of this quarter of a million of money.  They are the honest class of the community and they have borne the burden of the economic war just as much as the farming population.  For the last 50 years <Col N="499" /> they have been in the forefront of every battle for the rights of the people; in the land agitation they stood beside the tenant farmer in the effort to break the deadly incubus of landlordism in the Land League days. They never flinched or faltered at any time in standing behind and fully supporting the national demands of the country and the people.</P>
    <P>While the principle of this Bill is good, and while we give every credit to the Government for passing a Bill which will make cottier tenants the owners of their homes, we certainly think that the Government have not gone far enough, that 25 per cent. reduction is not enough, and that 50 per cent. reduction is actually required. When they are accepting the liabilities of the boards of health to-day to the extent of £56,000, surely the Government would be well advised in meeting the cottiers on this matter of the 50 per cent. reduction.</P>
    <P>As to the question of unemployment, there is no doubt that it is one of the problems agitating the country at present.  There are, as Senators know, 80,000 unemployed people to-day in the country.  These people are costing the Government at least £80 per head, that is a cost to the country to-day of £6,500,000.  I think many ways could be got of employing those people and removing this evil.  One of the ways would be the reclamation of land in Counties Clare and Galway and along the Kerry coast.  A double asset would be gained if this money were so applied.  By reclaiming these lands you would make the lands productive and you would be helping to solve the unemployment question.  We know that there is more unemployment in Northern Ireland and in England than in this country, but the position is so serious that we think the Government would be well advised to try to solve this problem and thus save the country £6,500,000 which the unemployed are to-day costing.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion as a direct representative of the 50,000 cottier tenants.  We think they are entitled <Col N="500" /> to consideration.  They stood behind the national movement and they are the chief asset of the nation.  I hope the House will pass the motion and, if they do they will be helping to solve this problem for the poorest class in the community and it will redound in their favour throughout the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GilbertHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to second such a motion as this because I feel that a little time should be devoted to consideration of this big problem of the rural workers, the uneconomic holders and the cottier tenants. By setting up a committee such as the motion suggests a comprehensive survey of existing conditions which are said to be responsible for the decline in our rural population might be made and certain recommendations formulated with a view to securing legislative action to improve them.  I believe that it would be more useful to attempt to find remedies than to be continually crying about the ills.  I am sorry to have to state that, in my opinion, there has been more shedding of crocodile tears over this problem than efforts to remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to employment, everyone will agree that to increase the number of employed would be the main concern of any committee or group of persons interested.  I am of the opinion, rightly or wrongly, that there is a certain volume of opinion in this country in favour of a policy that must inevitably tend to decrease agricultural employment.  If the settlement of the economic war is to result in an unlimited market for young store cattle and easy money for what are often described as armchair farmers, I am afraid the benefits of such a settlement are very doubtful.  The student of history, of course, will recall that in former generations a similar situation arose in this country when an unlimited market for every class of four-footed animal was opened; and the appalling results of that are well known to those who have glanced through the pages of the history of the past.  The greed for land, for grass, has resulted in depopulating the countryside and in the crowbar brigade and all those appalling occurrences of the land war. <Col N="501" /> It cannot be argued, of course, that a tillage policy alone would increase employment to-day, as it would 50, 100 or 200 years ago, because of the development of agriculture machinery.  But our farmers should not be encouraged to exploit the market for young stores without keeping a close eye on the finishing and fattening end of the business.  I am afraid it is true that the farmers have been exploiting the labourers for a long time&mdash;not all the farmers, of course, but a very substantial number.  The wages and conditions of farm labourers, to my personal knowledge, were the worst form of slavery in even what are described as the good old days.  I have recollections of conditions of farm labourers, and experienced some of them myself, and for a Christian country I am sorry to say that they were far worse than the conditions of black slavery referred to here to-day.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been made recently to fix agriculture wages.  The wage fixed is too low.  In fact, I will go so far as to say it is too low to enable a man to live in frugal comfort.  But it is appalling to hear political propagandists endeavouring to misrepresent the position and to ridicule the effort to provide for the vast majority a minimum wage which they never got before.  I should like to see it made a criminal offence for certain people, who are compelled by other circumstances to pay more than the minimum wage, to endeavour to reduce the wages to the minimum.</P>
    <P>Much has been done, but much more could be done in the matter of housing at reasonable rents.  Much could be done in the matter of education&mdash;not so much the book-learning type of education, because, I suppose, a farm labourer who could discuss literature, science and art would be regarded as a sort of monstrosity.  I once heard a farmer say that all that was necessary for them to know was just the amount of literature that was in a cow and the science required to milk it.  But a form of education that would produce a highly efficient agriculturist is necessary and that is a subject which such a committee as the motion suggests could usefully examine, so that <Col N="502" /> we would have men and women with a scientific knowledge of agricultural and horticultural production.  We need not aim at very high scientific knowledge, but certainly education along those lines is, I am afraid, sadly neglected in the rural parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is no other country where so much good food is allowed to go to waste and to rot for want of knowledge on the part of our people as to how to use it.  It has always seemed to me the height of folly to have in small towns and rural areas what they call cookery classes experimenting with foreign products, such as rice, tapioca, currants, raisins, cocoa-nut.  All those things are very necessary in a way, but, at the same time, the experiments are confined to these types of foreign foodstuffs while many tons of valuable fruit and vegetables are allowed to go to waste and rot in our fields, woods and hedgerows.</P>
    <P>Next to bread, I think the potato is regarded as being the staple food of the country.  I think it ranks next to bread in its use amongst the population of the country.  Yet, how many of our young people throughout the country ever even heard of boxty, not to say the innumerable palatable and nourishing dishes which could be made from potatoes?  When we read of the progress that is being made in other countries in regard to cookery and the use of all classes of vegetables and fruit which people in this country would regard as mere waste; when we look at the advance that countries like France have made in that respect, we have to admit our backwardness in that regard.  A queer-sounding foreign name would seem to be sufficient to make us eat hay.  Perhaps now that Arus an Uachtaráin is established, a headline in fashionable dishes of purely Irish origin might be set and, perhaps, give an international reputation to some of our lesser-known Irish products, not to mention skill in preparing them.  All these matters have been discussed by various public bodies for a long number of years, including the improvement of the education of our rural population along certain lines, and I am sure that any committee or <Col N="503" /> commission that will examine the problem thoroughly will find ample scope for improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway has dealt with the grievances of the cottier tenants and their efforts to improve their lot.  The provision of properly controlled halls is, of course, a very thorny subject. One means that springs to my mind in discussing a matter like that is that if the Volunteer movement was developed as it should be throughout the country, where Volunteer halls were established, the local Sluagh committees could do a lot to brighten up the countryside by catering for those who are not eligible or qualified for service in the Volunteer forces.  They could help a great deal by having their halls made available for the use of the rural population.  Playing fields do not strike me as presenting a terrible lot of difficulty.  Nevertheless there are some districts where it is very difficult to get permission from farmers to play football.  These are things which could be very easily got over.</P>
    <P>As to the allotment of land, I will say that apparently the majority of the people of this country believe that the Government is doing wonderful work in that respect.  Unfortunately&mdash;perhaps it is not their fault&mdash;they are not doing enough.  I believe they are making an honest effort.  Until all the available land is divided amongst the people you will have cries and wails from the countryside.  In spite of all that has been said in this House and outside it in connection with the plight of the farming community, the greed for land is astonishing.  If, as some farmers would have us believe, they are not making their farms pay, it is difficult to understand the lengths to which people will go to acquire just as much land as you would step over.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion, but, discussing this motion now, in an election atmosphere, it is very difficult to get for it the attention which it really deserves.  I would go so far as to suggest that the matter might be left over for discussion by the new body which will be coming in shortly.  Fortunately or unfortunately many of us will not be here to carry <Col N="504" /> on the discussion, but I believe that the subject is well worthy of consideration by such a body.  If Senators are of opinion that the motion will not get the consideration it deserves at the present time, then I would be in favour of withdrawing it and leaving it to be considered by the new body in which there will be representatives of the people most concerned and which can discuss the matter more fully and more throughly than it can be discussed to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNewcome" hpid="Mr. Newcome Mr. Newcome">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Newcome</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support the motion, although I agree that it would be more desirable to defer it until the new Seanad meets.  I and those associated with me in the Mount Street Club feel that a back-to-the-land policy is the only policy which will help to solve this question of unemployment. We have tried experiments in a small way in connection with city unemployment, and we have found that it is a successful policy.  We have so much faith in this matter of land settlement that this very day we are inspecting a farm of 200 acres with a view to encouraging the city unemployed to get a back-to-the-land outlook.  I believe that anything that would help to make rural life more attractive and that would keep the people in the country would be of advantage to this nation.  Whilst I should prefer that this motion should be passed, I think that, in view of the coming election, it would be better to defer it until the new Seanad comes into being.  I heartily approve of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that this motion is before the House at a time when it cannot get the consideration that it deserves.  That is a matter that concerns every member of the House. Those of us who were brought up in rural areas know the condition of the rural worker.  Each of us knows that the rural worker is not as well treated and is not getting the same concessions as the urban workers.  I think that the House might make certain recommendations to the Minister responsible regarding what could be done for rural workers.  We have Senator Baxter and other Senators talking <Col N="505" /> about encouragement to stay on the land.  I am honest enough to admit that the present Government has done a great deal for the rural workers but a lot more could be done and I hope will be done for them.  The rural workers are not treated in the same way as city workers.  Why I cannot understand.  The cottage tenants are entitled to a 50 per cent. reduction just as much as the farmers are entitled to a 50 per cent. reduction in their annuities.  If the farmers are entitled to that, the labourers, who are not half as well off, are entitled to the same concession.  On that I have always expressed my opinion and do so now.  I hope the Minister will see his way to approve of that view in the near future.  The Minister has done a lot in bringing forward a purchase scheme but I am not satisfied that a 25 per cent. reduction is sufficient when the tenant is responsible for repairs.  I do not want to go into figures, as Senator Conway has dealt with that aspect of the question, but the 25 per cent. reduction is not enough in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that every member of the Seanad will agree that there should be equal payments for widows and orphans in rural areas and in urban areas.  Encouragement, we are told, should be given to the people to stay on the land. Encouragement is not given inasmuch as a distinction is drawn between the widow residing in an urban area and the widow residing in a rural area.  If a man thought he was shortly going to pass out of this world, and if he had a wife and four or five young children, it would be in his interest to move into an urban area.  That is a sad thing, but it is true.  When that is the case with a man whose days are numbered, is it any wonder that a man who is about to start life would move in also because of the better conditions?  Widows and orphans in the rural areas should get the same amount as they do in the city. There is another point in regard to widows' pensions which I should like to mention.  Some of these widows may have been living on small, uneconomic holdings of a few acres, on which they never had a day that was not a day of hardship.  These women are in some <Col N="506" /> cases receiving only 1/- or 2/- a week. I hope to see the day when the Government will be in a position to treat all widows alike.  It is a great pity it has not been possible to do that up to the present.  We have a Minister who is very favourable to that class and, if he did this, it would be one of the greatest acts ever done in this country, because these widows never had any of the comforts of this world.  Senator Hughes spoke about the kind of dishes cooked in these houses.  It was very easy for the women in these cases to cook anything they had to cook.  I hope to see the time when a widow of that class will be treated on the same lines as a widow residing in an urban area.  The widow residing in an urban area may have enjoyed comforts which the widow on the uneconomic holding did not enjoy, because the husband of the urban widow may have been earning good wages.</P>
    <P>Another question to which I wish to refer is that of unemployment assistance or the &ldquo;dole.&rdquo;  It is very hard to see any decent man being forced to go for the &ldquo;dole.&rdquo;  In these circumstances, however, I cannot understand why he should not get the same amount in a rural area as is obtainable by an unemployed man in an urban area.  The Government's advisers must have thought this matter out very seriously before they made the distinction, but it is a thing I cannot understand.  Take the case of a man living in a rural area with a wife and five children.  The highest amount he can get is 14/-, whereas a man with the same responsibilities in an urban area will get 20/-.  Six or eight persons cannot exist on 14/- a week.  What is the result?  These people are forced to go to the relieving officer.  We have cases in County Dublin where they get 12/- or 14/- assistance.  People living on the borders of Meath are forced to go into the Home Assistance Officer to make up the difference between what is obtainable and what the city person is getting from one source.  If this committee is set up, it should give grave consideration to the position of people like those.  Picture the plight of a man who has to go in six miles to obtain 3/6 a week.  He must walk in <Col N="507" /> because, if he paid his fare twice a week, the 3/6 would be gone.  If we are going to keep the people on the land, they must get the same conditions as the people in the cities and the urban areas.  That is not the position to-day. While admitting that a great deal has been done in fixing the wages of agricultural workers and in other ways, they are not treated the same as urban workers.  There is no need to set up a commission or to send for papers to establish that.  Each one of us knows that that is the position.  The encouragement is to go into the city. A single unemployed man in Dublin gets 10/- a week, even though his father may be earning £5 a week.  The single farm labourer's son, if unemployed, does not get one penny.  That is wrong.  I hope the day will come when there will be nobody on the dole.</P>
    <P>When work, subsidised by the Government, is undertaken in a rural area, one of the conditions of employment is that a man should be in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I say that that is wrong.  There may be a certain type of person who is not so anxious for work but it is very hard on some of the people in rural Ireland to have to go for anything in the shape of assistance.  The majority of people in rural Ireland like to earn the money they receive.  There is a great spirit amongst the population in rural Ireland and I hope that that spirit amongst the peasantry will be maintained. If there is work available in a certain area and people are willing to give an honest return for wages, they should not be asked to go in and sign up for public assistance.  That is a matter which I hope the responsible Minister will deal with.  Naturally, it would be a fair way to find out if a man was entitled to work&mdash;that is, if he was eligible for unemployment assistance.  By all means have investigations made and give the man an unemployment certificate but do not force him to go for assistance before he is taken on for work.  That is a matter on which I feel very keenly. If we want the people to stay on the land, then the residents of urban and rural Ireland should be treated equally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> This Government has set a great example in regard to the division of land, particularly in giving preference to the cottier tenant, with his accommodation plot.  I am afraid that that has not been carried out so well latterly as at the start.  In the area in which I live, last year there was some land divided and some of the cottier tenants got portions of that land.  I believe that the cottier tenants should get portion of these lands for more than one reason.</P>
    <P>The first is that by giving the workers some property or stake in the country you are helping to make better citizens and helping to kill Communism for all time.  You are helping the man; if his family are unemployed they can work on the land.  I really think that the cottage tenant should in every case get preference when these lands are being divided.  He has worked so hard for his living in the land, and he gives all he has to produce more wealth from the land.  He should have first claim in the allocation of any portion of land that is to be divided.  Last year an estate was divided in North County Dublin, and at that time 13 or 14 tenants of cottages did get portions of that estate.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that when an estate was divided in an adjoining area this year not one occupier got an accommodation plot.  It would be interesting to know why the change from the previous year was made this year. Those who got accommodation plots last year made very good use of them indeed&mdash;much better than other people who are in better circumstances and who let their land to others.  I hold that the Government should not go back at all on the precedent set in giving land to the cottier.  In every case where the cottier was in possession of half an acre and cultivated it, that man should be given preference. In doing that the Land Commission are helping the nation, they are helping the family, and they are helping to build up a sound people who will never go wrong.  If the worker is given a stake in the country, that is a very great and important thing. <Col N="509" /> Now, in connection with the matter of controlled halls in the villages, I am afraid we have not come to the time when we can treat such a proposal seriously.  The first thing the worker wants is at least a home.  Certainly the present Government are doing very well in that direction.  The present Minister for Local Government and Public Health has made great strides in connection with the building of labourers' cottages.  Notwithstanding that, one still finds in a portion of the County Dublin workers who are residing in hovels not fit for animals, never mind human beings.  In the area in which I happen to represent on the county council there was a scheme approved of in October, 1935, for the erection of 40 labourers' cottages. These people are still living in the houses that were then condemned.  The new houses have not yet been built for them though the scheme was approved. In such a case the Minister should take action.  He has power but we, the people living there and knowing the conditions, have no power.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some members of the County Dublin Board of Health took exception recently to a statement by me in connection with that scheme. Their answer was that more cottages are being built by their board than by any other board in Ireland and that the responsible Minister had complimented them on the number of houses they had built.  Where is the use in telling people who are residing in hovels that the rest of the people of the country are living in fine houses? They know the conditions in which they themselves are living.  If a man is working for the miserable wage of 15/- or 18/- a week, is it any comfort to tell that man that other employees are earning £5 a week?  Telling a man a thing like that will not feed his children. Certain members of the board of health stated that they built thousands of cottages in the country. What is the use of that to us in Finglas?  In 1935 the Minister made up his mind that these 40 cottages were needed at Finglas yet in 1938 they are not being built.  This is a case where the Minister should exercise his <Col N="510" /> power.  The men concerned are good decent workers and they should be provided with a decent house in which to live.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am travelling a little beyond what we started with, but I know this does affect rural workers in this country.  I do not know whether we are to give a decision on this motion of Senator Conway's to-day. Perhaps it would be unwise.  I think it is a pity, at a time when the present Seanad is going out of existance, to bring on such a motion.  But I do appeal to every member of the present Seanad who hopes to be elected a member of the next to take up this question.  It is a most important one. I do not know why the workers in urban areas get preference over the workers in rural areas.  We have all Parties in agreement in asking to keep the people on the land.  But we cannot keep the people on the land if we do not give them at least equal treatment with the people in the urban areas.  Those are my views on this question, and I do hope that out of this motion something good will come for the benefit of the rural workers, a class even more important than the farmers.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration for certain farmers.  I have admiration for the farmer who gives employment and pays a decent wage.  I have the greatest possible respect for such a man.  But there are certain people who own hundreds of acres who have never paid a decent wage, have never properly cultivated their land only when forced to do so by Government action when tillage was made compulsory.  I heard Senator MacDermot say that those people were a necessary evil.  But I hope to see the day when the evil is removed.  I have great respect for the honest tillage farmer who is making an effort to cultivate his land.  More consideration should be given to that type of farmer.  At the present time he has a certain remission of rates, but the amount allowed is too small.  More should be done for the farmer who is giving employment.  He should get more advantages in derating.  The man who has never taken off his coat to do an honest day's work or never paid a <Col N="511" /> decent wage and who has his land uncultivated has no such claim to consideration. Treat the farmer well and you help him to treat his labour well. That is all I have to say; I would say much more if it were not for the particular time at which this motion is being brought forward.  I do hope that when we make a recommendation effect will be given to it by the responsible Minister.</P>

      <P>We have listened to the speeches made by the mover and seconder of the motion and the claims put forward by Senator Tunney on behalf of the workers.  I would like to put forward the claims of the unemployed. I think the first duty of the State is to put every man who is capable of being employed into employment. That is the view I take.  It would be much better if a five years' plan or a ten years' plan were adopted by the Government to carry out national improvements such as drainage and forestry.  Much could also be done for the fishing industry which could be developed more than it is at present and in that way employment could be given on the sea-board areas.  I would not, I think, at the present time very strongly support this motion that we have been discussing because I believe the duty of finding work for the unemployed is more pressing.  The question of town halls and playing fields has been mentioned. The last speaker did not attach much importance to that.  I do not agree with him.  I believe that it is necessary in every village in Ireland to have a properly controlled hall, well equipped for dramatic classes and such other things as would be found useful. I suggest that the Minister should allocate about £100 to any body of workers or any committee or society in a particular village who would be prepared to erect a public hall.  I just mentioned the £100 to enable the committee to make a start in the erection of such a hall.  I suggest to the mover of the motion that he should withdraw it and it could be introduced probably in the new Seanad when it would receive much more and better consideration that it can receive here <Col N="512" /> this evening.  The motion is deserving of consideration by the new Seanad.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that this question of the agricultural workers has been raised, but I believe its further consideration should be left over for the new Seanad.  Like the previous speakers, I believe that this question of the treatment of agricultural workers is one of the greatest importance and should be tackled as soon as possible if rural reconstruction is to be taken in hand.  My views on the question of agricultural workers is not so much with reference to housing as to the matter of providing them with a living wage.  The wage which has been fixed is 27/- a week.  Now, when we consider the cost of living and the expenses of keeping a family, we can easily see that that figure is not sufficient to maintain a man and his wife and family.  The figure might be all right for a single man, but the married men amongst the rural workers are in the great majority.  To maintain a family 27/- a week is not an adequate wage.  There is besides the fact that though a man may be getting 27/- a week he may not on the average draw more than £1 a week. He will be occasionally unemployed, and for that reason his average wage will be less than £1 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish that we could make those who do not live in rural districts understand the conditions under which an agricultural worker living in a cottage tries to bring up a young family.  An agricultural labourer when employed may be fed by his employer and, if so, his actual cash wages would amount to about 14/- or 15/- per week.  Senators can realise how difficult it is to rear a family on such a wage.  It means very often that there is a scarcity of essential foodstuffs.  The children of cottiers are very lucky if they get meat once a week or even less.  There is a scarcity of such essential foodstuffs as butter and meat, which are so necessary to growing children.  The children, from their earliest infancy, are brought up on a diet which consists almost entirely of bread and milk.  The problem which faces us here is how to increase the labourers' wages to such a figure as it will at least <Col N="513" /> enable him to provide his family with the ordinary necessaries of life.  The trouble, unfortunately, is that labourers' wages are uncertain and they are low because of the conditions obtaining in the agricultural industry at the moment.  Owing to marketing conditions all over the world, to the general depression in prices and the consequent depreciation in the value of agricultural produce, the farmer is not able to pay a higher wage.  The problem which faces the Government is how to supply the deficiency between the amount which the farmer can afford to pay in present circumstances and the amount which would be sufficient to maintain the worker and his family.  My personal opinion is that the only solution of this problem is to subsidise agricultural wages.  It may seem a very drastic remedy but I do not believe it is so drastic as it may seem at first sight.  I believe we must strain every effort to provide a living wage for our agricultural workers who, after all, are the foundation of the nation's prosperity.  We must provide them with a sufficient wage to enable them to rear their families.</P>
    <P>I believe that if a census were taken of the people whom we would have to assist with these subsidies, it would be found that the sum involved would not after all amount to a very considerable figure having regard to the immense advantages which would result.  The return from such expenditure would well repay the outlay.  A little money, say five shillings, a week goes a very long way in the country especially amongst agricultural workers. During the time when free beef and free milk were distributed some years ago one could see at once an improvement in the physical appearance of agricultural workers and their families.  To-day you can see that these children, fed under the conditions which I have described, are reared without proper nourishment and they are consequently as easy prey to diseases such as tuberculosis when they grow up.  That condition of affairs is not due to recent conditions in agriculture.  It is a condition which has been a very long time developing, in fact since the Famine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> In earlier days, these agricultural workers in our county, and I suppose all over Ireland, generally took small allotments of land on which they could supplement their earnings from their employers.  At a later stage, these holdings were taken from them.  They lost them immediately after the Famine but they continued to live in the hovels.  These hovels were replaced by cottages in our own generation but a change was also taking place in the whole condition of agriculture in the southern counties.  In the early days, a labourer was able to live on his land with occasional work on neighbouring farms.  At a later stage, although the labourers had lost his right to the allotments, there was so much tillage and so much work was provided by dairy farming in the South that the labourers were continually employed. There was very little unemployment with the result that labourers were at-least able to live.  In more recent times, however, the general depression in agriculture set in, the proportion of tilled land became less and less until finally tillage almost died out altogether.</P>
    <P>Dairy farming, which was the foundation of prosperity in the south, also gradually gave way to the rearing of dry stock and of fat cattle, not alone on the ranches but even amongst the small farmers with the result that there remained less and less employment for the agricultural worker.  Faced with these conditions, the agricultural worker, on the other hand, grew less and less inclined to work on the land and more and more anxious to get employment on the roads, or to go into the towns and cities with the result that you have to-day the deplorable situation amongst agricultural labourers which has been described. That situation has got to be remedied; these conditions must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>One cannot blame the present Government or the previous Government for this condition of affairs because it has been gradually developing for the last 60 or 100 years.  If agriculture is to survive, if the agricultural labourer is to survive, this question has to be <Col N="515" /> tackled.  Perhaps if a commission is set up, it may possibly devise some means which will enable the agricultural worker to live on the land.  My opinion is that any inquiry must proceed on those lines, that the Government must be prepared to subsidise agricultural workers' wages in such a way that his earnings will provide him with a living wage.  In addition to that, there are other means by which the conditions of agricultural workers could be improved.  The present Government undoubtedly has made great advances in the direction of providing agricultural labourers with allotments of land.  Allotments, such as these, give new hope and courage to the cottier.  I hope that policy will be continued, because no matter what may be said about landless men, they at least can be removed to districts where estates are being broken up, whereas the cottier has no hope of improvement in that respect unless land in the immediate vicinity in which he lives is being divided.  In addition, I think loans might be given to enable the cottier to purchase and maintain a cow.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why in rural districts he should not be able to keep a cow to help him to maintain his family.  The question of cottage industries might also be considered together with side lines, such as poultry keeping. I fear I have detained the House too long but, in conclusion, I should like to support the motion.  Though we may not be here when the new House is set up, I hope the new <Col N="516" /> Seanad will seriously consider this question and realise that it is very necessary to the country that it should be solved at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>At the express wish, and on the recommendation of other speakers, I agree to withdraw this motion in the hope that it may be considered by the new Seanad.  We were asked to introduce this motion at the express wish of some 50,000 cottier tenants in various districts, and we trust and hope, as representatives of that body, that the new Seanad will give this motion the support it deserves.  We are glad that support for the motion has come from each side of the House, representing as we do, for the moment, the Cottage Tenants' Association, which to-day is recognised as a nominating body and as a successor to the old land and labour movement.  We may not be here when the new Seanad takes over, but we hope at all events that this matter will receive the attention and support it deserves.  I might mention that the very people who four months ago gave evidence, with the object of preventing our association from becoming one of the nominating bodies, are now trying to come into it.  I accede to the request generally made and ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7 p.m. until Friday, 22nd July, at 10.30 a.m.</P>
