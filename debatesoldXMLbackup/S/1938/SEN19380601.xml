      <P>I understand there is a general desire to postpone the appointment of committees and the motions on the Clár until the next meeting of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my motion is concerned, Senator O'Dwyer and I feel that the atmosphere is not the atmosphere that existed when we put down the motion, and that the problems of agriculture are so vital, and of such outstanding importance, that they should be considered under conditions when judgement would not be disturbed by the conflicting thoughts that are in men's minds at the time of a general election.  We hope, when we pass into calm waters again, which will not be <Col N="201" /> very long, and which, I presume, will leave things as they were, that the House will be prepared to consider this motion.  For that reason, I ask the House to assent to the suggestion that the motion should stand adjourned until the next meeting.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the same, Sir, about the motion down in my name. It is especially intended to engage the serious attention of Ministers, and somehow or other I have a feeling it would not engage the serious attention of Ministers at the present time.  But I wonder if it would be possible for you to throw any light on the question as to whether these motions will ever have an opportunity of being discussed at all by this Seanad or what exactly is the future of this Seanad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that point, I would like to be advised on another important matter.  I understand the constitutional position at the moment is that the Oireachtas consists now, for the time being in any case, of Seanad Eireann, and I would like to know, Sir, if I would be in order in requesting the permission of this House to introduce a small Bill and put it through all its stages, while the Seanad is in that singular position, to abolish the Dáil, and avoid all this trouble of a general election. I think we have in this Assembly brains enough on both sides of the House to form a vocational Government. The country would welcome that and would give a sigh of relief if this distraction with which it is threatened were avoided.  I would like to know if I would be in order in seeking the permission of the House in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been officially communicated to me, through the Clerk, that the general election for the next Seanad will take place on the 17th August, but there is a likelihood that there will be business coming from the Dáil for the Seanad to consider about the 15th July next.  Then we can meet as often as we like until the general election takes place&mdash;to the day previous <Col N="202" /> to the general election.  Senator Milroy's suggestion was made earlier in another place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be an opportunity for the Seanad to reassemble before the 15th July?  I understand that the Dáil General Election is to take place on June 17th; that is the polling day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the Seanad so desire, they can meet earlier.  There is nothing to prevent it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the position that the Seanad can decide to-day, but if it does not decide to-day it will be for you to decide?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I partially answered it.  I shall accept a proposition should a Senator wish to make one, as to the date of the next meeting of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a proposition that we do meet earlier than July 15th.  It is very likely that then we shall be overwhelmed with Government business.  In the meantime we have two motions to which we attach, rightly or wrongly, great importance, and there may be more motions put down in the interval; for example, some new scheme may be devised in connection with the next general election of the Seanad itself; somebody may wish to introduce a Bill on that subject.  I would therefore suggest that we meet earlier.  I do not know whether it is necessary to propose a particular date.  I have not got the day of the week in my head.</P>

      <P>The 6th of July, Sir, is the more suitable date, because then you may have financial business from the new Dáil.  However the new Dáil is composed, there are two financial measures which they must pass and pass quickly, and so must we.</P>
