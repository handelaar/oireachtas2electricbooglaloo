      <P>Unfortunately I had to attend to business of a rather important nature elsewhere.  I certainly would not agree if I had been here. As one who was absent, I wish to express disagreement, if I am in order in doing so now.  To take the Second Stage of the Industrial Alcohol (No. 2) Bill to-day is simply making a farce of the procedure of Parliament.  This is supposed to be a revisionary body, and the constitution of this House was re-arranged&mdash;at least, we were given to understand&mdash;in order to secure that it would be more effective in that respect, and less of a political body.  This is a Bill, the merits of which, to put it mildly, are open to very considerable doubt, and it provoked very tense debate in the other House.  I am not expressing any opinion on it at the present time.  We are asked to take all stages of these Bills at one sitting, without having had time even to consider their merits since they were passed by the other House.  I say that not only should all stages of the Industrial Alcohol Bill be not taken to-day, <Col N="518" /> but even the Second Stage should not be taken.  We should have time to examine that Bill before it is brought up for discussion.  It is brought before us now without being given time to examine it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps you would permit me to remark that as far as the Industrial Alcohol Bill is concerned, and apparently it is the one the Senator is referring to, I think the attitude he has adopted is a rather unreasonable one, in view of the fact that that Bill was discussed in the other House, and had two Committee Stages there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, I suggest that that is what we are here for, and if the Senator was so terribly interested in these Bills he would have been here yesterday.  When he was not <Col N="519" /> here he should abide by the unanimous decision of the House.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the Senator has not learned of these Bills for the first time to-day.  If he is as terribly interested in them, as he would have us believe, he should have read them within the last two or three months, because they were discussed by everyone, with the exception of the Senator.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister a question on sub-section (4).  Under that section &ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Government to declare by order that any particular fund or money shall be deemed to be a public fund for the purposes of the next preceding sub-section of this section.&rdquo;  Is that a usual procedure or is the Government there taking powers that they have not exercised in the past?  It looks a little peculiar to me to see the Government taking power to declare any particular fund to be a public fund by order.  I thought there should be some legally recognised standard as to what was a public fund.  I can see irregularities arising in relation to this matter at some later date.  If, for instance, there is controversy between the Government and an outgoing President as to the amount of the pension, there is a possibility that the Government may be enabled by this sub-section to settle the matter on their own flat, so to speak, and, perhaps, in some cases unjustly.  I would like to know what is exactly intended by that sub-section.</P>

      <P>The intention here is to deal with remuneration which might be received from such sources as the Currency Commission or the Industrial Credit Corporation or the Aer Lingus <Col N="520" /> Teoranta or, say, from university funds, most of which are provided out of public moneys; but I feel certain that the power of the Government in a matter of this sort is not likely to be used in the manner the Senator suggests.  I am sure that both parties, the outgoing President and the Government of the day, will recognise what is befitting in the matter and will endeavour to agree about it.  The power to declare what is a public fund is required to avoid the recital in the Bill of a considerable number of concerns, remuneration drawn from which might be regarded as remuneration out of public moneys.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 6, with regard to the Secretary, I notice that he is also to be Clerk to the Council of State.  He is, therefore, rather more of a type of civil servant than the kind of social secretary that Senator Professor Tierney was talking about.  Section 7 says that there may be attached to the office of the Secretary to the President as many officers and persons as the Taoiseach, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall think necessary.  I presume that does make possible the appointment of a social secretary if it is desired to supplement the secretary himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is not necessary to enable a social secretary to be appointed.  I do not think it is necessary to have actual statutory authority for an appointment of that sort.  It would depend upon whether we considered it as part of the personal establishment of the President or whether we considered it as part of the official establishment of the President. If it were part of his personal establishment and if he were to be appointed by him entirely on his own responsibility and upon his own initiative the charge would properly have to be borne by the allowance under Section 1 of the <Col N="521" /> Bill.  If, on the other hand, a sort of secretary of the protocol or something of that sort were required, he might possibly be appointed under Section 7 and the post would be regarded possibly as a permanent one in the public service.  These are matters which will have to be decided as we find out what is desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the transfer of the control of the Industrial Alcohol undertaking from the Department of Industry and Commerce to a company to be established.  The Bill, it is true, repeals the Industrial Alcohol Act of 1934, and re-enacts most of its provisions but does so with very little alteration and would, in fact, not be necessary were it not for the decision to effect the transfer to which I referred.  As Senators are, no doubt, aware, the carrying on of a commercial undertaking by a Government Department is rarely satisfactory.  This Industrial Alcohol undertaking was started as an experiment and during the initial stages of it, when decisions were being made as to the process to be worked, as to the location of the distilleries and as to the arrangements to be made for their construction, it was, perhaps, more suitable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be in control so that the Legislature could be advised of the measures taken at every stage and afforded an opportunity of getting information or expressing an opinion <Col N="522" /> concerning them.  The distilleries have now been completed, however, and during the coming session they will be working, it is anticipated, to the fullest extent, and the time has arrived, in the opinion of the Government, when a more suitable method of control is advisable.  We are, therefore, proposing the establishment of a company which will be set up in accordance with the provisions of the Bill and which will carry on these distilleries in the same way that a privately owned company would.  I do not know if Senators desire any detailed information concerning the actual position of the undertaking?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have mentioned, the Government decided, in 1934, upon the establishment, as an experiment, of five industrial alcohol distilleries. In that year, as some Senators may remember, and for some time previous to that the price prevailing for potatoes in this country was very low. It was felt that the establishment of some undertaking of this character, which would utilise potatoes as a raw material, would permit of the regulation of the price of potatoes in bad years by providing a market for the surplus that could not be consumed at home and that, in any event, it would be of considerable benefit to farmers in particular localities of the country.</P>
      <P>Five distilleries, as Senators may be aware, were established, one in the Cooley peninsula of County Louth, in respect of which special considerations operate because, although potato growing has always been a main feature of the agricultural industry there, it is scheduled as a &ldquo;black scab&rdquo; area and potatoes grown in that area are not allowed to be sold in other parts of Ireland.  There is another distillery in County Monaghan; there is one in County Donegal and two in County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each of these areas, with the possible exception of County Monaghan, potato-growing is an important occupation of the people, and the establishment of an undertaking which would absorb quantities of potatoes at <Col N="523" /> a reasonable price was considered likely to be of substantial benefit to the people.</P>
    <P>There are of course, other considerations which might prompt the establishment of this industry rather than another industry which would use potatoes as a raw material.  There are, as is well known, many commercial products produced from potatoes. Those which have received most prominence in this country are starch and glucose, which are used in considerable quantities here and which can be made from potatoes, and also from other vegetable products.  I felt there were good reasons to select industrial alcohol for the purpose of this undertaking rather than some other product. Most countries, for different reasons, are engaged in the production of industrial alcohol, and in many countries they have legislation similar to that embodied in this Bill, requiring its use in an admixture with petrol.  The considerations which may have prompted the establishment of the industry in various countries may vary, but there are obvious advantages in having available a supply, however small a part it may be of our total requirements, of motor spirit which, in times of difficulty, would permit of a more economical use of the spirit which would have to be imported.</P>
    <P>Industrial alcohol mixed with petrol and benzol is also a motor fuel of very high quality.  It is superior to ordinary petrol as a motor fuel, and it is selling on its merits as a motor fuel in other countries.  In the United Kingdom last year a national alcohol mixture placed on sale as an ordinary commercial undertaking sold to the extent of 9,000,000 gallons, which represents a production far in excess of anything contemplated here.  Industrial alcohol is also a commercial raw material.  It is used as a raw material in the manufacture of commercial products of one kind or another, but the market for it for that purpose in this country is far short of the contemplated production of the five distilleries.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the five distilleries will produce 1,000,000 gallons of alcohol per year.  When they were originally planned, an output less than <Col N="524" /> that was anticipated, but it has been found that the circumstances in this country permit of the operation of the distilleries for a longer period than in other countries, and consequently the production of a greater quantity of spirit; and furthermore, it is intended to utilise, during the portions of the year in which potatoes are not available, molasses purchased from the Irish Sugar Company, the effect of which will not merely be to increase the quantity of spirit produced, but also to decrease the working costs of the distilleries.</P>
    <P>The distilleries commenced operations last year, but they operated only for a comparatively short period.  The various distilleries were started one after another, there being an interval of two or three weeks in each case. The first distillery operated was the Cooley distillery, and the last one was the Ballina distillery.  The production of alcohol was 414,000 gallons, which was less than half the estimated annual production of these distilleries.  There were employed during the campaign period a total of 250 employees.  The alcohol produced was sold to the petrol distributors, to be mixed by them with an appropriate quantity of petrol and sold.  The price fixed is 3/- per gallon. That price is estimated to be adequate to cover the cost of production in a complete year of operation, and also to meet overhead charges and provide for a return of 5 per cent. on the capital invested in the enterprise.  It also includes a margin for contingencies.</P>
    <P>The actual estimated cost of producing alcohol and meeting these charges, including interest on capital, is 2/10½.  The cost of production last year was, of course, higher than that, because the distilleries were working for a comparatively small part of the year.  In giving that figure I have to emphasise that it is merely an estimate. It may prove to be possible to produce spirit at lower price.  It is not anticipated that a higher price will become necessary.  The price of spirit depends entirely upon the price paid for potatoes and the other raw materials, as well as the cost of labour.  The raw materials required are potatoes, barley and coal. <Col N="525" /> When we decided originally to proceed with this enterprise, the price prevailing for potatoes was very much lower; in fact, potatoes in Donegal and Cooley areas were selling at about £1 per ton.  That was the price paid for graded potatoes for human consumption. Potatoes are purchased for these distilleries at £2 per ton.  That is the price paid for the whole of the produce of the land, and it represents a substantially higher price for graded potatoes. No difficulty has been experienced in securing adequate supplies of potatoes at that price, except in the Ballina area.  I do not think the difficulties there are likely to continue.  They arose solely out of the fact that the factory commenced so late in the season.</P>
    <P>There is no compulsion on the farmer to sell at that price, and the fact that they are selling at £2 when the ordinary market price for graded potatoes is very much higher, is an indication that it pays them to do so. It is a wise policy for the farmers in these areas to maintain the supply to the distilleries, because the circumstances that existed over a number of areas around the year 1934 in respect of the price of potatoes may be reproduced at any time.  There is probably no agricultural product in respect of which so great variations of price occur as potatoes.</P>
    <P>The amount which has been expended already upon the construction and equipment of the distilleries is £266,000.  Land, buildings and roads cost £156,000.  The plant and equipment, including the royalty payable to the owners of the process, cost £97,000. Rolling stock, lorries and other miscellaneous equipment cost £13,000.  In addition, capital liability has been incurred in respect of the excess of the production costs on last year's working over the estimated normal production costs, and the amount in this connection is £13,000.  The interest on fixed capital up to date amounts to £13,000.  Further royalties are payable to a firm of engineering experts who have been advising the Government in this matter, royalties which will be payable over four years' production, but which represent a capital liability of £30,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> The proposal in the Bill is that the Minister for Finance will be issued shares to the amount I have mentioned. The nominal capital of the company has been fixed at £500,000. It will be noted that the figures I have given include no provision for working capital.  A cash advance will be necessary, probably to the amount of £30,000, to provide for working capital in the coming season.  Against that the Minister for Finance will also get shares in the undertaking. Although the nominal capital has been fixed at £500,000, it is not anticipated that £500,000 will be required on the basis of the present undertaking.</P>
    <P>Apart from those provisions which have special relations to this undertaking, the rest of the Bill in its provisions relating to the formation of this company are similar to other measures of a similar kind which have been enacted by the Oireachtas in recent years.  Most of the other provisions of the Bill which provide for the acquisition of land, the construction of works and so forth are merely re-enactments of the Act of 1934.  It was felt desirable, from the point of view of the Oireachtas, that the 1934 Act should be repealed and these sections brought into this Bill rather than that we should frame merely an amending Act which would have in every section some reference to the Principal Act.  I do not know if there is any other point upon which the Seanad would desire information.  If there is, I will be very glad to make it available.</P>

      <P>I do not think this is a matter in respect of which the Seanad should spend much time.  Many people were sceptical of the effects of this policy, but it is definite policy, and I think it is our desire that it should be a success.  I missed the first portion of the Minister's speech, and I do not know whether he is in a position to give any indication as to what the increase in the price of petrol is likely to be.  It would be a great advantage if we could have that as soon as it is possible to get it, because there are wild and extravagant rumours about which are doing nobody any good.  From memory, what the Minister said, that this is very largely in the same form as other Bills creating similar companies, is correct, and from that point of view I do not think there is any reason for us to criticise it.  I notice, however, that there is power to acquire land at only one month's notice.  That may be a common form of provision&mdash;I cannot remember&mdash;but it is extraordinarily short notice.  In the case of a dwelling house there is three months' notice to be given, but it seems to me that one month's notice of intention to take a person's land compulsorily is far too short.  There may be very good reasons for it, but, generally speaking, I think it is not a thing of which we should approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that I should say a few words in the discussion of this Bill.  I always approach these matters with a certain sense of inferiority to the Minister, because he has to take into account social, spiritual and cultural values, whereas I, as an economist, am more interested in purely economic values.  I recognise fully that the point of view of <Col N="528" /> the economist is necessarily a somewhat prosaic and pedestrian one, and that there are occasions when the nation has a perfect right to incur economic losses in order to achieve cultural, spiritual and national values; but at the same time I think that, in aiming at those values which stand higher in the hierarchy of values, a nation should take into account what precisely are the economic losses involved.</P>
      <P>In a matter of this kind, one of the difficulties is the extraordinary one of measuring what economic losses are incurred in policies like this policy of industrial alcohol and the other policy of beet sugar.  In theory, if you could ascertain the national income after the full establishment of these schemes and compare that national income with what the national income would have been if factors of production had been allowed to find their own national direction, without this artificial diversion, the difference between these two national incomes, one actual and the other hypothetical, would be a good enough measure of the economic loss; but apart from that criterion, which may give rise to some controversy and ambiguity, the only rough and ready way that occurs to me of measuring the economic losses involved in these schemes is: what is going to be the loss to revenue account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am rightly informed, the full operation of this industrial alcohol scheme would involve a reduction in the import of petrol of 1,000,000 gallons a year.  If I remember rightly, the tax on petrol is 8d. per gallon, and if my arithmetic is correct, 1,000,000 eight-pences is roughly £30,000.  I am quite prepared to take an annual loss of £30,000 on revenue account as a rough and ready measure of the economic loss involved in this scheme.  That amount of £30,000 a year, capitalised at 5 per cent., is the equivalent of £600,000, and so we may as well face the fact that in putting through this scheme, we are, in fact, adding to the deadweight national debt a sum of money which is at least £600,000.  I am not sure that we ought not to go further and take into account also the additional cost to the users of petrol which will result from this mixture, and capitalise their loss also as consumers.  In that way, you would <Col N="529" /> probably add substantially to this estimate of £600,000 as the deadweight addition to the national debt.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk at any length on this aspect of Government policy at the present stage because there are reason why it would be more convenient to delay a more serious consideration of all these aspects of Government policy until we have more of the facts available, and especially the facts that will be brought to light when the report of the Banking Commission is available; but I should like to go on record as being utterly in disagreement with these economic policies.  I think we should not take on any additional commitments in that way until we have completely explored all the aspects of the policy in question.  Of course, the outstanding example of a policy of this kind is the beet sugar business which cost the taxpayer in loss of revenue £1,000,000 a year, which loss, if we capitalised it at 5 per cent., is the equivalent of a deadweight addition to the national debt of some £20,000,000.  We might have had some excuse for that kind of thing during the years when the economic war was in operation, but now that that has been happily terminated, I hope we have seen the end of these very expensive economic policies. In the meantime, I want to emphasise the fact that they have, in fact, added to the deadweight national debt sums of money running into tens of millions of pounds which do not appear in the national accounts at all.  On the contrary, in so far as they do appear, they appear as assets.  They are not assets at all, but sources of continuing loss to the taxpayer and the nation.</P>
    <P>The only real argument in the Minister's speech in favour of this industrial alcohol policy is the situation of the Cooley farmers in County Louth.  I recognise that they do occupy a difficult position because they are not allowed to send their potatoes to the rest of the country, or even to the rest of their own county, but have been completely dependent on the export market.  If you put it to those 2,000 or 3,000 potato growers whether they would rather have a free gift of £600,000 contributed by the rest of the nation or the industrial <Col N="530" /> alcohol factories, I imagine they would plump for the £600,000; and we would be doing a perfectly rational thing, from my point of view, if, instead of going ahead with these factories, which are going to cost the country an additional debt of £600,000, we were to make a present of that £600,000 to the only people who are likely to be the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to potatoes, I think that is one of the few agricultural products of which by far the greater amount is absorbed by the home market.  Surplus potatoes, for the most part, are used in the feeding of pigs and poultry.  I think, myself, that it would be a much better policy to encourage further the pig and poultry industry.  In the matter of pigs alone, our export to the British market is only a matter of some 300,000 or 400,000 cwts. in the year, whereas other countries, such as Denmark, export something like 6,000,000 cwts. in the year, and, at times, have been even exporting 9,000,000 cwts.  Of course, for some years, owing to certain circumstances, our market was restricted; but now that our export market is free once more I would much rather see money being devoted to encouraging the production of pigs and poultry than being used in this perfectly absurd manner. Of course, this policy, although it may have seemed to be good politics, was always bad economics, but I think the time will come when the reverse will be true, and the Government will realise that it is both bad politics and bad economics; and I have no doubt that, in the next general election, the Minister will reconsider his attitude with regard to this and similar policies.</P>

      <P>In reference to the point made by Senator Douglas, I may say that no further increase in the price of petrol or motor spirit is contemplated in relation to the price of industrial alcohol.  The increase that was made some time ago, to which I have referred, was in consideration of the beginning of the operation of the scheme&mdash;that is, in connection with the supply of industrial alcohol to the <Col N="531" /> distributors&mdash;and I think that should be sufficient to enable them to recover whatever additional expenses they may have been under in putting this mixture on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that no further increase would be justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No further increase would be justified in consequence of the establishment of these distilleries and the supply of 1,000,000 gallons of industrial alcohol to the distributors.  The price of industrial alcohol has varied more than once since industrial alcohol commenced to be distilled.  That was in consequence of world changes, and, of course, the price may very again; but the specific increase that was made was designed to recover the original cost, even though it may have been masked by variations in the general price of petrol at the time.  I agree with the Senator's observations with regard to the acquisition of land and building, but, in practice, a much longer time has been allowed.  The provisions in this Bill are similar to corresponding provisions in other Acts, such as the Liffey Reservoir Act and the Air Navigation and Transport Act, and other Acts of that kind.  However, it is not expected that any further use will have to be made of the powers given by this Bill, by reason of the fact that all the land, buildings, and so on, for this company, have already been acquired.  These provisions are merely, so to speak, a re-enactment of corresponding provisions of the 1934 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Johnston's points as to Budgetary considerations, it is quite true that, if purely Budgetary considerations were to be taken into account, this enterprise would not have been started; but it must be remembered that there is probably no form of industrial production at the moment which does not have reactions on the Budget.  Any increase in industrial production here, involving a corresponding reduction in imports to this country, must have a reaction on the Budget.  It is probably <Col N="532" /> true to say also that, of the various new enterprises started in this country in recent years, this industrial alcohol enterprise is the most problematical, and one of which the ultimate utility is most open to question. However, it is also true that in a large number of countries action has been taken by the Governments concerned to secure the production of industrial alcohol.  The motive of these Governments may have been a desire for national self-sufficiency or, more probably, the fear of national insufficiency in a time of war or of national difficulty, and I do not think that can be entirely left out of account.  There were, of course, other considerations working in our minds.  We realised that there would be some value in having a supply of motor fuel&mdash;however small&mdash;available in the country; but our main consideration was the desire to have some means of fixing a downward limit to any fall in potato prices.  The situation in relation to potatoes in this country is rather unusual. The actual proportion of the total quantity of potatoes produced that is exported, is very small; but small as it is, it exercises a very great influence on price.  In fact, the normal export of potatoes in recent years has been substantially less than the quantity of potatoes that will be utilised in these industrial alcohol distilleries. Of course, it is not desired to restrict the export of potatoes in any way; but it is felt that, in these areas that are concerned, particularly, the establishment of these industrial alcohol distilleries will tend to fix the downward limit of potato prices.</P>
    <P>If that were the main consideration, I think it would be quite justifiable for us to refrain from operating these factories except when the prices of potatoes were bad or likely to be bad; but there are other considerations to be taken into account.  I do not know what importance should be attached to the fact that there is a commercial demand for a motor fuel of this character, but there is no doubt that there is a commercial demand for such motor fuel which is obviously expanding in other countries.  It is true that in Great Britain they sold an alcohol mixture at the price of first grade <Col N="533" /> petrol although the cost of producing the mixture was much higher, and on that scale they got a remarkable return which was recorded last year. That may be particularly true with regard to the use of this spirit for certain special purposes, such as long distance aeroplane flights and other activities of that kind.  However, whether we were wise or not in starting this enterprise in 1934, the fact remains that it is there now, and it is there now under, probably, the most favourable conditions in which we could have got it.  The plant was purchased at a time when costs were very low, and the firm concerned was the well-known Skoda Works, of Prague, and they have given a guarantee of 60 years.  Recent inquiries established the fact that similar plant would now cost almost double what we paid for it; also the building were constructed upon a basis favourable to us.  Having those plants there now, I think it is worth while carrying them on, and if we are to carry them on I think there can be no question that it is desirable to effect the change in Government control which this Bill contemplates.  That is, of course, the main purpose of the Bill.  It is open to the Government at any time, of course, to reconsider its decision in relation to this enterprise, to suspend its operations, or to carry them on if it is considered desirable to do so, but I think we ought to have further experience of its work.  We do not even know as yet what the costs of the operations will be in a full year's working, and I think we should at least get that information before coming to any definite decision.  In my opinion, in view of the fact that capital expenditure has already been incurred, it will always be worth while to carry on the distilleries rather than close them permanently, or adopt the alternative of closing them temporarily at a time when potato prices on the ordinary commercial market are high.</P>
    <P>However, I do not want to be dogmatic in any view I express concerning this enterprise.  It is one concerning which we deliberated for a long time before deciding to embark upon it, because the considerations to which Senator Johnston has referred were before our minds.  We had to <Col N="534" /> contemplate the losses of revenue; we had to consider the possible effect upon motor users of an increase in the price of motor spirit, and to balance those considerations against the advantages &mdash;certain national advantages which we saw, and more particularly the advantages to the producers of potatoes in the localities in which the distilleries were established.  In the circumstances of 1934 and 1935 we decided on establishing the enterprise.  Possibly, if the circumstances now existing had existed then we would not have done so; I mean if potato prices had been as high then as they are now we would not have taken this step, but, having taken it and knowing that the price of potatoes may at any time collapse again, I think it is advisable to keep the enterprise there.</P>

    <Title>Telephone Capital Bill, 1938&mdash;(Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Traynor) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Traynor)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fifth Telephone Capital Bill since the transfer of the services in 1922.  Funds for the development of the telephone service, that is, for the extension of the system as distinct from its operation and maintenance, are provided by the Telephone Capital Acts.  These Acts authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund such sums, not exceeding a stipulated amount, as may be required for the development of the telephone service, in accordance with estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.  The moneys so provided are raised by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 20 years.  The present Bill provides for a sum not exceeding £1,000,000, which amount will, it is anticipated, suffice for requirements for a period of about five years.  This provision, together with <Col N="535" /> the moneys provided in the four previous Acts&mdash;£1,750,000&mdash;will bring the total amount provided by the State for telephone development since the transfer of services to £2,750,000.  It was anticipated that the amount of £500,000 provided by the last Telephone Capital Act of 1936 would cover expenditure for four or five years.  Telephone charges were, however, substantially reduced in July, 1936, and the increased rate of development which followed the reductions necessitated unprecedentedly heavy outlay for additional plant and apparatus.  Of the money provided by the Act of 1936, £168,000 is still undrawn, but as the capital programme for the current financial year will involve about £300,000, the balance available will be exhausted in the next three or four months.  The present Bill is accordingly necessary to provide further funds.</P>
      <P>There are now 26,400 telephone subscribers, an increase of 3,000 during the past two years; 40,500 telephones in use, an increase of 3,800; 793 telephone exchanges and 1,485 call offices and kiosks&mdash;increases of 38 and 47 respectively. During the 12 months ended 30th June last, 29,400,000 local calls and 3,200,000 trunk calls were made, representing increases of 3,400,000 and 800,000 on the figures for the year ended 30th June, 1936.  This gives some idea of the development of the service which has taken place in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst the major works carried out during the past two years were: (a) the extension of the automatic system in Dublin.  This embraced the installation of new automatic exchanges in Crown Alley and Clontarf, also the closing of the Drumcondra and the Dundrum manual exchanges and the transfer of the subscribers' circuits served from them to the Crown Alley and Terenure automatic exchanges, respectively.  (b) The provision of a large number of additional trunk circuits to carry the greatly increased trunk traffic.  The increase in circuit accomodation and the introduction of the up-to-date &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; system on the main trunk routes has materially improved the standard of <Col N="536" /> the service both as regards expedition and the quality of transmission. (c) The laying of a new cross-Channel cable of the most modern type between Howth and Nevin, North Wales.  The increase in cross-Channel traffic has been considerable, particularly after 7 p.m., when the low night rates apply; and in addition to the new cable recently laid it has been necessary to arrange for the provision of a further cable, the laying of which is about to commence.  When the two new cables are fully functioning 16 cross-Channel telephone circuits will be available for public use, and a first-class service will be ensured.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the service is satisfactory.  A profit was made for the first time in the year 1931-32.  This profit increased yearly to 1935-36, when it reached £105,702, but following the reduction in tariffs it fell in the year 1936-37 to £73,833, and it is expected that the accounts for the year 1937-38 will show a further fall.  Expenditure is naturally growing by reason of extensions of equipment, increased staff costs, etc., but, on the other hand, revenue is increasing steadily.  While, however, revenue will continue to grow, the profit on the service is not likely to show any upward tendency in the near future as the capital outlay must, in order to meet growing public needs, continue high for some years to come.  I do not think that it will be possible during the next five years to keep capital expenditure below an average of £200,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The programme of major capital works during the coming five year period includes in addition to the normal works involved in the provision of service to new subscribers, etc:&mdash; extension of automatic equipment in Dublin, a new automatic exchange for Dun Laoghaire and surrounding districts; new automatic exchanges in Cork and Dundalk, and possibly also in Waterford, Galway and Sligo, a new central trunk exchange in Dublin, additional overhead trunk circuits, a second new cross-Channel cable, underground cabling of certain main trunk routes on which overhead lines are overloaded; extensions of equipment in manual exchanges and installations of additional &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; circuits on main <Col N="537" /> trunk routes, etc.  With the exception of the Erris Peninsula, County Mayo, an area which is at present under special consideration, no important or extensive locality throughout the country is now unprovided with telephone service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister that it is still the general policy of the telephone service to depend on overhead wires rather than on the underground cable?  If so, is that not a matter in which we differ from the general practice in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Post Office, so far as possible, where the overhead lines are overloaded, is to put them underground.  It is a very much more expensive method, of course, than the overhead method.  I do not think I can state definitely that the general policy will be to go from the overhead to the underground system, because of the very heavy additional cost involved. But, where extensions are found necessary, such as on some main trunk routes like the Cork, Belfast and other routes, we are putting them underground as far as possible.  I do not think, however, that we would be justified, because of the extraordinarily heavy cost, in adopting the policy of underground cabling.  I do not think it is adopted in England, which is a rich country.  In England they are doing what we are doing here, namely, going underground when it is necessary to make extensions; but, generally, I do not think it is their policy to take down all the overhead wires and substitute underground cables.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from that particular point, I dare say we should not measure our standard of telephone service by comparison with such rich countries as England and America; but I think that we ought to measure it by comparison with small countries of our own size approximately and our own wealth.  I am afraid that, even as compared with such countries, we here in Ireland are very far in the rear.  I do not blame the Minister or his predecessor. A good deal has been done to improve the telephone service in <Col N="538" /> this country during the last few years; but by the universal consent of all I have met who are acquainted with telephone services in other countries, we here in Ireland are about a quarter of a century behind the times.  I think it would be a good investment, in view of the very real value that an efficient telephone service is to a country, to spend still more money in developing our telephone service here than the Government is at present contemplating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a somewhat similar remark, but, sitting beside Senator Johnston, I do not like to advocate any heavier expenditure. I think that we can support the Government in doing everything possible to modernise the telephone fully. I think it is not always realised now that in the matter of the telephone we started with a very inefficient service and inefficient instruments.  Owing to circumstances which we need not discuss now, I think practically nothing had been spent on the telephone service by the British Government in the period preceding the establishment of this State.  In fact, I think hardly anything had been spent on the telephone service from the time it was handed over by a private company except what was necessary to keep it working.  Consequently it was inevitable that we would be saddled with considerable expenditure and that we would be somewhat behind the times. I think I can say, however, so far as Dublin is concerned, that while things are by no means perfect there has been a marked improvement.  I welcome the further expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has in mind any programme for the further development of the telephone service in rural areas.  At present there seems to be a growing interest in and a growing anxiety as to the tendency of people to leave the rural areas.  Every Department of Government should concentrate on that particular problem, and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could do as much in its way as any other Department.  Life should be made more attractive for people in the rural <Col N="539" /> areas, and I believe that the introduction of the telephone would go a long way in that direction.  I do not know exactly what would be a workable proposition in this regard&mdash;whether it would be the setting up of automatic telephones at particular centres or the making of the telephone service more easily available to people in private houses.  I believe that something in the way of automatic telephones, here and there, would go a long way to meet the problem.  People in rural areas are now inclined to keep in touch generally with the country, and there is a growing tendency to discharge business over the phone.  I appreciate what the Minister has done since he came into office in the way of reducing telephone rates and making the telephone service more easily available to a number of people in the country, but I believe that a good deal more could be done, and I ask the Minister to examine the situation from the viewpoint I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Quirke has said in regard to the use of the phone in rural areas.  I agree that it would be impossible to have a direct service in all the rural areas, but I think it would be possible for the Minister's Department to arrange to have a public telephone at each Gárda station.  That would overcome many of the present difficulties. The Guards are very obliging when sick or urgent calls have to be made at night, but the phone in the barracks is not regarded as a public phone.  If the Minister could make some arrangement such as I suggest, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I have been speaking to some people who are employed in the Minister's Department, and they complain of their long hours, particularly in regard to attendance at the telephones during the night.  I ask the Minister to take this complaint into serious consideration and to bring the conditions of work in this regard up to the required standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the point raised by Senator Quirke, the making of a continuous telephone service available in rural areas during the <Col N="540" /> night has always given trouble to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The question has been under consideration for some time recently.  Beyond stating that we are about to experiment in one rural area, where the demand would be greater for a telephone service at night than in many other rural areas&mdash;I refer to the Lusk Malahide area&mdash;I cannot say very much. We are about to experiment there with an automatic service.  A lot will depend on the results of the experiment.  That experiment will provide continuous telephonic service to subscribers in that rural district.  If it were successful, it would probably be extended to other areas.  The question of expense has also to be considered.  The expense of installing automatic exchanges is very high.  I agree with Senator MacDermot that the needs of the people rather than other aspects of the question should be taken into consideration.  So far as humanly possible, that is the manner in which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs approaches most of its problems&mdash;from the point of view of the needs and requirements of the people.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any problem exists regarding the hours which attendants have to work.  The attendants in these exchanges who are on duty at night are actually provided with sleeping accommodation, and a special alarm bell rings when a telephone call comes through to that exchange.  The hours are not unduly long.  I do not think that they would be any longer than in normal circumstances. I do not think that any hardship is inflicted on any of the employees of the Department who have to do that particular type of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find&mdash;to return to Senator Quirke's point&mdash;that a large number of requests for longer service at night are made from time to time.  Where services cease at 8 o'clock, we have requests to extend them to 10 o'clock and where they go on to 10 o'clock, we have requests to extend them still longer.  When we get to the point of examining a particular case&mdash;each case is examined on its own merits&mdash;we find that the average number of calls in the place from which the request for longer service came is such that it <Col N="541" /> would not justify us in employing an additional attendant.  For example, two or three additional calls per night would not justify the Department in incurring further heavy weekly expenditure. We hope that, as a result of our experiment in the Malahide-Rush-and-Lusk area, the problem will be solved by the introduction of the automatic system.  If that experiment is successful, I have no doubt the service will be made available in other areas. This Department is highly efficient, in my opinion.  I keep very closely in touch with it and I know that those in charge of it are in contact with the specialists of other nations.  Quite recently, I was talking to a distinguished American and he complimented me on the efficiency of the telephone service in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Sometimes, I am inclined to think that our people have an inferiority complex in regard to some of the services provided by their own State.  This gentleman told me that our telephone service here was superior to the service in America.  I am only repeating what this gentleman told me when complimenting me on the telephone service.  In connection with the arrival of the American aviator, Mr. Corrigan, we were again complimented on the very high efficiency&mdash;those were the words used&mdash; of our telephone system.  I think we should be proud of that.  There are complaints&mdash;some of them are probably justified&mdash;as to our telephone service but I find that most of our people demand a sort of turn-on-the-tap service.  If we are to get close to the perfect standard, the user of the telephone will have to perfect his own methods because we find that many of the complaints are due to the shortcoming of the individual using the telephone.  Of course, individuals very rarely admit the fact.  If the individuals would perfect themselves I have no doubt whatever that the telephone system would be vastly improved in respect of the service and we would have an almost fool-proof service.  I do not think there is anything else I need say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister familiar with the conditions in the service, <Col N="542" /> for instance, between Dublin and Dun Laoghaire?  I have not used that service myself for the last month or two, but before that I used it in the early Summer months.  I must say that my experience of the service was extraordinarily bad.  It seemed remarkably bad in a place so near Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the circumstances were under which the Senator was using the telephone, but very recently I had the experience of a Deputy in the House coming down to me in a tearing rage on account of the manner in which he felt he had been abused by the Telephone Department. When I cross-examined him I found that he had gone and endeavoured to secure a trunk call without acquainting himself with the means by which a trunk call could be secured.  He rang up the Exchange, told them what he required, then went and wandered away.  When the trunk call came through in due course, he was absent. Several people went looking for him. When he was eventually found most of the three minutes had passed, and he was in a range then because he was not allowed to have a full three minutes after he came to the phone.  As a matter of fact, he was not at the phone when the call came through, and he was absent during part of the time when he should have been using the phone. Now, that was a case in which the Telephone Department was not in any way to blame.  I have no doubt that gentleman will be one of the severest critics of the Telephone Department when the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs comes up for discussion in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Any indication I could give would be in anticipation of the decision of the Taoiseach, but subject to that I would say that the Seanad will probably be convened in the first week in September.  That, of course, as the Senator will know, is only a personal indication, and there is nothing definite about it.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.55 a.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
