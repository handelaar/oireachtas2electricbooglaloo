      <P>If I might be allowed to intervene, I should like to say a word on the question raised by Senator Sir John Keane on the subject of the exemption of documents from stamp duty.  I was unable during the discussion in Committee to refer the Senator to the particular sections of the Bill and the paragraphs of the agreement relating to the matter.  Section 8 of the Bill, which relates to the transfers of the assets of the participating companies to the terminating company provides for transfer by means of vesting order, and it is provided <Col N="234" /> in one of the sub-sections of that section that no stamp duty will be payable on the vesting order.  In so far as the vesting order may be inadequate to effect the transfer of the assets of a participating company to the amalgamated company, the stamp duties will be payable by the terminating company on transfers or conveyances of assets, but any duties so paid will be refunded by the State.  The case for recouping the terminating company the stamp duty payable upon such transfers or conveyances is that, if it is obliged to bear the stamp duty charge, its insurance fund would be to that extent depleted and the company would, at the outset of its operations, be in the position that its assets would be insufficient to cover its actuarial liabilities.  I would point out that, apart from the relief from stamp duty upon the taking over of the assets, neither the terminating company nor the permanent company will enjoy any special relief from duty. They will, like every other company, have to bear the full duty upon capital and pay stamp duty upon all documents and forms to which the stamp duty applies.</P>

    <Title>Holidays (Employees) Bill, 1938&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to apply, in the case of workers not covered by previous enactments, the same principles in respect of holidays as have been applied to those other workers.  In 1936 the Conditions of Employment Act was passed, and, amongst other provisions, it secured for industrial workers the right to holidays with pay.  In the case of such workers it provided six public holidays during the course of the year and one week's consecutive holiday as annual leave.  The Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act of last year secured similar privileges for those who work in shops and wholesale houses, although the circumstances of these businesses necessitated some alteration in the particular method of applying the same principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was introducing the 1936 Act I informed the Dáil that it was the intention of the Government to enact similar legislation covering all occupations, <Col N="236" /> so that there would be brought into existence a code of legislation which would prescribe minimum conditions of employment in these occupations and protect the workers engaged in them.  The 1936 Act was the first of these measures, and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act of last year was the second.</P>
    <P>It became obvious, however, in the course of preparation of these Bills that the preparation of a complete code was going to take a long time, having regard to the many difficulties experienced in framing legislative provisions to cover the varying circumstances of all occupations, and the Government considered that it was desirable to forestall the completion of its programme by introducing forthwith this Bill for the purpose of applying to all workers, as soon as possible, the holiday provisions of the 1936 Act, leaving the question of the regulation of other conditions of employment to be dealt with subsequently.  That is the reason this Bill is being presented now.  Certain classes of workers are excluded from its scope for a variety of reasons, but, generally speaking, it seeks to ensure for all workers, other than agricultural workers, not covered by the 1936 and 1937 Acts, the same right to holidays as industrial and commercial workers now have.  For the information of Senators, I should point out that it was considered expedient for a number of reasons to repeal the holiday provisions of the 1936 Act and to re-enact them in this Bill, firstly, because it was considered more convenient that all these provisions should be embodied in this Bill, and, secondly, because experience had shown that some modification of the provisions of the 1936 Act was necessary to remove anomalies.</P>
    <P>The terms of this Bill had to be drawn fairly widely because it is designed to cover workers in a great variety of occupations not all of whom can be treated in the same way.  If Senators will consider, for example, the position which arises on a public holiday, they will see at once what I mean.  If a public holiday is to be a real holiday for a number of people, a number of other people must work on that day.  To give everybody a holiday on a public holiday would mean that <Col N="237" /> there would be very few facilities available for enjoying the holiday.  Therefore, it is necessary to introduce provisions which will enable some people to work at times that other people are on holiday and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The circumstances of domestic servants, who are covered by this Bill, had also to be taken into account.  A number of domestic servants might find it inconvenient, if not impossible, to take a holiday at all if that holiday meant being put out of the place in which they usually work and in which board and lodging are provided.  In order to deal with particular circumstances which might arise, special provisions in relation to domestic servants had to be introduced in this Bill and the whole framework of the Bill is based upon a classification of the workers affected as &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-domestic&rdquo; workers.  I do not anticipate that the principle of the Bill will be contested.  The legislature having already provided statutory regulations to ensure holidays with pay for other classes of workers will, I am sure, not seek to deny similar rights to the workers affected by this measure.  Consequently, this is a Bill the various sections of which can be more conveniently discussed in Committee because what arises for consideration is not so much the principle itself as the manner of applying that principle to the various classes of persons concerned.</P>
    <P>In general, the principle has been applied, as closely as possible, on the lines of the provisions of the 1936 and 1937 Acts so as to ensure, as near as may be, uniformity of treatment for all workers.  As I explained, uniformity was not fully possible but I think everybody will recognise the necessity for having somewhat different provisions in the case of the workers affected by this Bill.  In fact, a great deal of the work of applying the principle of holidays with pay to these workers will have to be done by regulation rather than by direct provision embodied in the Statute itself.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any other matter to which I need make specific reference now.  I should imagine that members of the Seanad <Col N="238" /> would be anxious to give close examination to the Bill in Committee. Each section of the Bill raises problems of its own&mdash;separate problems and not related one to another. The procedure of Committee Stage is, therefore, more suitable to the Bill than that of Second Stage.  I recommend the Bill to the Seanad.  There can be no question that we are morally bound to enact this measure to secure, in respect of workers not covered by the 1936 and 1937 Acts, that their treatment by the State may be no different from that of any of the others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a &ldquo;spoil sport&rdquo; and I accept the aphorism that &ldquo;all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.&rdquo;  This Bill must be taken along with the Bills already passed.  I profoundly disagree with the philosophy behind this measure and the other measures of a similar kind.  They represent the conception of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He tells us that we are morally bound to pass this Bill.  It is strange, in a country where goods are scarce and dear, to have a Minister getting up in the legislature and enunciating a policy of less work, fewer days for work, and, by inference, less work being done on the days devoted to work.  If there is one country in Europe in which the leaders of the people should get up and tell the people that they must work harder and must work longer hours, it is this country.  Comparing our policy with the policy of other countries, one has to ask what are the possibilities of progress in the world in which we are living?  There is no doubt that our people do not work as hard as the people across the Irish Sea.  I doubt if it would be claimed that the people over there or, indeed, the people of France work as hard or as long hours as the people of certain other countries in Europe.  We do not want to introduce these conditions here but we have the obligation upon us to examine the policy propagated here and see what the consequences will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the debacle in Czechoslovakia, the then leader there said to <Col N="239" /> his people: &ldquo;We must work harder and harder, so that we may forget our loss.&rdquo;  I should not mind if the Minister's policy meant an equitable distribution of all the burdens of labour in this State.  I should not mind if the Minister were propagating a policy in a country where you could number by the hundred thousand those who were going down the mines or standing the white heat of the blast furnaces.  But these are not the conditions here.  The Minister and I have very different conceptions as to what the structure of our future State ought to be.  So far as one can judge, the Minister's view is one of glorification of industrialism. He thinks that that is the right foundation on which to build.  It looks as if he wants to have his roots in the pavements of the streets, while I should like to have my roots, and the country's roots, in the soil of the country.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty about all this legislation which the Minister is enacting is the situation that it has created and is creating in rural Ireland.  I find it difficult to understand how the Minister, who, we must concede, works long hours and works very hard, believes that things are going to be bettered by fewer hours of labour and lower output during those hours, because that is the experience of those of us who have seen the fruits of some of the legislation already passed.  Elsewhere in the world the cost of living is lower than it is here. People are working harder and producing more goods.  Their output must be higher than ours.  They are able to produce the necessaries of life and distribute them to the people at a lower price than that at which they can be procured here.  Accordingly, the standard of life is higher for those people.  The Minister's industrial policy, in pursuance of which he is coming forward with this legislation, was introduced at a time when the people living on the land were so harassed and depressed that it was easy to attract them to the towns. They were anxious to leave the land if there was anywhere else to go.  The Minister, in proclaiming the value of his industrial policy, has been demoralising <Col N="240" /> a great many people in the country.  They have turned from the land and work on the land, and they have gone to the towns.  There, there is a higher standard of living.  There, there is more ease and more pleasure, and these things can be procured with the money which one can earn in the towns.  The country districts, impoverished in many ways, with low purchasing capacity, and with an absence of many of the amenities to be found in the towns, are places where it has become increasingly difficult to keep our young people.  There was no necessity whatever for the legislation the Minister has been enacting to make town life more attractive.  If the Minister were taking the long view about his country's future, what he would be doing would be trying to make town life less attractive than it is.  Unless that be done, there is no use in the Minister, at the opening of new factories in the country, trying to convince the people, as he has tried to do frequently with vigour and insight&mdash; of the value and importance of a progressive agricultural community to the industries of the State.  When you have everything in favour of the people who live and work in the towns, to the disadvantage and detriment of those who are expected to stay in the country, life in rural Ireland will become more difficult and impossible, day after day, and the work of reconstruction will be something that no one in this State will be brave enough to face.</P>
    <P>What are we getting out of this measure?  I am not going to deal now with its effects on workers in industries in the towns or those other people to whom the Bill makes special reference. Take the position as I see it. Across from my home there is a dwelling where an official lives with his wife.  There is a servant who will be styled under this Bill&mdash;it is in a rural district&mdash;a domestic servant, entitled to a fortnight's holidays with pay.  Just adjoining there is a farmstead where the milk is procured for this family and where there are two servants.  One does the work and can be rightly styled a domestic.  The other will help with some of the domestic work in the house <Col N="241" /> and milk a cow or perhaps two or three.  As I see it, under this Bill, one will get 14 days' holidays with pay and the other cannot get any holidays at all.  That is how the provisions of the Bill appear to me.</P>
    <P>Think of the problem which is created by this Bill generally.  You have all these hosts of young people coming from the country and entering service in the city.  They will come from the 15, 20 or 30 acre farm.  There may be one girl out of a family who will go off and marry a small farmer.  You see her after some years, with three, four or five children, struggling against all the difficulties of bringing up these children. The other sister will go off to town, and she will come back each year on her 14 days' holidays with pay, very well dressed, very happy, and obviously enjoying a much higher standard of living than the sister who remained at home in the country.  You have that repeated probably in every townland&mdash; in the west, in the south, and in the north&mdash;in counties like mine, <i>ad infinitum.</i>  When you have conditions like those for the people who live on the land, when you have all these facilities given to the people who come into the towns and cities, while all the inequities are borne by the people who remain at home.  I have no doubt whatever that the Minister for Agriculture in this country and those who want to work with him will have an impossible task.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has begun at the wrong end altogether.  I do not believe that this State has become so highly industrialised, that we have made so much progress industrially, that we should rush so much ahead of our time to procure for the people who are engaged in industry or in some service other than the work of agriculture, all these amenities through the legislature while those who are courageous enough to remain on the land, or who cannot get away have to suffer all the disadvantages.  I am attacking the philosophy behind the Minister's measure.  I think that this Bill is perhaps ahead of our time.  If some action were taken to raise the standard of living of the people who still remain on the land, before the Minister <Col N="242" /> marched so far, we would have a better distribution of the burden, the equities and the inequities, on the part of the Legislature.  I greatly fear that we are reaching the point referred to by the Bishop of Galway the other day when, not without good reason, he said: &ldquo;The real strength and well-being of the country, human beings, are disappearing at such a rapid rate that, if it be not changed, the next century will see the extinction of the Irish people on the land of Ireland.&rdquo;  I greatly fear that by what you are doing here you are rocking the foundations below, without building anything constructive in your towns or cities.  I am convinced that the time has arrived when stock should be taken of the position.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I know, is only one of a series of measures through which the Minister has enunciated his policy.  I greatly fear that the Minister is building on sand.  I do not feel that one can consistently oppose this measure, certainly not on Second Reading, in view of what has gone before, but I should like the Minister to take stock of the position because success, even a very limited success, cannot come to the policy for which the Minister has been standing unless he realises the disabilities and the disadvantages which the propagation of that policy has meant for the people living on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, pretty consistently I think, supported the principle underlying this Bill and, in spite of what my friend Senator Baxter says, I am still in favour of it.  I believe that, as far as the towns are concerned at any rate, there is everything to be said in favour of, and very little to be said against, the principle of an annual holiday.  I do not at all accept the view of Senator Baxter, that a person who at one period goes away for a holiday of seven or 14 days will of necessity do less work than if no such holiday were given.  If the holiday is a <i>bona fide</i> one, I think the reverse should be the case.  While in this country we have not produced any figures in this regard, I know that years ago some leading industrialists in Great Britain did try the idea, <Col N="243" /> which was then new, of a paid holiday for their workers and they found that it was definitely to their advantage. In the case of industrial work, in which the holidays principle has been established by law, there could be a case against it, in certain industries only, on the ground that it adds somewhat to the cost of production and makes it more difficult to compete, certainly as far as exports are concerned. In spite of that argument, which I admit, I am still glad that as far as industrial work is concerned the principle has been put into operation here.</P>
      <P>I should like to see some greater effort than seems to be made in this Bill to ensure that holidays will be genuinely taken.  The industrial worker cannot, if I understand the Bill aright, do industrial work during his holidays. He cannot undertake work for pay during his holidays but, as far as other workers are concerned, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent their doing so.  If a considerable number of workers took advantage of their holidays with pay to go and work for pay at some other kind of work, it would defeat the object of the Bill.  The Minister may say that it is almost impossible to provide against that. Perhaps he is right, but this is one of the cases where I would prefer to see such a law enacted even though it was difficult to enforce it.  I do not propose to speak at length on the Bill because I am in favour of the principle of it.  The Bill is a very complicated measure.  I have had to read some of the clauses three or four times before I could arrive at an idea of what they contained.  The object before the House should be to try to alter the Bill so as to make it as clear as possible, in order that people who will have to carry out the provisions will be able to understand them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I hope there will be a considerable delay between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage.  My own experience, particularly with regard to Bills which affect business people and industrialists, is that the only time they have for reading the Bill and trying to understand it is the interval between the time it <Col N="244" /> officially passes the Dáil and the time it is dealt with in the Seanad.  A reasonable period of time would give such people an opportunity of making suggestions or of writing letters to Senators putting forward these suggestions. I support the principle of the Bill, and I hope that it will be carefully examined, not because I am against anything in it, but because I am not at all sure that some of the sections are as clear as they could be or should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say, at the outset, that I am in agreement with Senator Douglas in supporting the general principle of the Bill.  I do feel that of all Bills that have been brought before this House for a considerable time past this Bill is perfectly justified. It caters for a section of the community which is the most abused section that I know of&mdash;the domestic servant class.  I believe that this Bill will go a long way to stop the worst form of emigration we have had, namely, the emigration of poor girls from the west of Ireland to England, tempted, as they have been, by long hours off and high wages.  I believe that if the Bill succeeds in achieving the objects which the Minister has in mind, it will bring about a new standard of living and a new outlook for domestics in this country.  I think that anything we can do, or which employers generally can do, to raise the level of wages and provide better conditions of employment for these servants, represents good national work.  Senator Baxter painted a very morbid picture in comparing the standard of living of the small farmer's daughter who marries and lives on the land with the standard of living of the girl who gets employment in the city.  I can speak from my own experience of the West of Ireland, from which, in the past, we had very extensive emigration to America.  In no case did I ever see a servant girl, who, after some years in America, had saved enough to enable her to come home, anxious to return to that higher standard of living which she was supposed to have in America.  In no case would she return to that higher standard of living if she could get an opportunity of marrying a small farmer at home.  As a matter of fact, it is the <Col N="245" /> ambition of girls who have worked in that type of employment to get out of it as quickly as possible, even though they have to marry the poorest and the smallest amongst farmers in this country.</P>
      <P>We heard quite a lot from the Senator about comparisons of the standard of living in the country and in the town.  I question very much if the small farmer is in any way envious of the life of the worker in industrial life.  In my opinion, the son of a small farmer, even though his father holds only what is recognised as an uneconomic holding, would much prefer to bide his time until he gets possession of that uneconomic holding, rather than accept a 50/- per week job in a factory. The standard of living may not be as high on such a farm as in the town, but there is something in a small holding that means more to him and, although he may have to endure slavery, he at least has security on that farm that industrial life can never give to him.  Under these conditions, I feel perfectly happy in supporting this Bill and I think the Minister is to be congratulated in having thought out a scheme for a section of the community to which nobody seems to have given a thought heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle or the philosophy behind this Bill just as strongly as Senator Baxter disagrees with what he thinks is its philosophy.  When I say that, I should say that I have much sympathy with the point of view expressed by him because I believe that without a sound agricultural economy, industry is not going to make that progress which we all desire.  I do not think, however, that I have ever listened to such reactionary views as those expressed by Senator Baxter this evening.  All the facts point to the opposite of what he has alleged.  He asks us to work harder and to work longer hours.  That is an amazing request in a country in which we are seeking employment for just one hundred thousand unemployed workers.  Our experience has been that where hours were reduced, the volume of output has not been reduced to any considerable extent.  In the industry with which I am intimately <Col N="246" /> associated, working hours were reduced from 48 to 45 some years ago, and our experience has been that the volume in respect of production has increased, but there has been no appreciable increase in the number of those employed, which would all point to the necessity, in my opinion, of still further reduction in hours of industry.</P>
      <P>I think the day of the old maxim that if man does not work, neither shall he eat, has long since passed, and industry in the agricultural and manufacturing sense must be reorganised on the basis of service to the community and not altogether in the interests of private profit.  We, as workers' representatives, demand that, and when Senator Baxter speaks of the equitable distribution of the burden of labour, we say we would like to share in the profits of the production of labour.  We do not hear overmuch about that when the workers' interests are at stake.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much in the point made by Senator Baxter that because the Minister for Industry and Commerce works 16 or 17 hours a day, the hours of those employed in agricultural industry ought not to be decreased.  The same would apply to most trade union officials who work very long hours.  It does not follow that we want to bring all our people up to the same number of working hours.  I think Senator Baxter takes altogether too gloomy a view of the proposals in the Bill, and I merely wish to say, that so far as we are concerned, we are profoundly satisfied with the Bill the Minister has submitted, and we intend to support it, except for certain amendments that may be put forward on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not confer such wonderful benefits on the domestic worker as some people imagine.  The domestic worker, in practically every case, is getting what it is proposed to give in this Bill.  I have made some inquiries and I find that, even amongst the agricultural community, domestic workers have their half-day a week and every second Sunday off, together with a week or 14 days' holidays.  In many cases they get those <Col N="247" /> holidays with pay.  The only thing is that they do not get the 1/- a week sustenance allowance which is included in the Bill, and which the Bill makes compulsory on an employer.  There is no great compliment due to the Minister for making it compulsory on the employer to give them what they are already giving.  Senator Baxter complained, like all farmers, about the condition in which the farming industry is at present.  He has great sympathy, and justly so, with the farmer's wife who has to work 17 or 18 hours a day, but I do not agree that because she has to work 17 or 18 hours a day, others should be expected to do so.  It is enough to have one slave, without making the domestic worker do the same thing.  The sooner we realise that people will be young only once, and that it is up to us to do the best we can, in given circumstances, to afford people reasonable facilities of enjoying life while they can, the better.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to intervene in this debate because I think Senator Campbell covered generally the views of the Labour Party on the Bill, but, after hearing Senator Counihan, following Senator Baxter, I was wondering which of them represents the farmers.  Senator Counihan treated the Bill in a humane and natural way, while Senator Baxter would drive every industrial worker in the country into abject slavery.</P>

      <P>You can have your rumour, but the solidarity is there and the results are there.  You cannot say the same for the farmers.  With regard to the comments of Senator Douglas, we all endorse his views that it should not be possible for any industrial workers who get holidays under the Bill to do another person out of employment in some other remunerative business.  As a matter of fact, the trade unions penalised very severely any man who on holidays takes remunerative employment.  It is a very serious thing and it does a tremendous injury to the unemployed.  Holidays give an opportunity to a number of unemployed people to earn a week's or a fortnight's wages.  They are helped to that extent, and it is a very serious thing for an industrial worker, who leaves regular employment and pay, to take on employment while on holidays. The trade unions look on it in that light, but it occurs to me that many industrial workers spend very enjoyable holidays in the country in the springtime and the harvest time working on farms.  In that respect, I see very great difficulty in legislating on this matter.  A domestic servant who goes home for a fortnight's holidays has an opportunity of recreation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are paid for their holidays.  I mention this merely to show how difficult it may be to remedy this through legislation.  I hope that Senator Baxter does not represent to any great extent the small farmer in this country, when he would deny any improvement whatever in the conditions of the industrial worker in the city.  He said that we ought to make it less attractive for the country worker to come to the city, and, to that extent, I can agree with him.  The way to do it, however, is to improve his conditions on the land and not to attract him by neon lights and decorations <Col N="249" /> round the City of Dublin which seem to attract him as the moth is attracted to the candle flame.  Worsening the conditions of the people in the towns is not going to make for improvement in industry and agriculture, and it is deplorable to hear a man of Senator Baxter's standing advocate such a policy as that which he advocated here this evening.</P>

I think the principle of paid holidays, whether one agrees with it or not&mdash;and it cuts both ways&mdash;is accepted.

      <P>Living as I do in close proximity to, and perhaps dividing, Senators Baxter and Counihan, I might say a few words to bring them a little more closely together.  I think the view which Senator Counihan enunciated is one which will find a great deal of favour with all farmers who, unfortunately, due to certain effects of the present time, are inclined to look with prejudice, as if their own position was being lowered, on any effort by the Minister to uplift the standard of living in the towns.  It appears to many rural residents and thinkers as being the predominance of the urban mind.  I do not think there is any reason why the House, for one instant, should have any cause to delay in reaching the decision that life in Ireland is not attractive just now.  I think that if Senator Baxter did seem a little strong to the more cultured minds which we rural citizens always admit to be almost the sole property of town residents, it is due, in my opinion, to the fact that sufficient legislation to uplift rural life is not available.  Recently, a measure has been introduced setting up a wages board and if I mistake not, the maximum wage fixed is something in the neighbourhood of 24/-.  If the Minister's inspectors throughout the country examine the position, I think they will find that in many instances <Col N="250" /> labourers are offering their services at perhaps half that figure and expressing their willingness to inform the inspectors that they are getting the full rate.</P>
      <P>I should be the last to depart from the theory of Senator Foran, because I believe that without sufficient pay you cannot expect loyalty in the State. In my conception of a national outlook and loyalty in the State, the man at the foot of the ladder&mdash;the agricultural labourer, the small farmer and, perhaps, the big farmer&mdash;has first to be considered.  Hence it is that I should deprecate a too serious division between Senator Baxter and Senator Counihan.  I do not think it exists.  I think the views expressed by Senator Baxter apply, more or less, to the case of many farmers who find the ground is slipping from them rapidly.  All of us here are agreed that the standard of life in the country should be raised. I hope and trust that the Minister, in the pursuit of his task, will give some thought to this: that there is a rural Ireland behind those in receipt of a wage of 24/- and 25/- a week, and that that is not an attractive wage compared with what may be offered in the towns.  While I support the principle of the Bill, I do not like to see Senator Baxter scarified too much.  I think that between himself and Senator Counihan there is a bridge, and that it is up to the Minister to try to see that his views coincide with theirs, and that something is done for our agricultural life.</P>

      <P>A lot has been said about the philosophy behind this Bill and the philosophy against it, but those whom this Bill is intended to assist most&mdash;domestic servants&mdash;are also philosophers.  I think that their philosophy was best expressed by the story of the little servant girl in New York who, at the end of a 16-hour day, sat down for the first time, and said: &ldquo;It is the will of God to be flat-footed and the fun of the world to be Irish.&rdquo;  I think that, if this Bill can be regarded as a charter of freedom for that class of our people, it is to be welcomed in every possible way.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter, who spoke first upon this measure, made mention of a number of matters of great importance.  He touched lightly on questions of such very great importance that no discussion which we could undertake here this afternoon could adequately dispose of them.  He touched upon these questions, however, in a manner which I think indicated that he had not properly related them to the Bill before the House, because in doing so he said he was attacking what he described as the philosophy or the policy behind this Bill.  I do not think that he understands what the policy, or the philosophy, behind the Bill is.  It certainly is not a philosophy of less work, or a policy of attracting people from the rural areas into the towns, or of dealing more advantageously or more leniently with the problems of the towns than with the problems of the rural areas. There is no such intention behind this Bill, and I think it is necessary that that should be made very clear indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the enactment of statutory provisions requiring that workers should get annual leave with pay, or six public holidays in the year with pay, can, in any circumstances, be interpreted as going to lead the workers to do less work, or as indicating the general idea that less work should be done.  I agree with Senator Baxter, and I agree with other Senators who have spoken here, that in the particular circumstances of this country more work per individual, and more work done per hour, is very necessary indeed.  I do not agree with Senator Baxter that our people work less than the workers in other countries.  I challenge him, and I challenge anyone else, to produce evidence that that is so.  I think that, before a statement of that kind is made, there should be available some evidence to support it.  I submit that all the evidence is to the contrary.  I have read in English newspapers letters written by indignant British citizens, and I have read in the reports of the debates in the British House of Commons speeches made by British <Col N="252" /> Ministers and Members of Parliament, all complaining that English employers in England will employ Irish workers in preference to Englishmen because, they say, they work harder.  Possibly they work harder in England than they do here.  I am quite certain that I can say this without fear of contradiction&mdash; that there is not an English farmer who would not employ an Irish agricultural worker in preference to an English agricultural worker any time.  If that is so, then, obviously there is no justification for this general accusation against our people that they are not inclined to work hard.</P>
    <P>Further, I invite Senators to interview people associated with industrial concerns in this country who have had experience of factory management elsewhere, and ask them if it is their experience that Irish workers in those factories work less hard, less enthusiastically and less willingly than workers in other countries in similar occupations.  I say that there is a whole volume of evidence to the contrary.  I am not saying that we cannot work harder here.  Of course we can, but I will join issue with Senator Campbell any day on the question whether we can solve unemployment by reducing the hours of work. I have never advocated a reduction in the hours of work on the ground that it would solve unemployment.  I do not think it could solve unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is almost capable of mathematical proof.  Mind you, if we could take the whole economic life of this country and organise it in every aspect and in every detail, as the Germans and the Russians have done, we might, and probably could, eliminate unemployment, and even do so in a manner which would appear to involve the performance of a lesser quantity of work per each individual, but it would also be at the price of a much lower standard of living.  Clearly, a reduction of hours of work, accompanied by a reduction of earnings, could be operated to reduce unemployment. That is theoretically possible. If you take 100 men to do a certain job in 100 days, then 200 men can do that same job in 50 days&mdash;that is assuming <Col N="253" /> that there are no external circumstances to upset the calculation; but, taking the simplest case, you can employ 200 men for 50 days or 200 men for 100 half-days to get the same amount of work done, but, in fact, they will not be employed if, by increasing the number, you are going to increase the cost of the job.  If the theory is, and I think it is a fairly good theory, that a reduction of hours of work must not be accompanied by a reduction of earnings, then there is no solution of unemployment along that road.</P>
      <P>We can, and I think we should, reduce the hours of work for other reasons, &mdash;for instance, by trying to secure for our workers some share of the benefits of improved industrial methods and of new inventions.  There is always the question, when some new industrial process or device revolutionises the methods of production in some industry, whether the benefit of that new process is to go entirely to the employer or to the owner of the process in higher profits, or entirely to the public in a lowering of prices, or whether it should be distributed between the employer, the public, and the workers.</P>
      <P>In most cases, I think the workers can get the advantage of that improved process in the form of greater leisure more easily than in the form of higher wages, nor is it wise that they should always get the advantage in higher wages as against more leisure.  But, if we are legislating to ensure that workers shall have certain rights, particularly that they shall have the right to certain public holidays with pay and to annual holidays with pay, it is not for the purpose of encouraging them to do less work when they are working, but, on the contrary, in the expectation and hope that when working they will realise, in so far as they can be made realise, that they are going to be treated not merely as parts of a machine but that their rights as human beings are going to be protected.  If we can get that idea into their heads, then I think we will get a return in better output rather than in lower output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Douglas has pointed out, it has been the experience of a large number of big firms who have investigated the facts that shorter <Col N="254" /> working hours and improved working conditions have led, according to the reports of their experts, to this conclusion: that the output per hour per individual was always increased with improved working conditions.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, a very undesirable trend, when measures of this kind are being considered, to suggest that there is some conflict of interest between the cities and the rural areas.  I do not think there is that conflict.  Mind you, I am not prepared to contest the view that there are anomalies, and that sometimes the intervention of the State in economic matters operates, or appears to operate, unduly to the advantage of the urban area as against the rural area.  I think that the attractiveness of life in the cities, as compared with the rural areas, has been greatly exaggerated even if you take it on the basis of shillings and pence.</P>
    <P>The average wage payable in the city is undoubtedly higher.  It appears to be higher than the average paid in the rural areas, but whether it represents a better standard of living is, I submit, open to question.  Take the case of the average agricultural worker paid the minimum wage fixed by the Agricultural Wages Act, and compare him with the industrial worker living in some tenement dwelling in Dublin who is paid a much higher rate per week when working.  I am certain that the agricultural worker in the rural area would not change places with him if he knew all the circumstances. Undoubtedly, when he reads that some strike is being settled in the city on the basis of an increase of a few pence per hour&mdash;it may bring the city worker's wage up to £3 or £3 10s. a week&mdash;he applies that sum to his own experience in the rural area, and gets, I submit, a very false conception of what, in fact, it actually represents in purchasing power.  On that account, you get a certain sense of grievance and of unfairness which is not altogether closely related to the facts.  The experts in the Department of Agriculture have expressed the view that a wage of 30/- a week in a rural area is equivalent to 50/- a week in a city area. That is a matter upon which the opinions of experts and of in-experts will differ, but that there is a substantial <Col N="255" /> difference between the amount of money required in a city to purchase the same standard of living as can be secured in the country is, I think, unquestionable.</P>
    <P>It is altogether wrong to suggest, and entirely contrary to the facts, that the trend of Government policy has been in favour of the cities, or that the trend of legislation enacted here in recent years has been designed to benefit the urban dweller as against the rural dweller.  I had the same statements made in the Dáil.  I was told there by, presumably, a responsible Deputy that all the social services were designed to benefit the city dwellers as against the rural dwellers. The opposite is the fact.  In many cases the application of these social services to rural areas was undertaken with great difficulty and at an expense altogether out of proportion to the expense involved in their application in city areas in order that disparity or unfairness would not arise.  This legislation has been described as legislation in favour of city dwellers. It is nothing of the kind.  It applies to every person who comes within the category of workers described in it, whether these persons reside and work in cities or rural areas.  We have excluded agricultural workers from the Bill.  That is true, but they were excluded for reasons which, on examination, will, I think, be pretty obvious.  Agriculture is a seasonal occupation and it is difficult to apply the same principles to workers employed in an occupation of that kind as can be applied to those who work in factories&mdash;on railways or other industrial occupations.  In any event, we decided that legislation bearing on the conditions of employment for agricultural workers should be enacted separately from legislation applying to other workers.  That is why the Agricultural Wages Act was adopted as a separate measure, and any extension of the protection given by the State to agricultural workers and their conditions of employment should, I think, be done by an extension of that Act, rather than by the inclusion of agricultural workers in a Bill of this kind which, obviously, is <Col N="256" /> designed to deal with conditions different from those under which they work.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, in due course, the improvement of the conditions of agricultural workers will become of live interest.  I do not know if Senators have noticed that a committee in Northern Ireland have published a report which proposes quite revolutionary changes for that part of Ireland in the law relating to agricultural workers, including paid holidays, overtime payments and other proposals of that kind.  The conditions of agricultural workers in that area may not be as good at present as they are here, but it is clear that the trend everywhere is in the same direction.</P>
    <P>We had a number of references to the fact that young people are leaving the land and coming into the cities.  I should like to question whether they are doing it any more now than they were 10 or 20 years ago.  It is true that the influence of the cinema, the daily newspaper, and other factors of that kind are operating to make city life appear to be more attractive than rural life.  But whether, in fact, people have found it to be so on trial is another question.  Senator MacEllin referred to the fact that a very large number of those who leave the West of Ireland to take up domestic service in America and England come back and are anxious to get back and marry locally and devote the rest of their lives to being the wife of some small farmer in that area.  I am certain that they all do not come back.  Human nature is as variable now as ever it was, and some people will be attracted by one form of life which would be torture to others.  But not all the factors that are tending to make young people leave rural areas and seek a different environment in cities are subject to the control of the Government. Some of these factors are subject to the control of Deputies and Senators and they might exercise their influence more directly in their own constituencies than by making speeches here.</P>
    <P>There is always a movement of population from the rural areas into the cities; there must always be a movement of population from the rural areas <Col N="257" /> into the cities.  At times, due to temporary causes, that movement will be accelerated or the reverse.  But to speak of it as something which began this year or last year or the year before, is sheer nonsense.  It has always been there.  While, undoubtedly we must ensure that there are no causes operating to accelerate it which are within our power to remove, the mere fact of its existence is not necessarily a bad thing if there is sufficient population left to ensure that the land is properly employed.  I do not want to quote statistics.  I invite Senators to study them themselves, and they will find that available statistics do not show any substantial diminution or, in fact, any diminution, in the number employed in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It has been the Government policy to provide by whatever means we can other forms of employment than employment in agriculture.  We have often had considerable difficulty in that matter, and sometimes, by exercising very direct pressure, tried to ensure that the new industrial employment resulting from the Government policy would not be concentrated in the cities, but would be distributed around the smaller towns.  Industrial occupations must necessarily take place in towns, because facilities which are only available in towns are required.  Water supply, sewerage, sometimes gas, electricity and other facilities of that kind cannot be cheaply provided in rural areas.  Therefore, industrial employment must necessarily be concentrated in towns.  But it has been the Government policy, as everybody knows, to ensure that, as far as possible, new industrial employment would be secured in these rural towns.</P>
    <P>In implementing that policy we had to face the fact that it might involve, and possibly does involve, for a time at least, higher prices for the goods produced than would have been possible if purely economic considerations applied.  I do not think that purely economic considerations should apply, but that social considerations should also be taken into account.  In due course the initial difficulties which industrial concerns have to contend with may be removed.  In some cases, perhaps, they will never be <Col N="258" /> removed, because they are inherent in the site selected.  But I think it is well worth while paying a slightly increased price for some industrial products if, in return, we get a distribution of employment throughout the whole country, rather than a concentration of population in one or two centres.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to this Bill and similar measures as indicating that we were rushing ahead of our time.  On the other hand, Senator Counihan said that we were, in fact, securing for the workers covered by the Bill no advantages which they had not already got.  I do not think either statement is altogether correct.  I think the purpose of legislation of this kind should be to establish as the general rule what is, in fact, the general practice; that we should not attempt to go further than level up from the bottom; to make uniform and legally enforceable everywhere the conditions which public opinion and good employers have generally succeeded in making effective in various occupations. I do not think we should try to go further than that&mdash;that our legislation should be to fix minimum conditions and not to try to force the pace.</P>
    <P>In so far as Senator Baxter appeared to object to the State doing that work at all, I think the answer must be that it is much better to have these improved conditions secured by legislative enactments than by agitation and upheaval.  I think that in due course we will have the idea very generally accepted that there is a duty on the State to ensure that abuses of one kind or another are not associated with any form of employment, and that the job of removing these abuses is one for the Government rather than for a combination of workers or some public agitation to deal with.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas referred to the possibility of some sections of the Bill not being sufficiently clear.  I would much prefer if we could have framed this measure in simpler language, because I see difficulties in the future arising from the technical phraseology used in certain sections.  But these difficulties would be very small in relation to the difficulties which might arise, and which, in fact, have arisen under earlier Bills, due to the inadequacy <Col N="259" /> of the provisions to cope with all circumstances.  We have had difficulties already under the 1936 Act, due entirely to the phraseology used, and the phraseology used was dictated by a desire for simplicity.  We will get simplicity if we can, but I think we must get clarity and absence of ambiguity at all costs, particularly in a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here, in another regard, to conditions in agricultural areas.  Senator McGee referred to the fact that it was not unusual for labourers to offer their services at lower than the minimum wage fixed by the Agricultural Wages Act and pretend to inspectors that they were in fact getting such wage.  That may be so.  I am not prepared to contend that that has never happened.  The last occasion upon which I discussed in this House the question of agricultural employment was some 18 months ago or so, and the burden of the complaint on that occasion from Senator Counihan and a number of other Senators who are still here, was that, owing to the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act farmers could not get workers at all.  Senator Counihan and other Senators will remember the complaint being voiced not merely here but in the Dáil&mdash; it was voiced also outside these Houses&mdash;that, due to the extension of the unemployment assistance scheme to rural areas, there were, in fact, considerable difficulties being experienced by farmers at seasons of the year, or at all times, in getting workers and I know from investigation of a number of complaints that that was so on occasion.</P>
    <P>Different circumstances apply in different parts of the country and the experience of one part of the country should not be deemed to be the experience of the whole, but if we are going to improve conditions in rural areas, to make it possible for agriculturists to get a better profit from agriculture and, consequently, give better conditions of employment to agricultural workers and make life in rural areas more attractive, there is nothing in this Bill to stop it.  That is the point I want to get into the minds of Senators <Col N="260" />&mdash;there is nothing in this Bill in conflict with that idea.  Everybody has the same motive and the same idea in mind in relation to rural areas.  There is nothing whatever in this Bill, or any similar measure enacted, to benefit industrial workers or non-agricultural workers, that will prevent the adoption of any proposal that may be considered practicable to improve conditions in rural areas.  I should like to emphasise again that there is no necessary conflict between a sound policy for the improvement of urban conditions or the promotion of urban industries and an equally sound policy for the improvement of conditions in rural areas or the promotion of the prosperity of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that we are in fact doing so.  This idea that we are rushing ahead with legislation to benefit urban dwellers and city workers and postpone action in relation to agriculture or rural areas is wrong.  I say that if any examination is made of the various measures of one kind or another involving action by the Dáil or Seanad in the past five or six years it will be found that by far the greater number had very direct relation to rural and agricultural conditions.  It may be that factors were greater than our strength, that the factors which were operating to depress conditions in agriculture were beyond our power to remove.  I would not contend that myself, but it has to be recognised that the factors that have depressed agriculture are very powerful indeed, and that it is going to take, not merely a very great effort, but also a considerable period of time before they can be fully dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal to set up a commission of inquiry into agriculture, a commission with wide terms of reference and which will be representative of various interests, to deal with the problem of agriculture as a whole, and in so far as that separate examination, which will have no direct relation to the day-to-day problems, can be made by a body of this kind much more thoroughly than by a Minister of State <Col N="261" /> or officers of a State Department, if that inquiry produces proposals which, on the face of them, are worth trying, there will be no hesitation in trying them, because I think everybody recognises&mdash;I certainly never in my life have heard anybody contend to the contrary &mdash;that the whole prosperity of this country depends upon the prosperity of agriculture and that everything else, industries, urban conditions of employment and all will go unless the problem of agriculture can be safeguarded. That fact being so clearly recognised, Senator Baxter, Senator McGee and others need have no fear that anything will be done which would be in conflict with the realisation of that aim.</P>

      <P>I should like to make some observations on that suggestion. I should like to press very strongly that the Second Reading of these two Bills be taken this week so as to allow an interval for reflection before consideration of the further stages.  We could then take all the remaining stages next week.  It seems to me to be a mistake to huddle all the stages of these important Bills&mdash; important in principle&mdash;into one week, as we should be doing if we decline to sit on Friday.  Personally, I do not see why we should not sit to-morrow.  I do not know on what principle we are imposing a severer standard on the Legislature in regard to doing work on the afternoon of Church holidays than we impose on any other class of the community.  Assuming that that is the established practice, that Senators do not like to break through it and that we are not to sit to-morrow, I do urge that the least we might do is to sit on Friday on the understanding that we should dispose of the Second Reading of these two Bills on that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
      <P>I want to raise this matter with the Minister because it seems to me that this sub-section is not in a desirable form.  I feel that it is a very difficult position if the owner of premises cannot, as we say in the country, stir hand or foot without the leave of the Minister.  I might have registered premises and might be prepared to spend money on them to enlarge and improve them, and yet I cannot do that without the permission of the Minister.  I feel that the Minister would be amply safeguarding his powers, without that sub-section at all.  It is really going beyond all reasonable limits to put the proprietor of premises in the position that he can do nothing to alter his premises without the permission or the previous approval of the Minister.  If the owner of premises wants to alter them, I would prefer that he should be allowed to do so.  There are certain disabilities provided if the premises are not satisfactory after the alteration.  I imagine that no owner of a premises who has had his premises already registered or no retailer whose premises are registered will, in fact, make any alteration without discussion with the inspector.</P>
      <P>I presume that would be so, but I think it is going to extremes to say that he cannot alter his premises without committing an offence.  The whole structure of the section, in my view, is wrong.  It is enunciating a principle that is undesirable and is an extraordinary restriction.  I realise that the Minister and his officials will act with discretion, but if you have an unpleasant or disagreeable inspector you may have a prosecution.  This is a matter on which, I suggest, the House should express the opinion that the principle is undesirable.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  I think it is an extraordinary thing that, if a man carries out an alteration which he thinks might be useful, he makes himself liable to a penalty of £10.  I think the Minister has sufficient powers under the Bill to prevent any injury being done to the premises.  The section, in my view, is not necessary and I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.  Possibly traders might leave premises, which they might easily improve, in their existing condition rather than have to put in applications and specifications.  It might mean a simple matter to improve the premises and yet they might be afraid to start on the work unless they had got permission from an inspector.  I think the Minister should consider the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

It gets people's backs up, and does not win the co-operation of the community.  I think the Minister would do well to have regard to the psychological effect of all these regulations.  They only defeat their own purpose in the long run. Surely the power to cancel registration should be sufficient?  It is unthinkable that a man is going to alter his premises to his own detriment.  You cannot possibly allow too much liberty in matters of this kind in this over-regulated world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, of course, applies to wholesalers in particular and, under the new legislation, it would apply to dealers.  It has applied to wholesalers ever since 1930.  Section 14 of the Act of 1930, sub-section (1), is practically framed in the same words.  The wholesalers have been carrying on under this system since 1930 and they have not complained.  As a matter of fact, I met the wholesalers and other interests in regard to this Bill, after it was printed and before it was brought before the Dáil, and the wholesalers approved of this section because they felt it was for their own protection.  They did not want to spend a certain amount of money in making alterations and then be told that the alterations were all wrong, that they would have to undo them and do something else instead. They felt that it was a protection to them to know that they had the approval of the Minister before they proceeded with the alterations so that they would not be spending money foolishly from their point of view.  I think that Senator the McGillycuddy is right in his view that if sub-section (1) is wrong, sub-section (2) is also wrong.  If sub-sections (1) and (2) go, sub-section (3) should go also so that the whole section would then be removed. I do not think that the view expressed by Senator Douglas is correct, that if a wholesaler is prepared to pay £10 he can carry out the alterations without approval.  In addition, he might also lose his registration.  If he made alterations that would render his premises unsuitable as registered premises, he might possibly lose his registration so that the penalty is very much greater than £10.  I should like to see this sub-section retained because, in the first place, the wholesalers themselves have approved of it.  Secondly, it has been in operation since 1930. <Col N="269" /> They have had experience of it ever since and, in the light of that experience, they have approved of it. Thirdly, I think it is fairly obvious that even for their protection it should be there because any wholesaler who has sense will consult an inspector before he makes alterations so as to make sure that the alterations will be approved.  It refers to premises that are altogether concerned with eggs, that is, wholesalers' premises.  It does not refer to retailers.  It might be unfair to apply it to retailers because they might have other business such as groceries, etc.  It refers only to a room or premises entirely devoted to the business of grading and packing eggs.</P>

      <P>If what the Minister says is correct, that he is liable to lose registration, surely that is a sufficient penalty?  If you leave sub-section (2) by itself, it gives the proprietor an opportunity of sending a request to the Minister, and if he gets approval obviously he cannot lose registration.  That would be quite sufficient.  If you provide machinery by which he can protect himself, I do not think that sub-sections (2) and (3) should go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible for a carrier, in taking a package of eggs to the railway station, to be stopped anywhere, and if the inspector orders that he is not to take the package any further, the inspector has to notify the owner of the package.  I want the owner notified immediately.  A packet of eggs on a summer day might, in the judgment of the inspector, be unsuitable for export.  It may not, however, be absolutely worthless, but if it is left for a day or two, pending the time when it is convenient for the inspector to notify the owner, it would be absolutely worthless.  I think there is an obligation on him to inform the owner immediately that he has stopped the packet.  I think it obvious that the <Col N="272" /> owner ought not to be in the position of having his produce stopped <i>en route.</i>  He has issued his consignment note, with the quantity for export; one packet is taken away, and he may get notification a day or two afterwards. Only then does he become aware that the full consignment has not gone.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Baxter's amendment.  I would suggest that the words &ldquo;with all practicable speed&rdquo; be inserted.  It would not do to leave the matter to hang over for a day or two days.  As it is, there is nothing definite, and he may notify the owner in a week or a month. There should be some qualifying adjective or adverb, so as to put the onus on him to notify the owner with all practicable speed.  The word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; might mean possibly <i>instanter</i>, but at any rate, some obligation should be placed on the inspector to notify the consignor within a reasonable time, and I think 24 hours should be the limit.</P>

      <P>I do not know exactly what the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; would imply in law.  I expect it implies instantaneous action on the part of the inspector.  It might not, as Senator O'Donovan has evidently realised, allow practical difficulties, in the way of giving notice, to be got over.  In practice, of course, the inspector would give notice, to the consignor as soon as he possibly could.  In the Agricultural Produce Acts of 1930, the words were something like this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever an inspector gives a direction under this section to a carrier prohibiting the export of any packet of eggs, it shall be the duty of such inspector, where such carrier is not the owner, to notify the consignor of the giving of such direction&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the practice which has been carried on for the last eight years and the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; was not mentioned. The practice was that as soon as an inspector had served written notice on the carrier company, he sent word to the consignor of the action he had taken.  Offences of the kind are not common, but I do not think an inspector has been accused of being <Col N="273" /> dilatory in giving the required notification to the consignor.  As Senator Baxter says, if the eggs are not fit for further transit, they are not going to be improved by being kept for another day, but, in practice, the consignor has been notified with the greatest possible speed.  I dislike very much putting in the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; because I do not know what its legal implication may be.</P>

      <P>All the Minister's inspectors are not beloved by all the people to whom they go, and, when this becomes law, it will have to be administered.  The owner of a packet of eggs, I believe, will get the full rigour of the law.  I know that some of these inspectors are, as I say, not beloved by the people and I have had quite a number of complaints over the years.  If a particular inspector does not care a great deal about a particular exporter, he is quite within his rights in notifying him two or three days after.  He can argue that that was the earliest possible date.  I think that is not fair.  It ought not to be left to the whim of an inspector, or to his convenience either, in the sense that he might go when it is convenient.  The majority of these people, of course, are considerate and understanding and they do their work satisfactorily. I realise the difficulty with regard to the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; and I was confronted with it when I was trying to get a form of words.  If the Minister can get something better than the words I suggest, I shall be quite satisfied but I would not be satisfied to let the section pass as it stands.</P>

      <P>That is a reflection on the inspectors, and I do not agree with him.  They have done their duty very well up to the present.  Some remarks were made here recently about Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, and, for the last two years, the inspectors have found cases and lorry loads of dirty and stale eggs being shipped and sold here.  I think the inspectors have done their duty very well and they are quite competent to do it.</P>

      <P>On general principles I feel that I should agree with Senator Baxter that everything possible should be done to expedite the transport of these eggs.  Except in isolated cases, or where there are different people to deal with, there are not such hold ups. I am aware that in certain ports in this country there is a well-known principle worked on by which some exporters who put through a small number of packets for examination by the inspector, the remainder being in the local depot beside the port.  These are rushed through on the same consignment, when the few cases have been passed, and, in that way, they have succeeded in putting stale, and sometimes dirty, eggs through.  It is very difficult to deal with the case of the rushing of a consignment, and to deal with the individual who has most of his consignment right, and who puts the remainder, which is doubtful and lying in the local depot, through with the consignment already passed.  Generally speaking, the trade as a whole, the men who are prepared to abide by the law and anxious to raise the standard of eggs on the market abroad, are getting facilities from the inspectors.</P>

The phrase in that case is, &ldquo;with all practicable speed.&rdquo;  I disagree with the word &ldquo;immediately,&rdquo; but, at the same time, I agree that the inspector is safeguarded by some indication that he shall not leave it over for two days, but should make the notification, if not immediately, with all practicable speed.

      <P>In sub-section (1), after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, in line 18, to insert the following words: &ldquo;if and when he is satisfied that it is essential to do so in order to facilitate the inspection of consignments of eggs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this is to make it clear that the section does not give the Minister an absolute discretion to choose any carrier he wishes.  I take it that the idea of the section is to facilitate the examination of eggs. Representations have been made to me that the section gives the Minister power to differentiate between one carrier and another, quite apart from any other object.</P>

      <P>Although it ought not be necessary, it does seem desirable to limit the discretion of Ministers in the exercise of powers of this kind.  As the thing stands, it <Col N="277" /> would be quite possible for the Minister, without reason given, to direct that eggs which would naturally and more economically be exported through that part of geographical Ireland which we may call <i>Hibernia Irridenta</i>, should instead of going through <i>Hibernia Irridenta</i>, be diverted to leave by another route, say, Dublin.  I think that the exercise of such powers is vexatious and in the highest sense impolitic.  I mention the point because I have studied the exercise of similar powers in connection with the bounties.  In that case the powers were exercised in order to induce the goods to go by one route rather than by another, and in order to prevent them from going out by Northern Ireland ports.  I distinctly remember noticing that the bounties given on the export of pigs and pig products were much less when the pigs were exported through a Northern Ireland port than when through a Saorstát port.  In case the Minister should yield to a similar temptation in this matter, I think we should do everything possible to limit the exercise of his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to what Senator Johnston has said with regard to the bounties being used to discriminate against traffic through Northern Ireland ports, there was a reason for that other than the one which may have occurred to the Senator.  We had a particular difficulty with regard to live pigs.  We knew that any live pig going through our ports here direct to England was a mature or a fat pig, whereas the majority of pigs going across the Border were small pigs.  We had to give a different bounty on small pigs to that which we gave on fat pigs. There was nothing political in what the Senator has referred to.  It was entirely economic and did not, I think, hit Northern Ireland in any way.  The number of fat pigs which went through the Northern Ireland ports was negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real object of this section is to stop the practice referred to by Senator McEllin&mdash;that is, of exporters of eggs presenting large consignments a short time before a boat or a train is due to leave.  It is to deal with exporters who put it up to inspectors, more or less, to examine large consignments <Col N="278" /> of eggs in half an hour or so, or otherwise to leave the eggs lying there for the next boat at a port where there may be only weekly sailings. Such exporters put inspectors in the position of saying: &ldquo;Well, I will either have to reject the whole lot&rdquo; which would be a very severe thing to do, or &ldquo;Well, I will have to let the consignment through by examining perhaps one case out of 300 or 400 cases.&rdquo;  The section is intended to deal with that kind of thing.  In future the intention is to serve notice on exporters notifying them they must export their eggs <i>via</i> a certain route&mdash;through a port at which we know we will have daily sailings, so that if it should happen that a consignment comes late on a particular evening it will be no great hardship to keep it over until the following evening and have it properly examined.</P>
    <P>In practice we do not think that this section will ever have to be resorted to.  If exporters know that we have this power, then I think once will be enough to use it.  If they offend once they are not likely to do so again.  As a matter of fact, I think that we will get their co-operation in presenting the eggs at a reasonable time at the ports so that they can be properly examined.  I may mention that there is a similar power in the Dairies Produce Act of 1924.  That Act has now been 14 years in operation, and the power in it has never been used, principally, I believe, because exporters know that the power is there for dealing with butter.  Therefore, they have never been unreasonable in presenting large consignments of butter immediately before a boat was due to sail. The section in this Bill has the same end in view.  With regard to the amendment put in by Senator Douglas, I do not think there is very much objection to it.  All that I can say is that sections of this kind are obviously put in to deal with the most tricky and clever people in the trade.  If there is a loophole at all in a section they are so clever and able that they are sure to find it out.  Sections such as this are drafted in a very simple, but in a very drastic, way if you like.</P>

      <P>There are two things that a person must get before he can become a wholesaler.  He must get registration and a licence.  The registration is, of course, the more important thing.  He must have properly constructed premises.  If he loses his registration, it is a very serious thing for him.  The licence is not the major thing, although, of course, the person must have a licence to operate in the registered premises.  The Minister has a discretion to grant a licence.  Where the premises are suitable, unless there is something specifically wrong about an applicant&mdash;such, for instance, as the contravention of regulations&mdash;the Minister will grant a licence.  As the Minister has a discretion to grant a licence he should naturally have a discretion with regard to the withdrawal of a licence.  In practice, the Minister does notify a licensee who has committed an offence.  I think it would be <Col N="281" /> an unheard of thing to write to a person saying that you were withdrawing his licence without giving a reason for it.  A reason is always given.

      <P>In sub-section (1), immediately after paragraph (a), to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  Prohibiting any vehicle ordinarily used for the transport (otherwise than by a producer) of eggs intended for sale to be used at the same time for the transport of any articles other than the ordinary fittings and equipment of such vehicles and packages, appliances and apparatus ordinarily used in connection with the sale or purchase of eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with applying to lorries the general principle that applies to stores in a town.  For the purpose of having eggs exported in proper condition it is necessary in the stores in towns to provide against wet, damp, dirt, adverse weather conditions, and contamination of the eggs.  My amendment is to bring that principle <Col N="282" /> a step further and to provide that an exporter bringing eggs in a lorry shall not carry with them such commodities as manures, bacon, paraffin oil, onions, and others which are certainly going to affect materially the eggs which are in the lorry.  I hold that eggs are much more liable under existing conditions to suffer from adverse weather conditions and contamination in such a lorry than they are in any store in a town.  If the making of all these regulations is necessary in connection with a house in a town, they are more necessary in connection with lorries. My amendment proposes that a lorry used for the collection of eggs by an exporter should be confined solely to carrying the necessary materials for the handling of these eggs, such as straw, boxes, or other articles necessary for carrying out the work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is absolutely essential that we should go the whole way in providing properly for the collection of eggs from a producer.  In many cases the contamination of the eggs occurs, not in the store, but on the roadside, because the exporter has not the necessary appliances with him. Owing to the groceries and other things which he is carrying, he has not room for the machines for the grading and testing of eggs.  When on the roadside, he may think that he is buying fresh eggs, and find when he comes to examine them in the store that he has a large number of stale eggs.  That man is not going to suffer the loss of his eggs.  By some means or method he is going to circumvent the Act and get these eggs away.  In these circumstances, I think the House would be well advised to adopt the principle of this amendment.  The Minister is not compelled, according to the Bill, to enforce this particular section immediately.  He is taking power to make use of it, if he so desires, at a later date.  The section is such that the Minister may, by order, make regulations, so that he is not necessarily compelled to enforce it.  He may enforce it later.  I think that he should take such powers as these and use them at his discretion as time goes on.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator has done a disservice to the community <Col N="283" /> generally by putting such an idea into the Minister's head.  I am not in the egg trade, but it seems to me intolerable that a wholesaler, who presumably does other classes of business as well, should lock up all his capital in a lorry which can be used for one purpose only.  I do not see why a lorry should not be allowed to deliver feeding stuffs, or whatever it may be, and bring back eggs.  It seems like regulation gone completely mad.  The Senator, from the way he talks, seems to regard this thing as being so simple that it will impose no burden on the trade.  I should very much like to know if the trade approves of this.  It certainly seems to put an unfair advantage into the hands of the big man whose trade as a wholesaler is sufficiently big that he is able to be a wholesaler for eggs and eggs only.  The country is not constructed that way and business is not done on these terms.  There must be a large number of people in general trade.  It seems intolerable that the amount of capital locked up in transport should be confined merely to one class of trade.  I hope that the Minister will not take the power and, even if he does take it, that he will not use it in the way suggested.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment, in proposing to impose this restriction, is going much further than the section at any rate.  The section deals with adverse weather conditions, damp, contamination and so on.  I do not know very much about the technical side of this matter, but I imagine that, if it were proved, for instance, to the technical side of my Department that the carrying of paraffin oil, or at any rate a leaking vessel of paraffin oil, was dangerous to eggs, then a regulation would be made prohibiting a person from <Col N="284" /> carrying paraffin oil, or anything else which might be dangerous in that way, at the same time as eggs.  But I do not think I should like to go as far as is suggested by the amendment and to insist that nothing else should be carried in the lorry or the conveyor at the same time as eggs.</P>
      <P>There is a class of trade done, especially in the West of Ireland, by itinerant collectors.  I understand that they bring out groceries, etc., which they sell to the people from whom they procure the eggs, and, of course, they will have eggs, groceries, and provisions in the lorry at the same time.  I do not know whether that is desirable or undesirable.  I am only concerned with whether it injures the eggs or not. I am not concerned with the economic side of it in connection with an Eggs Bill.  If we are going to deal with the economic facts of that type of business, I think it should be dealt with in a separate Bill and not in a Bill like this. I should, therefore, like to ease the fears of Senator Sir John Keane by saying that, if the Senator does insist on the passing of the amendment, I will not ever adopt it under the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>

That is the position of the egg trade and it is not a desirable position.  I am satisfied that it would be in a far healthier position if the amendment were adopted and, as time goes on, I <Col N="285" /> believe that the Minister and his Department will see that.</P>
      <P>There are powers being taken by the Minister not alone for the marking of eggs, the general control of the trade, and tightening it up by regulations, but, in actual fact, they can actually go back to the producer, under Section 52, which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To place in or on every such container the note, docket, or mark specified in that behalf by such regulations indicating the producer from whom and the date on which the eggs in such container were acquired, and such other particulars in relation to such eggs as may be so specified.</P>
      <P>Therefore, under these conditions, the producer might be held liable in the long run for eggs which he might have sold in good condition and which afterwards, through adverse weather conditions or being thrown into the lorry with all sorts of produce, may become contaminated between the time when they leave the producer and the time they are exported.  The producer can be held liable for something for which he is not responsible.  Senator Sir John Keane threw up his hands and talked about regulations and the big man, etc.  It is easy to talk in that way.  The fact of the matter is that it is a difficult job to handle.  It is difficult to give satisfaction to the men on the other side of the channel and the only way it can be done is to isolate the eggs.  It will have to come sooner or later.  In my opinion, it would satisfy both the producers and exporters generally if people were confined to the egg trade and it would make a success of it.</P>

      <P>I rise to point out that the amendment seems to me to be out of order.  The Minister has suggested the same thing.  This Bill deals with the purchase and transport of eggs, etc.  Senator McEllin seemed to me not to refer to the implications in his amendment.  I think that the amendment is getting after what is known as the &ldquo;shop on wheels,&rdquo; and he has not referred to that.  I do not think it would be popular if he did.  He would not like to come up against the idea <Col N="286" /> of the greatest good to the greatest number, and certainly the &ldquo;shop on wheels&rdquo; is one of the greatest advantages that the small farmers have at their disposal.  I submit that it is out of order and, on the other hand, I submit that, on its merits, it ought not to be adopted.  The people of the country have been accustomed to this facility for 40 years.  Formerly, a donkey and cart came along and, latterly, small lorries are used and they are a very great benefit.  Men from the country districts know what an advantage this is to a housewife who may be resident five or six miles from a market town. She can dispose of her eggs at her door.  I do not believe that any objection has been made to the condition of the lorries used for this purpose.  They also carry groceries to the people.  I oppose the amendment because it would have the effect of taking away this benefit from the majority of the people.</P>

      <P>If it is not in order, I shall abide by your ruling.  I think the amendment would place great restrictions on the user of eggs. Senator Conlon has said that these eggs are used for various purposes. We have in the city a regulation by which if a farmer's cart brings cabbage into the city in the morning and brings home a load of manure in the evening, the cart must be washed before bringing in vegetables the following morning. There is a certain system of barter in connection with the collection of eggs.  A collector may get three dozen of eggs at 1/2 a dozen.  That <Col N="287" /> means 3/6.  The person from whom he is collecting the eggs obtains from him a pound of tea at 2/6 and a quarter stone of sugar at 1/-.  That can be regarded as a system of barter.  If Senator McEllin's amendment would prevent that person from taking that pound of tea and quarter pound of sugar to the person from whom he is buying the eggs, it would be very unwise to adopt it.  I am sorry I was not here during the debate because I might have been more enlightened on the subject.</P>

      <P>Senator McEllin has questioned whether it would not be better, as applied to eggs alone, to have only one organisation dealing with them.  I agree with him if you look at the matter in terms of eggs, apart from the restriction of liberty which would be involved.  It might be much better for our produce if we had the totalitarian methods of dictator States.  But surely we are not thinking in those terms.  If we have totalitarian methods applied to eggs, we may have them applied to other things as well.  We have to work within the scope afforded by a democratic country and it is not fair to attack people merely because they wish to preserve the few remaining rights we have as regards freedom of trade and commercial liberty.</P>

The best form of organisation is co-operative organisation. It is also the best form of democracy because the people concerned have confidence in one another.  It was such an organisation which I had in mind when I suggested that our eggs should be handled by one body. Senator Healy spoke about the travelling shop.  If the cap fits, they can wear it.  What I had in mind was some organisation to handle the egg question as a form of produce efficiently and well and to follow up the regulations already applied to houses in the town which are confined to the sorting of eggs.  I want to follow <Col N="288" /> that up to its logical conclusion and apply it to the lorries handling the eggs.  I think we should be benefiting the producer if we had an organisation such as Senator O'Dwyer suggested the last day.  The co-operative movement could do the work.</P>

      <P>This section is going to make a radical change in the purchasing of eggs in future.  I should like to know what notice the Minister proposes to give producers and the trade generally before this section is made applicable.  He will remember that, when the Pigs and Bacon Bill was going through, we tried to warn him of the confusion which would arise from certain sections in that measure which altered the method of trading to which the people had been accustomed. If the Minister is going to apply this section in a very short time, the people who have not been accustomed to produce eggs for sale by weight will have such unpleasant experiences and disappointments that it is very questionable whether we shall not have a drop in production rather than an increase. Those of us who trouble about these things know that a large proportion of our eggs would be classified as <Col N="289" />&ldquo;small.&rdquo;  They have been bought by the dozen in the past, but if they are to be bought by weight in the future, the housewife who takes in her basket of eggs to the town or to the travelling shop will, if the scales go against her, hesitate to continue bringing in her basket of eggs.  This section should be made applicable only after fairly long notice both to the producers and to the trade.  If we are to sell by weight, we shall have to produce a larger egg than we have been accustomed to produce. That cannot be done in a day. It is necessary to breed the poultry so as to get the larger egg.  If the experience of the operation of this Bill is to raise the price in the case of a small proportion of our egg production and to lower the price in the case of the greater proportion of our egg production, the consequences, from the point of view of total production, will be very disappointing.  I should like to have some information from the Minister as to when he proposes to make this section operative.  I think it would be time enough to do so in 12 months.</P>

      <P>It is not the intention to make a regulation for sale by weight immediately.  In fact, it could not be done immediately.  When this Bill passes, it cannot come into operation for a couple of months because various things have to be done before it can be brought into operation.  It is not intended that the sale of eggs by weight should be made obligatory for some time after that.  It may be 12 months before that is done.  Under Section 4, any order like that must be laid on the Table of both Houses and can be debated, if thought desirable.  I could not give the Senator at this stage a definite indication of the time at which this section will be brought into operation, but it will not be brought into operation immediately.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the dealer must pack the eggs in a standard box with a docket of identification, showing the producer from whom they came.  This is dealt with in Section 52 (1) (b) (ii) (quoted).  I should like to know from the Minister how he expects to have that particular provision carried out.  The dealer is going about purchasing eggs.  He probably purchases a dozen eggs from one person and a score of eggs from another, and if he must have a docket for each small portion of eggs like that, I do not know how it is intended to have the regulations carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed that matter with some collectors and they explained to me how they could do it.  They did not raise any difficulty whatever about it.  They explained that in these boxes the eggs are placed in a row.  It is not necessary to have a separate container.  They proceed with their collection in rows, and after the last egg from each producer a docket is put in containing his name.  That container goes on to the wholesaler and the wholesaler when he is testing these eggs knows the persons from whom the eggs come in the first instance.  I should like to assure the Senator that the collectors I met did not raise any difficulty whatever about this section.</P>

      <P>I begin to wonder immediately whether they were my eggs or my neighbour's eggs.  These eggs were mixed up when they went into the packing house.  I am afraid if the eggs are going to be handled as the Minister says, in rows without their being packed in a separate container or a separate portion of the box, this system will be similar to the grading of the pigs in the factory <Col N="291" /> under which it was impossible to get the farmer to believe that the grade for which he was paid was the proper grade of his pig.  Unless the eggs are packed in containers so that there can be no question of their becoming mixed in the rehandling in the dealer's premises, whenever a prosecution has to be taken, there will be grave doubts in the mind of the people about the mixing of the eggs.  I think it will be necessary to have more stringent conditions with regard to packing than the Minister seems to anticipate.</P>

In fact, I do not think there will be any prosecution against producers in the way Senator Baxter has suggested, at least for a long time, until we have given several warnings.  The intention is that the wholesaler will notify the dealer that he had so many bad eggs when tested and that they came from such-and-such a producer.  If the dealer finds from these reports that he is continually getting bad eggs from a producer&mdash;he will not know until after the eggs have been tested&mdash; he will naturally say: &ldquo;I will not take any more eggs from him until he mends his way.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to see the Minister for Local Government and Public Health here, because his appearance indicates that this Bill is being opposed.  The history of the Act which we are trying to amend is rather peculiar.  When it was passed through the House in 1936, there was a chorus of approval from all sides, including the Government side.  On the one contentious point, the matter of the reduction of rents, opinions were greatly divided.  I think the main opposition to this Bill will be directed against that point, the reduction <Col N="293" /> by 50 per cent. of the original rents.  I am informed that the debate in the other House showed that there was a big volume of opinion in favour of this reduction.  The Opposition were all right.  The Government would be all right, too, were it not for the unfortunate whip which was applied by the Minister.  Some members of the Dáil, supporters of the Government, who had spoken in favour of the 50 per cent. reduction, responding to that great lash, voted against their own convictions in the matter. We shall probably be told that if this 50 per cent. reduction is given, it will stop further building of cottages and that many labourers who want cottages badly will have no chance of getting them.  We are definitely challenging these statements.  This is neither the time nor the place to substantiate the challenge by getting actuarial advice on the matter if necessary, but I can say definitely that this change can be brought about without imposing one penny burden upon the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely unlikely that the present Act will be availed of by the tenants.  There is no enthusiasm about it, as the Minister admits himself.  He admits further that that enthusiasm does not exist because the tenants, the possible purchasers, were not aware of the terms of the Bill when they first exhibited enthusiasm.  As a matter of fact, amongst large masses of the tenants, the enthusiasm which once existed seems to have vanished completely, as a result of the revisions made in the Act which the tenants did not regard as good revisions.  We shall be told also, possibly, that the findings of the Cottier Tenants Commission, set up in 1932, are embodied in the Act and that it was signed by eight members who were on the commission.  That is true but we have not been told that so insistent were four members on this question of the reduction of 50 per cent., that although the matter was not within the terms of reference of the commission, the chairman of the commission permitted these four members to make a minority report, which I think was embodied in the final report some months afterwards.  You have the fact that it was a case of <Col N="294" /> 50-50 on that commission&mdash;50 per cent. in favour of the 50 per cent. reduction and 50 per cent. the other way.  I think that is a very important matter and I would stress it in this way.  In the terms of reference presented to that commission of inquiry, the question of the 50 per cent. reduction was never referred to.  It did not come within the comprehension of the terms of reference of the inquiry.  We say that if it had, the findings of the commission would have been different. Leave to introduce this Bill was opposed in the Lower House so that no opportunity was given to the advocates of the reduction to 50 per cent. to make the case which we maintain they can make.</P>

I agree with Senator Douglas that, waiving for the moment whether the Minister has or has not a constitutional right, it is a very undesirable thing that the First Stage of a Bill should be defeated here by anybody.  My personal view is that when any responsible people in the House put forward a legislative proposal, I would not object to the Bill being printed and circulated.  I would go further and say that on the Second Stage, unless something entirely abhorrent to myself were in the Bill, I should be inclined not to vote against it, but wait to see what proposal would emerge when the Seanad had considered the Bill in Committee.  I admit that the Minister on Second Stage might come in, if he pleased, and put his point of view, but while that is my point of view generally about Bills, in the case of this particular Bill there is a complication.  It is that, in respect of this Bill, apart from our discussion of its merits, a motion to introduce it was before the other House, and was rejected.  In effect, what we are being asked to do now is to give leave to introduce this Bill, and to put it through its various stages; in other words, to make up an article and send it down to people who have already said they do not want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a very bad procedure, and I should like to suggest to the people who are sponsoring this Bill and any other people who have friends in the other House that it is a very bad procedure for this House that motions or Bills defeated in the other House should be introduced in the same form in this House.  For that reason, although, as I say, I would be very strongly in favour of all first stages, I find it difficult to vote for this one, and while there may be special circumstances in this case, I think it is very undesirable generally, from the point of view of the business of the House, that the Minister should <Col N="297" /> appear at this stage to make his case against the Bill.  There may be very special circumstances in this instance, but I regard it as a very bad procedure indeed that when leave to introduce a Bill is refused in the other House, and even when the Bill is defeated, it should be immediately introduced here and we should be invited to pass it and to send it back to the other House which has already demonstrated, whether we like it or not, that it does not want it.</P>

      <P>It was demonstrated that the Dáil would not look at it, and whether we could make a more beautiful article which they would look at, I do not know, but I doubt it. For this reason, I feel that it is not a very sound procedure, although, in general, I think that any group of people who want to introduce a Bill should be encouraged to do so.  I think that more use should be made of this House for the introduction of Bills by Private Members than the other House, which is more congested, and does not want its time taken up with the consideration of Private Bills.</P>

      <P>Senator Cummins, in his remarks on the subject, in asking leave to introduce this Bill, adverted to the fact that the House was not being allowed to discuss the Bill, that is, if there was going to be opposition to the First Stage.  I may say that when this Bill was before the Dáil two years ago, there was a very full discussion on the principal matter in Senator Cummins' discourse&mdash;the question of a 50 per cent. reduction in the rents versus a 25 per cent. reduction.  I fully realise, of course, that that does not mean that the House, if it wished, should not discuss the matter over again, but there was a full, free and frank discussion on the subject.  In 1936, the Bill making purchase possible by the cottage tenants became law after a full and frank discussion.  This matter of the Act enabling the cottage tenants to purchase their houses and holdings arose out of a persistent agitation carried on in the country over a number of years, by cottage tenants, individuals and organisations asking the Government to put legislation through the Oireachtas enabling the tenants to become owners of their cottages and holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> There was an agitation over a long period.  When I became Minister for Local Government I received shoals of resolutions.  I received deputations, and I received many letters from individual cottage tenants and from cottage tenants' organisations all over the country asking for a Bill of this kind. In order to get the mind of the people concerned chiefly, and the mind of the country generally, I, at the request of many of these cottage tenants' organisations, set up a commission of inquiry into the sale of cottages and plots provided at various times under the Labourers Acts.  I am sure that most, if not all, the members of the House have seen the report of that commission. It was published four years ago. The Bill that I introduced was based on the report that I got from that cottage tenants' commission.  Three of the eight people who were members of the commission were able and direct advocates of the cottage tenants' organisations.  They were the representatives of those cottage tenants and of the holders of cottage plots.  There were others on the commission who, though not direct representatives of the cottage tenants, were sympathetic with their point of view.  That commission, in its report, recommended the 25 per cent. reduction that is contained in the Bill.  Every member of the commission signed that report.  Four of those who were chiefly interested in the cottage tenants put an addendum to the report. They said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have signed and agreed with the general report...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They did not withdraw from their recommendation that a reduction of 25 per cent. would be a just and reasonable reduction, and went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... but desire to add that in view of the fact that substantial reductions to the extent of at least 50 per cent. are being made in all annuities payable by tenant farmers and others, under the various Land Acts, we suggest that in this connection, favourable consideration should be given to the position of existing cottier tenants whose rents form portion of the payments hitherto made to the British National Debt Commissioners by An Saorstát.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> That is dated the 29th March, 1933, and is signed by Eamonn Mansfield, Michael Smyth, James O'Farrell, and Séamus Johnston.  Although they signed that, they did not withdraw their recommendation that a 25 per cent. reduction would be a just and fair reduction in the rents, and that a cottage tenants' scheme, based on that condition, would be fair and just.  That is their statement in the report, and that is what I embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Certain gentlemen want to give more than that.  Is not that the position? What I see in this is that if a 50 per cent. reduction were agreed on it would eventually have the effect of stopping cottage building altogether. There are Senators who are members of local authorities.  They know the burden that our housing policy has put upon the ratepayers.  It has done that, and I say justly so.  If this housing policy is ever to be solved in town and country, then the national Exchequer, which is bearing its share, as well as the ratepayer, will have to put their hands in their pockets to pay for its solution.  Both are doing that.  All parties in the country are doing it. Thanks be to goodness there is no question of Party.  All Parties are joining together in pushing forward our housing programme.  My belief is that if you were to put an additional burden on the ratepayers by doing what is suggested here to-day you would stop the building of labourers' cottages. There are many thousands of labourers in every part of the country who are still without cottages.  Are you prepared to leave them in the lurch?  That, in effect, is what you want to do.  I am not saying that you are doing that willingly or deliberately, but in effect, that is what the result will be.  It may be that if a vote were taken on this you would have some voting in favour of giving a 50 per cent. reduction rather than the 25 per cent., but having voted in favour of the 50 per cent. reduction they would go back to their local boards and send up to me, as Minister for Local Government, a fiery resolution damning this Government for raising the rates.</P>

      <P>Senator Cummins knows that happens as well as I do. I am principally concerned that the building of labourers' cottages should go on throughout the country.  I am particularly anxious, of course, that where there is a slum problem to be dealt with that good houses should be provided.  Unfortunately we have slums in most of our towns and cities. We have a slum problem, too, in the rural areas.  You have rotten housing conditions in rural areas, and, therefore, as I have said, I do not want to see the building of labourers' cottages stopped.  I am sure there is no member of the House who would vote in favour of that.  Aside from that I submit that we are doing the just and the fair thing so far as the tenants of those cottages are concerned.  Their representatives on the commission pinned themselves down and signed a document saying that this was a just scheme.  That is what is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are other arguments that might be used to show that the Bill is just.  One is that a number of the tenants of labourers' cottages are in a position to bear a much higher rent, in proportion to their incomes, than they are actually paying.  You have such people as tenants of labourers' cottages in every county.  There are people in the occupation of those labourers' cottages for whom the cottages were never intended.  There are hundreds and hundreds of such people &mdash;teachers, Civic Guards, lorry drivers, people with shops and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  It does not follow that because a man may happen to be a Senator that he would not be entitled to a cottage. There may be Senators who are cottage tenants and who are properly entitled to be such.  But, you have hundreds of people, such as I have been speaking of, occupying labourers' cottages.  For the benefit of the rural worker, we propose that he shall become the owner of his cottage in a period related to the period of the existence of the cottage at a payment on an average of 10½d. per week.  Of course, he has to do the repairs.  In <Col N="303" /> their report, the commission say that it is their opinion that the repairs will probably be better done by the tenants themselves than they were by the local authorities, with all their staffs and officials, in days gone by.  That is the opinion of those who sat on that commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have kept the House a long time, but these are the reasons why, in the Dáil, I opposed the 50 per cent. reduction when the Bill was going through. I opposed it last week, and I am giving the Seanad the same opinion now, because my first interest is to see the housing conditions of the country <Col N="304" /> improved&mdash;to see the slums wiped out in every town and city in the country. The suggestion made here would, if adopted, retard that being done.</P>

It is no more convenient to me to have it Friday than it is to have it Tuesday.  I press for Friday in the interest of public business, and only in the interest of public business.  I must say that I think there could easily be too much of a disposition&mdash;and I have often seen it to exist in the past in the Dáil&mdash;to put matters of private convenience before what is actually best for public business.  I think that is a thing that, above all, ought not to be done at a moment when we are <Col N="305" /> increasing parliamentary salaries, and when it would be tactless, to say the least, to give the country the impression that we are gentlemen of leisure who only come here exactly on the days that suit us.</P>
      <P>The normal thing for a measure of importance is that its principles are discussed on the Second Reading Stage and that a suitable interval is then allowed for Senators to consider what amendments they wish to put down upon the basis of that discussion on the Second Reading Stage.  Here we shall be dealing with Money Bills, so far as those two Bills are concerned &mdash;the Parliamentary Allowances Bill and the Ministers' Pensions Bill.  They are almost certain to be certified as Money Bills, and it follows that we can do no good or no harm by rejecting them on the Second Reading, because, if we did, we should merely take away our power of moving amendments and the Bills would pass into law automatically in spite of us.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of making a long speech on the subject. It seemed necessary to point out that the normal procedure is for an interval to elapse between the stage of a Bill when we discuss its principles and the stage where we discuss amendments.  I suggest that that normal procedure ought not to be departed from in the case of two Bills in which the country takes a great interest, and that it certainly ought not to be departed from merely on the score that it is inconvenient to be here on Friday, because we do not intend to sit to-morrow.</P>
      <P>It gives one very great guidance in the framing of one's amendments if one has had an opportunity of listening to the Minister on the general principles of a Bill; and it also gives the Minister some guidance to hear the members of the House on the general principles of the Bill.  Then a few days elapse and there is time for all concerned to consider what amendments may be possible. I would, therefore, urge very strongly that the House should not depart on this occasion from what is customary and constitutional; that we should discuss these Bills in perfect good temper in principle on Friday on the Second Reading Stage, and then should have a few days to consider what amendments we might put down to be discussed on the following Wednesday.</P>

      <P>It is a very fine thing for Senator MacDermot to talk about sitting here on Friday.  Anybody who lives in a luxurious flat in Merrion Square can step across here in about five minutes, but, in my case, I have to come about 150 miles.  It is not at all convenient for me to stay over here to-night and to-morrow night, and to wait on Friday until the House meets in the afternoon.  So far as we know, anything to come before us can be very well disposed of next Wednesday, or, at all events, next Tuesday.  Besides that, two days' notice of the meeting of the House, if it is to meet later, is not sufficient for me.  While our public duties have first claim upon us, <Col N="307" /> so far as it is possible to attend to them, we have also other business to look after, and two days' notice is not sufficient to enable us to make our arrangements.  I have very important matters to attend to on Friday afternoon, and I cannot very well cancel them in order to attend to my duty here.  As I say, there is nothing before us which cannot wait until next week, and I do not know that there is anything to come before us next week which could not wait until the week after that.  I shall be available every week&mdash;even Christmas week and the week after&mdash;and we would have a precedent for meeting the week after Christmas.

      <P>We cannot carry this business over to the week after next, because the 21 days' provision with regard to Money Bills would come into operation.  If we carried over our deliberations on these Bills until the week after next they would be completely useless, because there would not be time to call the Dáil together supposing any of our recommendations were accepted.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator McEllin that there is no great rush about the matters to come before us and that it would be better if we met on Tuesday so that we should have the whole week to discuss the business. So far as Senator MacDermot's statement is concerned, I do not think that there is any danger of anybody associated with us being accused of being a &ldquo;gentleman of leisure.&rdquo; We are all prepared to work a seven-day week, if necessary, but is it necessary?  The majority of the people <Col N="308" /> here, so far as I can gather, are in favour of meeting on Tuesday instead of Friday, and I am always prepared to abide by majority rule.</P>

    <Title>Public Transport&mdash;Establishment of Tribunal: Motion.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the present position of public transport (other than air transport) within the area of jurisdiction of the Irish Government, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in particular, the circumstances which have led or contributed to the present unfavourable financial position of the Great Southern Railways and of the other railway companies operating within the said area, and</P>
    <P>(c)  whether any and, if so, what measures are necessary or desirable in order to secure efficient and progressive public transport (other than air transport) in the said area, and</P>
    <P>(d)  in particular, whether&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any further transport legislation,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(ii)  any changes in the ownership or in the methods of administration or both in the ownership and in the methods of administration of existing transport undertakings,</P>
    <P>are necessary or desirable.</P>
    <Col N="309" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal will be established under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, under which it will be vested with all the powers, rights and privileges of the High Court, or of a judge of the High Court, in respect of the enforcing of the attendance of witnesses, the compelling of the production of documents, and so forth.  It is considered desirable that the tribunal which is to inquire into the matters set out in the motion should have these powers.  That is why the motion is being submitted to the House.  I do not think that it is desirable I should speak at any length now on the question of transport, except to show that the matters mentioned in the motion are definitely matters of urgent public importance.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from the railway companies operating here &mdash;the Great Southern Railways Company and the Great Northern Railway Company&mdash;that they have reached positions of acute financial stringency in which Government action for their assistance is urgently necessary if they are to carry on satisfactorily.  Both companies estimate that the net income of their undertakings for the present year will fall short of the amount required to pay interest on their debentures.  They have represented that their liquid assets are exhausted except for the amounts hypothecated to secure loans in recent years to meet capital expenditure, and that their position in the matter of cash resources to carry on the day-to-day working is precarious.  Money is also required for the purpose of capital expenditure.  The Great Southern Railways Company have mentioned a very substantial amount as being necessary to enable them to undertake the capital expenditure involved in closing uneconomic sections of their railway line and developing road transport.  I think it is clear that the companies, under present circumstances, could not possibly hope to raise that capital in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Government have decided that the time has come when major decisions on transport policy are necessary.  It is considered desirable that before these decisions are made there should be a <Col N="310" /> review of the situation by such a tribunal as we now propose to establish and that the decisions ultimately made should be based upon the information obtained as a result of such a review as well as of such recommendations as members of the tribunal may decide to submit.  It is not possible, as yet, to give any intimation as to the personnel of the proposed tribunal except to say that it will consist of persons who are in a position to approach the consideration of the transport problem with unbiased minds.  I do not think that we require a review by transport experts.  I think that we require a review by people who can view the whole transport situation as it is and make recommendations as to the steps necessary to put it upon a basis which will enable public needs to be adequately served.  I contemplate that the tribunal should do its work expeditiously and that we should have its report for consideration and subsequent action, if considered necessary, by the time the Dáil reassembles in February next.</P>

      <P>It would seem as if the efforts made a few years ago to put the railways on their feet were entirely vitiated, if this tribunal must now be set up to try to find a new solution.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the decision reached, because in parts of the country which are remote from railways there has been a great deal of uneasiness in regard to this matter, particularly during the last ten or 14 days.  Developments in agriculture and tillage have been, perhaps, revolutionary and, to some extent, successful. If the position is to be met, the demands of the remoter parts of our country, which are wholly unorganised and which may not be able to voice their views before this tribunal, should not be forgotten by the Administration.</P>

      <P>We must welcome the effort the Minister is making to put our transport system on a sound basis and I am sure the House will gladly accept this motion.  At the same <Col N="311" /> time, it seems necessary to say that we cannot have any really scientific solution of the transport problem in Ireland if we consider only the area of jurisdiction of the present Irish Government, and I should like to suggest to the Minister the propriety of adverting to the similar problem which is agitating the minds of the people in &ldquo;Hibernia Irridenta,&rdquo; as I previously described it.  Every effort should be made to co-ordinate whatever solution of the transport problem is arrived at here with the solutions which are likely to recommend themselves to our northern neighbours.</P>

      <P>It is, I suppose, necessary to say that the legislation which was enacted in 1933 has not solved our transport problems.  That is clear. These problems are there&mdash;as acute as ever.  It is impossible to visualise the circumstances that existed in 1933 when the whole transport organisation of the country was on the verge of immediate breakdown and when the chaotic conditions existing offered very little prospect of clear-cut solution. These conditions have been modified.  To a very large extent, the aim of the 1933 legislation has been accomplished.  We hear occasional references to loopholes in these Acts and to successful evasion of these Acts.  While it is true that there has been some successful evasion of the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1933, that fact should not obscure the much more significant fact that it has been, to the extent of at least 90 per cent., effective in its purpose.  Apparently, the extent to which we went in 1933 was not sufficient to remove the problem entirely.  Consequently, it is <Col N="312" /> necessary to reconsider the whole position.  That is what we now propose to do in the light of the information which review by this tribunal may make available and of its recommendations. It is essential for us to keep in mind that one of the railway companies directly concerned has two-thirds of its line outside our immediate jurisdiction and that, to a large extent, its financial difficulties at the moment are due to circumstances in that area which is outside our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I know that the transport position in Northern Ireland has been under investigation recently by a somewhat similar tribunal, the report of which was published some days ago.  We shall, of course, have that report available for consideration in conjunction with the report of this tribunal when decisions upon policy and on the nature of legislation to be introduced are being taken.  Increased productivity is, of course, a matter which would have a direct bearing upon transport, but we must not forget that for a great part of this country public transport was never an economic proposition and was provided only by means of Government subsidy or Government grant.  While changing economic conditions might alter that situation, conditions have not yet changed sufficiently to make it possible for us to see a solution of our transport difficulties precisely on the lines on which a solution has been found in other countries.  Our circumstances are different from those of other countries and, while anything that increases the wealth of the nation will have a direct reaction on transport, it will not be sufficient in itself to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
