      <P>The question I want to ask the Minister really arises on Section 1, sub-section (3), paragraph (c) of the Schedule under which the terminating company will have power to promote a permanent company. I should like the Minister to explain why that roundabout procedure is adopted, why the permanent company should not come into being first and the terminating company be a subsidiary of that company, or why some arrangement could not be made whereby the existing contracts that are now to be handled by the terminating company, could not be segregated in the books of the permanent company?  I know it is a question that is somewhat technical.  I have read this Bill through to the best of my ability but it is very complicated and I find it very hard to understand the procedure laid down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course many different schemes of amalgamation could have been devised.  I have no doubt that those responsible for this agreement, during the course of the negotiations which led to it, considered many different schemes and the scheme which appealed most to them was the one that appears here.  On consideration, it appears to be a simple straightforward scheme having regard to the <Col N="136" /> many difficult problems with which those who negotiated the scheme had to contend.  Four companies are being amalgamated.  All their assets and liabilities are being transferred to a company which is being established for that purpose&mdash;a company established for the purpose of taking over these assets and liabilities.  The amalgamated companies then go out of existence, except in so far as they remain in existence as holding companies in this Insurance Amalgamated Company, Limited.  That Insurance Amalgamated Company, Limited, will have to deal first of all with policies issued by the amalgamated companies, policies which were issued at different times, subject to different conditions and on no uniform basis.  They decided that the best way to deal with these policies, that is policies which are being transferred by the amalgamated companies, was to transfer the function to a terminating company and to form a new permanent company to deal with new business, operating the existing business on the basis of a closed fund.  The new company will be able to issue uniform policies.  It will be able to standardise the method of working.  It will not be faced with the difficulty of having the efficiency of its operations marred by the various sets of policies issued by the companies taking part in the amalgamation, whereas the terminating company will be able to operate the closed fund without difficulty, using as its agents for that purpose the officers and the staffs of the permanent company.  In due course, the company that will be operating the closed fund, that is the Insurance Amalgamation Company, will cease to exist.  Its business will be finished.  It will have worked off its liabilities or arranged for the transfer of these liabilities upon some basis to the permanent company, and will then be liquidated.  At that stage, there will be only one company, the permanent company, which will have carried on none of the problems of the past and will have conducted its own business from the start on what we hope will be a new and better system which will prove more beneficial to those engaged in industrial assurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> I think there are advantages in having this arrangement of two companies, and I think that of the various methods of amalgamation which could have been adopted this has most to recommend it.  I am recommending it to the Seanad, as I recommended it to the Dáil, on the ground that it was agreed by the companies.  The prospect of getting an agreed scheme of amalgamation appeared at one time very difficult, but we have got an agreed scheme, and in so far as that scheme is open to no objection in principle that I can see, the best course for us to take is to accept it and to use it as a basis on which to build up future industrial assurance organisation here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has enlightened me up to a point, but only up to a point.  I rather gather that the Minister left it to these participating companies to formulate a scheme and during the formulation of that scheme stood aside and, finally, when an agreed scheme was presented, he consented to sponsor it.  I rather feel that the Government had a responsibility from the very commencement of the formulation of the scheme in view of the very substantial obligations which the Government are undertaking in connection with the whole transaction.  I do not want to get into a Second Reading debate, but what I do not see is the necessity for two separate boards of directors.  Apparently there is going to be a board of directors to handle this terminating business, this closed fund, which will be getting less and less and, finally, will disappear altogether.  At the same time, there is going to be another board of directors to handle the permanent company's business which will have to deal with all new business, and, no doubt, it will be very substantial.  I cannot see the necessity for the two boards in that the business of the terminating company is only a segregation of business and practically only a book keeping matter.  I know that this is agreed and I do not except that the House will upset it, but the House is at least entitled to full information <Col N="138" /> on these points which, to me, are certainly obscure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to give the Senator the impression that the history of these negotiations was precisely as he says&mdash;that the Government stood aside and waited until an amalgamation scheme was presented to it.  In theory, that is what happened. Four companies came together; they agreed on a scheme which they presented to me, and I approved of it eventually.  In practice, before they started negotiating, I informed them of the nature of the scheme that I would approve, the principles to which that scheme would have to conform and, in fact presented the parties concerned with a rough draft of the type of scheme I desired to have presented to me, with an intimation that a scheme which was not in general conformity with that draft would not be approved, so that it would be incorrect to say that the Government stood aside.  Quite the contrary is the case, because the Government intervened right at the beginning and pushed through an amalgamation along these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator does not quite see the reason for two companies.  We are proposing to put a large amount of State money into a fund designed to be the security of the policy-holders of the existing company.  We are not in any sense guaranteeing the solvency of the permanent company, nor do we intend to subsidise it in any way.  We want to ensure that none of the money which the State is providing is going to be devoted to the business of the new company.  On the contrary, that money is being put up to make good a deficiency in the funds of the amalagamating companies and will be security for the policy-holders of these amalgamating companies.  It is, therefore, I think, clear that there should be a separate fund.  That is one reason, but there are other reasons.  We hope that the new company will be able to operate its business on such a basis that the payment of bonuses to policy-holders will be a practicable step for it to take.  Clearly, whatever profits are realised by that new company, and <Col N="139" /> can be devoted to that purpose, should be retained for the benefit of the policy-holders of that company.  We are, I think, doing enough for the policy-holders of the amalgamating companies in guaranteeing the solvency of the insurance funds behind their policies, and there are other reasons more directly related to administration which make it desirable that the two funds should be operated separately.</P>
    <P>The one I have referred to is important, namely, that the policies of the amalgamating companies which the terminating company will take over have been issued on no uniform basis. There will be no common set of conditions applying to them and it would complicate the business of the new company to a considerable extent if they had also to be directly responsible for these older policies.  The establishment of two companies does not, in fact, mean any substantial increase in the overhead costs of the whole scheme.  While it is true that there will be two boards, the staffs, generally speaking, will be the same in both cases.  In fact, the staff of the terminating company will be small indeed, in so far as the service of these policies will be dealt with on an agency basis by the permanent company, and there will be a certain amount of duplication in the personnel of the two boards.  It is intended that some of the directors of the terminating company will also be members of the board of the permanent company.  The managing director will be the same in each case, so that whatever additional expense may be involved in having an organisation of two companies, it will not be very great, and certainly will not be sufficient to offset the very substantial gains which result from this method of organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion is somewhat academic, but I hope the Minister will give an assurance that he will not in any sense duplicate these directors, because you reach a position, if you do duplicate them, in which some directors will be left with absolutely nothing to do.  In the course of time the closed fund will get smaller <Col N="140" /> and smaller, and eventually you will be paying directors for doing nothing.  No doubt, directors are sometimes paid for doing nothing, but I do not think it is a principle to which the Government should, directly or indirectly, be a party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to suggest that the directors of the terminating company will have nothing to do. They will have a very heavy responsibility to carry.  They will have the investment and the safeguarding of the investment of a very large amount of money.  While it is true that, in the course of time, the liabilities of the company will gradually disappear, it is not intended that the company will continue until the last claim on the last policy has been discharged.  It could do that, but it is intended that, at some stage, as soon as it is practicable to do so, an arrangement will be made between the two companies for the transfer to the permanent company of the outstanding liabilities of the terminating company, and, when that takes place, the terminating company will be liquidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate until I found that I could not put in amendments.  The Minister has said that the directors of the terminating company will have a very grave responsibility.  If that is so, I should like to ask the Minister what were the considerations which induced him to select the persons whose names have been given in the Press as the directors of the new company?  I find that one of the directors is a motor man.  He may be a very good motor man, but I have grave doubt about his being a good insurance man.  Another of the new directors is the manager of a milling concern.  He may know how many loaves can be got out of a 10-stone bag of flour, but when it comes to insurance it may be quite another matter. Another director, who is a very estimable gentleman, and for whom I have a very high regard, is considerably over 60 years of age, and while a member of the board can be over 60 years of age, no agent over that age is to be employed.  I have yet to find out what that gentleman knows about winding up an insurance company. <Col N="141" /> Another gentleman is a stockbroker, and my small experience of stockbrokers has not been very satisfactory. I should like the Minister to tell us what induced him to make those selections. One would expect the Minister to select men who knew something about the business, or some men who knew something about it.  I find also that the managing director is to be managing director of the terminating company and of the new company, and that we have had to go to the other side to get a man for this position.  If my information is correct, we have got a pensioned servant from a company on the other side for the job.  If we are going to start an Irish company, although I have nothing to say about this gentleman, I say that we should have got an Irish national.  I should like the Minister to inform us as to the considerations which induced him to make these selections, and why, when appointing a managing director, an Irish national was not secured.</P>

      <P>With regard to compensation for staffs, there is mention on page 32, sub-paragraph (b) (i) as to the amount of compensation to be given to persons who have what are known as book interests.  There is a provision here which I should like to have explained.  The scheme is that compensation will be payable on one of two bases.  The first is that if you belong to a company which has, in fact, purchased books, you will get compensation based on the price paid by the company for the books.  If, on the other hand, the company has not purchased books, the amount shall be fixed on a fair and reasonable basis, and having regard to the average value obtained for a book interest in such company during the 12 months ending 31st December, 1937.  I am not an expert in the matter, but it has been represented to me that where a company purchased book interests it always did so at very low prices, and that, therefore, those persons holding a book interest, who will be compensated under this part of the scheme and who hold an interest in a company which made such purchases will get a very low amount indeed, while other people will get what one might <Col N="142" /> call a fair market value.  A book interest, as I understand it, is a saleable asset to which a person up to the present had the same right as I have to a house, or as any man has to any other asset of his.  If, in fact, there are two different bases and one much less advantageous to the agents concerned, it is a matter worthy of explanation.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2, at the top of page 33, contains a provision which I do not understand.  It seems to me to be capable of two meanings.  It says that these persons &ldquo;shall be entitled... to demand employment with the permanent company&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the amount of the salary to be paid to each such person shall be fixed with reference to the amount of the capital payment.&rdquo;  Does that mean a bigger capital payment and a bigger salary, or a bigger capital payment and a lower salary?  I am not quite clear about it, and would be glad if the Minister would enlighten us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Kelly it is not an easy matter to discuss the claims of individuals for appointment to a particular post of responsibility.  I should say at the start that the persons whose names have been published as having been invited to act on the board of the terminating company will not constitute the whole of the board of that company. Only certain persons were asked so that a beginning could be made, and possibly those persons will be added to before the company really begins to operate.  In making a selection of persons for membership of that board, regard was given to the work which that company will primarily have to do.  It will not be directly concerned with the day to day administration of insurance business at all.  The main function of the board of that company will be to safeguard its funds: to see that these funds are so employed as to ensure that there will be no wastage of the assets of the company&mdash;on the contrary, in the expectation that there may be an appreciation of them.  I think that the persons we have chosen are fully competent.  They are probably as <Col N="143" /> competent as any persons available in the country to do that work.</P>
      <P>Reference has frequently been made to the selection of the first managing director of this company of a person who is not of Irish nationality.  I think if Senators and others will pause and think for a moment they will conclude that that had almost necessarily to be the case.  We have in this country five companies carrying on industrial insurance business, four of which are participating in this amalgamating scheme.  Clearly the selection as managing director of a person directly associated with one of the amalgamating companies might give rise to considerable difficulty when one has regard to the problem that there will be of amalgamating the staffs and of ensuring fair treatment between staffs, particularly in the case of a company which is going to carry for a long period of time a considerable surplus staff.  I have no desire to disparage the ability of many of those associated with the amalgamating companies.  Some of the officers of these companies would, I am quite sure, be quite fitted to act as managing director of this company. I do not say that we could have got the services of those that we would have chosen ourselves, because not all the executive officers of the amalgamating companies will be transferred. I do not think we would have been justified in selecting as managing director some of those who have been offering their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel certain that we have chosen an individual whose competence and knowledge of the insurance business are beyond question, one detached from whatever rivalry may exist between the amalgamating offices, one who will establish the amalgamation scheme on a fair basis and carry out more easily the general design of the Government behind the amalgamation scheme, which is to change entirely the conduct of industrial insurance business here&mdash;to put it on a basis which, we trust, will be fairer to the general public and better from the point of view of the country as a whole.  I have no apology whatever <Col N="144" /> to make for having chosen for that post a person of other than Irish nationality.  I think that if we were under an obligation to ensure that the person whom we appointed was the most competent of all those available, having regard to the circumstances which I have described, we had necessarily to look outside the ranks of the employees of the amalgamating companies for such person.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes raised a question of considerable intricacy.  I do not know that I will be able to give him a very lucid explanation of that part of the scheduled agreement.  I have not heretofore received any representations to the effect that the provision for the compensation of persons holding a book interest, as set out in the agreement, are unreasonable.  I do not know that the question of book interest is of very great importance.  All that I know is that the price which will be paid will be reasonable, and I think that the provisions in the agreement are sufficient to ensure that the intentions of the agreement in that regard will be given effect to.</P>
    <P>The reference which the Senator made to the paragraph at the top of page 33 relates to a particular provision of the agreement which is perhaps more difficult to put in non-technical language.  Perhaps it would be better to defend that section of the agreement by a mere advertence to the fact that the scheme, as a whole, was approved by those who had a very direct interest in ensuring that no part of the scheme would be unfair to the interests concerned.  It is true that the peculiar nature of the terms of the employment of some of the staffs of the amalgamating companies created a difficulty in laying down a clear line of policy for dealing with them.  Generally speaking, I told the companies, when we were engaged in these negotiations, that the undertaking which I had given in the Dáil when the 1936 Act was being considered there, must be given effect to in the agreement: that is to say, that the agreement must provide adequately for the maintenance in employment in insurance of all persons who were dependent for their livelihood upon their existing employment <Col N="145" /> in the insurance business.  In giving effect to any general principle of that kind, some rough and ready method of calculation must, of course, be adopted.  The method that was adopted is embodied in the agreement. It seeks to cover the various types of employment, and is designed to ensure that those persons who could be properly described as being dependent for their livelihood on their employment in the insurance business, and who had been looking forward to making employment in the insurance business their career, will be continued in that employment in the future on terms not less favourable than those which they now enjoy.  All the various provisions of this section of the agreement are designed to ensure the application of that principle to the various types of employment concerned.</P>

      <P>There is just a point that I wish to raise on the section.  It seems to me that if the sole object of this measure was to safeguard the policy-holders in these four participating companies&mdash;I know the Minister will say that it was the primary object&mdash;it would have been better for the Government to have guaranteed any deficiencies that might arise.  In that case the assets would have been taken over and the fund would continue to work.  That, it seems to me, would have been much better than locking up a sum stated <Col N="146" /> to be in the region of £500,000.  That money will have to be borrowed at a time when borrowing is none too easy and invested in the shares of this terminating company.  I would like to know whether that £500,000 is going to be invested solely in the terminating company.  I agree that question does not arise on this section.  I would like to know if the Minister, or his advisers, considered this point that I have raised, because it seems to me that it would have been much more straightforward and, I suggest, more economical to have guaranteed the policies of the four participating companies rather than do what is set out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Senator is suggesting that we might have guaranteed the policies of the amalgamating companies or guaranteed the solvency of the amalgamating companies. In other words, is he suggesting that we could have secured the position of the policy-holders without an amalgamation scheme at all, or is his idea that, having effected the amalgamation scheme, we might have nevertheless secured the policy-holders of the amalgamating companies by a simple guarantee given to the terminating company?  We could have done it that way but we considered that the giving of a guarantee by the State would involve the State directly in the administration of the company.  The State would have to see that all reasonable precautions were taken to ensure that the guarantee would not have to be met.  We preferred to see the company operating on a freer basis such as this scheme contemplates.  There was, of course, also the consideration that it was desired to secure for the State some share in the equity of the company in proportion to its contribution to its establishment.  That involved clearly that there would have to be some accurate assessment as to the value of the Government's guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system devised here is fairly simple.  By reference to it the Senator will, perhaps, see what I mean.  In the scheme provided for in the agreement, the four amalgamating companies transfer to this company their assets <Col N="147" /> and liabilities.  By reference to the form set out in the agreement, the value of what they transfer is determined, and they get against that the value of shares in this company.  In addition, the State puts in cash and for that cash gets shares.  It is a simple matter to determine the number of shares which the State should get under that arrangement.  To determine the number of shares which it should get in return for a guarantee would be a much more difficult matter.  These shares are of a rather peculiar character. Their actual value will have no relation to their face value.  The face value has, in fact, been fixed at 2/- each, but the State is getting only one 2/- share for each £1 it contributes and the amalgamating companies are only getting a 2/- share for each pound of value, if I may use that term, that they put into the company.  These shares will, we expect, appreciate in value very considerably and will eventually be worth considerably more than their face value, possibly worth more even than the £1 upon which the number is calculated at present.</P>
    <P>We could undoubtedly have operated some kind of amalgamation on the basis of a Government guarantee, but I think it is a better system to have this company dealing with its policy-holders on the basis set out here.  It is desirable that there should be, in the case of industrial assurance, a fund in existence which is the property of the policy-holders&mdash;their security that they will be paid when they make claims on their policies.  Each company doing industrial assurance should have that fund.  The fact that the sum total of the life funds of the amalgamating companies is insufficient to cover their liabilities is due to the fact that a portion of the money that should have gone to the policy-holders' fund had gone in expenses of administration, or in bad investments or some other way. We felt that the best way to deal with those deficiencies to make them good in cash.</P>
    <P>It is not practical to say that the money will be locked up, because the money held by the terminating company must be invested.  It is from <Col N="148" /> that income that the company will meet its outgoings and I do not think that constitutes a problem because if these deficiencies had not arisen, if there had been no wastage of assets in the case of some of these amalgamated companies, then the same amount of money would be there now, not in one fund but in four funds and would be invested by each of the amalgamated companies.  Again, I have to say that it is only through that that this amalgamation scheme could have been devised.  I do not know that I am making myself very clear as I do not profess to have technical knowledge on this matter, but having regard to the considerations which appear to me to have weight, I felt it desirable to approve this scheme.  The State, against that cash subscribed, is going to get an asset of real value, an asset which may prove to be worth considerably more than the actual amount of cash that is being put up now.</P>

      <P>I do not want to embarrass the Minister because this is a very technical matter, and I know that the Minister will understand that no one has a greater admiration for the way he has handled it than I have. I would like to ask, however, if a valuation has been made of what the deficiency will be in the four amalgamating companies or how has the £500,000 been arrived at?  One word more, while I am on my feet.  The Minister said that it would not be right, or probably proper, to take a managing director from any one of the four amalgamating companies but, might I point out that the man who has been appointed comes from another company that is likely to come in?  I will let it pass at that, but I would like to ask if the £500,000 is the whole State liability in connection with the four amalgamating companies and, if so, how is it arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only an estimate of what the deficiency will prove to be.  No one can say yet what the actual deficiencies will be, first, because the actual transfer date has not been fixed and secondly, because the valuation has not been concluded.  The transfer date cannot be fixed until this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just point out that before we go any further, we would like to see what the deficits of these companies are.  I claim to know a little bit about insurance and I do not want the Minister to have to come to the Dáil some time hence for another £250,000.  Let us know exactly what the amount will be now.  We should have those four societies valued at once because that £500,000 might easily become £750,000 or £1,000,000 later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if the Senator will look into it for a moment he will see that no one can say exactly what the deficiency will be or what it is now.  The figure we have determined is the figure estimated for the date on which the actual transfer of business will take place.  That will not take place until the scheme is passed by the Dáil and the most we can give is an estimate.  That estimate is about £500,000, representing what the deficiency will be.</P>
      <P>On the second matter, it is quite true that we hope that the Prudential, the Refuge, the Pearl and other British insurance companies will eventually participate in this amalgamation and to that extent there is some point in his argument.  When I referred to the difficulty of taking as the first managing director somebody directly associated with one of the amalgamating companies, I was thinking more of the difficulty there will be of adjusting differences between staffs, and I felt that difficulty would be enhanced if the managing director was directly concerned with staff matters here, that is, dealing with one section of the staffs amalgamated.  There are other considerations. I do not want to say that that is the sole consideration.  There was also his very high standing in the industrial assurance business, his reputation therein, and his approved competence and the fact that he had considerable experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has referred personally to the individual, I wish to say that I entirely agree with what he has stated in that respect.  I am not an insurance expert by any means, but I know something about the gentleman, and I do not think the Minister could have got a better person. It is a highly technical subject. Senator Kelly raised the question of the qualifications of directors versus managing directors.  Of course, they are quite different.  Gentlemen who occupy positions as directors are, very often, not experts, and very often would only be interfering with the expert.  The managing director must have technical qualifications.  If I may say so, Sir, I do not think that these qualifications were available in the country.  It would be absurd to say a retired civil servant had them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that, and it was clearly provided that the policy of the Government was to get full control, or a large measure of control, over industrial assurance, but I was not a bit convinced by the objections to guarantees on the grounds that they would have involved the Government in direct management or control of the administration.  Why, every day the Government issues guarantees to concerns over which they have had no control whatever, Trade Loan guaran tees.  There is an inquiry made in the first instance, of course, but there is no interference afterwards with the management of the concern.  Until default is made on the guarantee, the Government can do, and actually do nothing.  I do not feel that the difference is convincing, but I would like to raise this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deficiencies are to be guaranteed&mdash; the Minister or the Government is to be responsible.  How will that operate in practice?  In the course of time, the finances of the terminating company may be very considerably better, and although there are deficiencies now in prospect, a position may be reached some time in the future where bonuses will be payable.  When that position <Col N="151" /> has been reached, it will be reached partly by management, but largely by the finance, assistance and participation of the Government.  Should not the Government have the first say on that bonus or on that surplus?  I do not think it is fair for the Government to be put into a position in which, if the finances improve, they get only the interest on their investment, while the surplus goes to the benefit of policy-holders who, if the Government had not come to their rescue, would probably be subject to default.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that the board would necessarily follow that policy.  I am inclined to agree with the Senator that policy-holders of the amalgamating companies whose policies are being transferred should not bank unduly upon the expectation of getting bonus payments.  When I referred here to the possibility of the payment of bonuses I was thinking of the policies of the permanent company, but what will eventually happen, we expect, is that this terminating company will be left only with assets, that, in due course its liabilities will disappear, for one reason or another, and it will be left only with assets, which will then be distributed to the owners of the equity of the company when the company has been liquidated. The Government will, at that stage, get its due proportion of the assets. If, in the meantime, the Government disposes of its shares&mdash;the Minister is entitled to do that although I think it would be bad policy to do so&mdash;then the amount the Government will get for the shares will be determined by the position of the company, the extent to which it has made progress towards that position when it will have assets only without liabilities, or when the shares will be worth more than their nominal value or more than what was paid.  The extent to which profits paid by the company will be available for policy-holders will be a matter for the board, but I think it will be some considerable time before that question will arise in that acute form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt <Col N="152" /> that the Minister and his advisers have looked into that matter, but under insurance law at present, shareholders are only entitled to a certain proportion of the surplus profits and the balance in excess of that proportion has to go to the policy-holders.  No doubt all that has been gone into.  I am satisfied that the Minister agrees that it would not be equitable for the residue of the policy-holders to share largely in any surplus that may exist when the fund is approaching the winding-up stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) (a) (i) to delete lines 44 and 45 and insert in lieu thereof the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;until the final allocation of shares as between the Minister and the participating companies shall have been determined as provided by Section 22 of the Scheduled Agreement, and thereafter for so long as he shall think fit unless within a period of 12 months from the date of such final allocation it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that such shares can be disposed of on terms which will recoup the Central Fund for the advances made to the terminating company in which <Col N="153" /> event it shall be the duty of the Minister to so dispose of his holding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that when the new amalgamation has been set upon its feet, the Government will be prepared to divest itself of its financial responsibility and leave the development of the undertaking to private enterprise, provided that Irish capital is then available to the extent necessary.  The Bill provides for the investment, to an unspecified extent, of State funds and, because the amount required is an unknown quantity, it is obviously impossible, at the moment, to determine whether the capital necessary would or would not be made available by private investors.</P>
    <P>An entirely new position will arise when the actuarial position of the participating companies has been ascertained and the liability to be undertaken by the Minister for Finance has been ascertained.  The project will, then, have reached the stage when it can be examined as a business proposition.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for the termination of State ownership and control only if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that the shares held by the Government can be disposed of on terms which would recoup the Exchequer, and it will be observed that the wording limits the time during which this change from State ownership may be effected. There can, therefore, be no question of private investors hanging back to assure themselves of the ultimate financial success of the new undertaking, as the disposal of the shares envisaged in this amendment could only take place while the amalgamation is still in its very early stages.</P>
    <P>My reasons for moving this amendment having been put forward in the course of the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, I do not propose to delay the House by restating the argument.  It is true that, in the past, there were many serious abuses associated with industrial life assurance&mdash;many of them due to a defective agency system&mdash;but the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1936, preclude a <Col N="154" /> recurrence of such abuses in this country and, even before the enactment of similar legislation in Great Britain, reputable insurance companies had taken effective steps to eradicate the evil.  Private enterprise has had its failures in every branch of commerce and, although the business of insurance has had its quota of casualties, there is no branch of economic activity which can lay claim to a more creditable record of beneficial service to the community.</P>
    <P>I can see no adequate reason why insurance or any section of insurance should come under permanent State control&mdash;as distinct from State supervision&mdash;and it must be remembered that not one, but two branches of insurance&mdash;ordinary life assurance as well as industrial life assurance&mdash;will be transacted by the new company. In other countries where Governments have tried the experiment they have learned their lesson in due time at the expense of the taxpayer, and, all too frequently, at the expense of the policy-holder as well.</P>
    <P>Insurance is a business where same competition is necessary to provide an adequate service to the public and to maintain the flow of new business essential to successful underwriting. If the permanent Company achieves a virtual monopoly it will lack the incentive which would ensure the facilities which the public should have.  On the other hand, if other insurance companies continue to operate, the new undertaking should be as unfettered as possible in order to work successfully on competitive commercial lines.</P>
    <P>If we were to ask the man in the street his outstanding impression of industrial life assurance he would probably point to the number of cases which are contested in the courts.  This factor exists in spite of the fact that insurance companies do not like contesting these cases and, as a general rule, do so only when no alternative is open to them and when equitable settlements cannot otherwise be secured.  Can anyone imagine that a State-controlled institution would be able to deal with such cases except on a basis of strict adherence to rules which would preclude the flexibility <Col N="155" /> possible in a commercial undertaking? It seems inevitable that a State-controlled company would find itself contesting many more cases than are brought before the courts under present conditions.</P>
    <P>There is one national company with which I am personally associated, which furnishes an example of what can best be done by a Government in this matter of insurance.  In 1926, the Oireachtas passed legislation to enable local authorities to establish a company for the transaction of their insurances. If I may say so, that company is an example of successful administration by insurance experts.  I have had the honour of piloting it from its small beginnings to its present assured position, and I am convinced that the Oireachtas was right in allowing the company to develop along its own lines under competitive conditions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would stress the importance of the point that a Government-controlled company must for all time confine its operations to native territory. Life assurance could be developed so as to become an important invisible export, for the premiums paid to a life company remain in its custody for long periods, and there are not the same &ldquo;in-and-out&rdquo; payments which are a feature of fire, workmen's compensation, and the various branches of accident insurance.  A commercially-controlled national life assurance company could, in course of time, spread its ramifications to almost every part of the world with an Irish population, for our exiles would gladly insure with a sound company operating from the homeland, and, with their assistance, the new enterprise could not fail to become an important factor in our national economy.</P>
    <P>No one appreciates more than I do the anxiety of the Minister to put the business of industrial life assurance on a sound basis, and it is because I feel that the real help which the Government is offering in the proposals contained in the Bill can be supplemented and intensified, that I commend this amendment to the House.  If the investing public are not prepared to take up the shares, the amendment will <Col N="156" /> have no effect on the fortunes of the permanent company.  On the other hand, if the necessary capital is forthcoming, the amendment will ensure that the State will be relieved of the obligation to run an insurance business for all time, contrary to all the lessons which may be learned, and all the experience which may be gained from those countries which have been least successful in the development of the business.  I have pleasure in commending the amendment to the House, and I hope that it will meet with the favourable consideration of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I must express my complete opposition to the amendment proposed by Senator Brennan.  As I see it, the main object of the Bill is to relieve private enterprise from the awkward situation in which it found itself when its chestnuts had somehow got into the fire.  To a certain extent, it is a case of the State acting as a cat's paw to recover the chestnuts from the fire, and the suggestion contained in the amendment is that the State, having acted in that kindly capacity, should in due course make a present of these chestnuts to private enterprise.  I think the State, if it retrieves the chestnuts, should keep them.  I think that the situation contemplated by the mover of the amendment, in his advocacy of the virtues of private enterprise, requires some further elucidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation which existed before the amalgamation was that we had a number of private insurance companies competing with one another and with English insurance companies for a certain amount of insurance business. That was private enterprise, if you like, and it certainly was not, in any sense, monopoly.  But, when this legislation has been completely carried out, and when, as we hope, the amalgamated company has acquired the interest of competing British insurance companies in Eire, the situation will then be that there will be a single <Col N="157" /> monopolistic insurance company doing all the industrial assurance in Eire; and I think a very desirable situation, so long as the State maintains a rigid control over the proceedings of that one monopolistic company.  But, if the State relaxes its control, as the amendment contemplates, you then have a situation in which you have a monopoly company owned by so-called private enterprise, but actually, a monopoly, with all the economic power of a monopoly to exploit a monopoly position, and to make the public, either as policy-holders or otherwise, pay more for the service of insurance than that service is worth, the balance representing a form of transfer of income without service; in other words, exploitation of the policy-holders by the fortunate owners of this monopoly position.</P>
    <P>I maintain that, if we must have monopoly, the State should have absolute control of that monopoly and should do any taxing of the individual that is to be done; and that any form of monopoly which involves, as a monopoly must, a certain power of taxation which is not under the control of the State is thoroughly objectionable. We have enough public taxation already, but at all events, we get public services in return for public taxation.  But those who are the victims of monopoly taxation get nothing in return for that monopoly exploitation.  I want to avoid a situation coming into existence in which a monopolistic insurance company will be able to exploit the public.</P>

      <P>As I read the Bill, I do not understand that the purpose of the Bill is to bring all industrial insurance into the monopoly, but that industrial insurance can proceed independently of this Bill if people are so minded to do so.  I also do not see how this amendment is going to effect the objects of the mover.  If I am right, it only refers to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares; it only gives power to public investors if they so desire, to acquire &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares.  But as I read the Bill and the schedule combined, it is the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares that have the voting control, and if public investors wish to <Col N="158" /> have control, they will have to acquire the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares.</P>
      <P>Arising out of that, would the Minister tell the House what is the distribution between &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares.  The participating company, in return for assets transferred, I understand, get &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares at their nominal value.  I may be wrong in that, but the Minister can correct me.  Then a certain number&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;of these &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares are allotted to the Minister for Finance. Over and above that the Minister for Industry and Commerce gets the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares.  I presume he gets the quantity of &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares stated in the scheduled agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to Senator Sir John Keane that, as far as I can find out, the division refers only to the terminating or temporary company, and there is in fact no such division of the share capital in the permanent company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the amendment is to Section 6 of the Bill and this refers only to the shares of the terminating company.  The first line says: &ldquo;Every share of the terminating company...&rdquo; There is no question that the section refers to the shares of the permanent company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that eventually the shareholders of the permanent company will be comprised of the shareholders of the terminating or temporary company; so that whoever holds the majority of the shares of the terminating company must of necessity have control of the permanent company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would say why he should hold the shares in this company through a nominee instead of openly holding them himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that is not unusual.  The Minister may find it more convenient to hold these shares through an officer in this Department or some other nominee than to hold them himself.  The main question that arises is whether the Minister, either <Col N="159" /> directly or through his nominee, should hold these shares at all. Senator Johnston has dealt to a considerable extent with the arguments put forward by Senator Brennan in moving his amendment.  I was also struck by the fact that Senator Brennan's speech in support of his amendment did not appear to relate to the amendment at all.  He was, in fact, arguing in favour of the retention of a reasonable amount of competition in industrial assurance business while the sole purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister for Finance shall sell to members of the public the shares of this company which he may obtain. This company, whether it occupies a monopolistic position or not, will not have its position altered by reason of the sale of the shares to members of the public and what I take to be the main idea of Senator Brennan&mdash;to secure a reasonable amount of competition&mdash;would not be effected by the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keane asked if the purpose of the Bill was to create a monopoly. The answer must be &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The purpose of the Bill is to give statutory effect to the scheduled agreement. That is an agreement for amalgamation between four companies now carrying on industrial assurance business here.  There is, then, the further purpose of facilitating and making legal subsequent agreements between the new amalgamated company and any other company that may wish at a later stage to come within the amalgamation scheme.  There is no legal enactment of any kind designed to compel the establishment of a monopoly in industrial assurance or to prohibit companies now doing industrial assurance business from carrying on that business.  There are, of course, restrictions on the formation of new companies.  In fact, one Irish insurance company has not, as yet, agreed to take part in this amalgamation, and the inclusion within the amalgamation of any of the English companies which have been mentioned would be as a result of agreement on their part.  There is no power in this Bill or in any Act to require them to do <Col N="160" /> that.  If they do that they will do it as a result of agreement reached through negotiation.  Personally, I favour monopoly in this type of business.  I think that whatever disadvantages may arise through the absence of competition are of no consequence compared with the advantages which result from monopoly in this particular type of business.  I do not say that monopoly in other forms of insurance business or in any other business is necessarily good, but in this particular type of business experience has shown that abuses of a very grave kind follow from excessive competition or, indeed, from any competition.  The only real argument against the existence of a monopoly of industrial assurance is the danger that the monopolistic concern will not have the same inducements to go out and get new business which companies in competition have and that people who would benefit by insurance will not have the advantages of insurance brought to their notice or will not have the pressure put upon them which is now exercised in order to get them to take out insurance policies. I think that that is merely a matter of management, and that with good management, the same volume of industrial assurance business can be done here as was done in the past, or even a larger volume.  The fact that business will be done on a much better basis from the point of view of the assured, that the terms which will be offered will be better and that abuses, known by the public to be associated with industrial assurance, will be eliminated, will help to extend, rather than diminish, the volume of business done.</P>
    <P>My answer to Senator Brennan's amendment, apart from the speech he made in support of the amendment, is that the Bill gives the Minister for Finance power to sell these shares if he thinks it is good policy to do so. The amendment seeks to compel him to sell these shares under certain circumstances. While, in my opinion, it would be undesirable for the Minister for Finance to dispose of these shares in any set of circumstances that can now be foreseen, and while I think it <Col N="161" /> would be very bad national policy for him to dispose of the ownership of the B shares at all, I think we should not compel him to take one course or the other.  He must exercise his discretion in the matter.  The Minister for Finance in any Government will be only too anxious to secure repayment to the Exchequer of the amount of the State contribution and, if the circumstances the Senator visualises arose and it became possible for the Minister to dispose of his A shares for the amount of the State contribution to the funds of the terminating company, the Minister for Finance would be strongly tempted to do so.  If that circumstances did arise, I should use my in fluence to discourage him from such a sale because, unless it was clearly in the public interest that the Minister should dispose of his interest in these shares, I think he should not do so.</P>
    <P>Different considerations attach to the A and the B shares and the Senator's second amendment relates to the B shares.  It would be bad from every point of view for the Minister to dispose of his holding of B shares in any circumstances that we see at the moment or in any circumstances that we think might arise during the lifetime of the terminating company.  If the Bill were to be amended to permit of the Minister for Finance disposing of his ownership of the B shares, we should put in a large number of conditions limiting his power of disposal.  We should ensure that the Dáil and Seanad should be consulted as to whom he might dispose of these shares.  A number of other conditions of that kind would also be desirable. As the Bill stands, the Minister for Finance is not entitled to dispose of his B shares at all, and I prefer to see it that way.  When the Bill becomes an Act, it can always be amended by a subsequent Act, but that subsequent Act will have to be fully considered and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the circumstances at any time made it good policy, I am sure the Government of the day would come with such a Bill to the Oireachtas, but I do not think that the Minister should be given power to dispose of his B shares <Col N="162" /> without consulting the Oireachtas, having regard to the whole history of insurance here, and to the circumstances which made necessary this scheme for amalgamation and the provision of a substantial amount of money by the State to make good the deficiencies in existing life assurance funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Keane asked some question about the shares.  I am not quite clear as to the point on which he required information.  The nominal capital of the terminating company will be £200,010.  That would be divided into 200,000 A shares of 2/- and 100 B shares.  When I say shares of 2/- each, I ask Deputies to forget that figure, because we must put some value on these shares under the law, and that value does as well as any other. We have deliberately put a low value on the shares for the purpose of ensuring that the good-will item which must appear on the other side of the balance sheet will not be unduly large, and can be easily disposed of in the course of time out of the profits earned by the company.  These shares are merely tokens by which the equity of the company will be distributed amongst the various interests concerned.  The bulk of them will go, presumably, to the participating companies.  To the extent that they become entitled under the provisions of the agreement, they will get these shares.  The Minister for Finance will then get his shares to the extent that he has supplied cash.  In addition, he will get 5 per cent. or 100,000, whichever is the lesser, without any cash consideration at all, in return for his having financed this undertaking and acted as promoter of the company.  Furthermore, he will get all the B shares, and these B shares will carry the sole voting rights and give him complete control over the company.  It is not possible to say the extent to which the shares will be held by any one of the participating companies.  That cannot be determined until the assets and liabilities of these companies are ascertained, and the formula prescribed in the agreement prescribed in each case.  On the basis of that formula, the shares will be distributed to these companies, and <Col N="163" /> the balance will go to the Minister for Finance.</P>

I do not know how that will react on the formation of the permanent company.  The money for that company will come largely from existing prosperous insurance companies.  If they are also, indirectly through this measure, to be exempt from stamp duty, I think the Minister for Finance is doing himself a very bad turn.  I do not think it is a thing that should be done without the full knowledge of the Legislature.</P>

You are not prohibiting him from selling the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares, but in fact, you are leaving a provision in the Bill which will tie his hands considerably if ever he attempts to sell these shares.  According to the second amendment which I have proposed, he would be obliged to hold the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares so long only as he holds the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares.  He has already power to sell the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares, but if the second amendment which I have proposed were adopted you would give the Minister much more freedom with regard to the disposal of these shares.</P>

      <P>We are giving the Minister for Finance power to dispose of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares, if he thinks fit.  The Senator proposes to insert a condition in the Bill that the Minister must sell them under certain circumstances.  I do not think we should do that.  We are prohibiting him from selling the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares under any circumstances and he cannot sell these &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares without promoting fresh legislation.  I think that there should be no disposal of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares without all the circumstances being made known to the Oireachtas and without the necessary legislation being passed by the Oireachtas.  If we were to insert now a section, which would in certain circumstances give a discretion to the Minister to sell these shares, we would have to limit that discretion by imposing certain conditions on the sale.  I can see a situation arising in which members of the Dáil or Seanad would object to selling these shares to non-nationals or to some external company. That is one obvious limitation which should be imposed upon the Minister if we were to give him this discretion.  I do not think we should give him that discretion.  If at any time he should consider it desirable to sell these shares and hand over control to some external interest I think it should be necessary for him to promote a Bill and to get prior approval before he does it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will excuse me if some of the points which I raise in connection with this section have been settled already.  I was making inquiries in the House to-day before the Seanad met, but I did not have an opportunity of satisfying myself that the information which I got was correct.  My interest in this Bill is entirely on behalf of the policy-holders. First of all, I made inquiries as to the procedure to be adopted in formulating amendments on the Committee Stage and the Report Stage.  I <Col N="166" /> must confess my ignorance of the routine to be followed in submitting amendments.  I would, first of all, ask the Minister to guarantee that all policies taken over by the terminating company shall be accepted as correct. In line 25 the statement occurs &ldquo;every right and every liability of such participating company&rdquo;.  Such right and such liability will, I assume, be taken over by the terminating company. My experience is that some insurance companies sometimes refuse to pay an insured person when his policy matures or to pay the dependents or relatives of an insured person when he dies.  I was informed that that matter is covered in the 1936 Act, at least in so far as policies of six months' duration or longer were concerned. The suggestion which I had hoped to put forward in an amendment was to the effect that all policies of three years' standing should be accepted as correct by the terminating company.  I have been informed that that matter has been dealt with in the 1936 Act and, if so, it might be irrelevant to raise it now.</P>
      <P>The other point I wished to raise had reference to the question of bonuses on policies which are taken over by the terminating company.  It is unquestionable, I think, that many people took out life policies for patriotic reasons with these companies that are now entering into this agreement. They were approached many years ago, as far back as 1919 and 1920, to support Irish industries and to join Irish companies.  They took out policies with the object of supporting these Irish industries.  I am not conversant with what bonuses have been allocated by these various companies since, but I believe these bonuses are negligible.  They must be, even in the case of endowment policies.  If they had been giving bonuses, I do not suppose that this enactment would now be necessary.  I claim that these people who have paid premiums for so many years should have a primary claim on any benefits or any profits that may accrue from this amalgamation system.  So much for the question of bonuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To lend force to my argument, I may say that in the case of policies taken <Col N="167" /> out many years ago, there were legal inaccuracies or legal commitments that the policy-holder could not understand at the time.  I believe that when these policies were taken out there was no definite or proper check on age limits, for instance.  Again, I believe that has been covered in the previous Act, but I should like the Minister to enlighten me fully on the matter. There were other points, legal points in these policies, of which the holder was entirely unaware.  I might just mention the fact that, to my amazement, quite recently I got a demand for £5 from a company which is in liquidation.  That demand was by reason of the fact that I held a policy, the premium on which was something like 6/- or 7/- in the company.  All my insurance is laid with Irish companies, but in this case I did not insure directly with the company. The insurance was effected through the agency of a company with which I was insured.  I give that information to the House as proof of the fact that in these policies of some years' standing there may be some commitment under which the terminating company can claim the right to say to the policy-holder: &ldquo;We will not pay you because such-and-such a thing is inaccurate.&rdquo;  Or, again, you may have the legal representative of deceased persons being told: &ldquo;Well, this policy is inaccurate and the amount cannot be paid.&rdquo;  I just wish to raise these points to demonstrate the fact that there may be inaccuracies in these policies which may be used afterwards to the detriment of policy-holders.  I have given an instance in which I myself was concerned to show that that can happen.  I certainly did not know that I was a member of that company by the fact that I was insured through the agency of another company or that I was under an obligation to pay £5 by the fact of having taken out a 6/- or 7/- policy with the company.  My only point in referring to these matters is to ensure that policy-holders will be safeguarded to the fullest extent.  I accept the assurance that the Government has introduced this Bill in the interests of policy-holders.  I should like the Minister <Col N="168" /> to assure me that the points I have raised are completely covered, or that if they are not, they will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that if the demands of the last Senator were granted in their entirely a very dangerous precedent might arise.  We are all liable to undertake obligations of which we are not fully aware, but we have to stand up to them all the same, and if certain policy-holders undertake legal obligations of which they were not aware, surely they should be liable the same as anybody else.  To put it another way, why should the State come to the relief of a special section of debtors in the community?  There may be specific cases where the State might come to their assistance, such as lapsed policies or injustices of that kind, but if I understood Senator O'Donovan correctly his argument would cover a policy-holder against a wrong statement in a proposal form which, as everybody knows, is part of the contract.  If a person proposing insurance gives a wrong date or age it is tantamount almost to a criminal offence, and I do not think the State should come in any way to such a person's assistance.  It would create a most embarassing situation, and I hope the Government will safeguard themselves to the extent to which they indemnify policy-holders against their legal obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the policy-holder who is in any way the debtor, but the insurance company.  So far as inaccuracies in a life policy which is in existence for a number of years are concerned, the only question can be one of age, and the liability of the State in taking over such a policy would, I maintain, be negligible.  I know perfectly well that birth certificates were not sought when policies were taken out at that time, and it would be very hard on the individual concerned or his dependents after his death if the insurance company could say: &ldquo;You said you were 25 or 40 when, in reality, you were 30 or 50,&rdquo; and so invalidate the policy.  When a company has accepted premiums over a number of years that would be a hardship, even if the holder had made <Col N="169" /> an inaccurate statement.  I do not think it is even correct to speak of the policy-holder making an inaccurate statement, because in many cases the agent was so keen on getting business that he accepted the age without confirmation, so that the policy-holder is not the prime offender in respect of the statement of a wrong age.  Cases have been heard by the courts in which relatives of deceased policy-holders found difficulty in getting money accruing from the maturing of a policy.  This entire discussion is irrelevant if all this has been covered by the 1936 Act, but I ask the Minister to assure me that that is so.  If it is my point is met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case under the 1936 Act I think there should be an amendment in this Bill, or in some other Bill, to put it right, because it means that the State is going to accept responsibility for a wrong statement with regard to age. A person who said he was 25 when he was 40 paid a much smaller annual premium, and if the State is going to make up that deficiency I think it would be outrageous.  I have no other word for it, and I could not support such a proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggested was a difference of a few years.  Confirmation of age in many of these cases was not sought by the company.  They are not quite as anxious about accuracy in the country as the Senator or I might be, but when a birth certificate was not demanded and when a person has been paying premiums for so long, the State should not victimise either that individual, or his dependents, when the policy has matured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All this seems to be a very faint echo of the discussions we had in 1936.  We passed an Act in that year which was designed to lay down the condition under which industrial assurance should be carried on in future.  We dealt with all these <Col N="170" /> things as they applied to the future. Clearly, we could not go back and validate invalid policies in the past, or invalidate what were legal policies. We did set out to deal with the future and we said that, in future, all industrial assurance policies must be issued subject to the terms we passed then. We dealt with this question of age then, but we could not go back, as Senator O'Donovan would like us to do, and deal with all the existing policies on the assumption that they had been issued on conditions such as those contained in the 1936 Act, when everybody knew that they had not.  In the future, on the question of age, for example, the age of insured persons will be deemed to be agreed.  It will be deemed to be the age stated in the proposal.  The insurance company can question the accuracy of the insured person's statement of age when he is applying for the policy, or within a limited period thereafter; but once the policy is issued with the age stated in it, the age cannot be questioned at the time the claim arises.  It can be questioned now and that is one of the abuses which the 1936 Act was designed to deal with, because even though it was not an uncommon practice for persons to attempt frauds on companies by mis-stating their ages, neither was it altogether an uncommon practice for agents to induce persons to mis-state their age with a view to giving grounds for contesting the claim when a claim did eventuate.  That was dealt with so far as this country is concerned in 1936, and in Great Britain, earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the 1936 Act is concerned, it will apply in the future.  That particular section has not yet been brought into operation, but it will be when this new company comes into being.  The provisions of that Act in relation to all those matters will apply to the policies of the new company. So far, however, as the policies now being taken over from the amalgamating companies are concerned, these policies, in so far as they are legal policies, will be met in full.  In so far as they are illegal, and could be illegal on many other grounds than mis-statement of the age of the insured person, they could not be accepted.  I do not think I can say more to the Senator <Col N="171" /> than that the policies will be taken over and the obligations of the new company will be as stated in the policy, or in the law under which these policies were issued.  The extent to which the law may have been defective when these policies were issued cannot be remedied now.  It can only be remedied in respect of the future, and that has been done in the 1936 Act; but so far as any of the policies transferred prove on examination to be invalid, then invalid they must be.</P>

      <P>Then, my information is absolutely incorrect.  I still maintain that there is a point for the Minister to consider.  If a policy is accepted by one of these participating companies, the only question that can arise in regard to it is a question of age.  The question of disease can scarcely arise.  It might arise in respect of an industrial policy, but in life policies, I think the main factor is the question of age.</P>

      <P>I am referring to an individual who takes out a policy on his own life.  Take the case of a man who, 20 years ago, took out a policy on his life.  The agent, being what I might term aggressive in trying to secure a client, says to him: &ldquo;We are an Irish company just starting and we want as many people as we can.&rdquo; I distinctly remember canvassing of that kind and the cases have been heard in the courts since.  I should not like to see the terminating company proceeding afterwards to invalidate such a policy which has been in existence since 1918, 1919 and 1920, <Col N="172" /> because of a year, or even two years' inaccuracy.  I maintain that farmers, who at that time took out policies, when asked their age, did not say that they were such and such an age on such and such a day of such a year. They gave their age roughly, and it was so accepted by the company.  I maintain that those policies should be taken over as correct, or investigated when being taken over, and, if necessary, corrected, so that a position would not arise when, after paying hundreds of pounds to an insurance company, the policy-holder or his next of kin would be told that the policy was invalid and nothing was payable. I think the section requires looking into to see that a satisfactory settlement would be made under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is in error when he says that such a policy-holder would get nothing.  He would get what he was entitled to.  If a person takes out a policy, and if 2d. a week brought him £10, he would get £7 if that was what he was entitled to in relation to his correct age.  That is the proper legal position.  The Senator says that the farmer does not know his age, but I can say that he always knew it on the right side, so far as insurance is concerned.  He also says that insurance agents induced people to state their ages as being lower than they were.  That may have been done so far as the Irish societies, when they came into operation, were concerned. It was done, and done with a view to getting insurance from other societies. I do not blame them, but the respectable insurance agents and the profession as a whole would do nothing of the kind.  The man who goes into insurance business and desires to make his living at it, wants a clean business, and he can only do a clean business by getting people to insure at their correct ages, so that when death takes place the claim will be met.  That is the best advertisement an insurance office can have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the 1936 Act is concerned, the Senator said that it made all insurance legal.  That is not so.  It only makes the question of age right.  There can be 101 other things wrong with a policy, such as want of outside relationship, <Col N="173" /> or even disease.  A man might insure himself, or a friend, who, at the time, was suffering from a severe disease, and that would invalidate the policy, but the 1936 Act does clear the matter of age up, and I think the Senator need have no misgivings on the point.  I think the 1936 Act has done a lot to clean up the business generally, and the Minister is entitled to every-body's gratitude for having put things right.  We were not, however, the land of saints and scholars here, so far as insurance is concerned, that we thought we were.</P>
    <P>The very fact that all the Irish insurance companies are in such a deplorable condition to-day is due to the fact that they have given better value than they should have for what they received.  I believe that this amalgamation scheme will put matters right. I would like to warn the Minister that in this he is travelling on a road that has many pitfalls.  He will need to be careful because the road of insurance is a thorny and a difficult one.  I hope that his advisers will put him on the right road, and that the new company will do business according to business principles, and only give value for money.  The companies which are amalgamating under this scheme had, unfortunately, many men on their salary staff who probably did not give value for money.  Unfortunately, they could not do otherwise than they did, and they are not to be blamed.  As one who has been engaged in the insurance business all his life, and has made some success of it, I hope that the new company will do well.  I am confident that, if properly managed, it should do well.</P>

      <P>On this section, I desire to take this opportunity of getting my mind clarified as to the relation between the terminating company and the permanent company.  The terminating company has power, I understand, to promote a permanent company.  That is clear as far as it goes.  Can the Minister give any indication as to what form that promotion will take?  He has mentioned that a certain number of existing companies will come in.  They will bring in certain assets and will get certain shares. That is clear.  It is straightforward practice.  If the terminating company promotes a permanent company, what will it bring in?  It cannot bring in the terminating company's assets, because they are all earmarked for the benefit of the policy holders of the terminating company.  Later on, when the terminating company is wound up, I suppose then those assets will be available for the permanent company, <Col N="175" /> but until that situation arises, what will be the extent of the participation of the terminating company in the proposed permanent company</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator misunderstands the position somewhat. The four companies that are parties to this agreement will be amalgamated in what we are calling the terminating company.  Any other company that comes into the amalgamation will come into the terminating company and not the permanent company. They are amalgamated in this Industrial Insurance Amalgamation, Limited.  It is that company&mdash;the terminating company&mdash;which promotes the permanent company.  It is the terminating company which will own all the shares of the permanent company. There will be no other person with a share in the equity of the permanent company except the terminating company until, of course, the terminating company is liquidated and its assets, including the shares in the permanent company, are distributed amongst its shareholders.  The Senator will appreciate the position if he realises that all the companies which come into the amalgamation come into the terminating company. The terminating company will be the sole owner of the shares of the permanent company.  None of the companies participating in the amalgamation will have anything to do with the permanent company.  Their assets and liabilities will be transferred to the terminating company.</P>

On the basis of valuation set out in the agreement, it will have to transfer assets fully equivalent to the liabilities that <Col N="176" /> it is transferring.  These assets will take the form of funds and of cash paid into the coffers of the terminating company.  The four companies that have signed the agreement will, so far as they can, transfer assets equivalent to their liabilities, and to the extent that they are unable to do so the deficiency will be made good from the State contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation dealing with the stabilisation of butter prices was first introduced in 1933.  An amending Act was passed in 1935.  As a result of our experience of the administration of those Acts, I think it can be said that, as far as the creamery industry is concerned, there was general satisfaction, and that the legislation fulfilled its purpose.  But with regard to non-creamery butter, it was difficult to administer and much more costly, in proportion, than the administration of the creamery industry.  The collection of levies on non-creamery butter was suspended on 1st January, 1937.  The suspension of the levies renders the registration of dealers in non-creamery butter unnecessary.  Part II of the Principal Act makes it mandatory on the Minister to keep registers of dealers in non-creamery butter, and makes it an offence for persons to carry on business unless they are so registered.</P>
      <P>Paragraphs (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the principal Act relate to the payment of levies by producers and distributors of non-creamery butter.  The purpose of Sections 2 and 3 of the present Bill is to enable the Minister to suspend the operation of this provision of the Principal Act as and when he considers it desirable. It will be noted that the power of suspension is made retrospective.  It is intended to have the suspension made operative back to the 1st January, 1937.  I would like to say that this is a matter that was raised in the other House and that possibly may be raised by Senators&mdash;the power given to the Minister to suspend certain parts of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that under the Principal Act the Minister has power to suspend the collection of levies, which was a very important <Col N="178" /> matter, and all that is asked under this Bill is that he should also have power to suspend the keeping of a register when these levies are not being collected.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill deals with collection of levies and specifies the classes of those from whom these levies can be collected.  In the case of creamery butter, the levy is collected from the creamery.  In the case of non-creamery butter, it is collected only from certain classes, that is persons registered in the register of butter manufacturers or non-manufacturing exporters, or, in the register of dealers in non-creamery butter, provided for by Part II of the Principal Act.  This latter register, as I have already mentioned, is not being kept since the 1st January, 1937, and it is not intended that it should be kept.  The fact that levy was only collectable from certain specified persons made it difficult at times to get what I believed we should get, when there was a change of price.</P>
    <P>For instance, if butter is put up in price&mdash;on the 1st May we put butter up by twopence a lb.&mdash;we could collect a levy of the same amount from non-manufacturing exporters and from butter factories if they happened to have butter on hands, but we could not collect from wholesalers and retailers who might possibly have large quantities of butter on hands.  Owing to the fact that we could not collect levies, a very big profit was made by people who had these heavy stocks.  We want the power to collect in future from those carrying big stocks of butter when there is a change in price.  The levy would go into the butter stabilisation fund and would be placed there for the benefit of producers in general.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with certificates of registration.  Power was taken under the Principal Act to give any person a certificate of registration if he so desired, but that was never availed of and as there is no likelihood that it ever will be availed of, the section is being dropped.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the payment of levies on cream.  Where a person pays a levy on cream and sells it to another person, under the present legislation it would appear we would have to collect <Col N="179" /> a levy from both people, and where it might afterwards be converted into butter it appears we might have to collect also.  This Section 6 is to make that right and to say that only one levy is collectable and that the cream can be sold to another person afterwards even though there would not be a levy collected afterwards.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the amendment of a levy order.  We have, in the past, felt that it would be convenient if we reduced a levy during a levy period, that is, retrospectively.  It is rather a difficult problem to forecast what the export market for butter will be like in advance, but, in order to make this stabilised price for butter, we have to make the best forecast we can.  We arrange what the levy collectable on butter sold at home should be and we arrange what the bounty should be on butter exported.  If we are wrong in our calculations and if butter goes lower than we had thought, we must put up with that and try to make it right in the next levy period, but, if butter increases in price on the export market, we feel we should be in a position to give the benefit of that increase to the producer.  We have no such power at present and we are asking for power to make orders reducing the levy and, therefore, collecting less than we had anticipated.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9 and 10 deal with butter coming in to the country.  We have not much butter coming in but on a few occasions we had to import butter towards the end of the season.  We regard the butter season as running from the 1st April to 31st March. Sometimes in the month of March in the past two years we had to import a certain amount of butter.  We have not allowed importers to bring in that butter and sell it at prices at home which would bring them a big profit, so that in order to allow whatever profit we can, we take a levy off the butter coming in and the proceeds are brought into this stabilisation fund. Again, we have to forecast there.  The power I am asking for in this Bill is that we should be allowed to reduce that levy afterwards.  The way that will operate will probably be something <Col N="180" /> like this: We give a permit to a person to bring in butter.  We have no idea how the market may go in the month of March, as we have to give the permits at the beginning of the month. We put on a fairly high levy, say, 60/-, knowing it is far too high, but, when we come to collect the levy at the end of the month we know what the price was coming in and the price at the time the allowance was made, so we then reduce the levy to what we think would be a fair amount.</P>
    <P>In that way we get what is fair, and at the same time we allow the importer an ordinary profit.  Just like Section 7, where power is sought to reduce a levy retrospectively, we want the same power under Section 11, reciprocal power, if you like.  We want power to increase retrospectively a bounty at the end of the levy period.  As I said already, we fix the bounty and the levy on a forecast of what conditions in the foreign market are likely to be.  We find that, perhaps, we have got more from the levy than we expected, and we may find that at the end of the period we have more money than we anticipated and that we could afford to pay out more; therefore we are asking for power to pay out a higher bounty than we had announced, but not for power to pay less.  We are giving the benefit, in other words, to the producer, and we are not asking for power to reduce the bounty.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with offences regarding minimum prices.  Hitherto only the seller was guilty of an offence. I think it only reasonable that the buyer should be considered guilty of an offence also.  Frequently he is often more wealthy.  The buyer is often a man with means, and he tempts the poorer creamery with ready cash and induces that creamery to sell to him below the fixed minimum price.  Up to this, the creamery could be fined for committing an offence like that, but we could not do anything against the purchaser. This Bill will enable us to do it.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with a small omission in a section of the Principal Act which makes it an offence to give false information as well as an offence not to give information at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> I have dealt with this Bill section by section because it is a Bill by reference and there is no underlying principle. It deals with a number of matters, and that is why I have gone through it section by section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. J.G. Douglas Mr. J.G. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.G. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one section to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  I am not an expert in dairy produce; I know very little about it, but Section 2, sub-section (4) is of a misleading character. If you examine it carefully by looking up the Interpretation Act, you will find that it does not really do what it appears to do on the surface.  It appears to give the Minister power to repeal an Act of the Oireachtas. Actually, it provides that when there is an Order regarding certain suspendible provisions it will have the effect as though they were repealed while that order was in force.  That is for the purpose of connecting it with Section 21 of the Interpretation Act.</P>
      <P>Several people drew my attention to this section, believing that it was giving the Minister power to do what only the Oireachtas can do.  When I examined it, I found it was simply a matter of the lazy drafting that we have had sometimes.  I want to say that it may be in the interests of the legal profession, but that it makes it very difficult for the ordinary person to read the Bill and understand it, when Section 21, sub-sections (1) and (2), which are comparatively short, are not also set out.  They provide that when an Act is repealed you will still be able to deal with certain things up to the date of repeal.  Instead of doing that, we refer back to an Act, which makes it bewildering to an ordinary member of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions I have drawn attention to this habit of referring back to other Acts, even when it would be quite simple&mdash;a matter of only 20 or 30 lines or so&mdash;to print the relevant provisions in relation to the new provisions. I intended to move an amend ment in the Committee Stage and, if there is time, I probably will, to insert a provision of that nature instead of the Section as it stands.  I suppose it is not very important, but I would urge that that kind of drafting gives <Col N="182" /> a wrong impression, and certainly four or five people, including one prominent person, drew attention to this, thinking that the Minister was now taking power to repeal.  Instead, the Minister is taking power to say that, for certain purposes, an Order will have the same effect as if it were repealed&mdash;rather a careless form of drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. P.F. Baxter Mr. P.F. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not, I take it, going to be any objection to the Minister getting the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is, indeed, a very strange sort of measure and, on the whole, it is giving the Minister powers of a kind which perhaps some people feel ought not to be given to him. But, as far as the Minister has exercised his powers in his relationship to the dairying industry, he is certainly looked upon as a benevolent dictator, although it is true that the dairying industry, as a whole, has thought at various periods that the Minister ought to have done more, and that there was a necessity to do more for it, than has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it has been conceded to the Minister that he has done much, and had he not pursued the policy which he has been pursuing, the conditions of the dairy farmers would be much worse than they have been. They are very far from being ideal, and there is no use in pretending here that the return to the dairy farmer for his milk this year, last year, or over a number of years, has been anything like adequate.  It is somewhat better this year than last year, but still there are other considerations, as far as the dairy farmer is concerned, that have been responsible, in fact, for depreciating prices this year to a level just as low as last year.  On the other hand, I believe that the costs have outweighed any increase given to him. Nevertheless, the dairy farmers generally realise that, although it is undesirable to give powers like this to the Minister, the industry is passing through such a difficult period that there is no alternative but to give the Minister the measure which will be as flexible as is necessary to protect the interests of the producers and, at the same time, give reasonable safeguards <Col N="183" /> to the consumers at home.  For that reason there is not going to be any exception taken to what the Minister is asking the right to do in these various sections in the amendment of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>There is a point, however, that has been brought to the notice of the Minister before&mdash;it is an important point in certain dairying districts&mdash;and that is the position of the farmers who have tried to go in for a bit of winter dairying.  Neither the Minister nor anyone else who has any acquaintance with the conditions will pretend that you can produce milk in winter at anything like the same price as in the summer months or in the harvest. There are farmers in certain districts who make an effort to do a bit of winter dairying.  I am convinced that we will never put our dairying industry on the plane where it must be if it is to compete successfully with the Danes unless we can go in for winter dairying to a much greater extent than we have attempted up to the present.  We must realise that you cannot feed cattle in the house, with the labour entailed and the cost of foodstuffs, at the price at which you can do it during the summer or harvest.</P>
    <P>A week ago a plea was made here for the stall-feeding industry.  It was argued&mdash;and rightly so, I believe&mdash;that to encourage stall-feeding was to encourage tillage, and, further, that it would give additional employment around the farmstead during the winter; that you were going to make manures and all that which are very necessary in mixed farming.  Winter dairying will do exactly the same thing.  But you will not get milk from your cows to-day merely by going out and feeding them in the morning.  You must feed them the month before and the month before that.  It is time for the Administration to face up to that problem.  I know it can be argued that it is going to cost a great deal of money.  It is true that at present in certain of our Northern districts winter dairying is being carried on&mdash;small farmers are doing it.  I am convinced that they are not being adequately repaid for what they are putting into it. <Col N="184" /> I, therefore, make a plea for these districts.  They are really the poorest dairying districts in the country.  The Minister ought to make an effort to give some added compensation for the extra food and labour entailed in winter dairying.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity to argue this at any length.  The Minister must get this Bill.  There is no opposition to it here and there is no opposition to it in the country.  The Minister's efforts are appreciated by the dairy farmers. While saying that, it is well that the House should understand that the dairying industry, for those who have their milk manufactured at creameries, is not giving to the farmers anything like an adequate return.  The added costs of labour this year, due to legislation which we cannot go into now, have made difficulties for the dairying farmers with which they were not confronted before.  I put it to the Minister that, in the interests of dairying in the poorer districts, he ought to consider making concessions to them out of this fund.  If the money be not available from this fund, the Exchequer should find the necessary money to keep these people in winter dairying. I believe others would be encouraged to go into winter dairying too.  I am convinced that our dairy farmers everywhere must go into it before our dairy products on the British market will get back to the position they once occupied there.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the importation of butter during the winter months.  I am sure the Minister is aware that we produce butter in May, June and July second to none in the world.  He has quite a number of inspectors going around the country and why not have a sufficient quantity of this butter made in May, June and July and cold-stored to meet the requirements of the consumers in this country?  I think there should be no difficulty in having that done.  We are aware that in May, June and July the price of butter is at its lowest level in this country.  For that reason, if the butter was cold-stored and a sufficient price got for it, it would, to a great extent, tide over the lean months of the year.</P>

      <Col N="185" /> I agree with what has been said by the last speaker with regard to winter dairying.  Unless some encouragement is given to the feeding of cattle and the production of food, I do not think there is any hope for winter dairying in the greater part of the country. I hope that the Minister will give due consideration to the views of dairying farmers in this House and that he will see his way in the coming season to assist the dairy farmers as far as possible.</P>

      <P>As Senator Baxter has raised the question, I should like to impress on the Minister that if we are to increase our butter production we must have winter dairying.  We must also almost double the amount of milk produced by our cows.  The Minister should do something to increase the amount of milk given by our cows. Out of a total of 1,500,000 cows in this country, we have only 48,000 in our cow-testing associations, and the number has been practically the same for the last 20 years.  Something should be done to increase the number of cows in the cow-testing associations. The average yield of milk per cow over the whole country is 450 gallons, while inside the cow-testing associations the thousand-gallon cow is common.  Inside the cow-testing associations the average yield per cow would be, roughly, 600 gallons.  Therefore, if you want to have winter dairying a practical proposition, something must be done in that matter.  I do not like to say that there should be compulsion, but the Department of Agriculture could do a great deal by means of education and propaganda.  We should really have 750,000 cows, or half the number in the country, tested and the low yielders eliminated.  It is only then that we can talk about winter dairying as a practical proposition.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to enter into a general discussion of rural economy.  I am not going to have the first encounter with the Minister in the new Seanad.  I am afraid I sometimes rather rubbed him up the wrong way in the past.  The Minister, I notice, made a very interesting statement <Col N="186" /> in the Dáil.  He said that a Government did business better than private people.  I hope I have not taken him up wrong.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is an indication of doing business, the business is getting more and more complicated, and I admit the Government does business.  The Government is working in the best way to carry on, inasmuch as you are patching and stopping leaks and adapting yourselves to new discover ies.  The whole of our code for agricultural control is one mass of regu lations.  You have only to look at the number of regulations on the Order Paper when the Seanad meets.  I think there were 28 Agricultural Produce Orders or it may be 28 Industry and Commerce Orders.  The whole thing is complicated by regulations. Will the Minister consider getting away from that sort of thing? Will he, at least, admit that it is most undesirable?  The farmer, instead of being benefited, is suffering tremendously.  Might I suggest to the Minister that he wants perhaps a different outlook on the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see by to-day's papers where, in Germany, Dr. Schacht comments on this.  He says that they are paying a heavy price for it and that he thoroughly sympathises with the exporter who has to fill up 40 forms before he can do business.  We are almost in that position to-day.  We cannot do any business without filling up forms.  The Minister tells us that it is for all our good that we should do so.  Dr. Schacht at least holds out the hope to the people of Germany that, before long they will be able to free business from all this intolerable burden of control and get back to a certain degree of liberty of action. Following along that line, will the Minister consider whether these benefits which he claims to have given to agriculture should not be given in a much simpler and satisfying way. Agriculture has to be helped.  Instead of all these regulations could he not go back to something like further relief from the burden of rates and even of annuities?  If you give benefits in that way, you get rid of a <Col N="187" /> host of officials and a whole code of complicated laws.  I would ask whether the Minister is any way thinking along these lines&mdash;of getting rid of all these regulations and of this control, and getting back to simpler and more direct benefits which all will benefit by, which will be readily understood, and more simply administered.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if he has noticed the figures recently given in the Milk Bill in England for the cost of milk production.  There the cost of milk production is in the region of from 9d. to 10d. per gallon.  I do not know if the Minister has any expert costings to confirm these figures.  If he has, we should like to know what they are; because, on the basis on which the farmers are now paid for milk, there must be something very beneficial in the form of production here which enables them to exist at all with the price they are getting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to take any part in this debate, but I should like to re-echo the sentiment of the last speaker, who pleaded for a simpler programme of legislation and regulation dealing with this whole matter.  I am so overwhelmed by the complicated legislation affecting the butter business that I have delayed and postponed indefinitely the task of attempting to understand it.  Perhaps my task would be rendered completely unnecessary if the Minister would accept the advice of Senator Sir John Keane and hasten the day when we shall get back to a simpler commerce in butter.  To a certain extent, I suppose, we were committed by the policy of the last few years, which all Parties in the Oireachtas seem to have supported, to pay something very special, at the expense of the taxpayer and the consumer, to enable the dairying industry to obtain a higher price for its products than would have been possible in the conditions of commerce that existed during those years.  We may as well realise that, in doing that, we, as consumers and taxpayers, have, in fact, been helping to pay part of John Bull's butter bill&mdash;a very Christian act <Col N="188" /> of altruism on our part for which we should, I think, obtain high marks.  I do not know whether it is the permanent policy of the nation that we should continue indefinitely to pay our neighbours for buying our produce but, as an economist, I should welcome the day when our neighbours would pay the whole cost of the produce we think it worth our while to send them.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this butter legislation is that, under it, a fixed price is maintained for the produce of the creameries.  The price may not fall below a certain figure and, in this Bill, a penalty is not only imposed on the seller below that minimum but on the person who buys below that minimum. I should like to know how that fixed price&mdash;which, presumably, applies to the products of all creameries&mdash;reacts on the efficiency of the creameries.  If the inefficient creamery is going to get the same fixed price for butter as the efficient creamery, why trouble to improve in efficiency?  I should like to have some assurance from the Minister that this phenomenon of fixed price is not tending to undermine the efficiency with which butter is produced in some of our creameries.</P>
      <P>I sympathise profoundly with the remarks made by Senator Baxter about the desirability of promoting winter dairying.  If we must have levies on taxpayers and consumers and interference with the ordinary course of commerce, I should gladly sweep away all payment in respect of butter produced or exported during the summer months and concentrate on payment for butter produced, whether exported or not, during the winter months.  In that way we should be giving a very definite fillip to the development of winter dairying in every part of the country, both north and south.  I think that the future of tillage and the efficiency in farming, generally, is closely related to this desirable policy &mdash;the development of winter dairying. As every farmer knows, we cannot have winter dairying without tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctor Kennedy, of the I.A.O.S., has been a propagandist of the necessity for improving in every way the efficiency of our dairying industry.  I see that he points out in a recent <Col N="189" /> pamphlet that our milk production is only 420 gallons per cow as against 700 to 750 gallons per cow in Holland, Denmark and New Zealand.  He says that the chief reason for that disgracefully low average output is that our farmers are in the habit of starving their cows in the winter.  If the State must have an economic policy, by all means have one which rewards the farmer for feeding his cows in the winter time.  If we could develop some policy of winter dairying, even at the expense of the taxpayer, I think we would do a great deal to ensure the proper feeding of cows in the winter as well as in the summer.  In the summer they feed on the grass which nature provides, but in winter, if the cows are milking, the chances are that they will be fed, whereas, if they are dry, the temptation to starve them is irresistible.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas raised a question with regard to sub-section (4) of Section 2.  The drafting may appear somewhat drastic, but the powers given in this sub-section are not in any way different from the powers given in many other Bills.  In many Acts, the Minister is given power to suspend the operations of an Act under certain conditions and in certain eventualities. Under the Principal Act the Minister was given power to suspend the collection of levies or the payment of bounties at certain times.  What is asked here is very small compared with that&mdash;that is, that I should have power to suspend the keeping of a register where no levies are being collected from a certain class.  The thing looks, perhaps, much worse than it is.  It deals with a very small matter.  The principle may be objectionable, but it is being applied to a very small matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter spoke of the price. I am quite prepared to agree with any Senator who says the price is not adequate.  It is not as high as we should all like it to be, but it is a great improvement on the price of former years.  It will, I think, be found that for the present year&mdash;1st April, 1938, to 31st March, 1939&mdash;the average price paid by the creameries will work out at about 5½d. per gallon, with the skimmed milk going back.  A few years ago, demands were being <Col N="190" /> made in both Houses that we should try to bring the price up to 5d. per gallon.  Perhaps the farmers would like to get more than they visualised at that time, but the price is now much better than they thought of at that time.  Our butter is not on the British market to any great extent now, but the best Australian commands about 98/- there, while the price our creameries are getting for their butter is 135/-.  That is a considerable addition to what might be regarded as the world price.</P>
    <P>Senator McCabe says that the price of butter is at its lowest in May, June and July.  Generally speaking, that is true, but, this year, the reverse appears to be the case.  During May, June and July of this year, butter was 114/-. Now it is 98/-.  We did store a lot of butter in May, June and July, according to the advice now given by Senator McCabe.  It might now be held that if we had stored less and sold more of it at that time, we would have done better.  Taking the last few years, however, Senator McCabe is right in his contention.  Butter was stored in the summer, and we imported some at the end of the season.  We did not import very much&mdash;4,000 or 5,000 cwts. &mdash;less than a week's total supply.  We think it will not be necessary to import any during the present winter.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of yield.  We all admit that the yield of our cows is very low.  We believe that if we could get our farmers into milk-testing societies something would be achieved, because they would see demonstrated the yields of the bad cows and the good cows.  I never knew a farmer who went into a milk-testing society who knew beforehand which cow was best and which was worst.  He is always completely mistaken until he gets his cows tested.  But it is extremely difficult to get farmers into milk-testing societies.  About three years ago we lightened the burden of farmer-members by paying more from State funds for their membership.  That, however, did not improve matters very much.  The membership may increase now if farmers see that better prices will be realised than they were getting then.</P>
    <P>As regards the general remarks of <Col N="191" /> Sir John Keane, I did say in the Dáil, when challenged, that the Government did business as well as, or perhaps better than, private enterprise.  I had in mind the creameries run by the Dairy Disposals Board under Government auspices.  They are run very well, they are paying a good price, and are giving great satisfaction.  They are being run as well as private enterprise could run them.  That may not be an argument that everything should be taken over by the Government, but it is an argument against the plea that the Government should not do anything of this nature.  What we are doing may be empirical, but it must be remembered that we must bring in Bills and try to foresee all the things that are likely to arise.  If we do not foresee those things we have to bring in another Bill.  A business man has not to do this.  As things arise he meets them.  He meets them in his own office.  He has not to come to the Seanad and tell them of his difficulties. We have to do that, and we have to bring in amending Bills, so that it is not fair to compare our position in that regard with that of the business man.  We should be wonderful business men in the Government if we could foresee everything, and a private business man would be a wonderful man if he could go away for 20 years, telling his manager not to make a single change in his absence and yet expecting him to make profits in the meantime.  It would be unfair to put that burden on the manager.  Yet that is what is expected of the Government when they are told that they, having brought in a Bill, should not bring in an amending Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should not interfere much with exporters, but we believe we are interfering with them to their benefit&mdash;to give them subsidies.  If we did not interfere with them they would get 114/- most of the year for their butter and 98/- at present.  We interfere to give them 135/- instead of 98/-.  I admit that our legislation looks terribly complicated, but the producer is not very much troubled about legislation. He knows that he is going to get 135/-.  The consumer knows what he <Col N="192" /> is going to pay for his butter.  Changes are made very infrequently, and I believe that anybody who examines the matter will find that in the case of no commodity on the market does the producer or the consumer get such good value.  The &ldquo;spread&rdquo; between what the producer gets and what the consumer pays is very small.  Wholesaler and retailer get what we regard as a fair profit, but they do not get an exorbitant profit.  The consumer gets very good value, considering what the producer gets.  In that way the producer and the consumer know where they stand, and are not bothered by this legislation.  The legislation is rather involved because it is difficult to deal with some people.  They are able to get round some things, and it is necessary to bring in amending Bills to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about subsidies, in general, for agriculture, there may be a lot in what Senator Sir John Keane said&mdash;that it would be much simpler to reduce costs of production generally&mdash;rates and annuities&mdash;and let things take their course.  Yet, I think a case can be made for a specific subsidy for the dairying industry.  I am afraid that, if we were to drop subsidies altogether and reduce rates and annuities, the people would change from dairying into some other form of agriculture because, comparatively speaking, they would not do as well at world prices by producing butter as they would in other branches of agriculture. I think that a case can, therefore, be made for specific help for the dairying industry, whatever we might think of subsidies in general.</P>
    <P>I cannot answer Senator Sir John Keane as to the cost of milk production in this country.  It is very difficult to get costings in agriculture.  Roughly speaking, we have to take the test that, when we are increasing production, the producer is doing well and, when we are going down in production, we have to take it that the product is not paying.  If there is an increase, we take it that it is paying.  That is about the only rough test I can think of, and it is perhaps the most satisfactory test, too.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> Senator Johnston makes a plea for simple legislation, but again I do not think the people concerned are very much troubled about complicated legislation. It is, I admit, rather unfair to members of the Seanad to have an academic Bill like this done altogether by reference, but that is a thing I am afraid I cannot help.  I should like very much if the draftsmen had time to have a Bill of this kind drafted in a more simple way&mdash;in fact to repeal all previous Dairy Produce Acts or Dairy Price Stabilisation Acts, to bring in a new comprehensive Bill, and to place the whole matter before the Dáil and Seanad.  I think it is a matter of time in the draftsman's office more than anything else.</P>
    <P>The argument is advanced at times: &ldquo;Why should we pay part of John Bull's butter bill?&rdquo; I could never be quite clear on that question myself, but I do suggest that if we were to say to John Bull: &ldquo;We do not intend to pay part of your butter bill any longer,&rdquo; and if we still wanted a good price for our butter, I think John Bull could say: &ldquo;We do not want your butter; we can get plenty of butter from New Zealand, Australia and Denmark, and we can do quite well without any of your butter.&rdquo;  It is a choice of subsidising our exports to Great Britain and of supporting them on the home market by getting our consumers to pay more than the world price, or of facing a very big decline indeed in the dairying industry.  Therefore, it is a matter of academic interest whether we are paying part of John Bull's butter bill or not.  We are accused of being altruistic.  I suppose, if we are subsidising exports to John Bull, it is as well to take the credit for doing it, rather than say that we are doing it because we cannot help it, which is nearer the truth.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Senator Johnston that the inefficient creamery does not always get away with inefficiency. On the home market, it is true, there is a minimum price fixed, but the efficient creameries can demand a little more if they like, and sometimes they get a little more, but where the difference does come in is on the export market.  When we pay a subsidy on <Col N="194" /> butter exports, we take an average of the best sellers, and we cut out those at the very end.  We take the best sellers, and we pay the subsidy on the average, so that in fact the best seller gets more than the minimum price and the bad seller gets a shilling or two less.  In that way the efficient creamery gets more for its butter than the inefficient creamery.</P>
    <P>A case might be made for pooling all the benefits and putting them on winter production.  That is a very big question.  I am afraid that although it might look a fair thing to do and a good thing to do, we would have a very big decline in the principal dairying districts if we were to follow that course. I do not believe that any inducement, unless it were some ridiculous one in the way of price, would get the Limerick farmers to go in for winter production. If the Limerick farmers, however, are not getting an adequate price for summer-produced butter, they will go out of production, to some extent anyway.  We would inevitably, I am afraid, have a decline in dairying production, if we were not to give some subsidy, at least at present prices, on summer production.</P>
    <P>I hope when this Bill is through to be able to do more for winter production this year.  That is one of the reasons why I am anxious to get the Bill through.  I intend to ask the Seanad to facilitate me in getting this Bill through quickly because the time is at hand when we should be making the winter price if we can.  That winter price can be made by giving a subsidy on production or by reducing the levy.  There is only a levy of a shilling now and to reduce that would not be any great advantage.  On the other hand, we could increase the price of butter to the retailer.  Whatever we do, it will be necessary to have this Bill passed quickly if we are to prevent profiteering by certain wholesalers and retailers who hold rather large stocks. I should not like to make any change until this Bill is through but I do intend to try to do something more for winter production, as soon as we have this legislation through both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the egg trade from beginning to end.  It continues the provisions of the 1924 Act and the 1930 Act.  The first Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act was passed in 1924.  That Act was amended in 1930 in some slight respects.  We are now continuing the provisions of the 1924 and the 1930 Acts in this Bill, but we are going somewhat further also.  Perhaps it might be useful at this stage to give some idea of what was done in the 1924 and the 1930 Acts. The 1924 Act dealt entirely with exporters. That is one of the big differences between that legislation and the present Bill.  Exporters were registered under the 1924 Act.  They had to have suitable premises.  They had to test, grade and pack eggs before export, according to the regulations that were laid down.  An inspector had power to recommend the forfeiture of a package of eggs if he found a number of defective eggs in the package. That forfeiture could be sanctioned or rejected by the Minister as he thought fit.  After a number of forfeitures had taken place, it was the practice to cancel the registration of an exporter.  In practice also, after some time the exporter was restored to the register, and if he had a good record from that onwards, as sometimes happened, there was no further trouble.  If, however, his licence was again cancelled, the cancellation lasted for a much longer time, but, as far as my experience goes, I do not think that any exporter was removed from the register indefinitely. In other words, nobody gets a life sentence, as far as I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealers or producers were not dealt with specifically in the 1924 Act.  They could be prevented from selling dirty eggs, and a package could be forfeited if found on a dealer's premises to contain a number of eggs that were considered as below the standard, but the theory of the Act was that pressure should be used by the exporter down along the line to the producer.  The theory was that if the exporter was getting bad eggs from certain dealers he would cease to do business with these dealers, and that the dealers, in turn, if they were getting eggs which they found were unfit for sale from <Col N="197" /> certain producers, would cease to do business with these producers and eventually the producers would be compelled to market good eggs.  In practice that did not work out.  A number of exporters did set out in the spirit of the legislation to try to improve things, and refused, in the first instance, to take eggs from dealers who did not offer good eggs.  After some time, however, they heard from these dealers: &ldquo;If you do not take these eggs somebody else will.&rdquo;  They began to lose business in that way.  Similarly, the dealer who refused to take eggs from a producer was told: &ldquo;If you do not take them somebody else will take them&rdquo;, and he also began to lose business. After some time, if the exporter wanted to remain in business, he had to take eggs from all dealers and the dealers had to take eggs from all producers.</P>
    <P>The result was that there was no great improvement.  The 1930 Act was passed, and there were some slight changes made in the 1924 Act.  There were larger powers given to inspectors which did not amount to a lot, but one big change which was considered important at the time and which, I believe, was important&mdash;it is being continued in this Bill&mdash;was that the exporter must be a qualified person, or must have a qualified person in charge of his business.  A qualified person meant a person who knew how to test and grade eggs properly.  Those people who are now in charge of exporters' premises are regarded as qualified by the Department, but no new person can go into the business unless he is properly qualified.  There are courses of instruction held by the Department, and such people must attend them and pass an examination before becoming qualified to enter the business.  In time, we will possibly get an improvement in the quality of eggs as a result of that.</P>
    <P>The big problem we have to deal with now is the stale egg.  We find in times, for instance, of rising prices, that the producer is a little slow about marketing his eggs.  He says: &ldquo;If I do not sell this week, I will sell next week when the price may be better.&rdquo;  The dealer gets them eventually when they have gone up in price and perhaps <Col N="198" /> down in quality.  He again holds on to them because he says the price is improving and there is no harm in holding them for a week or two.  Then the wholesaler gets them.  He does not hold them too long, but when the egg reaches the consumer, whether outside or inside this country, the egg is stale and very often unfit for human consumption. This Bill deals to a great extent with that problem, and I might say also that there is more necessity for dealing with that problem now than there was in 1924 or 1930, because competition on the foreign market is every year becoming more keen.  The Bill seeks to accelerate the movement of eggs right from the beginning, from the producer to the wholesaler, and to the retailer at home, or on the other side, if they are exported.</P>
    <P>We are going to deal with dealers for the first time under this Bill. They must be registered; they must have suitable premises; and they must dispose of eggs within a prescribed time.  For the first time, that principle comes in.  We are going to see, so far as we can, that dealers get rid of their eggs in the shortest possible and reasonable time.  They must also pack them in standard packages and docket them.  As Senators are aware, the dealer goes around the country collecting eggs from the producers, or he takes them in from producers who bring them to him.  He will now be compelled to docket them as being from each producer, so that afterwards, when tested by the wholesaler, we can trace them back to the producer, if we find a large number of eggs unfit for human consumption in any particular consignment.  We can then tell the producer that he had better improve matters, or it will become impossible for the dealer to buy from him at all. The dealer in all cases will get his eggs from the producer, or, if he has a special licence, from another dealer. He disposes in all cases to the wholesaler, or, by special licence, to another dealer, or to a retailer.  He keeps the necessary records of his purchases and sales, and he must have registered premises.</P>
    <P>Also, it will be an offence for him to buy or sell dirty eggs.  That is specifically <Col N="199" /> laid down and it is also an offence for him to have such eggs on his premises after a certain time.  It is quite possible that a retailer may get in eggs and may not have time to examine them for an hour or two.  A reasonable time will be allowed and, after that time, if dirty eggs are found on his premises, he will be liable to prosecution.  He will pay a registration fee of £1 and an annual fee of £1, but he will not pay fees on the volume of his business, as the wholesaler does.  His registration can be cancelled for any contravention of the Acts or of the regulations.  Under the Bill, the present exporters will automatically become wholesalers and will carry on automatically in the premises they now have registered as wholesalers. There will be a provisional licence given, but it may be necessary to have these premises improved.  Time will be given also for that.  The fee which the present wholesaler pays on export is a penny per 36 dozen.  He pays that only on export, but, in future, he will be asked to pay a fee on all eggs dealt with, whether exported or sold at home.  The fee will probably be raised, but not, I think, to more than twopence per case or per 36 dozen.  If he buys from a producer, he will be subject to the same regulations and so on as the retailer with regard to packing and docketing, and if he buys from a retailer, he must test, grade and pack, and must mark them also, according to the regulation. At present, they mark their cases and the individual eggs.  We may go so far in this Bill, but not, I think, immediately, because I do not believe we are ready for it, as to insist on the system by which a certain mark is put on each egg which will identify it in respect of date, so far as inspectors and people in the trade are concerned, but not perhaps so far as the public are concerned.</P>
    <P>There may be different regulations with regard to home sale and export sale of eggs, but that again is a matter for further consideration.  They must do this testing, packing, grading and disposing of their eggs within a prescribed time.  It is an offence for them to sell dirty eggs or eggs unfit for <Col N="200" /> human consumption.  They will find out whether an egg is fit for human consumption when they have tested it, and they must not sell an egg which is unfit.  There will be three grades of egg&mdash;the good egg, the second grade egg and the egg unfit for human consumption. After testing, they must mark their eggs, if they are either second quality or unfit for human consumption. Such eggs must be put aside, and if an inspector calls and finds egg that have not been so graded, after having been on the premises for sufficient time to allow of grading, the wholesaler will be guilty of an offence and liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>The powers of inspectors are the same as in previous Bills.  I think these are the main changes made by this legislation.  The principle underlying this Bill is the same as that underlying the 1924 and 1930 Acts, that is, by getting better eggs put on the market, both export and home, we hope eventually to get a better price.  This is the first time we have tried to get a better quality of egg placed on the home market.  In the City of Dublin a greatly increased consumption could be got, and, as I say, by getting a better egg, we expect to get a better price.  If we get a better price, we expect to get a greater production, and in that way to bring more prosperity to the egg producing industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to point out what I pointed out in the Dáil, and Senators who may have read the Dáil Debates will forgive me for repeating it.  There may be some confusion between the price that the Northern Ireland producer gets for eggs and the price which we get.  Take the case of extra selected or best grade.  Perhaps the Northern Ireland producer gets a price much higher than ours, but it must be remembered that the weight of ours is not as great as theirs, and if we get a comparison, egg for egg, as it were, both in degree of freshness and weight, I think it will be found that Northern Ireland producers are getting about 1½d. a dozen more than we are getting.  That is a good lot, and if we can, by getting a good reputation for our eggs, catch up on the Northern Ireland price, we shall have done quite a lot.  I think we should be able to <Col N="201" /> do that, if we can assure consumers in general that if they buy an egg passed by the Department of Agriculture here, they can be certain that the egg is all right.  We hope, at any rate, to improve things considerably by this legislation.</P>

      <P>I would say, at the outset, that if the price of our eggs in future can be raised by regulation, we are going to have a very high price indeed.  I look on this as a really drastic measure.  I am not too optimistic that it is going to do a great deal to give the producer a very much improved price.  I remember when the Pigs and Bacon Act was passing through another House, some of us pointed out that it was all very fine to be optimistic about the consequences of legislation when you are legislating, but all this regulating of trade has not brought the satisfactory results anywhere that were expected of it.  I have just been reading what an agricultural expert wrote in an English paper on Sunday last about conditions in England.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In spite of subsidies, quotas, marketing boards and other legislation designed for the purpose of helping our agricultural industry, the unpalatable truth is that farming to-day is in worse plight than at any period since the war.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the interrupters in the way they do not want to be answered.  If it is as bad as that in England, what must it be in Ireland? I have great sympathy with the Minister in his endeavour to improve the position of the egg trade.  I was a member of the other House when the first Bill was passing through in 1924, and it is interesting to make a comparison between the conditions then and the conditions to-day in the egg trade.  In 1924 the quantity of eggs exported amounted to 4,272,830 great hundreds of a value of £3,079,203.  In 1937 our export was scarcely more than half.  It amounted to only 2,458,846 <Col N="202" /> great hundreds, and the return was £857,689.  That is an alarming drop both in productivity and cash return, and what we have to remember is that we have legislation operating since then, and that legislation has not brought to us the improvement in either price or productivity that one would hope for from it.  For that reason I, personally, am not over-optimistic that this Bill, which I say is very drastic in many of its clauses, is going to bring a greatly increased price to the producer.</P>
      <P>The Bill is making very great demands, not only on producers, but on the people in the trade.  I do not want to go over the arguments that were put to the Minister in the other House.  But it seems to me that, when you make it obligatory on the traders of the country to make alterations in their premises before they can get a licence to do a certain trade, such a provision is in itself going to hamper the trade in the initial stages.  If an individual is going to incur the expenditure necessary to enable him to get a licence, he will naturally expect to receive some return on his capital. That return must be taken out of the trade, and, in my view, will be taken out of the price which goes to the producer. There is another point, and this is likely to happen in this trade as it has happened under the Creameries Act and under the Pigs and Bacon Act.  We have a great many small people&mdash;they may be poor people&mdash; doing a fairly considerable trade, and doing it with very limited capital resources.  They are people who have not ready cash, and perhaps may not have credit, so as to make it possible for them to reconstruct their business and thereby keep in the trade.  If the position be, as I have stated it, then you are going to have a great many people going out of business.  That fact in itself will restrict production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us know what the conditions are in the country.  The drop in our egg production is due to a number of causes and not to any one cause.  This variety of causes has brought us to the position revealed in the figures for 1937 as against 1924.  Now we are to have this further restriction on production. <Col N="203" /> I believe that this measure will cause such inconvenience that, instead of the housewives carrying their baskets of eggs two or three miles extra for sale, because the neighbour who used to buy them has gone out of business, they may decide that their few dozen eggs are not worth bothering about at all.  These few dozen eggs in the homes of thousands and thousands of small people in the countryside will make up the millions of great hundreds that we want to export. I think that the clause in the Bill dealing with that will, before it is made operative, require very grave consideration from the Minister.  I fear that in its present form it will not bring about the good results that he hopes for.  Let him be careful that he is not going to nip in the bud further productivity.</P>
    <P>Looking at the position as I see it to-day, I am convinced that legislation alone is not going to restore the position to anything like what it used to be.  Much more than a measure of this kind is required before we get back to the old position.  It is true, as I have said, that a variety of causes can be said to be responsible for the drop in our egg industry.  We have had a period of dear food for our poultry.  In addition to dear food and the difficulties caused by the economic war, we have had legislation of this kind sponsored by the present Ministry and the previous Ministry.  It is true to say that no one in any branch of agriculture in this or in any other country will keep in production if the costs of production exceed his returns.  In my opinion, if the Minister is going to succeed with his legislation, not alone will he require careful and wise administration of the legislation which he is asking the House to pass, but further, he will have to try and awaken a spirit in the countryside that is not there at present.  The farmer and the housewife have had so many upsets in recent years that they have no confidence that if they go in for production they are going to be paid for their labours.  In fact, in view of their past experience it is hard for them to be confident about anything so far as the <Col N="204" /> future is concerned.  In view of that, the Minister, I suggest, will need to go out on a propaganda campaign that is sadly needed and sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>I feel in a way that, possibly, the Agricultural Commission which is to be set up will, in its review of farming problems, go some distance in bringing our farmers, our people in the country, and, above all, our people in the towns and cities, back to a realisation of what is necessary to keep the wheels moving in rural Ireland.  In the meantime, the Minister will have to see that cheap food is made available for the poultry industry.  He will have to see that his legislation in the future will not put upon poultry producers the obligation of having to procure food which they regard, in the first place, as not being suitable, and, in the second place, of being too expensive. In addition to cheap food, there will have to be much better housing.  A great deal was said on that in the Dáil. Yesterday, at a meeting of the county committee of agriculture in my county, we had before us proposals which the Ministry are putting forward as a solution of the housing problem for poultry in the country.  These proposals, in my opinion, are not going to solve the problem at all.  The Minister is suggesting a scheme of loans for the housing of poultry.  The loans, at 5 per cent., are, I understand, to be repaid in four years.  I do not believe they will be availed of at all.  Poultry production here is not going to be such a paying proposition that our people on 10 or 20 acres of land will embark on an expenditure of £20 or £30 for the erection of a poultry house, especially when the loan has to be repaid in four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator any suggestion to make with regard to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I heard the scheme in full detail I asked if the 5 per cent. represented the repayment of principal and interest.  I was told then that it did not.  The 5 per cent. is the interest charged on the loan, and the principal has to be repaid in four years.  I feel certain that a poultry house, in accordance with the Department's <Col N="205" /> plan, could not be built for less than £25.  Therefore, I cannot see any people, except those with capital resources themselves, taking up the scheme.  I suggest to the Minister that a poultry house, such as we are thinking of, is not going to fall to pieces in four years or in ten years.  It will stand as long as most dwelling-houses. Therefore, I cannot see why the loan to build it would not be extended over 15 or 20 years.  My view is that poultry production is such an essential branch of agriculture, especially on our small farms, that it is next in importance to housing for the people.  The Government are subsidising housing.  If they were to subsidise, even to a small extent, the housing required for poultry I believe they would be astonished at the results that would follow.  I believe that a stimulus of that kind is needed to increase production in poultry farming to-day.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the dirty egg.  I am afraid it is not going to be so easily eliminated. I remember a man in my county being brought before a district justice for selling eggs that were not clean.  The district justice asked him what he would do with the hen so that the egg would be clean.  His reply was: &ldquo;I do not know, unless you got her to wash her feet before she went in.&rdquo;  In view of the condition of the soil, of the whole countryside, even around dwelling-houses, leaving aside altogether the poultry houses, I submit that this problem of the clean egg is not going to be easily solved.  People are to be prosecuted if they wash eggs. When people are up against regulations of that sort, what are their reactions going to be?  I agree that if there was enough of money in it they would take the necessary trouble to produce the better article, but what I fear is that there is not going to be so much money in this, especially during the initial stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that, in the course of a couple of years, we will be able to establish a better reputation for our eggs than they enjoy at the moment. I suggest that can only be done by a big advertising campaign outside the country.  So far nothing has been attempted in that direction.  Would it <Col N="206" /> not be possible for the poultry industry, the dairying industry and the bacon industry in this country to combine either under the aegis of the Government, or in some other way for the purpose of carrying out an advertising campaign in England where they want to sell their goods, and not be leaving everything to chance.  If you go over to England you are struck by the absence of any Irish produce in the shops.  If you ask about it, they hardly know what we produce here.  That is not as it should be.  I am satisfied that we will not have the opportunity for increased production here until we try to convince the consumers that we have the goods, and that we will deliver them properly.  That is an aspect of production that has been absolutely and completely neglected.  Our competitors have been doing this advertising very successfully.  Opportunities in this direction are available to us in England that are not available to any of our competitors.</P>
    <P>It is, unfortunately, true that thousands and thousands of our boys and girls have gone over to England during the last few years.  There must be thousands and thousands of homes in England in which they are ministering to the wants of the people of that country at their breakfast and dinner tables.  I read recently of the difficulties that are being created by the presence in England of a number of German and Austrian boys and girls. It was reported that they were getting into a sort of Nazi organisation and it was felt that they were trying to carry on a certain class of propaganda in the interests of their own countries and their people at home.  I cannot understand why we should not make some effort to get our boys and girls in England to help their own country. Despite what may be said of them, thousands and thousands of them are holding up their heads there and carrying on in quite a decent way. They are not ashamed of their country, and if members of this House were over there and saw them, they would not be ashamed of them either.  And, I cannot see why we here at home could not, in our efforts to spread the information <Col N="207" /> about the value of our products in England, utilise those people who have gone over, and particularly the girls who have gone into homes, and who are supplying at the breakfast and at the dinner tables, produce which we here can produce second to none, if we go to a little pains about it.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that his legislation will get us but a short distance indeed, and the fruits will be disappointing, unless the problem as a whole be tackled.  I am not going into the problem as a whole now, because it is a very wide one.  Its scope is of such a character that I believe it can only be adequately considered by this commission which the Minister has, I am glad to say, decided to set up, but in the meantime there are things which can be done and ought to be done.  I think myself that the Minister is understanding enough now to know that for poultry production in this country you want cheap and proper food.</P>
    <P>The Minister has realised that better housing is essential, but I suggest that the Minister's way about getting better houses will not get them, that he will have to go some other way about it and that it is rather dangling the carrot before the donkey to say that this scheme of loans is going to be effective&mdash;it is not.  You are not going to have healthy stock and cleaner eggs produced until you can house the poultry better, and housing is required at every farmstead in the country.  In addition, if we are going to produce these eggs and put them on the market in a cleaner condition, we ought to go out and tell the world about it; we ought to let the world know that we can produce the best eggs and sell them.</P>

      <P>There are two points arising, Sir, out of the speech of the Minister and the speech of Senator Baxter.  The first one is that I think that Senator Baxter is wrong in saying that Section 5 forbids you to wash eggs.  The second point is, I find that when Ministers come to this House to introduce legislation <Col N="208" /> they very rarely try to give us any idea of the probable cost of the new measures they are putting before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally the cost of the measures work out at a great deal more than is anticipated, for one thing.  The cost of inspection and other matters takes away enormously from the profits of the retailers in the first instance, but the retailer takes care that the costs, as far as he can&mdash;and he is generally extremely successful&mdash;are passed on to the original producer.  I would very much like to know whether any steps are contemplated to prevent the producer getting a smaller price for his eggs than he does at the present moment.  I would like the Minister, when he winds up, to give us some general idea of the actual difference over a period between the price of what you might call the English fresh egg and the Irish fresh egg, at the present moment, and to say whether it was owing to representations by the High Commissioner or how it was that the information came to him generally, as to the legislation he is proposing now.</P>
      <P>Further, I would like to make one small disagreement with Senator Baxter.  I do think that legislation carried out reasonably can improve a product which is good.  I think the Minister is right, that without the original Eggs Act, the original Bulls Act of Mr. Hogan and the Butter Act, instead of not getting increased value for our eggs, we would, in the present competition going on in the British market, be getting prices a great deal lower than we are at the present time.</P>

      <P>I find some of Senator Baxter's remarks quite good, but, generally speaking, he seemed to be in very morose mood this afternoon, when he talked about the terrible condition of the farmers.  I do not agree at all that conditions are altogether as bad as he led the House to believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that the egg production of <Col N="209" /> this country has gone down, but it does not necessarily mean that if it has gone down, it is the result of the legislation of the last five or ten years for that matter.  It does not necessarily mean that if exporters had to provide special housing accommodation in order to look after their eggs properly and to see that they were cleaned and graded, that that affected the producer.  I would like the Senator to understand that this fall in eggs generally has come about during the period when the eggs of the country were collected at the very door of the producer.  In actual fact, the more facilities that have been given to the producer, the less the producer happened to be interested, so that Senator Baxter's point about &ldquo;nursing the farmer&rdquo;, as such, is not going to help him to increase his production.</P>
      <P>In addition, I might also add that if this legislation provides for capital expenditure for the exporter, it does not mean that it should go back on the eggs, because most exporters are themselves mixed merchants.  Generally speaking, the exporter carries on a general grocery trade, and as a consequence, he brings his lorry and picks up the eggs at the door and gives groceries or some other kind of commodity in return.  Sometimes I wonder if there was keener supervision of the operations of the dealers in those circumstances and of the value that the farmer was getting in return for his eggs, that it would justify him in maintaining his egg production.  It is a point&mdash;I do not know whether there is anything in it or not.  However, it is an end, in any case, which I think should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I think this whole question of eggs should be tackled in the stock itself and I am of opinion that the grading up of our stocks of hens, the weeding-out of the bad ones, the supply of high-grade chicks from recognised hens and a general intensive supervision of supplies of chicks from high-grade hens&mdash;let them be the Department hens or the hens of individual owners&mdash;should be attempted, and that whatever money should be spent on that account, would be well spent and that whatever distribution of chicks was made to the farmers, <Col N="210" /> they could not get enough of those particular high-laying strains.  If a lot of the money that might be spent on the building of houses or anything else was diverted that way for a few years, you would have far better results and far more contented poultry producers.</P>
    <P>I feel also that this question of the marking of eggs is not helpful to the export trade.  I think that any marking of any kind, let it be ink or dirt, is objectionable to the consumer and I believe that if the Minister could succeed&mdash;I do not know whether it is an English or an Irish regulation&mdash;in changing the system so that we could send our eggs clean, without any mark of any description, they would be in a more presentable condition for the consumer and would, I believe, return a higher price than at present.  I believe that the marking on eggs has a detrimental effect on prices.</P>
    <P>I have not anything further to say except that I do believe and am satisfied that legislation of this sort is genuinely necessary to control exporters of our eggs.  People in the trade, naturally, will resist legislation or restrictions of any kind, but in the long run, it is definitely going to give confidence to the consumer on the other side and better conditions in which we can send our produce to them.  We cannot sell the produce in proper condition unless there is supervision and I am personally in favour of legislation of this sort and I hope it will have the desired effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cathaoirligh, I agree that this legislation is very necessary and I believe the Minister is touching upon the real problem when he is dealing with the question of the over-holding of eggs.  I think that is the great difficulty.  Eggs are being over-held too long.  That is due to the long distances between the districts and to bad systems of transport and collection.  I feel sure that this over-holding has had a bad effect, not only in England, but in this country and it is only fair to the consumers of eggs here and in England that they should get some guarantee that they are at least fresh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some measure also, I share Senator Baxter's fears about those <Col N="211" /> regulations.  If they are enforced too rigidly they may cause dislocation in the trade.  As Senator Baxter has pointed out, many dealers could not undertake structural alterations immediately and I suggest that the Minister ought to give all the time possible and make every allowance that he can, before he enforces the regulations too drastically.</P>
    <P>On the whole also, looking at this business from the general point of view, if the egg trade is to be developed properly, the whole trade should be organised on a proper basis like the butter industry.  We have had experience of the value of co-operation in the production of butter.  We saw that it was quite easy to enforce the regulations through the co-operative societies and that when the bounties were distributed through those societies, they went direct to the producers.  If the egg trade is to be developed as it should be I think the Minister should see that the time is coming when he must encourage the carrying on of the trade through the co-operative societies. The collection and disposal of the eggs should be done in future through these organisations, otherwise there will always be difficulties about it.  I think that the spread of co-operation would do much to encourage production and it would ensure that those regulations would be enforced and that the eggs would be produced more cleanly and transported more efficiently after they had been graded properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say, Chairman, on this Bill but I wonder, if nothing had been done at all from 1924 onwards, whether the position would have been really any worse than it is to-day.  Do Senators realise what is happening?  In the last eight years our exports of eggs have halved and the Danish exports have doubled.  That is roughly what it is. The Minister is not seriously suggesting that regulation, better or worse, is the explanation or that this final fillip is going to make any practical difference. It cannot be so.  It may be the explanation, but there is something much bigger than that wrong.  There is one thing wrong certainly, and that <Col N="212" /> is the high cost of feeding stuffs.  The Minister went in for the elaborate regulation of this maize mixture business which, I believe, is being abandoned.  I do not know whether that is an illustration of how Governments manage things better than business people.  I am sure that that has something to do with it.  But there is something spiritual, there is something in the bones of the people, something deeper, that must account for the extraordinary fact that the Danish output is doubled and ours is halved.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister again to get away from this belief in regulation.  We are trammeled up with regulations.  I do not believe that that is anything but a small fraction of the explanation.  It is like a business man with a lot of super-offices and the latest modern labour-saving appliances who thinks it is good business.  Very often the man with the most old-fashioned methods is the better man, because he has the spiritual personality behind him.  There is something radically wrong with the whole business.  We have poured enough money into this business.  There was an unfortunate dispute which aggravated it; but there is something radically wrong which is not going to be met by regulations and tightening up such as we have in this Bill.  But as we are on the road to regulation, a little more will not do us any harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Joseph Johnston Professor Joseph Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Joseph Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise for butting in so often in connection with agricultural problems, but I take rather a keen interest in them. I should like, first of all, to underline the extraordinary economic importance of the egg industry to us.  Actually there are, I believe, about 20,000,000 poultry in the country.  Some 10 or 12 years ago the value of the output of these poultry was a very substantial portion of the total agricultural output. What I should like to emphasise most of all is the fact that if you look back over the last 50 or 60 years of our agricultural statistics, you will find that two things, and only two things, have shown a steady rate of increase, and that of these two, one is the poultry population.  Some 60 or 80 years ago there were only about 11,000,000 poultry in the 26-County <Col N="213" /> area.  There has been, on the whole, a steady upward trend in the poultry population, and also I may add, in the population of dry cattle two years old and upwards.  The population of practically everything else, of cows, pigs, horses and so on, has remained practically stationary.</P>
      <P>I think the significance of that is that poultry is one of the lines of our agricultural activity which is capable of development, and if given a fair chance it shows signs of being able to become more and more important as time goes on.  Yet, if we look at the present position, we find that the average flock of poultry per homestead in the country is only a beggarly 50 hens and ducks.  In other words, we have about 400,000 agricultural holdings, we have about 20,000,000 poultry, and the average poultry-keeping is only about 50 per holding.  That average is far too low.  If that average could be doubled in the near future it would do more to add to the wealth of the nation than anything else you can possibly suggest.</P>
      <P>What then are the factors that influence people to go in for an expansion of poultry production?  Undoubtedly, as certain Senators have rightly underlined, the chief consideration which influences them is the cost of the feeding stuffs.  Of course, if you are a tillage farmer, and you use the whole of your output of tillage in feeding your own stock of poultry or what not, it does not matter to you what the cost of feed is.  The only thing that concerns you is the price of your finished animal products.  Actually, we have hundreds of thousands of poultry producers in this country who, for one reason or another, cannot produce on their own farms the feed that they need to give their poultry.  We have in one or two specialised areas, in Louth and Wexford, a number of tillage farmers who specialise in the production of quantities of cereal products which they sell through the channels of commerce, and for which they are able to obtain an inflated price through the Minister's absurd maize mixture scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The raw materials used in producing eggs are more than half of Irish origin. It is stated that a hen will consume <Col N="214" /> one cwt. of grain or meal in the year; that half that amount of grain should be fed to her in an unground state in the form of whole oats; and some portion of the rest of the ration, if she does not get a full ration of grain, will probably consist of the surplus potatoes or surplus skim milk produced on the farm.  So that only perhaps for 25 per cent. of the total cost of feeding for eggs do we depend on the import of maize meal or other foreign products. Consequently, the factor that influences the production of eggs is the relation between the price of the feed and the price of eggs.  We may ignore for the moment the origin of that feed. Taking the average price of oats and Indian meal as typical of the ration fed for poultry production, I had the curiosity to observe the relation between this price and the price of eggs for a period of some 20 or 30 years.  I found that there was a most extraordinary stability in their ratio, generally speaking.  It was somewhere between 40 and 50 per cent.  What I mean is that, if you assume, which I believe is not far off the truth, that it takes eight units of feed to produce one unit, by weight, of eggs, and if you compare the price of eight units of feed, on the basis I suggested, with the price of one unit of egg, deriving those prices in both cases from official statistics, you will find, over a period of years, that the relation between these prices is somewhere between 40 and 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I also found, in more recent years, a tendency for the price of feed to rise up to or above the 50 per cent. ratio, and I think I was right in concluding that that happened because there was a tendency for the number of poultry to diminish and of egg production generally to go down.  In other words, if you want to increase egg production, keep down the price of feed; and nothing is of greater importance in relation to the expansion of egg production than a suitable relation between feed price and egg price.</P>
    <P>There are two other points to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, because they seem to me to be serious defects in the Bill, the principle of which I personally am prepared to recommend.  There are four <Col N="215" /> categories of registered persons in connection with this Bill.  I notice, under the Bill, that only registered wholesalers may export eggs.  Does that mean that a poultry farmer, having, perhaps, 1,000 or 2,000 poultry, is not able himself directly to export eggs to Northern Ireland or Great Britain, but must incur the unnecessary expense and loss of selling his eggs in the first instance to a registered wholesaler?  I think the Bill should contain a provision that every poultry farmer, the scale of whose operations is sufficiently important, should be automatically entitled to the privileges of a registered wholesaler.</P>
    <P>Another point, which is perhaps only an oversight of the draftsman, occurs in page 26, which prescribes the various sources from which the registered wholesaler may acquire eggs.  He may acquire them from a registered dealer, or from a producer, or another registered wholesaler.  Suppose a registered wholesaler is himself by way of being a poultry farmer&mdash;in fact I think it should be the case in the case of an important poultry farmer&mdash;does that mean that he is not entitled, by law, to acquire eggs from his own hens and that, if he takes any eggs from his own hens, he is liable to a fine not exceeding £50, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months?  It is, of course, probably either a mare's nest or an oversight of drafting, but, whatever it is, I should like the Minister to look into the matter and put the thing right, so that, in no circumstances, can a poultry farmer be penalised for being a poultry farmer.</P>

      <P>There is one question I should like to ask on the point raised by Senator MacEllin with regard to the mark.  Somebody asked me what was the marking to be in the future.  There seems to be some confusion of thought as to how our produce is to be marked, whether it was marked in a particular way previously, and how it is going to be marked now with the change brought about by the new Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to make further and better provision for the purchase and sale of eggs and, <Col N="216" /> incidentally, I suppose, to increase production. I do not think that anybody can have any objection to the terms of the Bill.  There has been a lot of criticism of it, but I think anyone who does not like the Bill should vote against it.  I approve of the Bill.  In the present state of competition for the only market worth having&mdash;the British market&mdash;I think that, except we send our eggs to that market in a better condition than we are sending them there now, we will be completely wiped out.  The Danes and other competitors in that market send their eggs under very much more strict regulation than is insisted upon here.  Anything that would improve the marketing of eggs and, incidentally, production, and get a better price for them, should be approved of by this House.</P>
      <P>Production has gone down considerably within the last six or eight years.  There are many causes for that, some of which are obvious, and which I do not want to go into.  One of the causes for the decrease in production is the cost of feeding stuffs.  The price of the maize mixture for the last five or six years in the Twenty-Six Counties was practically, on an average, £2 per ton more than the cost of maize meal in the Six Counties.  Together with that, the farmers got it into their heads, rightly or wrongly&mdash;and, in my opinion, wrongly&mdash;that the maize mixture was detrimental to the rearing of hens and the production of eggs.  I do not agree with that.  My objection to the maize mixture was that it was too dear.  The only animals that I think it would be injurious to would be young pigs.  The maize mixture, I can say from my own experience, is a very useful food for poultry.  I know plenty of well-managed and paying poultry farms on which they feed whole oats and whole wheat once a day to their poultry.  But the fact remains that the farmers got it into their heads that it was injurious, and any amount of talking will not get it out.  That was one of the causes, which together with the cost of feeding stuffs, lessened production in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is perfectly right in trying to get increased production of eggs. <Col N="217" /> It is very important for the country that we should increase our egg production. It is very valuable, particularly to the small farmers and agricultural workers, and, in fact, to everybody in the rural areas.  The best way to do that, in my opinion, would be to have better poultry houses provided for the agricultural workers.  A grant should be given for the construction of these houses, and there should be more intensive propaganda and more instruction by the poultry instructresses throughout the country.  The poultry instructresses call on half a dozen of the bigger farmers.  These people are in very little need of instruction.  They should make periodical calls on the agricultural labourers and the small farmers, and they should use all the means in their power to induce them to keep more poultry.  They should instruct them in the necessity for producing more eggs&mdash;particularly winter eggs.  They should teach them the proper treatment of poultry in winter and the importance of warm and clean housing.  Housing is the most important factor.  If that were done, I think we would increase our egg production, but we shall not do so until steps are taken in the direction I have indicated. The cost of feeding stuffs should come down.  I suppose the ordinary law of supply and demand will now operate since the meal admixture is finished with.</P>
    <P>Nobody can have any objection to this Bill.  It is designed to provide for the better marketing of eggs, the increased production of eggs, and the procuring of better prices for eggs. For these reasons, I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter described this measure as &ldquo;drastic&rdquo;.  Some other Senators were inclined to agree with that description.  It might be a drastic measure if we used to the utmost the powers contained in it in all cases, but the Senator will agree that no Department has used powers they have obtained for purposes of this kind to the very utmost.  They were only used in the extreme cases where they were absolutely necessary. That is the intention of my Department and my own intention so far as the administration of this measure is <Col N="218" /> concerned.  We may have been too lenient in the past in allowing exporters on to the register two or three times after the registration had been cancelled.  I should be inclined to be somewhat more drastic in that respect in the future.  If a wholesaler were to contravene the provisions of the Act or the regulations on more than one occasion in a serious way, I think his registration should be cancelled and that it should not be so easy to get back as a registered wholesaler as it has been.  The Pigs and Bacon Act does not arise on this Bill, but I cannot pass over what Senator Baxter said&mdash; that it did not make any improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly made an improvement in the price of pigs. References to the reduction in our exports raises the question of cause. Senators may come in here and voice an old prejudice against the maize-meal mixture by saying it was responsible. I wonder what Senator Johnston would say, if he were speaking to the Minister for Agriculture in the British Parliament, of the decline in poultry production in that country. It is very much worse there than it is here.  If he could not say that he had done anything ridiculous, such as introducing the maize-meal mixture, how could he explain the reduction in that country?  Here, we are told that the &ldquo;ridiculous maize-meal mixture&rdquo; is responsible for everything.  That alone does not explain the reduction.  I wish it did because, then, my task would be very easy.  If it were quite obvious that the maize-meal mixture was responsible for the reduction in production, then my task would be a simple one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the production of eggs go down in 1929?  They went down by 33? per cent. from 1929 to 1931.  That was before the economic war was dreamt of and before the introduction of the maize-meal mixture.  Neither of them can explain that reduction and neither of them can explain the big reduction in Great Britain.  I do not see the use of throwing, because of an old prejudice against the economic war&mdash;against which we were all pre <Col N="219" /> judiced&mdash;the responsibility for the reduction on that episode or on the maize-meal mixture.  I have thought over this matter very deeply.  I said: &ldquo;If the economic war has caused this, it will be easy to make things right; if the maize-meal mixture has caused it, it will also be easy to make things right.&rdquo;  Neither of them had a great deal to do with it and the problem is going to be extremely difficult.  Senator Baxter says that legislation will not effect a cure.  I agree.  I have no great faith in legislation as a panacea but, if we think we can improve matters by legislation, we should take the necessary steps.  I can imagine Senators who are complaining of all this legislation and regulation getting up and suggesting that the Minister was doing nothing for the egg industry if there were no such regulation or legislation. All I can do is legislate and, by regulation, try to improve matters.  Other steps can be taken by the producers themselves.  The steepest decline in production was from 1929 to 1931.  For 1938, there is the first ray of hope.  The number of poultry for 1938 is up.</P>

      <P>The number of poultry is up, for the first time, in 1938 since that period, and our exports are up considerably to the end of October as compared with 1937.  We have, therefore, two indications of a turning of the tide in 1938.  This is the first turn since 1929.  The two causes mentioned by Senator Baxter and others were dear feeding and the economic war. We are trying to get over these difficulties as well as possible.  We have free entry for our eggs to the British market but we are doing even better than that.  We are giving a subsidy on exports, so that we are giving our producers even a better price than the British market would give them.  That was necessary because we found, when the economic war was over, that our subsidies had been higher than the tariffs and that, if we had stopped the <Col N="220" /> subsidies completely at the end of the economic war, our poultry producers would find that they had lost considerably by the ending of the economic war.  Therefore, we had to continue to subsidise them and I suppose we shall have to continue to subsidise them for some time longer. The maize-meal mixture will come to an end some time towards the end of the year and we shall see if there will be an improvement.  I agree with Senator Baxter that if we could awaken a spirit of confidence and enterprise amongst the farmers, it would be the most useful thing we could do.  Perhaps we can awaken that spirit, seeing that we are going to get better eggs produced, the best possible markets for our eggs, cheaper feeding stuffs and better housing. With all these things, we may get a feeling of confidence and enterprise.</P>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that Senator Baxter does not think that our housing scheme will be a success. Small loans of £15 and £25 are very costly things for a Department to administer over periods of ten, 15 or 20 years.  I am sure that Senator Baxter sees that point.  When we have to send out reminders of amounts due and collect instalments of £1 or 30/-, it is very costly.  The collection might cost almost as much as the loan itself.  That is why we cut down the period of years.  I should like to see what reception this scheme will get before making any changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Baxter that it is impossible for farmers, however small, to have clean eggs produced. If a farmer keeps clean straw and the hens have to walk through that straw to their laying nests, their feet will be clean before reaching the nests.  It is not necessary to go to the trouble of washing their feet.  It is illegal to wash eggs but it is not illegal to use a damp cloth to take off any dirt that may accidentally have got on to the eggs.  As Senator Baxter says, there is a lot to be said for an advertising campaign on the British market. It might give good results.  We have the best bacon and the best butter on that market.  We cannot say that for our eggs.  If we could improve the <Col N="221" /> quality of our eggs under this Bill, then we could advertise with good effect on the British market.  The money would be well spent, though it would probably be a costly matter.</P>
    <P>Senator the McGillycuddy asked what the cost of the Bill would be.  I said something about the cost in my opening speech, but I did not deal with it adequately.  The annual cost of the Acts up to the present is £11,000.  Of that, £5,000 comes in in the way of fees from exporters, and about £6,000 is contributed by the State.  The increased cost, on account of the greater inspection, will probably be about £15,000.  The greater part of that will come from the increased fees.  The fees are being increased from 1d. to 2d. per case of 30 dozen.  That will be collected not only on the exported eggs, but on the eggs in the home market, so that it may not cost the State very much more than at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comparison of prices.  I gave a comparison, so far as I possibly could, with Northern Ireland prices.  If we take egg for egg, as regards freshness, we are probably getting 1½d. per dozen less than in Northern Ireland.  In Northern Ireland they are getting less than they are getting in England.  We are therefore getting more than 1½d. less than the English producer.  That is the margin we want to make up as a result of this legislation with regard to clean eggs.</P>
    <P>The mark that must be put on the eggs as denoting the country of origin is not yet decided under the new Constitution, and until that question is settled up with the British Board of Trade, the mark &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo; remains.  Senator McEllin raised a question about the farmer getting value where he barters his eggs.  I am afraid that is a rather difficult thing for my Department to deal with.  I think that would be more a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce when dealing with the question of barter in general.  I do not think we could take it as an isolated case here and deal with it in a Bill like this. Senator O'Dwyer agrees, too, that the regulations may be too severe.  I think it will not be found in practice that the regulations are too severe. <Col N="222" /> They will be necessarily severe enough to try to effect an improvement, but I do not think they will be exceptionally severe.  We quite realise that alterations in premises cannot be carried out immediately, and that is provided for in the Bill.  An exporter's premises will automatically become registered as a wholesaler's premises provisionally.  We may afterwards serve notice on him that he must improve these premises, but he will get time to do so, and he will be allowed to carry on provisionally.  The same conditions will apply to the dealer.  The dealer will apply for registration, stating the nature of his premises, and he will get provisional registration.  He will get time to improve his premises, if an improvement is considered necessary on inspection.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Dwyer that the co-operative societies can play a big part in encouraging the production of eggs, but I do not think we can do anything by legislation of this kind to help co-operative societies in any way. In answer to Senator Keane, I do not know what might have happened if no legislation had been passed in 1924.  I think that Senator Counihan was right when he said that our competitors, like the Danish, are also subject to very strict regulations.  The Danes are improving their position on the British market, but they are probably acting, to some extent, at any rate, under Government regulations with regard to cleanliness and matters of that kind. They also may be complaining about the very severe conditions imposed upon them.  At any rate, it is very difficult to say what might have happened if there had been no legislation in 1924.  Possibly we might not be any worse than we are at present.  I agree with Senator Keane that very often a business man who would be regarded as something behind the times, who would have a small little office with no gadgets or up-to-date machinery, might get on just as well as the modern business man.  In other words, as the Senator said, there is something spiritual about a business man that sometimes succeeds where modern methods failed.  I should like to tell the Senator, however, that the Government cannot be spiritual.</P>

      <P>None, whatever.  Senator Johnston is right when he says the egg industry is of enormous importance. So it is.  I think at one time it held a very high place in the list of outputs of agriculture, and I should be very glad indeed if we could get it back into that important position again.  A poultry farmer can become an exporter. There is no difficulty about his exporting his own eggs if he wishes to do that.  The Senator dealt with the chief cause of decrease and increase in production, and referred to the cost of feeding-stuffs.  He is possibly right.  One other cause is disease.  There are people who got so much trouble from disease in poultry that they went out of business.  That is probably more true of England than of this country, because they have had a worse time from disease there than we had here.  Taking the number of hens&mdash;poultry, of course, in statistics includes turkeys, geese, ducks, cockerels, etc. &mdash;over six months old, in 1927-28, which were the years when we had the biggest export, and comparing it with the numbers since, there has not been a 10 per cent. variation in the number of hens in any year since.  How then can the big decrease in exports be explained, seeing that the number of our hens did not go below 90 per cent. of what they were in that year? I am sure nobody attempted to prevent the hens from laying.  Still there was a very big decrease in our exports. It is held by some people&mdash;I do not know on what evidence&mdash;that there was a very much bigger consumption of eggs at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may or may not be the explanation.  I cannot say and I do not know on what evidence it is based.  Senator Counihan also dealt with the maize-meal mixture and said, although he did not hold it himself, that it was believed to be bad for hens.  That is quite true.  I saw a statement myself that the maize-meal mixture had killed young chickens.  I wonder do Senators ever read papers like <i>The Farmers' Weekly</i>, British periodicals catering for British farmers, and look at the answers to <Col N="224" /> queries in these periodicals?  In none of these answers will you see people told that chickens should be fed on maize alone.  You will never see them advised to do that.  They are always told to mix maize with oatmeal or barley meal or some other home-grown cereal&mdash;exactly what we have done here.  You have experts giving that advice in England, where everybody has perfect freedom to feed with any meal they wish.  They do, in fact, always advocate that some home-grown grain should be mixed with the feed for young chickens and the same, of course, applies to laying hens.  I should say that, in advising that ration for hens, they always took into account the cost as well as the suitability of the feed but still they always advocate that type of feed.  Yet, people here are prejudiced against the maize-meal mixture and we are told that whatever misfortunes may befall agriculture it is due to that mixture.  I do not know if any other points were referred to in the debate.  There were some smaller points, but I would suggest they might be more suitably dealt with when the Bill is going through Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to put into effect a Convention which was signed in 1929 in Geneva.  Under that Convention we agreed to set up a national Red Cross organisation here which would take control of Red Cross activities in the country.  At the present time, ours is the only country in Europe that has no Red Cross organisation under State authority.  Up to some years ago there were two organisations here.  One was the British Red Cross Society and the other the St. John Ambulance, Irish District. The British Red Cross Society has, of course, disappeared and the only ambulance societies that are in the country at the present time are the St. John Ambulance Society and a <Col N="225" /> society called the Knights of Malta&mdash; a society in Galway.  Neither of these two organisations covers the whole country.  People who are familiar with Dublin will know the good work that has been carried on by the St. John Ambulance Society here for a number of years, but it exists only here in Dublin and in Cork, as far as I know. It is necessary now to carry out the Convention that was signed on our behalf in 1929 to set up a Red Cross organisation under national authority, and that is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
      <P>I need not describe the work of Red Cross organisation.  That should be familiar, I think, to all Senators.  Not alone do they provide for sick and wounded in time of war, but in time of peace they carry out humanitarian work in the various countries which have Red Cross organisations.  We hope, when the Bill is passed, to establish a Red Cross authority here which will be representative of all sections of the community.  That organisation when established will go ahead energetically to organise branches of the Red Cross organisation throughout the whole country, particularly in the populous areas. Not only is this a very necessary organisation in time of war, but it is a very useful organisation in time of peace by reason of the fact that it can carry on the various humanitarian activities that such organisations carry on in other countries.  There is a clause in the Bill which empowers the Government to spend money on this organisation, but it is not intended that this Red Cross organisation should be financed by the State to any extent. It is intended, however, to give them an initial small grant to enable them to set up offices, and to carry out the preliminary work of organisation.  It is hoped that, with public sympathy for their work, the Red Cross organisation will be able to carry on on a voluntary basis, and will get the subscriptions necessary to fulfil its functions in times of peace.</P>

      <P>I am a little disappointed that the Minister has not thought it fit to give the House a little <Col N="226" /> more information as to what his plans are when he is empowered, as the Bill empowers him, to establish the society. When this matter was under discussion in the other House, questions were asked of the Acting Minister&mdash;the Minister being, I regret, ill at the time &mdash;as to some more precise information in respect of the form the society would take, and, in particular, what relation it would bear to the existing organisation to which the Minister has referred.  The Taoiseach, who was acting Minister for Defence, admitted frankly that he was not conversant with what plans had been formed by the Minister for Defence in regard to the society, but said that the various matters raised would receive consideration. He went further and said, in the debate on the Second Reading, that he had tried to get information on that particular point, that is, the relation of the proposed society to existing organisations, before the Committee Stage of the Bill in order to see what advances had been made in designing the new organisation.  On the Committee Stage, there was no debate, and the Bill went through without any discussion, if I am not mistaken.  I had hoped, however, that the Minister would have been able to tell us to-day something of what was in his mind, and of which his deputy was not able to inform the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has naturally referred to the very extensive work done for many years past by the St. John Ambulance Brigade.  He has been misinformed in thinking that the brigade limits its operations to Dublin and Cork.  It has centres, I think, in many other towns.  I know it has centres in some, and during the time when there was more demand for its services, it had centres in places other than the two cities he mentioned.  We are all familiar with the very comprehensive and broad-minded work which that organisation undertakes in its attendance at assemblies of all sorts, where these members voluntarily give up their spare time in doing public service to those who attend these assemblies. Whatever the nature of the assemblies &mdash;sporting events, football matches, race meetings and political and <Col N="227" /> religious meetings&mdash;voluntary, unpaid services have been for many years given free to the public.  What I should like to know from the Minister is what he has in mind as to the relation of the new organisation to that existing organisation.</P>
    <P>I am not making any positive suggestion to him.  I am not suggesting that he might do what I think might be in his power, that is, to recognise the St. John Ambulance Brigade as the Irish Red Cross Society because there may be objections with which I am not familiar and also, I am not altogether sure that the St. John Ambulance Brigade would welcome giving up the independence and freedom it has at the moment in order to put itself more or less under Government control.  I am not suggesting that they would be willing or unwilling to do that.  I do not know, but it is a matter that should be considered by the Minister and his advisers before he makes other plans. In particular, I would suggest that whatever society he decides to set up, steps should be taken in advance to secure that it works, as I am quite sure it would, in hearty co-operation with existing voluntary organisations.  That has happened in the neighbouring country in the past.  The St. John Ambulance Brigade there has been very active in times of peace and of war.  The British Red Cross Society has been active almost altogether in time of war, except that since the Great War it has certain accumulated funds which it spends very generously in charity.  They are, however, accumulated funds which are gradually being decreased in amount, and are not being hoarded up.  There is, I think, no new activity undertaken by that society in time of peace.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that such a society should not undertake new activities, but pointing out that in the neighbouring country, whether by a tacit understanding or an explicit understanding, these two organisations work side by side in a very friendly way, it being understood that the main activity of the Red Cross Society is in time of war and the other society has an equal place in time of peace, and is also willing to help in time of war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I hope the Minister and his advisers who are planning this society will have full consultations with those who can speak for the St. John Ambulance Brigade.  The setting up of a society under Government control and with Government aid&mdash;and, I would say, parenthetically, that the giving of Government aid is rather a deterrent to the giving of voluntary subscriptions to such a society&mdash;quite possibly might have the effect of limiting very definitely the activities of the present organisation, and I think that would be, in itself, a great misfortune to the country.  That might readily happen before the new society would have gained the experience which that society has.  I think it is quite natural that the Minister should ask the Oireachtas to pass such a Bill as this in order to bring the country into line-with the undertakings they have made with other countries in regard to the Red Cross Conventions.  So much as comment, rather than criticism, on the general purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are some of the sections which are likely to cause considerable embarrassment in their carrying out, and, particularly, Sections 4 and 5, which refer to the use of the red cross, on one hand, and the white cross on a red background, on the other.  As matters stand at present, it is compulsory by law on certain factories&mdash;I think it is the general regulation in regard to factory control&mdash;to have as part of their equipment a box or cupboard containing first-aid equipment.  It is stated in the regulations that every box or cupboard shall be distinctively marked, and, &ldquo;if newly provided after the date of this Order, shall be marked plainly with a white cross on a red background&rdquo; and shall contain such and such equipment for red cross work. The quotation I have read is from the regulation concerning laundries.  That regulation is compulsory on all laundry proprietors in this country.  It would seem that once this Bill becomes law, if a laundry man obeys that regulation, he will be subject to very heavy penalties under this Bill.  He will be subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £10, and the court may also order that the goods in relation to which the offence was committed <Col N="229" /> be forfeited.  What is the unfortunate laundryman to do?  I wonder has the Minister had the Bill examined by the Department of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because, as the thing stands&mdash;it is capable of remedy&mdash;it would cause great confusion to the trade, of which there are an enormous number of branches in this country.  I think the quotation I have read is a common one in regulations concerning factories and such places, but I happened to come on this one first.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  It may interest the House to know that the same regulation, which happens to be in the same volume, applies to gut-scraping, gut-washing and tripe factories. I do not know whether the inconvenience caused to them would be as great as that which would be caused &mdash;but for the Minister's amendment&mdash; to the proprietors of laundries.</P>

      <P>I overlooked mentioning the fact that, on Committee Stage, I intend to introduce an amendment which will provide that where the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the factory regulations, insists that a red cross box shall be kept, he will have power to exempt such factories or buildings from the provisions of this Bill.  They can display a red cross on their boxes if he authorises them to do so, so that I think there will be a general authorisation that where they are compelled by law to provide these boxes they will have power to display a red cross.  I do not think that Section 5, however, would cause much difficulty, that is, the restriction on the use of the arms of the Swiss Confederation&mdash;the white cross on a red background.</P>

      <P>Anyway, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have power to exempt.  In regard to the form of the organisation, I agree with Senator Rowlette that this new Red Cross organisation should work in hearty co-operation with existing ambulance societies.  There is no reason why that should not be so.  The Red Cross Society exists in England, and also the St. John Ambulance Society.  I do not anticipate any difficulty at all in regard to that matter and when this Bill becomes law it is my intention to get together various people who are interested in this type of organisation and to consult with them as to the future, to thrash out a set of regulations that will meet the situation here, and when that is done, to invite representative people to form a Red Cross central committee.  I do not anticipate any difficulty in getting a very representative committee comprising people from all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Senator that it would be a very bad thing if it were taken for granted that this Society is going to be financed by the State. That is not the intention.  It is intended that it will be a voluntary organisation, carrying out its work by means of subscriptions voluntarily given to it, and anything the Government will do, in times of peace, at any rate, will merely be to provide it with a certain small sum of money which will enable it to set up its offices and cover its initial expenses.  Apart from that, it will have to be run on a purely voluntary basis, and I think that if we get a good committee, forming the central authority of the organisation, going, they will be able to raise sufficient money to enable them to carry on their ordinary peace-time work and to do good work, as similar organisations have done in other countries.  The Taoiseach, in the Dáil, mentioned some of the magnificent work carried out by Red Cross organisations in other countries.  In the case of one catastrophe in America they raised some tens of millions of dollars.  I anticipate that, with a good committee which I see no difficulty in <Col N="231" /> getting, this society will be a success, and that it will be able to raise, by means of voluntary subscriptions, all the money that it requires.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide that the widows of certain officers who died since 1932 will be covered in the same way as if the regulations had been made immediately the Bill of 1932 passed.  In 1932 we passed a Bill empowering the Minister to make regulations.  These regulations were laid before the Dáil and approved by the Dáil.  The regulations provided that, where officers died in the service after a certain number of years, their services entitled them to a pension.  It took a number of years to get the regulations drafted and agreed upon.  In the meantime, four or five officers died in the service.  We are providing that their widows will be covered by the regulations and will be entitled to a pension.  Another thing that we are doing in this Bill is this: we are safeguarding the pension rights of an <Col N="232" /> officer who was transferred to the Civic Guards.  In the 1932 Act we safeguarded the rights of officers who were transferred prior to that date.</P>
      <P>I think that is all that is in this Bill. The basis of it is to provide that no one will suffer by the delay in framing the regulations which the Oireachtas empowered the Government to make in the Act of 1932.</P>
