      <P>I rise to protest against what appeared to me to be an extraordinary and unparalleled development on the amendments that were submitted last evening.  I was amazed at the amendments and surprised at the speeches delivered by Senator Professor Tierney, Senator Johnston, Senator Alton and Senator McEllin.  If I interpreted the last speaker correctly, he appeared to me, from his remarks, to have become more English than the English themselves. One would infer from his speech that Gaelic culture was going to improve at the tea table in Downing Street.  I said I was amazed at the speeches delivered.  They appeared to me to be the very negation of the rights of the people and the very antithesis of what we heard so much about yesterday&mdash;the rights and principles of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago there was very considerable and, I might say, acrimonious discussion in the other House on the question of the increase of salaries.  Opinions were fairly evenly divided, and I believe that those opinions were a correct reflex of the general position through the country.  It seems to me to be an unheard-of policy and principle, in view of the condition of things, to find gentlemen here in this House moving an alternative and submitting a definite increase on the considered judgment of the Executive Council and the definite passing by this Chamber of the Bill giving <Col N="588" /> an increase to members.  When I spoke here on Tuesday I did not talk in an antagonistic way.  I showed no bitterness whatever.  I tried to clarify my position by saying that personally I agreed with the equities of the Bill, but that I was considering a very large and preponderating section of the people whom I have represented in public life on various public bodies for 30 years.  I was considering them and what I considered their incapacity to pay.  I said then, rather apologetically, that the gentlemen who happen to be Senatorial professors, if you like, did not know the real position of the rural community.  I have no doubt about it now.  Judging by their speeches last evening, they know nothing about the conditions as they obtain in the country at the moment. Had they known them in the same intimate association as I do, they never would have attempted to face what was the considered judgment of the Executive Council in setting forth the Bill in the other House.  Let us try, Sir, to look at things as they are, and not as they are often represented to be.</P>
    <P>It is only a few months ago since, I presume, many of those in this House found themselves on different and opposing platforms during the general election.  The people of one Party, the Fine Gael Party, were on the platform, criticising, perhaps too critically, the policy of the Government since they came into office.  I suppose there is a tendency to exaggerate in such matters, but, at any rate, they pointed out and tried to impress upon the people the bad agricultural economics of the Government.  They submitted a policy that if and when they were returned to power they would give to the most depressed and most important section of the community total relief or total derating. They also promised from that platform that they would give to the farmers of the country long-term and easy loans&mdash; a perfectly proper thing in my opinion &mdash;in order to give them an opportunity to rehabilitate their position, to restock the many derelict farms, and to give them an opportunity to normalise their position and the general position <Col N="589" /> of agriculture.  That was broadly the policy enunciated by the Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>What was the policy enunciated by the Fianna Fáil Party?  They cited first of all the many beneficent and useful changes that had been effected in general policy in the country.  They told the people, and very properly, that the industrialisation of the country connoted prosperity and employment among large sections of the people, and consequent better conditions for the farmer.  They pointed out that the economic war was now settled, that the markets that were at one time &ldquo;gone for ever, thank God,&rdquo; had been restored, and that the outlook for the future, while they admitted there was general depression, was bright, inviting and promising.</P>
    <P>Why do I say this?  To show that both Parties, both the Fine Gael Party and the Government Party, realised correctly the condition of that large section of the people, the agricultural community.  That has been further vindicated by the Government Party, because they have decided, not without due reason, to set up a commission to receive evidence and to formulate legislation by way of a remedial change to help what must be, to them, the convincing depression amongst the farmers of the country.  The Minister for Agriculture, even in this House, quite recently said that even long before the decision of the commission would be known, steps might have to be taken by the Government to introduce, in a kind of <i>ex-parte</i> way, in order that it might be applied immediately, some relief so as to rehabilitate the position of the agricultural community. We heard from the other platform, and we also heard in the House, encomiums and congratulations to the agricultural community for the manner in which they stood up to their responsibility, for the high sense of patriotism they displayed, and for the sacrifice each and every one of them made.  The eulogy even terminated with such expressions as that they were in the front-line trenches.</P>
    <P>I ask you, Sir, what has been done for them since?  They have been largely the victims of the economic war.  Have <Col N="590" /> we seen any economic ambulances going to bandage their wounds, to help them to convalesce and return to normal activity again?  Not a thing has been done.  The outstanding fact is that expenses and taxation are gradually and definitely being piled up on public bodies.  Quite recently An Taoiseach, and others responsible in the Government, gave an indication to us in public bodies that, in the estimate that is being prepared for the financial year 1939-40, public bodies must make provision to anticipate A.R.P. or air-raid protection.  The chairman of my council, from information he received, told me last Saturday that it would incidentally mean an increase of 1/- in the £ in the rates in my county for that financial year or in the aggregate £24,000.  We must, I suppose, be prepared for these Hitler demonstrations&mdash;that tyrant of the world, that man who evidently has his roots set in the bourgeois nationalism of the nineteenth century, who has insulted democracy, who has denied Christian rights and liberty of conscience, denied social justice and ignored the whole social programme based on Christian and Catholic philosophy enunciated from time to time by the different Popes.  But we have to meet that menace.  We see the result of it in Russia and in Spain.  The votaries of it seem to have got their inspiration in hell and we must meet them, too.  The campaign he has promised and visualised seems to be more sinister and more exterminating than even the Paganism of old.  We, in our county too, have done much to aid the policy encouraged and enunciated by the Government.  Last year we raised a loan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that conditions in my county are analogous to conditions in other counties and I am trying to point out that taxation is such that it should be perfectly obvious to Senators that they should seriously consider opposing the imposition of any further taxation until the condition of the country has been remedied or relieved.  I want to point out now, Sir, that last year we raised £250,000 in order to co-operate with the Minister for Local Government in finding homes for the poor&mdash;a perfectly proper thing to do.  I supported it in the most active way possible.  We have built 1,000 cottages for the poor at a cost of £250,000.  We further made an investigation into all the wants of those living under hovel conditions in the towns in my county.  We have decided in fulfilment of the wish expressed from time to time by the Minister for Local Government to build 500 more.  That amount, in the aggregate, represents £692,000, or 2/-in the £, so that, added to the 1/-already referred to, the two represent a charge on the rural ratepayers for these essential services of 3/- before we can do a normal piece of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things show the condition of the rural community in my county.  I mentioned on the last day that we had to dismiss ten rate collectors, not, mind you, for lack of energy, not for any slackness of work on their part or because they did not try their very hardest to collect the rates from the agricultural people, but because they had not closed the first moiety of their collection which should have been closed in April.  The Minister, I understand, sent down an inspector some day this week to inquire the reasons.  That position shows clearly and definitely the condition of the general taxpayers and ratepayers in the county.  I believe that the same position of affairs exists in every other county.  Therefore, I repudiate definitely and distinctly the motion moved by Senator Alton.  I consider it a very improper motion.  He might very well have left the position as it is so far as these salaries are concerned. The figures in the Bill before us for Ministers' salaries have, I am <Col N="592" /> sure, been carefully considered by the Government.  They have already received the imprimatur of the Dáil and, I understand, of the Seanad last evening.  The Senator might very well have left things at that instead of suggesting an increase which the people, owing to their condition as I have explained it, will be unable to bear.  I ask the Senator who has moved the amendment to remember that there is a limit to the capacity of the people to pay, and a limit to the endurance of the people to suffer.</P>

      <P>In the few remarks that I have to make I hope to keep to the amendment before the House. Senator Madden, I think, was not the only member of the House who wandered somewhat from it.  I thoroughly disagree with another Senator who did not quite keep to the last Bill when it was before the House. I repudiate the suggestion he made. It was one that, I believe, he will get very little support for.  I refer to Senator Tierney who suggested that we should abolish proportional representation in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of fault was found with the proposals in the Bill that we discussed yesterday.  It was stated that the Government, in that Bill, did not follow out the recommendations of the Shanley Committee. That committee did not recommend any increase in the allowance for Deputies.  While a great deal of praise has been lavished on the Shanley Committee for not making any recommendation on that, we find a different tone adopted in the House in reference to the Shanley Committee's recommendation to increase the salaries of Ministers.  Notwithstanding Senator Madden's denunciation, I intend to support the amendment.  I would point out that the Shanley Committee which recommended an increase in Ministers' salaries was composed of professional men, hard-headed business men and farmers.  I want to emphasise the fact that the majority on that committee was composed of <Col N="593" /> farmers, of men who can claim to represent the country just as much as those who are now denouncing the recommendations of the committee.  No member of that committee would recommend the spending of 1/- of public money foolishly.  In recommending an increase in Ministers' salaries, they did so solely and entirely in the belief that it would be for the benefit of the State.  I can say that the farmers on the Shanley Committee were as enthusiastic in recommending the increase as any other section of the committee.  The committee was of opinion that a salary of £2,250 a year was a proper one for a Minister of State.  They felt that he should have such a salary as would enable him to maintain a standard of living that would be in keeping with his office, and that would secure him from anything in the nature of financial embarrassment during his period of office, and, further, that suitable provision should be made for him when he relinquished office.</P>
      <P>These were the considerations which induced the Shanley Committee to make their recommendation.  It was not that they thought anything of the particular persons in office to-day, of those in office in the past, or of those who will occupy office in the future. The prime consideration with them was that those occupying the offices of Ministers of State should suffer in no way from financial embarrassment during their term of office.  Very many important people came before that committee and gave evidence.  We had evidence to the effect that we have certain people in this country earning incomes of more than £10,000 a year. We threw our minds back to those men who occupied office as Ministers in days past, many of whom were class fellows of the men now earning the big incomes I have mentioned.  We came to the conclusion that the latter had no more brains than many of our ex-Ministers.  Yesterday, I heard Senator Sir John Keane say in this House that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce had lost his vocation: that, had he devoted himself to the law, he would have made a wonderful advocate.</P>

      <P>An advocate is employed in good cases as well as in bad cases.  He has to take whatever comes along, so that all the greater credit is due to him if he has a bad case and wins it.  I strongly recommend the amendment to the House.  I believe that if Senators consult their better judgment it will be carried by a big majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, with Senator Counihan and others, that salaries of £3,000 a year for the Taoiseach, of £2,500 a year for the Tánaiste, and of £2,250 each for the Ministers are not at all excessive, and if we were sitting around a table considering this question, isolated from all surrounding circumstances, I would prefer the figures that I have just mentioned to the figures that are in fact provided for in the Bill.  Nevertheless, I am opposing these recommendations, and I am doing so because I think it is unsound and bad statesmanship to isolate this question from all the surrounding circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the first place, there is the question of the conditions in the country. We all know that this is a time of peculiar distress, but apart from material conditions, the psychology of the people is a fact to be taken into consideration as any other fact.  The people have not been prepared psychologically for so complete a change in their attitude about the remuneration of Ministers as to jump from the £1,000 per year, that we were told of a very short time ago as being appropriate, to the figure suggested by the Shanley Committee. They are especially not prepared for that if it is to be done by our action here in the Seanad against the judgment of the Government themselves as to what the country will stand for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feeling in the country is very strong.  During the last few days I have been ploughing a somewhat lonely furrow in this Chamber but, so far as the country is concerned, I am not in any such position of isolation <Col N="595" /> if I am to judge by the letters that I receive from County Roscommon.  It is not statesmanship to exasperate the people, even if that exasperation be unjustified, in a time of great distress, to a point where they get into almost a revolutionary frame of mind.  If you are going to make a drastic change in everything that you have been teaching the people about the proper way to remunerate such posts, then it ought to be done gradually and with the necessary education. That education has not been carried out.  It ought to be done, as I have said many times over, with full notice in advance of a general election and not just after a general election when we are beginning a new Parliament with the hope that in four years' time the subject will have been forgotten by the people.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has to be taken into account in connection with this proposal is, in spite of what Senator Tierney has said, the subject of pensions. He says that pensions and salaries are quite different things, and that in determining what salary we should give, we should forget all about the pensions.  From the point of view of an academic onlooker they may be two different things, but the payment of them falls on the same back, and the benefit of them goes to the same people.  If you take into account that pensions are going to be given here, not as a matter of grace, not just in cases where they are needed, but given as a matter of right, irrespective of a man's wealth or poverty, then you have to take into account that that does add considerably in effect to the remuneration that you are giving to Ministers. They would have to have a very much larger salary if they were to save up enough to produce in a few years' time the pension that the State is proposing to give them.</P>
    <P>The other extern circumstance that I feel you have to take into consideration in determining the figure of the Ministers' salaries is that these Bills contain other proposals.  We have a chain of proposals which, in the view of the country, and in my view, are closely connected with one another.  I, at any rate, am not disposed to give <Col N="596" /> the Government everything that they are asking for in directions where I entirely disagree with them, and also to give them much more than they are asking for in a direction where in other circumstances I might be inclined to be generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intrude in this debate but for the statements made by Senator Counihan speaking for the agriculturists of the country.  I could not let them go by the board.  I am in touch with a very large section of the agricultural community, and I think I know what their feelings are.  I have not met a single person who would be prepared to subscribe to these recommendations.  I was not here during the debate on the Deputies' allowances, as I was engaged elsewhere trying to set up machinery to fix the price of the 1939 beet crop. I will come back to that later.  I want to say that I appreciate the work which Ministers are doing.  I think it work of the first magnitude.  I think that both the present Ministers and the former Ministers are all very capable men.  But I do feel that it is not the Ministers or the Deputies or the Senators, but the men and women behind the Ministers and the Deputies and the Senators who will make or mar this country.  The people on the land are the backbone of the country.  They are the people who create the big proportion of the wealth of the country. They have been through, not seven lean years, but nine lean years.</P>

      <P>They have carried the industrial revival on their back, they have borne the brunt of the economic war, and they have had, as well, to stand the shock of a world depression which wiped out whole countrysides of farmers in Europe and America.  These sentiments are pretty much in accord with the views expressed by Senator Baxter, but I should like to take exception at least to a couple of statements he made.  I should like to do it as gracefully as I possibly can.  I should like to draw attention to the statements which he made that boots were made in Cork which would give anyone rheumatism.</P>

      <P>Statements like that do not add to the wisdom, decorum or dignity of the House, and I am sorry that a man like Senator Baxter has allowed himself to make these statements.  I now come to the question of beet, if I may be allowed to do so.  Every member in this House has wandered over a wide realm, and this may be looked upon as a domestic issue.  I think it has a bearing on the question under consideration. I believe Ministers are entitled to good salaries, but the time is not opportune for increasing salaries.  When agriculture&mdash;our main industry&mdash;is put upon a proper basis will be the time to be generous with Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A day or two ago, I and others were trying to set up machinery to fix the price of the 1939 beet crop.  I am sorry to say these negotiations broke down.  I do not see much hope of a satisfactory arrangement which would induce the beet growers to produce sufficient beet to keep the factories going during the 1939 season.  If the four factories close down, 600 people <Col N="598" /> will be put out of direct permanent employment while thousands will be put out of casual employment.  The railways, which the Government are so anxious to save, will be left without business.  Some stations on the G.S.R. derive more revenue from the carriage of beet than they do from all other sources put together.  A year ago, we tried to induce the powers that were to give a price for beet which would induce the people to grow sufficient to keep the four factories going.  We failed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should not have intervened in this debate but for one reason.  I was very much impressed last evening with the arguments advanced by proposers of these recommendations, but I notice that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is omitted from the recommendations regarding increases of salary.  That may have been merely an oversight.  As there is every indication that this House will become more important than the Dáil, there may be greater demands made upon the Cathaoirleach for the social activities and those other things which have been referred to than upon those associated with the other House.  I think that the Chairman of the Seanad should be included in these recommendations.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator McEllin, in his address last evening, who said that the revival of social activities and the making of the necessary provision for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries might be a good thing for the country.  He mentioned that there might be a revival of the breakfast-table talks in Downing Street.  According to the figures in these recommendations, I can see a danger in that.  I think that these figures do not go far enough.  Suppose we had these early morning talks with regard to this horrible anomaly of Partition and you had the Prime Minister of Ireland going up to Northern Ireland to have breakfast there, you would also have the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland coming down into Ireland for breakfast here.  The salary and prequisites of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland amount, roughly, to £15,000 a year.</P>

I can clearly foresee the danger of Ireland being absorbed into Northern Ireland.  You might have the worm gobbling up the duck.  For that reason, I intend to oppose these recommendations.  I do not think that they go far enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that these recommendations and most of the speeches we have been hearing during the last couple of days are really out of place.  The fundamental law quite obviously intends that matters relating to finance shall be controlled practically entirely by the Dáil.  In so far as we have three weeks in which to make recommendations, I take it that the idea is that we might merely advert to some consideration overlooked in the other House or discover some flaw in a Bill which it would be useful for the other House to have an opportunity of further considering. These recommendations and most of the speeches&mdash;the long and irrelevant speeches made both yesterday and to-day&mdash;are, to my mind, quite out of place.</P>
      <P>As this recommendation has been put before us, I should like to indicate that I, for one, would be entirely in favour of it if it were a proposal coming from the Government.  I object strongly to a number of things said by Senator MacDermot.  He suggested yesterday in relation to the other Bill that the Shanley Committee was much better able to direct its recommendations to the common good of this country than the Government is.  He did not attribute the fact to what I might call the natural corruptibility of the members of the Government, but to the system by which the Government comes into office.  If the Senator were right and the system by which a Government comes into office induced it to put other considerations in front of the common good, it would be criminal for us to maintain that system.  I think that the argument of Senator MacDermot was quite absurd. It was a condemnation of the whole system of election to suggest that any body of upright men, put into the position of being responsible for the common good, must naturally and necessarily, in these circumstances, direct themselves away from the common good to considerations of saving their faces or their natural pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just a few minutes ago the Senator talked about what you have been teaching the people, and he says that there <Col N="601" /> would be psychological reaction and that this teaching must be done slowly.  Now, I presume he did not include me in that view&mdash;I am quite content that he should say anything offensive that he likes to say about the Government&mdash;but if it is a fact that the Government has been teaching the people that appalling doctrine of envy, of contempt for the public thing of the State, and of contempt for those who are associated with the control of that public thing, then I think that the sooner the Government beings to undo that pernicious teaching, the better.  I think that Senator MacDermot was most ill-advised in urging them to refrain from admitting their crime&mdash;if I may use that word&mdash;that they committed in the past, and should rather urge them to a speedy repentance and an immediate effort to rectify the wrong they have done.  He suggested that this change in the people will have to be brought about gradually with the necessary education.  It does seem to me that our acceptance of this amendment fulfils that gradual and necessary education because I judge, from the attitude of the Minister here, that no matter how, or by what majority or otherwise, we might support this amendment, the Government will refuse it, and the mere fact that men in this House, guided only by consideration of justice and the common good in this country, have faced up and taken the odium of going against the ill-informed opinion in this country and the propaganda that went on some years ago will be a first step towards that necessary education.</P>
    <P>Now, as to the merits of the proposal itself.  I approve of it for two reasons: one, because I recognise that on account of this idea that has been preached so largely in this country of that absolute equality of condition that the poor man in the street can look with envy on and denounce anybody who, belonging to a different order of society, has certain material goods that the other man, in his particular order of society does not possess, I think we must recognise here that you are going to have a certain hierarchy in society and that, in the interests of the State, it should be recognised that those who are responsible for the Government of <Col N="602" /> the State occupy the very pinnacle of that society and that that position of theirs requires that certain conditions should obtain in their lives.  I am satisfied, myself, that the stipend given to Ministers at this moment is such, first, that at the end of their term of office, if they have actually fulfilled the conditions that their office requires, and if they do not possess any private source of income, they will go out of office financially embarrassed, or, secondly, another point is that if they go out of office and a time comes when they could be reappointed, I think that many men who are eminently desirable to occupy the position of Ministers of this State would necessarily have to refuse to take office. I can think of two men in the Dáil at this moment as to whom, if there should be a change of Government, anybody nominated by the Dáil to be Prime Minister would have to hesitate as to whether or not he would ask them to be Ministers, knowing that by doing so he would be asking them to injure their own position, to injure the position of their families and to injure their own future prospects.  So that, on the grounds of justice, it is unjust to propose that men should take over the responsibility of the position of being the heads of this State and being responsible for the government of this State and, at the same time, to provide them with a stipend that does not enable them to maintain the position we have imposed upon them. Secondly, in the interests of the common good, which is required, notwithstanding that contempt which has been preached to our people, it is desirable that we should get, for the position of those who are responsible for the well-being of this State, the very best men available.</P>
    <P>I can think of two men who are dead, and of two men who are still alive about whom if I were to become Prime Minister to-morrow&mdash;God between us and all harm!&mdash;I should have to hesitate before asking them&mdash;or, at least, before asking the two men who are still alive and in the Dáil&mdash;to take up the position of Minister of this State.  I should have to hesitate, because I recognise that if I were to <Col N="603" /> ask them to become Ministers I would be asking them to go against their own natural interests and accept a sacrifice in the public service.  Consequently, on these two grounds I think that if this recommendation had come from the Government I would certainly have accepted it on the ground of gradually undoing that hideous campaign that appealed to the cupidity and envy of the people of this country.  It would be a very good thing for us in this House to indicate that if and when the Government&mdash;I am not trying to be offensive now&mdash; has the courage to recognise that that would be the right thing to do, they would have people here who are ready to share with them any unpopularity and to share with them any abuse that might come from those who are seeking to promote an ill-informed propaganda, and that there are others of us here who would stand over such a proposal by the Government.  Consequently, as this proposal has come forward, I am prepared to support it, but, at the same time, I feel that we in the Seanad have to recognise that the fundamental law of this country indicates that these Finance Bills are almost entirely a matter for the Dáil and that for us to come here making long speeches and bringing in amendments or making proposals which must necessarily have been adverted to by the Government and by the members of the other House is a mere waste of our time.</P>

      <P>I think it is rather strange that I should so suddenly find myself in agreement with Senator MacDermot, but I am in agreement with him with regard to this particular recommendation, at any rate, and I intend to oppose the amendments.  I believe that the ideas of the Government are really enshrined in the Bill, and while I am not fully in agreement with Senator Fitzgerald I believe that it is out-stepping our duty completely if we are going to try to insist on Ministers accepting more than what we do know is their idea of what is necessary at the present time.  I realise also that there is considerable feeling in this House in favour of an increase in <Col N="604" /> Ministerial salaries, and I believe that it is very complimentary to the Ministers in office to think that, even in the ranks of those who are politically opposed to them, they have so many admirers or so many people who believe sincerely that Ministers are entitled to a greater remuneration than they have at present.</P>

In my opinion, there is no more necessity for pushing the thing any farther. We have a fairly good idea of what the Government attitude in this matter is.

      <P>At all events, I am one of the Senators that Senator Madden said did not know anything about the state of the country.  Let me tell the Senator that I was born and reared on a farm.  When I was a schoolboy I milked cows and did farm work, the same as the other children in the country do and because of my business I am in touch with the County Dublin farmers and know the situation well.  In June last I was down the country where I was born and reared and let me tell the Senator that things are very different in the country now from what they were when I was a boy.  The country people are much better off and much more prosperous than when I was a schoolboy. The Senator says he represents <Col N="607" /> County Limerick.  Is there any county in Ireland that has been spoon-fed as much as County Limerick has been? Limerick is a butter-producing county. It is a dairying county.  I know how the people are living in this city.  I was nominated as a candidate for this Seanad by a city association.  I was a candidate of the Municipal Association and I think it is time that somebody in this House should stand up and speak for the dwellers in the towns and cities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard Senator O'Callaghan to-day telling us about the farmers' nine lean years, but we heard nothing about the nine fat years when we in Dublin had to pay as much as 4/- a lb. for butter.  We grinned and bore it and paid our way.  It is time that both sides of these things should be dealt with.  I had thought that I <Col N="608" /> would get some support from my friends of the Labour Party, but their leader seems to be tired of this.  Now I come to the question before the House, the question of the salaries of Ministers.  I think on that matter the point should be&mdash;what salary is adequate to meet the services rendered? That question should be considered outside of any individual case no matter to which side the Ministers belong.  It should be a question of the value of the services regardless of the Party to which the Minister belongs.</P>
      <P>When I hear of the salaries paid to Ministers, I naturally make a comparison between the salaries paid to them and the salaries paid to people in commercial life.  We have in Dublin a city manager who is paid £1,700 a year.  Will anybody tell me that the services rendered by the Dublin City Manager can compare with the services rendered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Will any sensible man tell me that these services are equal, or that the city manager is giving the same service to this country as is the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  I do not think anyone will say that.  Because of that fact I do not think there is anything very outlandish in the recommendations before us.  I believe Senator Alton directed his full attention to this problem.  I have an open mind on this question.  As to the point made by Senator Quirke, that the Ministers themselves did not look for an increase, I think that it is quite possible that they may have done so, but that they left it to the better judgment of the people here to deal with the situation.  In making the comparison I have made, I think I am dealing in a very comparable manner with the whole situation.  I think it is clear that the man holding the position of city manager of Dublin should not be paid as large a salary as the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the other Ministers.  Such a state of things should not continue.  That is my view of the situation.  I do not intend to detain the House further.  Senator Tunney is very uneasy here, but before I sit down I want to deal with Senator Tunney.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to keep the House very long on this matter, but I feel there are some things which perhaps ought to be said before we proceed to a division, if we are to proceed to a division.  I can quite understand and appreciate the action of Senator Alton in putting down those amendments. He was a member of the committee which was given a rather difficult and, as it transpires, a rather thankless task, and which did that job with great diligence, and produced a comprehensive report.  It is quite understandable that Senator Alton, as a member of that committee, should come forward now with amendments to put the recommendations of the committee into legislation.  There is, however, in connection with those amendments just one general point to which I should like to refer, and that <Col N="610" /> is that the Bill itself which is before us departs from the recommendations of the committee in certain respects. Taking Senator Alton's amendments together they would have the effect in certain cases of giving certain persons the benefit not only of what the Minister is giving them, but of what the committee intended to give them as well.  I think in the case of Parliamentary Secretaries the report does not recommend pensions, but does recommend an increase in salary.  The Bill gives them pensions, and Senator Alton is now going to give them an increase in salary as well, so the matter would need, I think, some further consideration and adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not speak at all on this matter were it not for the fact that, like Senator Tierney and like most other people, I have a particular hobby which I should like to ride.  In the first place, either in connection with Ministerial salaries or Deputies' allowances, I do not understand at all why people should have come to regard £1,700 in the one case and £360 in the other as sacrosanct figures, which have in some mystic way a binding validity from which we must not depart, and a departure from which must hardly even be discussed.  I remember when the figure of £1,700 was fixed.  It was fixed in 1922, and I have never been able to discover from any person who was then a Minister&mdash;nor from myself who got the same salary&mdash;by what process the figure was arrived at.  Quite recently I made a diligent inquiry into the matter, and I entirely failed to find how the figure of £1,700 was arrived at.  I can say this, that at that particular moment of great stress and of great difficulty, and of full-time work for Ministers, not a single Minister took any interest, good, bad or indifferent, in what salary was being fixed.  If the figure had been fixed at a lower scale it would have been accepted; if it had been fixed at a higher scale it would have been accepted.  But at that particular moment, let us be quite clear about it, those who did fix it had no knowledge at all of what Ministerial office was like.  They had no knowledge <Col N="611" /> of what its responsibilities were like, although at that moment they were very great.  What I mean is they had no knowledge of what the responsibilities would be like in a normal period.  No effort was made, and no effort could have been made, to fix a figure which would allow Ministers to discharge their duties with ease of mind, and which would allow them to play whatever part it is considered right they should play in the life of the country.</P>
    <P>There was a subsequent enquiry into that matter; that was in 1928.  That enquiry was vitiated by the fact that it was an enquiry composed entirely of members of both Houses, and by the fact that at that particular moment the campaign which has been referred to here&mdash;I do not want to refer to it further&mdash;a campaign of slander and abuse in connection with the figure of £1,700, was in full swing.  Therefore, that particular committee in 1928 came to no conclusion at all, practically speaking, on those matters.  But if the figure had been fixed at £2,700 instead of £1,700 I do not think one extra word of abuse on the matter would have been spoken.  The figure of £1,700 came in for as much abuse as if it had been £2,700.  Within a more recent period a different kind of enquiry was ordered in different circumstances and after considerably more experience, and for my part, while the figure in the Shanley Committee's report in the general circumstances would not be exactly what I myself would recommend if I were sitting down to make a recommendation, I do agree with Senator Alton and others who have spoken that one can hardly take a more reasonable view than to say: &ldquo;Here is a committee which looked at this matter in an impartial and non-political way, and came to certain conclusions; we ought to accept those conclusions.&rdquo; For that reason, I personally would be prepared to agree&mdash;without reference to the personnel of the present Ministry, but taking the general question of Ministers' salaries&mdash;to accept that particular figure, but I should like to say that I disagree entirely with the suggestion made by some speakers here <Col N="612" /> that you are going to get a more honest Minister for a salary of £2,000 than for £1,700.  I do not think you will.</P>
    <P>Though not explicitly stated, there is a kind of implication that you ought to pay Ministers a higher salary in order that they should play a more prominent part in what are called social activities.  Now, a Minister has three very important functions to perform; one, the administration of his office; two, instruction in advance, and debating legislation in both Houses of the Oireachtas; and three &mdash; most onerous of all&mdash;defence of his policy in the country and preservation of his own seat in his own constituency.  I certainly would not like to go into a Ministry and get a salary which carried with it an implication that as well as doing all those things I should have to take part in social activities to which perhaps my own personal inclinations would not lead me.  I agree with Sir John Keane that social activities and hospitality depend upon the heart and head rather than upon the purse, but of course Senator Tierney was quite right when he said that a purse of a certain length is the <i>sine qua non</i> in the City of Dublin for any kind of social life.  I entirely agree with that. The increased salary suggested here is an increase which is given to Ministers not so much to put in their pocket as to spend, and there is no way of controlling that kind of thing by legislation. I am not referring to the present Ministers, but, speaking generally, if you take any group of people some of them will get £500, put it in their pockets and keep it there; others will spend it intelligently, and others very unintelligently, but you cannot really cope with all those things.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the poverty of farmers, the price of beet, and so on, but it seems to me that one of the most difficult problems facing us and one of the greatest signs of poverty in the country at the moment is the complete absence of the rise of any new young people in polities.  I would be prepared to double or treble Ministerial salaries if I thought&mdash;I do not think it, mind you&mdash;that it would do anything to induce younger people to take a greater interest in polities. In those debates, and in ignorant talk <Col N="613" /> for many years, there has been a great deal of abuse of politicians proper, but it is to be said with regard to those who are now in control of polities in the country in the two main Parties, the present Ministry and their predecessors, or indeed in the three main Parties, that they came into polities on a wave of national enthusiasm in or about the 1916 period&mdash;I use the word for want of a better one&mdash;and the greatest poverty, at the moment, is that no other people appear to be coming up at all.  To my mind that is one of the greatest signs of poverty in our public life.  In the other House, apart from the Front Benchers, I can only name one man and, I think, he is a Cork man&mdash;Senator O'Callaghan will be glad to hear that&mdash;who could be regarded as in any way giving Ministerial promise.  If an arrangement could be made to meet the situation I would be glad.  I fear that a great deal of harm has been already done by a certain type of politics, and by a certain type of ignorant abuse of politicians generally, which will make it difficult to get people of that kind to come into politics at all.  Senator Quirke was quite astonished that I agreed with Senator MacDermot, and he will be more astonished at my agreeing with himself, that this is a matter which ought to be one of Government decision and Government responsibility. In spite of what Senator Douglas said, I sympathise with Senator Quirke's view as to taking all the recommendations together, including the one which proposes to postpone the coming into operation of the Bill until after the period of office of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the merits, and in the circumstances, I think we could not do better than to accept the recommendation of the committee.  It must be remembered that the Bill itself departs from the recommendation of the committee in certain very important particulars, but that this House, with its very limited powers, should run deliberately counter to the decision of the other House on the expenditure of public moneys, and to the decision on which the other House was advised by the Government in office, seems to me to be going rather far.  I find considerable <Col N="614" /> difficulty in seeing this House take a decision in that direction.  Senator Quirke said that a good deal had been done to ventilate this matter and that it was done without any of the recriminations we had in the past.  It is a great sign of national progress that we can now discuss this matter calmly.  If we have passed from the era of propaganda, that is all to the good, and the question can be settled in the life of this Dáil.  But to pass a recommendation advocating an increase in public expenditure, which was not adopted by the Dáil, but was passed in the teeth of the Minister, that is a decision we should hardly reach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I should have intervened earlier in this matter except, perhaps, that it might be thought I was unduly trying to restrict the rights of the Seanad to debate every proposal which comes from the other House for consideration here.  In connection with this matter, I may say that my personal views are on record and are, I think, well known.  The decisions upon which this Bill is based are Government decisions.  Of course, there is collective responsibility in these matters and it is my duty to say to the House that I feel it would be futile for the Seanad to make any recommendation on the lines now proposed. Accordingly I ask Senators who have made themselves responsible for the recommendations not to press them to a division.  The recommendations would not be supported by the Government in the Dáil and, in these circumstances, I do not think they would have any chance of becoming effective.  I also ask the Seanad to bear in mind what Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Hayes said regarding the respective constitutional prerogatives of the other House of the Oireachtas, and of the position of the Seanad in regard to public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on this matter and, having heard the Minister, I do not think that is any reason why I should not say what I intended regarding the recommendation. I can only assume that the object aimed at in a matter of this kind is, not to think of what applies <Col N="615" /> to Ministers or to the Government, but to do what the Seanad feels is in the best interests of the community.  Having listened to the debate, I come to consideration of the recommendation with an open mind.  I feel from what I heard from the mover of the recommendation, and from those who supported it, that they have convinced me that it has everything to commend it; that it has all the merits, and that the Minister and the collective wisdom of the Executive Council failed, and that the advice given us by Senator Quirke and Senator Hayes had no merit whatever.  I feel that the mover of the recommendation has made a case which has, so far, been unanswered.  I know that it is not popular in this, or in the other House, to stand up and suggest increased expenditure, but I feel that, having declined to accept Senator MacDermot's recommendation reducing the allowances to Senators, and in view of the comparatively small sacrifice of time demanded, it would be invidious for this House not to recognise that members of the Executive Council occupy whole-time offices.  As Senator Tierney pointed out they are the accepted leaders of the nation, and it is entirely wrong that they should be placed in the position of having to make personal financial sacrifices. Any of us who know the financial responsibilities imposed upon Ministers, realise that it is a very tight fit to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that Ministers consider it their duty to discharge their obligations, social and otherwise, and also towards the Diplomatic Corps, and I think it would be very bad for the future of the nation if we allowed them to do so at financial sacrifices to themselves.  Therefore, I think the House is quite right in having regard to the very special obligations that are imposed for the time being on Ministers of the State.  In considering this question I am not thinking of the present holders of office, but of those who may hold the high office of Ministers in the future.  No one has pointed out in the course of the debate that whereas Deputies and Senators get an allowance for income-tax, Ministers are paying income-tax on the <Col N="616" /> excess remuneration they receive over and above their allowance as Deputies or Senators, as the case may be.  As far as I know, no member of this House has been a member of the Executive Council, but Ministers are paying income-tax upon the excess emoluments they receive over and above the ordinary allowances. Taking the emoluments paid, we know that Ministers are in a very much worse financial position than ordinary members of the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to take this view, especially as I am the only speaker to give my views after the Minister's appeal.  I think the Minister and Senator Quirke gave no reason why the House should not come to its own decision.  This is a matter of great importance and all the merits were with the mover of the recommendation. It seems to me that those responsible for the recommendation have converted the House to their view, and if it is left to a free vote there will be a considerable majority in favour of it.  While none of us want to put members of the other House to inconvenience by having to attend the Dáil during Christmas week, the interests of the nation are far more important than the convenience of members of either House. If Senators feel that the recommendation should be carried I do not think that the House should be deterred by considerations of convenience or inconvenience from pursuing the recommendation.</P>
    <P>I hope that those who have made themselves responsible for putting down this recommendation will not withdraw it but, on the contrary, that they will, if necessary, put it to a vote of the House.  I feel that one of the strongest arguments for the recommendation was the speech made by Senator Hayes.  He told us that this question of salaries for Ministers was considered in 1922 and at that time the Ministers would have accepted the responsibilities of office at a salary of £1,700 or £2,700; in other words, the salaries fixed for Ministers in 1922 were fixed in the most haphazard fashion.  If the salaries were reasonable for 1922, I <Col N="617" /> suggest that they are totally inadequate for Ministers in 1938. There is no point of personal admiration for the Ministers of the last Government, or the present Government, involved in this matter.  It is purely a question of what is best for the country, no matter who occupies Ministerial office.  It seems to me there has been no argument advanced to influence any member of this House in voting against the recommendation.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, if this is pressed to a division I feel it will be my duty to give the recommendation my fullest support.  I realise that the Executive Council, or the Ministers composing it, have a natural delicacy in a matter of this sort.  But I also feel that our present Minister for Finance, for instance, will not be a Minister for all time and I suggest we cannot decide this matter purely from the point of view of the delicacy of the Minister or the Executive Council with regard to what remuneration should be paid them.  I feel this House will be doing a great deal in the interests of the community if, when coming to a decision, they will not be influenced by considerations as to the convenience or inconvenience of the members of the other House.</P>
    <P>We have observed the attitude on the part of Senators with regard to their own remuneration which, in my opinion, is on the excessive side.  We here are part-time people and I think that to condemn whole-time Ministers, who are unquestionably inadequately remunerated, to accept what is an entirely inadequate scale of remuneration, is most unfair.  This House has a place in the Constitution of the country and it is a matter for Senators to decide for themselves on the subject of this recommendation.  I feel that Senators ought not to listen to the plea of the Minister, Senator Quirke and others and certainly the movers of the recommendation ought not to withdraw it.  Let them put it to a division in the House.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the increase of national expenditure. The amount involved in this matter <Col N="618" /> is merely a decimal point in relation to national finance.  There was no occasion to refer to the lot of the unfortunate people who are unemployed, or to mention the fact that certain of our workers are not paid what some of us might consider an adequate wage. Those things have nothing to do with this question of what should be an adequate sum for our Ministers.  The fact that there are sections of the community underpaid should not be advanced as a reason why those comprising the Executive Council should be underpaid.  If they are adequately remunerated, the prospects are all the better for those less fortunately placed, that their circumstances will be properly considered.  I do not think this House ought to take a lead from the other House, from Senator Quirke, or for that matter from Senator Hayes, even from the Minister himself.  I think the House ought to give its own considered opinion on this recommendation. Having listened to the question debated so well yesterday and to-day, Senators ought to come to their own conclusions, and they ought not to be deterred from registering their decision by any of the appeals from one side of the House or the other.</P>

      <P>Senator Brennan goes to great rounds to suggest that I put up no argument, made no case against the recommendation, and neither did Senator Hayes.  My attitude is that you do not have to make a case or produce arguments.  I stated that we would be outstepping our duty.  It is just the same as if a man asks you if you will take a drink and you say you will not have it.  You do not have to produce an argument why you will not have the drink.  The Minister has given the opinion of the Government on the matter, and I think it is a ridiculous thing to try to push it any further.  I take it that Senator Brennan and some of the other speakers have been influenced in this matter by the additional recommendation, which we have not come to yet.</P>

If that is so, it is quite obvious that they look forward to the time when there may be a change, and when it may be desirable or advisable to increase Ministers' salaries.  The Ministerial salaries have been reviewed in the past and can be reviewed in the future, and there is no necessity for us to try to push something on the Government which the Government do not want.</P>

      <P>Some of the arguments advanced in connection with this recommendation were very flimsy. I would like to point out to Senator Quirke that this is an autonomous Assembly and it has the right to its own opinions, and if it is going to be of any use it must express its opinions frankly and freely.  We are grown men and our minds are our own. Some of us, being poor professors, may not have agricultural experience. I apologise for being a professor.  I belong to a section of that society which claims a few scholars.  There was traditional respect for scholarship in this country in the old days and I wish to hide myself under that cloak. But perhaps we have only room for sense in this particular Assembly, and Senator Madden is its spokesman. Pardon me for this little deviation, but I would like to assure the House again of the thorough and exhaustive way in which the whole question was <Col N="620" /> examined by the Shanley Committee. I do not claim to be a particular light in that committee, but there were some very fine minds at work and very devoted investigators, and we had before us a mass of evidence, much of it confidential, to which I cannot refer, which convinced us that the figures we found were, as I said, rather erring on the moderate side.</P>
      <P>I would also assure the House of the sincerity of the motives of those who have put forward these recommendations. We only want to get the opinion of this House.  We believe that our views are right, that we have taken no narrow view but a big and far-seeing view and that it is a view that will be endorsed by the thinking section, the more thoughtful and farseeing section of the community.  If, as Senator MacDermot says, the country wants a psychological education, we are giving them one now. We are giving them a headline and I believe it is a headline that will be subscribed to and will be followed some day, maybe some day soon, but it will ultimately be adopted.  As I said before, I think these proposals do contain a very large element of political wisdom and real statesmanship. It is, perhaps, arrogant to say that.  You will forgive me, but I feel rather strongly on the subject and I would like the House to believe that we did not put up these proposals in any light-hearted way or through any desire simply to put up an amendment at any price.</P>

      <P>I should like to discover on what basis of calculation the Government arrived at the figure seven as a suitable size for a Party to be subsidised by the State.  It appears to me that out of a House of 138 members, seven is an extraordinarily small percentage.  I have, therefore, proposed as an alternative the figure &ldquo;15,&rdquo; and I suggest for the consideration of the Seanad whether any Party that has not a larger volume of opinion behind it than is indicated by numbers below 15 is, on any theory, suitable for subsidisation by the State.</P>

      <P>At all events, it is a figure which I think I can say was arrived at just as arbitrarily as the figure seven in the Bill.  On the Second Stage I opposed Part III of the Bill, and gave my reasons as to why I thought that political Parties should not be subsidised.  I held that they should not get legal status within the parliamentary system, and I still hold to that view.  I believe that political Parties should find the means, the finances and the methods of prosecuting their political affairs without receiving any assistance from the State.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, I opposed Part III of the Bill, and I still continue to do so.  I do not believe that funds provided by the State should be allocated to the purposes set forth in Part III of the Bill, but I do say that if such funds are to be allocated for that purpose, then I do not think that the Party with which I am associated should be deprived of the benefit of the section. I hope that I may still refer to our Party as a Party, despite the fact that it has already been described and referred to here as &ldquo;a bit,&rdquo; but nevertheless bits make up the whole and are very important.  This recommendation seems to me to be class legislation.  It is well known that the Labour Party in the Dáil is composed of nine members.  Therefore, to fix the figure at 15 would deprive it of the benefit of the statute when passed. That may not be the intention of Senator MacDermot, but he cannot escape the logic or the arithmetic of the recommendation standing in his name if it is carried, and subsequently endorsed by the Dáil.  I have no hesitation in saying that the intention is to deprive the Labour Party, which is the third Party in the Dáil, of the <Col N="625" /> advantage of the section.  If Part III is entirely eliminated I will agree with that, but if it is to stand it should stand as a whole.  For these reasons I take the strongest objection to the recommendation.</P>

      <P>Surely the argument in favour of seven is this, that apart entirely from the principle involved in Sections 9 and 10, and whether we agree with it or not, if we are going to put that number into operation it should benefit a Party of rather small dimensions, such as a Party of seven. If, in fact, there is in the Dáil a Party with a greater number than seven, a Party of say ten or 15, then it is the Party which has the greater number of members which will come in for the benefit of, these sections. Therefore, there is no objection in fixing the figure as low as seven, because if the Second Party has only seven members it gets the benefit of the section.  If, on the other hand, the Second Party is greater than seven then it gets the benefit. Therefore, there is no objection in fixing the figure at seven.  The fact that the Labour Party, which certainly ought to represent an important section of the community, did fall as low as seven, would be, to my mind, at any rate, a sufficiently good reason for fixing seven as the minimum figure, but it is a minimum figure and that is a point in its favour, I think.</P>

      <P>Senator MacDermot asked how we arrived at the figure seven.  We knew, of course, that the Labour Party with a membership of nine was the Third Party in the House.  We discussed several figures and came to the conclusion that a Party of seven should be the smallest to get the allowance.  In doing that, we were not thinking all the time of the Labour Party.  We were thinking of the Labour Party at the present time, but we were also thinking that perhaps a Farmers' Party would come along and oust the Labour Party in a short time and become the third largest Party in the House.  The whole point about seven is this, that we did not think that a Party which <Col N="626" /> had not at least seven members should get the allowance.</P>

Let us, for the sake of argument, assume that you have in the Dáil two other Parties outside the two big political Parties &mdash;Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Let us say that the Labour Party is there, and that after the next general election there may be a new Farmers' Party.  Suppose there is a new Farmers' Party and that it has a membership of 12, and that at the general election the Labour Party increases its strength from nine to 13. In that situation the Labour Party would be the one to benefit by this legislation because it would then be the third largest Party in the House.  For argument's sake, again let us assume that the new Farmers' Party only numbers four and the Labour Party five.  This legislation would then come into operation, and neither of these Parties would benefit.  I think the Senator should withdraw the recommendation.</P>

      <P>Might it not be an inducement to some other Parties to split and divide and get this nice little apple for themselves.  Senator MacDermot advanced no argument in favour of the number that he has in mind, and I think he ought to.  I do not know that there is any special advantage or blessing attaching to the figure 15 that does not apply equally to the figure seven.  I should like to hear him upon it before I say any more. Senator Tierney mentioned the fact that Senator Lynch talked about class legislation.  If we can interpret the mind of Senator MacDermot, he would put our class at a very low level.  Therefore, coming from him with that mentality, so far as we can interpret it, it is class legislation.  The fact that the Labour Party has a small number in the Dáil at present does not enter into the matter.  They may increase or diminish, just like Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or anybody else.  At the moment, it looks as if it were definitely and viciously pointed at the Labour Party. Hence, Senator Lynch's comment that it is definitely class legislation&mdash;take away this money from the Labour Party and you will impoverish them, and by that impoverishment you will possibly wipe them out altogether.  I believe that is the mind of Senator MacDermot, and, consequently, we had the comment of Senator Lynch regarding class legislation.  Senator Tierney, with all his education, and all the advantages he has had through his university and so on, is not as well qualified to interpret the mind of Senator MacDermot as some of us on these benches.</P>

As regards my putting down this recommendation, I said why I put it down when I first got up&mdash; in order to find out the process of mind by which the figure seven has been fixed.  The whole notion of subsidising political Parties in this way is so obnoxious to me, and, indeed, so unintelligible, that I could not myself think of a system on which to decide what the appropriate number was. Actually, I drafted this very hurriedly and put down 15 almost at random.  I thought afterwards that  I had to do it again I would put down a percentage instead, and say that the Party should not be less than 10 per cent of the Dáil.  In any case, though I have little hope that Senator Foran will believe me, I assure him that I did not, in fact, put this recommendation down because of vehement dislike of the Labour Party.  The Minister at one point started to rise and say something.  I do not know whether he is still proposing to intervene or not. Might I inquire whether he is or not?</P>

The only hope for the Labour Party, with which on class grounds I have considerable <Col N="629" /> sympathy, is that it should be able to claim that it is not a Party of class but a Party with much wider ramifications and leadership which would not claim at all to represent one particular class in the community.  I think the people sitting on that bench at the moment represent more than one class. However, I do not think it is fair to Senator MacDermot that motives should be attributed to him, and I think that Senator Foran, besides being unfair to Senator MacDermot, was a little unfair to the Labour Party.</P>

Certain members vote against their Party and continue to vote against their Party perhaps in every division or on a number of divisions. Does not the continuity of the Party come to an end?  It looks very complicated. At what stage is the question of the continuance or numerical integrity of the Party going to be challenged?  It looks to me as if it will not work, but I suppose that has been thought out.</P>

      <P>Senator MacDermot apparently has put down this recommendation in the spirit of a gentleman adventurer.  He put it down and then he thought he would sit down and wait to see what would turn up to support it.  I think that is not treating the House or the Minister fairly.  If the Senator finds some virtue in the number 15 he ought at least to let us into the secret and let us know what were the first principles the consideration of which led him to that conclusion and not ask us to justify the number seven.  If I were to discuss <Col N="630" /> this matter in the same way as the Senator discussed the Bill which was passed by the House yesterday, I would refer to the report of the Shanley Committee.  I would say that they had been guided by considerations of good sense and that their recommendation in this matter was based upon experience.</P>
      <P>It is true that there has been in the Dáil since August, 1923, an organised body of opinion which has shown itself to be fairly cohesive, and which does represent a section of the population which holds certain broad economic principles which it tries to apply politically.  That happens to be the Labour Party.  There was another body of opinion at one time which did not show itself to be quite so long-lived as the Labour Party was, but at one period it was vieing with the Labour Party for the position of second largest Party in the Dáil&mdash;that was the Farmers' Party.  I should like the Senator to consider the position of the Labour Party which is still with us.  If the Farmers' Party is not with us, perhaps the Senator has a certain responsibility for that also.  The Labour Party, in August, 1923, had approximately one-tenth of the representation in the Dáil.  In June, 1927, the representation of the Labour Party rose until it was one-seventh.</P>

      <P>In September it fell until it was something less than one-tenth. Then it fell to one-fourteenth, then to a little more than one-fourteenth, and then it went up until it was about one-twelfth.  At present it would be about one-fifteenth.  At any rate, what is indicated here is that there has been, as I said, a cohesive body of political opinion always represented in the Dáil and always taking its own viewpoint.  That viewpoint may have on occasions coincided with that of the Government or on others with those of the Opposition.  It was, however the viewpoint of a body of public opinion in the country which was represented in the Dáil, and which was able to have it represented there in the form of an organised Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the present proposal is to enable such a fairly cohesive <Col N="631" /> body of opinion, when it has secured representation in the Dáil, to be able to voice effectively its views upon the legislative proposals which come before that House.  I have not touched on the history of the Farmers' Party, but it coincides roughly with the history of the Labour Party until the moment when it was absorbed by the Centre Party and disappeared out of present-day politics.  Looking at the history of these two sometime small Parties, and bearing in mind that during the period when they were in existence, they had been able, though not as effectively as the larger Opposition Party in the Dáil, to discharge this function of criticism, it was obvious that the smallest number of individuals who had seriously undertaken the function of organised criticism in the House was seven. Accordingly, we came, after consideration of this question, to the conclusion that if we wanted to give effect to what we thought was in the minds of members of the Shanley Committee, and if we wanted to give effect to this principle of helping those who represent any substantial section of the community effectively to criticise Government measures, it would not be safe to fix the minimum at less than seven.  We considered that it would be rather ridiculous to go below that number, but we fixed the number as low as it could be fixed without becoming ridiculous.  That is, I think, the only basis upon which one can proceed in a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>Because it is not possible to provide for every possible contingency.  The Shanley Committee, who considered this matter from another point of view, represented what we might not claim to be so familiar with&mdash;the general public opinion with regard to the matter. There was a very large non-political element on that Shanley Committee and, whatever views the Senator may have, the committee did recognise, as ordinary citizens of the State, that <Col N="632" /> there was need to do something to make criticism of Government proposals effective.  They thought it would serve the public interest if that course were taken.  We deferred to that point of view to the extent that, having examined the question of the minimum size of the Party for ourselves, we came to the conclusion that it would not be safe to depart from the views expressed by the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation raises the whole question of making these payments to opposition Parties.  I should be the last to decry the value of opposition and criticism of Government proposals&mdash;especially careful and informed opposition and criticism.  If I believed that what it is proposed to do was going appreciably to add to the value of opposition and criticism in the future, I should think that there was more to be said for this proposal than, in fact, I do think.</P>
      <P>I take the view that, in the first place, there is something inherently unsound, even ridiculous, in the State paying one set of men to govern the country and then providing subsidies to encourage and facilitate other men to impede them in the government of the country by systematic opposition. There is a marked distinction between the opposition that adjusts itself to every measure that arises and every proposal that is brought forward and deals with such measure or proposal on its merits and an opposition conducted on Party principles and on systematic lines.  It seems to me that such systematic opposition is something the State has no business to subsidise.  Whether it is a thing that one thinks essential to democracy or not, it is still a thing which it is not the business of the State to subsidise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of maintaining free speech, in opposition, in a country like ours, or in any democracy, can hardly <Col N="633" /> be overstated.  As I said the other day, the dictator throws opposition leaders into concentration camps.  What I wish to indicate by this recommendation is that there is a middle course between throwing opposition leaders into concentration camps and actually going out of your way to create systematic opposition by subsidising the persons who conduct it.  I do not know what evidence there is that, even if you want systematic opposition, such a subsidy is needed.  The amount which it is proposed to provide seems to be very small in proportion to what the revenues of a Party necessarily are, and there is nothing to ensure that the mode of application of this money, if it is provided, will be such as to improve the operations of the Party in the sort of way in which the Minister expects it to improve them.</P>
    <P>It has not been found in the past that, on the occasions when it has been urgently necessary that men should stand up and oppose the Government, it has been the Party system which has, in itself, provided that opposition.  It has been one of the glories of democracy in various countries that men have been found on great occasions to take a line disliked not only by a portion, or the generality, of their Party, but a line disliked by the majority of their countrymen.  It has been done over and over again in England, but when it has been done it has generally cut across Party lines and has not been the result of the Party system at all. You had people, for example, opposing the Boer War in England, and nearly breaking up the Opposition Party by doing so.  You had some opposing the Great War and much embarrassing their Parties by doing so.  You had opposition in England to the attitude of the Government about the Civil War in America, and there, again, it cut across Party lines.  You had opposition to the Crimean War.  You had opposition to the wars of the French Revolution and to the War of American Independence.  It was extremely valuable that men should have the courage to get up and say unpopular things and be accused of being unpatriotic or, perhaps, even traitors, because they believed that they were speaking on behalf of justice and truth, <Col N="634" /> but it has not been the Party system that has provided that.  In practically every case, where it has been done, men, in order to do it, have had to run the risk of actually disintegrating their Parties.  Consequently, it seems to me that, if the object is to be sure that that sort of thing will be available in our own country, the subsidising of political Parties which carry on systematic opposition is not the way to go about it.</P>
    <P>There is another sort of criticism that has been found of great value here and elsewhere, and that is the kind of criticism that depends on technical knowledge and intimate familiarity with the particular domain of which a special measure treats.  If a Bill affecting some special class of productive activity is introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, most valuable criticisms are often forthcoming from members of the Dáil who are familiar with the subject.  There again, however, such criticism always cuts across Party lines and is not going to be made any fuller or any better informed by providing the Party leaders with the kind of financial assistance with which this Bill proposes to provide them.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes talked about the desirability of getting able young men into politics.  I wonder if he would consider the question whether the failure to get able young men into politics is not in some part due to the Party system.  My own feeling is that for a newcomer who wishes, out of whatever motives, high or low, to come into politics here, it is a great deal more easy to be accepted by a constituency than it is to be accepted by a Party gathering in that constituency. That is more or less of a digression.  I was just reminded of it by seeing Senator Hayes there.</P>

      <P>I question, however, whether, if we are eager to get young men into public life&mdash;and I think we ought to be&mdash;a great deal does not remain to be done in influencing the Party caucuses throughout the country on the subject, <Col N="635" /> because they are always much more apt to choose the tried and true with long national records, especially if they are considered to be in financial difficulties.  That again raises the problem that I have spoken of yesterday and which, I need not say, I am not going to return to now&mdash;that of pensions for ex-Deputies, a question that sooner or later, I believe, is going to be a serious one for us here if we turn politics into a profession.</P>
      <P>Now, the specific quality of opposition provided by a Party is this: that its object is to turn the Government out.  I admit that that does not apply necessarily to a small Party like the Labour Party, a Party of seven members or nine members.  They may not wish, at any rate in the near future, to be a Government themselves, and they may play the part of honest broker and get as much as they can of the things they want from any Government that may be in office. But the main object of a main Opposition Party is to turn the Government out of power, and their attitude towards practically every measure that is capable of influencing the fate of the Government, depends upon their calculations as to how it can be made to contribute to the great end of turning the Government out of office sooner or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It follows that the most absurd inconsistencies take place.  The present Government is not in the position of having been in office before and then having gone out of office and come into office again, but even so it has provided us with extraordinary inconsistencies that are not due in any way to lack of the sort of clerical assistance or scheduled information that I understand it is the object of this Bill to supply.  What happens under the Party system is this: that, when people are out of office, they make statements quite recklessly, and, so far as they have bureaux and secretarial assistance, they use that assistance, not to amass all the facts affecting a particular subject, but to make a selection of facts that will be useful for propaganda purposes.  The files of a Party office are necessarily full of newspaper cuttings whereby a <Col N="636" /> speaker can go out and crush somebody in the opposite Party and a Party office is necessarily a propaganda machine.  I am not attacking it as such, but I merely say that, in my opinion, every penny you give to a Party is not a penny given for bringing truth to light and providing dispassionate, reasoned, impartial criticism of this or that measure, but is a penny given for adding to the effectiveness of a propaganda machine; and to add to the resources of a propaganda machine directed against the Government of the day seems to me to be an extraordinary purpose to which to devote public moneys.  If Parties have a volume of opinion behind them in a country, it is to that volume of opinion that they ought to look for the necessary funds to carry on their work.</P>
    <P>We are now suggesting that we shall subsidise exactly two Opposition Parties, as there happen to be just two Opposition Parties at the present time.  I cannot help feeling considerable curiosity as to what would have happened if the Centre Party had continued to exist and whether the recommendations would have been to subsidise three Opposition Parties.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the majority report.  I am wondering what the Government would have done or what the majority in the committee would have recommended if there had been three or four Parties in the House.  It seems to show lack of imagination to believe that what exists at the present time must be the right arrangement.  So far as in them lies, they are stereotyping for all time the present lay-out of the Dáil by subsidising the two Opposition Parties that are there and by fixing on the figure seven, which is the lowest to which one Opposition Party has ever sunk in numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a Government is democratic at all, there must always be opposition, <Col N="637" /> free opposition and free criticism. That is the difference between us and the totalitarian States and it is vital. There must always be opposition and free criticism if we are to have a democracy.  But there is nothing vital about the system of Parties; there is nothing vital about the principle of systematic opposition, by men waiting their chance to turn out the Government.</P>
    <P>There is no more democratic country in the world than Switzerland. Democracy has been overthrown in many countries because of the Party system and the intense animosities which the Party system has provoked. Consequently, there are some who think that it would have been better for the world as a whole if the type of democracy that was adopted by Switzerland and has lasted a very long time had been the type copied generally throughout Europe rather than the type in Great Britain. We have copied the British type of democracy.  I am not suggesting that there should be any immediate attempt to get away from it.  What I am suggesting is that we should not do anything that would close the door to evolution in another direction.</P>
    <P>The day might well come here for a Government to be formed not out of the members of one Party but out of several Parties and for the Government not to depend upon the acceptance of this or that measure for retaining office.  Each measure would be considered on its merits, and the Dáil would be free to throw out that measure without knowing that if it did it would throw out the Government too.  I think so all the more because of proportional representation. The last general election for the first time gave an Irish Government a satisfactory majority.  I thought it was impossible under proportional representation for a Government here to get a satisfactory majority.  They got it at the last election because they fought the election under very exceptional and favourable circumstances. I do not know whether a Government will ever again succeed in getting a satisfactory majority under proportional representation.  My view is <Col N="638" /> that proportional representation will not work if we have the same Party conflict and Party system that they have in England.  A logical consequence of proportional representation is some sort of proportional government.</P>

      <P>I do not like the expression myself, but it is really the doctrinaire idea of democracy gone mad.  The only virtue I see in it, and I was surprised to find it is a virtue that appeals to the Government, is that it has been adopted by the British Parliament with its long and honourable record of democracy and the Parliamentary system.  But I am surprised that this Government should follow in their footsteps in a matter of this kind, and go further and stereotype two Parties.  The Minister for Finance says the object of giving salaries to Party Leaders is to ensure criticism and close examination of measures.  He draws, I think, a most fanciful picture.  I am very amused at getting such a very fanciful picture from what we know Ministers themselves must really think about things&mdash; a picture of the Government, with all the aids and advice it has, and with the best intentions making a mistake which would cause the country damage, and their being saved from doing that by the criticism of the Opposition.  I should say that picture is purely histrionic. I do not believe that the Minister thinks it works that way. What I do see is that when these mistakes are made from time to time in legislation, or rather when the intentions of the Government are not carried <Col N="639" /> out, an immediate Bill amending that legislation is brought forward.  I know, and the Minister knows, that the Government has only to right and repair the mistake by amending the Act passed, if necessary by retrospective legislation.  I do not believe that the encouragement given to criticism is to have the effect stated by the Minister.  I do agree that criticism is valuable, but do you get proper criticism by subsidising a sort of corporate Party?  Surely not.  You get opposition in that way, I agree, but opposition and criticism are two entirely distinct things.  Are you likely to develop criticism by giving the Party Leaders an allowance which will be spent by the Party Leaders and Party managers at their own discretion?  We have to concern ourselves with what happens, and not with all those doctrinaire, shop-window views of debating societies. What happens?  Supposing they have a rather insubordinate member in a Party&mdash;and we all know Parties that have&mdash;perhaps a very intelligent member, whose views cut across Party policy.  Are they going to allow that member any say in or control of the expenditure of that money so as to get the information he may want in order to sharpen and help his criticism?  Not a bit of it.  The whole thing is going to be spent according to the well-known and well-tried methods of Party discipline. You are going to encourage opposition, but opposition is not all you want.  You get that without any subsidy.  What you want is intelligent criticism.  The means of intelligent criticism should be available to every member of the House, whether he is in a Party or not.  That has been done, as I mentioned before, in other countries, and it should be done here. You should have some officer attached to the Parliament with experience of parliamentary government, experience of drafting Bills, and a knowledge of where information can be obtained, whose services would be available to any member who wants to make a case or criticise a measure.</P>

At that time, I was given considerable help by Dr. McCarthy.  I may say that Dr. McCarthy, who is now dead, was frequently in close co-operation with Sir Horace Plunkett.  Dr. McCarthy was a person who made a very considerable study of the Governments of other countries.  He had legal experience, and he was able to advise a member of the Legislature on the drafting of private Bills and on such questions as that to which Senator MacDermot referred&mdash;the methods in Switzerland. If he had not the information, he would know where to find it.  There is no such person attached to the Oireachtas.  That is the way in which, to my mind, criticism as distinct from opposition should be encouraged, and not by means of giving grants to Party Leaders to be expended through Party machinery.</P>

      <P>I do not deny that the committee considered it, but I do not accept the suggestion that the committee was infallible.  Again we come to the question of criticism.  We want to get criticism from all angles. The committee has made some recommendation, and I am venturing to put another point of view.  If this matter is carried to a division I personally intend to vote in favour of the deletion of this section.  Apart altogether from the merits of the matter, I really foresee very considerable practical difficulties in the manner in which the section is going to work.  A Party comes into the Dáil, and the Chairman of the Dáil says: &ldquo;That Party is entitled to an allowance.&rdquo;  When does that Party cease to be a Party? Supposing certain members of that Party&mdash;not always the same members &mdash;are consistently or frequently voting against it on matters of policy, is it then the duty of somebody to raise the question, and ask that the matter be examined by the Chairman of the Dáil?  Should he then in his wisdom decree that the Party has ceased to exist and that the allowance should cease?  I do not claim to be a lawyer, but I do say that I feel sure, with all due respects to the Parliamentary draftsman, that a clever lawyer would have a great deal of fun within the ambit of this section if questions which must be obvious to all of us were raised.  If the terms of this section were not carried out when the Party ceased to exist, I do not know how the financial machinery would operate. Would it be the duty of the Auditor-General to say that the money had been paid improperly?  A number of questions arise.  That is the reason why I object to the section.  I object to the thing on principle, and I hope the House will reject it.  There is one further point&mdash;I do not know whether I am in order in mentioning it&mdash;and it is that I think this is a case of packing, bringing in an important point of principle under cover of a Money Bill.  In taking power to pay certain allowances to Party Leaders, a very important fundamental point of principle is brought into a Money Bill, and removed from the effective power of this House <Col N="642" /> to amend.  I wish to make a strong personal protest against it, and I hope this packing will not continue.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a question.  There can easily be a Third Party and two of the same number. If Senators throw their minds back to the 1923 period it will be remembered there were Independents who, when they went into a Party were Farmers and Labour.  When the Minister was talking about the numbers at that time number 13 came to my mind.  I do not know if they were Labour or Farmers, but I should like to know what happened then.  As to the irrelevant discourse of Senator MacDermot, I entirely disagree with his whole conception of a democratic Parliamentary régime.  The word opposition is applied to a Party, and the Senator said that its functions and all its actions were to try to throw out the Government.  A Government is a continuity.  A Government exists all the time though it consists of different members from time to time.  In fact, that is not true.  If you look over the history of the Dáil you will find that an enormous number of Bills are introduced and that a tremendous lot of them are passed without a division.  In relation to Bills on the Committee Stage, some with 100 clauses, only an odd clause was challenged or an attempt made to amend.  The function of an opposition is not to oppose.  The main reason I see for it is that you have this democratic system whereby first of all, a man becomes a member of the Dáil by virtue of the greater number of votes he received.  The Dáil is formed and later becomes a machine which works on the majority votes of a certain number of those who were returned.  Senator MacDermot's conception is to denounce what he calls the Party system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does he want?  He talked of Switzerland, but he did not tell the whole story.  I was present at election meetings in Switzerland where Party feeling was very strong.  They were elections in regard to Cantons and not <Col N="643" /> in relation to the Federal Government. In Switzerland Party feeling was particularly strong in Cantons, and the divergence between the two Parties was enormous.  Looking over the history of the Dáil it will be remembered that two years ago the Government brought in a Bill one day, withdrew it the next day, and then introduced a new Bill, by reason of the fact that the Opposition had more able legal advice than the Government had at that time.  That is how I interpreted it.  Most clauses in Bills are passed without opposition. I think it is quite compatible with the whole idea of opposition that each Bill should be considered on its merits.  It would be indefensible if the Opposition opposed a Bill merely for the sake of opposing, rather than for the reason that they thought the net effect of its introduction would be detrimental to the well-being of the country, or for the reason that they thought certain amendments would make it more beneficial. When there is talk about having means of intelligent criticism made available for members, that is part of the idea, somehow or other, that all over the country individuals disassociated from each other, and having no unity of mind, could be elected and then form a Parliament.  That is absurd.  The moment you have a system of numbers, Parties must inevitably result.  When you talk about the abolition of regulated Parties by only subsidising one Party, that Party is a Totalitarian Party in a State where only one Party is recognised.  When there is talk of doing away with the Party system what is meant?  You mean either having incoherence and disunity amongst members of the Parliament, or you mean to have all in one Party, and only one Party tolerated. What is the position here?  You have one Party in power.  What is the main purpose of an Opposition?  To my mind it is so that at any time, for one reason or another, the people may say it is desirable that the members of the Government be changed for other members; that the policy of the Government be changed for a different policy, and that there should be available to the people an alternative to the personnel of the present Government. <Col N="644" /> That seems to me to be the main purpose of an Opposition.  We know that legislation depends upon majority, and if members of the Government Party are intent on pursuing one course they can do so merely by voting.  Consequently it is primarily a matter for voting.  When there is talk of non-Party opposition, what would you have?  In various places each one goes up and stands for the Dáil, putting his own views and propounding various policies to the people.  What happens? Then they come together and begin caballing behind closed doors, and, having made certain promises, offer to sell the promises they made to the people in order to come together.  The difference is that on the one hand you have a number of people agreeing as to what they think is of vital importance to the people; agreeing on what they think should be done in relation to any matter put before the people they asked for support.  Everyone disagrees with everyone else on some point.  You have first to have agreement and then to come together to decide what action there should be in relation to important matters.  That is done openly before the election.  The alternative to the Parliamentary system is to have all independent members with no association before election.  That merely means that after election they come together and make a deal amongst one another in order to form a Government. It seems to me that once we have what is called the democratic system as we understand it, then the Party system is right and necessary, and to argue against it would be to argue for one Party in the State or else no State at all.  Looking over the history of the Dáil, it will be found that about two years ago a Bill was introduced by the Government and withdrawn the next day.  I think that was as a result of legal criticism from our side.  It will be found in the history of the Dáil that a number of Bills were amended to conform with proposals put up by the Opposition.  A main Opposition Party is necessary to the State, not to oppose everything the Government brings in, but to give the people an alternative body to whom it might turn when it wished for a change in the personnel of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> As to the payment of a second Party, that is a matter upon which I do feel strongly.  I think if you have a second Party it has to follow, to judge and criticise all legislation which comes forward, and not only to judge legislation, but to judge it at all times in the light of the existing circumstances of the country, and the general well-being of the people in the changed circumstances which time brings about.  To do that it is necessary to have a staff.  One man who is Leader of an Opposition cannot be expected to be able to look up newspaper files, Blue Books, debates in the Dáil and various types of legislation. He needs a secretary.  I think Senator MacDermot, the moment he went into the Dáil, set about getting and paying a secretary.  If a man is not able to do that out of his own pocket he can only do it as a result of public and private subscription.  It seems to me that all the arguments were based on a doctrinaire view and divorced from reality.  If it is said that it is a pity to have the country divided into various Parties, the answer is that that is inevitable. There is a realm of opinion on which the people's judgment will differ.  It is right, once you have the present system, that there should be on offer to the people a direct alternative to the personnel of the Government.  It is right that the alternative Party should keep itself <i>au fait</i> and <i>au courant</i> with developments taking place in the world, and judging every aspect of policy in its totality.  It is necessary that they should have skilled paid assistance to see how these developments affect the interests of the country generally, because, from time to time, it may want to change the personnel of government.</P>
    <P>I do not commend this proposal of an Opposition too highly, but I think there is no particular harm in it.  I have no doubt, if the money is not provided out of private funds, both the first Opposition Party and the second Opposition Party will be able to carry on pretty well.  The suggestion that there is anything wrong or detrimental in the State recognising the fact that there are organised Parties, and recognising that, in the <Col N="646" /> existing régime, it is necessary and inevitable that there should be such organised Parties, is perfectly ridiculous, and is based on nothing else than the doctrinaire point of view, which takes words and divorces them from the reality of politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very interested in the debate that has taken place this evening, and in the part of the debate carried on here yesterday on the same topic.  I listened very attentively to the speech the Minister delivered on that occasion. I thought his speech most persuasive and, if sound, most convincing. But I confess I did not find at the end of his speech that he had made any impression to convince me, and I hope I am not unduly unimpressionable, of the soundness of the proposal before the House.  I listened on the same afternoon to a very brief speech from Senator Lynch, which seemed to me conclusive in its reasons for upholding the proposal that we are now discussing.  The essence of the proposal, the important part of it, the kernel of it, it seemed to me, is that it establishes the principle of the endowment of Parties, as Parties, and by giving an endowment to any institution of that sort you are establishing it as a fixed part of our Parliamentary system.</P>
      <P>We have listened to a very eloquent defence of the Party system from the Senator who has just sat down.  But I did not hear anybody attack the Party system.  It seems to me that in most of his defence of the Party system he was knocking down something that nobody had set up.  I quite agree with Senator Fitzgerald that the Party system is a useful part of our present Parliamentary system, but I do not think that anything he has said shows that it need be a permanent part or a very long-continuing part of our Parliamentary or democratic system.  It fulfils a useful purpose at the present time.  It serves to associate common views and doctrines on particular things.  That is useful in that it tends to bring what is common to a number of people before the Legislature in perhaps the best way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> But one can easily foresee, without any departure from our democratic ideas or our views on democracy or our Parliamentary system, the system that has developed in other countries, where the two or three large Parties might disintegerate.  I was rather amazed at one statement made by Senator Fitzgerald, that the only alternative to a Party system is a one-Party State or no Party at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to suggest that the Senator might have developed that line of argument, but he did not. His words, which I think I quoted accurately, were that the only alternative to a Party system was a one-Party State or no State at all.  I pointed out that the sense in which we are accustomed to use the Party system here or, for that matter, in which it is used in Great Britain, has little relation to the group system that exists in the French Parliament. I can see no evidence in favour of the very dogmatic and sweeping statement that the Senator made.  One can look forward, and some of us would hope to look forward, to a system in which our rigid Party lines would disappear, and in which there would be grouping much less fixed and static than under our present system.  The recognition, for the first time, in our statute law, of the endowment of a Party, seems to me to fix that as if it were an essential and fundamental part of our system of government.  Development very far from our Party system might take place under our Constitution, but when we endow a Party, I feel we are tending to prevent what might be quite <Col N="648" /> a natural and free development in the future.</P>
      <P>I agree with a great deal, not all, that Senator MacDermot has said, and particularly on the point he was making&mdash;and it was made also by Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;that the criticism put up by the official Opposition or by a second Opposition Party, as a Party, is not necessarily the most effective. It suffers from this disability, that it is not free individual opinion; it is not necessarily the free individual opinion of the member of the Legislature who voices it.  He would be speaking not altogether for himself, but for the Party.  In the limitations of the Party system, no matter how lax Party discipline is, the speaker's freedom is limited to some extent by the fact that he is speaking for the Party of which he is a member.  That tends to limit the usefulness of his contribution to the discussion.</P>
      <P>Senator MacDermot quoted many instances from English history of the effect independent criticism had in the House of Commons, as distinct from the stone-wall opposition that an official Opposition offers.  I think that to do away with that spontaneity of criticism, that independence of criticism, would be a grave disadvantage to our democratic system, and I think the endowment of a Party as a Party tends also to diminish the value of the criticism.  I think it is the experience of anyone who knows the working of the Legislature here, that very frequently the Minister is more willing to give an unbiassed consideration to arguments put up by an independent member, or perhaps by one of his own Party, than to those put up by the Leaders of the official Opposition.  I think that is so.  The Minister in such a case is giving full weight to what he believes to be somebody's sincere opinion, and he may not be so impressed by the observations which he might be inclined to think were put up simply for obstructive or opposition purposes.  I think anything that would tend to limit free criticism by the individual is disadvantageous to the working of our legislative machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Sir John Keane's statement as to the difficulty <Col N="649" /> of the decision about what is a Party.  I do not think the Bill makes it very clear, and I think that the Government, in drafting this Bill, have thrown over the burden of a decision and a definition on the Chairman of Dáil Eireann.  Perhaps that is a useful way of getting a quick decision on the matter, and probably a sensible decision, but it seems unfair to the occupant of the Chair in Dáil Eireann that it should be definitely imposed upon him in the statute to make a decision in that matter.  For the first time we are asked to consider what a Party is.  We give very little direction to the Chairman of Dáil Eireann as to the lines on which he is to decide that.  The terms of the Bill are not decisive enough to enable him to work with complete ease.  We leave it to him to decide for the first time what is a Party.  I think we are leaving an unfair burden on the Chairman of Dáil Eireann in that respect.</P>
    <P>It may be due to obstinacy&mdash;I suppose my ancestors are responsible&mdash;but I have not been convinced by the very excellent case that I think the Minister made, or by the case made by Senator Fitzgerald who, I think, is the only other Senator who has spoken definitely against this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather interested in this particular proposal, not from the point of view of a person in opposition, but from the point of view that a person gets when he is responsible as Ceann Comhairle for the working of a parliamentary institution. I came to the conclusion a great many years ago in that capacity that something on the lines of this particular section of this Bill would have to be done.  Whether what is being done actually in the Bill is the best thing or not is open to question but, personally, as far as the Bill and the section of the Bill goes, I would support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, Sir, I think we ought to clear our minds as to what they mean.  This is an allowance to leaders of Opposition Parties in the Dáil.  It is not a salary.  It is not for personal expenses and we will have to face the fact of how the money will be spent.  We all have some experience <Col N="650" /> of politics and parliamentary assemblies, and any of us who has had any experience will know that this money will be correctly used, and that it will be carefully supervised.  The Minister for Finance is in charge of a Department which is not too popular in the Civil Service, which has watchdogs who have now and again to take very unpopular action, but I think the most rigid officials of the Department of Finance could not equal the activities of any group of Deputies who are led by a person who will get this particular allowance.  I think we may leave it to them and I think we may leave it to the facts and face the reality that the money will be expended for parliamentary purposes and not otherwise, and that nothing will reach the private pocket of the individual or the strictly Party fund.</P>
    <P>There is another point made by Senator Sir John Keane and other Senators too, that this particular section of the Bill transgresses some principle.  I am entirely at a loss to understand what that principle could possibly be.  For my part, I recognise certain moral principles and certain religious principles, but when I hear people talking about democratic principles and the principles of parliamentary government I am rather at sea. I find it difficult to understand them clearly.  We have here adopted, roughly speaking, the British Parliamentary system and I think it was the only system we could have adopted, because it was the only system we knew anything about.  Parliamentary government is a scheme for achieving the greatest good of the greatest number in the country, and I think that it is open to this Oireachtas to revise or alter or arrange that scheme in any way that may seem good to us in a particular moment so as to make it work.  I think we can do that without transgressing any principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was whether it should be in a Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it should not be in a Finance Bill but, assuming it was in another Bill, what principle is it that arises?  This is simply a device for providing a more efficiently <Col N="651" /> working Parliament.  It may be&mdash;it is quite open to Senators to assume&mdash;that it is a bad scheme or that it will not work out correctly, but to say that it transgresses some particular principle leaves me completely cold.  I do not understand that.  For example, we had a rather long, and I will not say relevant, discussion on the Party system generally.  I could say a great deal on that, but I do not intend to beyond saying this: Senators told us that historical examples are available to show that in every Parliament in a particular crisis a certain amount of personal courage is available.  The two sections of this Bill which embody this particular scheme will not, in any way, affect the fund of courage that exists now in this Parliament and that will exist in any crisis in the future. The same amount of courage will be there.  These sections will not do anything to reduce that amount of courage and neither will they reduce the number of individuals with technical knowledge who can bring that technical knowledge to bear upon Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from theory, we ought to consider in practice what Parliament is like.  When it was my lot to become Chairman of Dáil Eireann I was entirely unhampered by any theoretical knowledge of Parliaments.  I had never read a book of any kind or description on the subject and I think it was a very good thing.  I had to find out many things as I went along. The first thing I found out was that an Opposition Party wanted to get free access to the Dáil, to the Library, to the staff, to the papers, for their secretary, a particularly able man who was then acting as parliamentary adviser to the Labour Party.  One of the first decisions I was called upon to make, apart from decisions in the House, was whether that person could have access to the Library and to the House.  I said then that he could and that for the carrying out of the functions of the Ceann Comhairle in the Dáil it was almost indispensable that the Opposition should have a habitation as well as a name, should have a telephone and secretary, and <Col N="652" /> somebody who would draft amendments and somebody to whom you could talk in the absence of other people or even in the presence of other people.  At that particular moment&mdash; there is no secret about it&mdash;the Labour Party found that that gentleman's services were of very great assistance to them.  When I was Ceann Comhairle, one of the questions frequently asked&mdash;nearly always by ladies&mdash;was: &ldquo;Will you get me a ticket for the Dáil when there is going to be a row?&rdquo;  Everybody asked me to get a ticket when there was going to be a scene.  I was never able to tell them when there was going to be a scene, unfortunately.  It would have been very much more satisfactory for myself if I could have told them.</P>

      <P>It was not my job to provide one, quite the contrary.  One of the things that struck people who came into the Dáil, even in the most turbulent period, was that the Dáil was a very dull place.  In other words, that all this Party politics, about which Senators here are so extraordinarily concerned, were not in fact occupying the main part of the Dáil's time at all. That is one of the realities we must face.  People came into the gallery of the Dáil and found the Minister in charge of a Bill in Committee.  I am talking of ten or 12 years ago and it is the same yet.  The unfortunate visitors in the gallery saw a man bobbing up and asking something not particularly distinct to the gallery and a man on the other side saying he had a particular suggestion to make.  There was some cross-talk they did not understand very well and finally a statement that the amendment was withdrawn. They did not know what the amendment was.  They did not know what withdrawing it was.  What had happened, and what happens frequently, was that the amendment was not well drafted, that the matter was not a political matter and that the Minister was promising to bring in on another stage of the Bill an amendment to deal with the point but would not take <Col N="653" /> the particular draft that was before him.  A very great proportion of the time of the other House is occupied, not with fireworks, not with politics, not with discussing, for example, who started the civil war or anything of that kind or what Deputies or Ministers said at a particular moment in a general election, but with very ordinary, prosaic, dull, but very profitable and valuable things.  I think if Senators here had experience of what was done by Opposition Parties in the Dáil for a number of years, of members of the House sitting through long, dull, dreary, but as I say, profitable Committee Stages of Bills, where no really important political interests were raised&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; in its very narrow sense in this case&mdash;they would realise the immensity of work that has to be done.</P>
      <P>One of the first things that I did in the position of Ceann Comhairle was to make the Dáil staff available to Opposition Deputies and to explain to the Opposition Deputies privately and&mdash;I have not troubled to look it up, but I think it will be found on the records&mdash;in open statement from the Chair in the House that members of the Opposition and any members of the House could make use of members of the Dáil staff for nearly all purposes.  Added to that was the fact, as I say, that we allowed the staff of an Opposition Party, both of the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party and now of the Fine Gael Party, free access to the House.  Practically as if they were Deputies, they could walk into the office, ask for a Bill, and see officials, and so on.  In other words, the recognition of the Party system, which seems to transgress the principles that are held by various Senators, has been going on for years though they never noticed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, I must say that as Ceann Comhairle I had the greatest possible sympathy for members of the Opposition who had to deal, as Senator Sir John Keane mentioned, with Land Bills.  I remember one Land Bill, an enormous one, to which there were 328 amendments, of which a very considerable number were out of order in <Col N="654" /> various ways, consequential and otherwise. I think I spent over two hours with a member of the Opposition Party going over various points, and I marvelled at his industry and knowledge of the whole business.  I had the advantage of the assistance of a skilled staff and I had the enormous advantage that as Ceann Comhairle I was not concerned with what the amendments were going to do.  I was only concerned with what they meant. It seems to me that for the doing of that kind of work there is necessary a skilled staff.  It is important Parliamentary work and there is no principle of any kind transgressed if public money is paid to get that particular work done.  I do not know whether it is due to a wilful misunderstanding of the Bill that some Senators seem to think that this money could go into Party funds and be used for Party purposes.</P>
    <P>I should like to disabuse Senator Sir John Keane's mind of the notion that this is a slavish imitation of the British.  I am not as anti-British as Senator MacDermot and if the British had something good, I would not mind imitating them nor would I mind anybody saying I was a slave by so doing.  We have imitated a number of good things which the British had. My approach to the matter is entirely uninfluenced by any British precedent. I remember the first thing we discovered when this matter was talked over with the members of our staff was that it was not done in England, but that actually it was done in Canada a number of years ago.  Now in 1928&mdash;I quote this to prove that this is not a British idea here&mdash;I myself went before a joint committee and advocated very strongly that machinery should be put into operation to assist Opposition Deputies in this way.  I mentioned that this was necessary for any Party and that it was not a political process at all in the narrow sense.  That committee in 1928&mdash;I am afraid I misled the House when I stated a few days ago that they reported in favour of this arrangement &mdash; were convinced that something should be done, but they could not find a scheme for doing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Keane, and I think another <Col N="655" /> Senator also, mentioned that officials should be made available to do this work for these people.  I went into that myself a good many years ago and I came to the conclusion&mdash;and I think anybody with experience of the Dáil will agree&mdash;that the officials of the House can only go a certain distance. I think members of all Parties up to the present moment will agree that the staff is not only an efficient one but a very courteous and obliging one, but there is only a certain distance to which they can go.  They cannot go beyond that.  I do not think that you can provide the kind of assistance which is necessary through the Civil Service.  I remember discussing that matter with the Minister's predecessor and with officials of his Department. I think the Civil Service generally would not be improved by having particular individuals placed at the disposal of Opposition Leaders.  For one thing, from the point of view of the individual civil servant, his position would be a very anomalous and difficult one.  A person who is to act as a secretary either of a Parliamentary Party or of the Leader of the Opposition, must be entirely and completely trusted as if he were a colleague. While I do not say for a moment that civil servants could not be trusted, a difficulty would arise in case of a leakage and that would be a very undesirable thing.  I do not know how you could provide assistance by way of civil servants.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane will find that quite a lot of information is provided in the Library.  The precedent was established at the very outset of the State that members of the House could go to civil servants&mdash;could go to the Statistics Department, for example &mdash;if they wanted any information dealing with public documents, whether they be members of the Government Party or members of the Opposition Party.  I think that what he has mentioned as being done in other countries has been done here through the Oireachtas staff or through civil servants, but that does not actually meet the need that requires to be met. Since civil servants should not, I think, <Col N="656" /> be asked to do this work, I see no other or better system than the system recommended by the committee and now put into the Bill, namely, that of making an allowance to the leader of the Party.  I think it would help all Parties concerned, and I think the Chairman of the Dáil, facing up to the facts and unhampered by any consideration of Party, could do the work allotted to him under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak only for one Party.  Naturally that Party has a most excellent system of doing its Parliamentary work.  The Senator thinks that the system is so perfect that it could not be improved.  I should not like to contradict him.  We are not legislating for the Fine Gael Party alone.  There may be Parties in future not as well organised and not as competent and capable as the Fine Gael Party, even without Senator MacDermot. Let us consider that dreadful contingency.  Let us assume that an Opposition comes into being that is not as competent, as experienced, nor as well served with officials as the Fine Gael Party.  It is possible that we may not be able to maintain that particular standard.  It seems to me that if there is to be at the disposal of the leader of a Party an official who will get a fairly good salary, £800 will not go very far.  It will not go much further than paying one man who must be a whole-time official, and a confidential typist.  I do not think the allowance will provide much more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Labour Party even with seven members getting a chance of showing what it can do, not by way of enunciating, in Second Reading debates, pleasing platitudes or airy principles, but by way of getting down to the most important part of the work in the Dáil, that is the Committee Stage of longish and not particularly contentious measures. Senators who have no experience of the Dáil would be astonished to find the immense amount of work there is done, and has been done, in the Dáil where Ministers and the Opposition Party are not engaged in constant <Col N="657" /> snarling across the floor of the House. That is one of the things which surprised everybody who became aware of it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am in order in referring to the Second Reading debate, but Senator Lynch gave us the beautiful theory in that debate, that a Parliament consists entirely of individuals.  If Senator Lynch had my experience over a period of years of Parties in the Dáil he would hardly agree that the Dáil is a collection of entirely separate and distinct individuals. I think on one occasion a colleague of mine in the representation of the National University in the Dáil described the Labour Party as the best regimented Party in the Dáil.  I think that Senator Lynch will recollect, in connection with a motion of his own, that there is a certain amount of regimentation in the Seanad of the Labour Party.  So that, so far as that particular theory is concerned, it does not operate at all against this particular section.  As far as I am concerned, I am not consumed with enthusiasm for it, but I do think that we ought to discuss the matter not as a question of principle but as a question of ways and means; that we ought to accept what is in the Bill and see how it will work, and if it does not work, as Senator Sir John Keane said, the Minister or the Minister's successor will not be a bit backward in coming forward with an amending Bill, particularly if he is urged from the Department of Finance to save even £1,300.  On that ground, I think we should keep the discussion purely on the basis of practical ways and means and accept this particular scheme.  I do not see for the life of me how this fortifies, or solidifies, or makes more permanent the Party system that we have and about which we have heard so much talk.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot asked me whether I thought this would induce young men to come into the Dáil.  I do not think there is any objection to young men coming into the Dáil.  I do not agree with him in what he said about the Party system, or about the big Parties objecting to promising young men coming into the Dáil.  My <Col N="658" /> experience is that if they saw a promising young man they would go a long distance to get hold of him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">

      <P>I have already expressed myself in regard to this section of the Bill, and, therefore, I do not propose to take up much of the time of the House now in saying anything further on it.  I have a very strong objection to this part of the Bill, because I feel the Parliamentary Parties are purely transitory bodies, and, that being so, they should not get a solidified position within the Parliamentary system.  These Parties which come and go are in a position to provide funds for their own maintenance and propaganda.  I think, despite all that has been said about the Party system, that these bodies can be left entirely to their own devices, to look after themselves without any State assistance whatsoever.  Now, in all the debates which I have heard on this subject in favour of these payments, no effort, I notice, was made to reply to a point that I made in the Second Reading debate, and that was that the State, under this scheme, is to be asked to provide moneys for a Party whose principles are probably anathema to a great volume of the citizens of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but at the same time you may get in your Parliament a Party whose principles are, to a greater extent, anathema to a large volume of the citizens than even those that are there at present.  Consequently, in the provision of these moneys for this purpose it seems to me that we are endeavouring to place these Parties in a new light within the parliamentary system and are giving them an entirely new status by virtue of a contribution from public funds. You are putting them in a position that is almost tantamount to that of Civil Service bodies within the system when you finance them with public moneys.  I think, first of all, that it is quite unnecessary to pay such moneys to political Parties, and <Col N="659" /> secondly I entirely disagree with the payment of these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacDermot seems never to be able to escape bias when he is dealing with matters of this character, and especially when the Labour Party seems to be involved.  Perhaps that is a peculiar bent of his mind, and that he probably finds it difficult to depart from it.  I do not think it is quite correct to describe the Labour Party, as it is presently constituted in the Dáil, as &ldquo;an honest broker.&rdquo;  I consider that a rather opprobrious term to apply to the Labour Party or to any Party.  I am not making any case for the Labour Party as such here.  I do say that when this Bill proposes to give such a Party the legal status that will devolve upon it now, and that when a sum of money is to be paid to it, that at least Deputy MacDermot might be respectful to the legislation which is before the House if he cannot be respectful to the Labour Party.  If anything may be said for the payment of this money to a political Party it would be this: that it is probably far better, although I have opposed it, that these moneys should be paid to political Parties than that such Parties should be sent begging to America or Australia for funds to carry out their Party programme and Party propaganda, as Parties in this country have been compelled to do in the past.  The Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;the present Government Party&mdash;as the Bill is drafted is not to be subsidised under it.  That being so, it is to be presumed that it has the services of the Civil Service to provide it with those services which these moneys are intended to provide the other Parties with. Senator Hayes told us that the payment of these moneys was the best method that could be devised to procure efficiency.  That was the basic argument put forward for the payment of these moneys at all.  Senator Hayes undoubtedly speaks from a very lengthy experience on these matters, and knows from that experience the efficient or the inefficient manner in which Parties acted in the Dáil when he was the Chairman of that Assembly. He went on to pay tribute to the <Col N="660" /> Labour Party for the efficient, if not excellent, work done in the Dáil by that body at one time, and said it was due to certain officials which the Party was capable of providing for itself.  I would remind Senator Hayes that the Labour Party, although it may be only &ldquo;a bit&rdquo; and may be only &ldquo;an honest broker,&rdquo; did put up moneys privately for the efficient service which that Party was capable of, and did give in the Dáil.  That being so, is there any reason why the larger Opposition Party may not also be equally well able to provide funds for its political purposes?  The only argument for this payment is the argument of efficiency put forward by the Minister, and that does not seem to me to make a complete case for it.  We have been told already that the Labour Party, as far back as 1922, was quite an efficient Party.  I am sure that in the interval it has improved in efficiency, and that to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is probably more efficient by virtue of that experience. That being so, I think the larger Opposition Party might well provide its own moneys and might well provide all that is necessary for the giving of this efficient service in opposition. Senator Hayes, I think, also said that a good deal of acrimony developed from time to time between the Government and the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not hear you very well.  We know that acrimony has developed across the floor of the House from time to time.  With the provision of this money apparently this acrimony, which I suppose we must expect still in that Chamber, is going to be more efficient.  Except acrimony dies away from our Parliamentary proceedings, as we hope it will, it will at least be more efficient in future owing to the provision of this money.  Although it has been stated, here and elsewhere, that <Col N="661" /> this money is not going to be paid to any particular person but for an office, at the same time there will be people occupying those offices, and it does seem to me that there will be a personal flavour attached to the payment which it will be hard to avoid.  Senator Hayes, in reply to Senator Sir John Keane, said it would be difficult to get service without the payment of this money.  I doubt very much if that is so.  Surely it is not outside the competence of human agency to devise something which will enable the leaders of political Parties and their followers to have recourse to a bureau of information which might be set up with this money and which would give far better service to the leaders of these Parties than they probably will be able to get by securing the services of stenographers or secretaries.  The stigma of paying a personal sum of money to these leaders of the Opposition will be removed and it will be far more satisfactory to have such a bureau, where statistical data, historical facts, and information of all kinds could be secured.</P>
      <P>If the Labour Party in 1923 were able to give this efficient service with their limited resources, then I feel sure that the State will be quite capable of organising such a bureau as will give that efficient service which the Government thinks is so essential and which it proposes to give in a way that does not seem desirable.  I would prefer to see a bureau of information set up than the payment of a sum of money.  No matter how you label it, it will still be construed as a personal sum paid to these individuals who happen from time to time to be the leaders of these Parties.  We are not living in the moon, and at election times we hear very unpleasant things said, such as: &ldquo;So and so has five or six salaries.&rdquo;  These things will be all trotted out, and once a lie of that kind is uttered, as undoubtedly it will be with all the astuteness that Parliamentarians are capable of, it is impossible to follow it up and contradict it.  The payment of the moneys in this way is not the best manner in which this idea can be followed up.  I suggest that the bureau would be a very much better idea.</P>

No matter what I say, the Labour Party will find some cause of offence.  The term &ldquo;honest broker&rdquo; is not an offensive term.  At any rate, I think it so little an offensive term that if the Centre Party had been still in existence I would, in the connection in which I was speaking, have applied it to them as well as to the Labour Party.  I was using it to distinguish a Party which is not always striving to turn the Government out of office from a Party which is always striving to turn the Government out of office.</P>

Only three offices in connection with the Oireachtas have been excluded from pensions or other allowances&mdash;the offices of Chairman of the Seanad, Vice-Chairman of the Seanad, and Vice-Chairman of the Dáil.  The present recommendation is concerned with the Chairmanship of the Seanad.  There is only one person to whom the recommendation, if adopted, would apply, but it would ensure pensions for the present Chairman and future Chairmen of the Seanad.  The person who would be entitled to a pension now, if this recommendation were adopted, was Chairman of the abolished Seanad for eight years, and Vice-Chairman for three years.  He performed the duties of Chairman with honour and credit to himself, to the House and to the State. For a number of years during his Chairmanship he relinquished £550 a year of his salary, and he should be regarded as a person eligible for a pension.</P>

The Shanley Committee considered this matter specifically and they recommended that the offices of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach should be non-pensionable.  From the information at our disposal, we do not envisage any circumstances which would justify any lump-sum payments to the holders of these posts on the termination of their offices.  The Chairman of the Seanad has not to devote so great a portion of his time to the duties of his office as has the Ceann Comhairle.  It was due to consideration of that fact that the Shanley Committee made the recommendation it did.  I appreciate the reasons which have, I presume, moved the Senator to take action in this matter.  There are grounds why the Chairman of the Seanad should be put in a position of independence.  He may, during his period of office, have to take action in certain matters in which his own interests would be involved.  Notwithstanding that, it is felt that we should not go outside the recommendations of the Shanley Committee in this case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing new to say on this subject. <Col N="666" /> As I explained during the last few days, I take the view that Ministerial pensions are not comparable with any other kind of pensions. There is no other walk of life in which a man can earn a pension for the rest of his days, a pension for his widow and an allowance for each of his infant children on the basis of service for only a few years.  At the same time, I recognise that it is in the highest interest of the people and of the State that Ministers should not be subjected to the financial anxiety of feeling that, when their term of office is over, they may not have the means wherewith to live.  Consequently, the conclusion I draw is that pensions should be given as a matter of high policy but that the people of the country ought not to be asked to give them where they are not needed.</P>
    <P>I have never been able to see that there is anything derogatory in making a confession of not being wealthy. Nobody respects anybody more because he is wealthy, and, in any case, there will be no more publicity involved than there is in other countries.  All that would be required would be that, privately, the claimant to the pension should make it known to some authority&mdash;the Minister for Finance or whatever Government authority be fixed&mdash;that his financial position was such as to make it reasonable that the country should pay him a pension.  It is very hard to decide exactly what figure to fix upon, but it does seem to me that if a man has got a large private income, or if he has, after leaving politics, become, in some other field of activity, extremely prosperous and is earning a large income, it is not reasonable that the country, just for the sake of a few years' service, should pay him a pension which he actually does not need.  It could have happened even within the past few years, if things had been just a little bit different, that one or two persons might have got into a Government as Ministers after a very short time of membership of the Dáil. They might, perhaps, have parted company with those Ministries, for reasons, good or bad, within a few years, and walked away in the position that, for the rest of their lives, they would be entitled to a pension from the country. <Col N="667" /> I do not think that is reasonable, and I do not think I am being a bad democrat or that I am suggesting anything objectionable if I say that, quite quietly and privately, those who receive such pensions as are provided for by this Bill should satisfy the authorities that they need them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment.  I see no reason why a condition which is not imposed in regard to any other pension, granted for services rendered, should be imposed in the case of a Minister.  It is quite wrong to say, and I think the Senator at this stage ought to abandon the argument which was worn threadbare and shattered in the other House, that pensions are going to be granted for short service. Some of those who will be entitled to maximum pensions under this Act&mdash;a pension of £500 a year&mdash;will have served 10 years in the Ministry, or almost 10 years.  Some of them will have served much longer, when we take into consideration their pre-Truce services in the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not a short period of service, in such a responsible office as that of a Minister, for which to grant a comparatively small pension such as is proposed. Not merely that, but some of those who will draw pensions under this Bill will contribute £350 per year to their own pension in so far as they will be deprived of a military service pension which they earned in circumstances of great personal danger and for particularly meritorious services. Why, on top of that, should this other very exceptional condition be imposed? If there is no absolute analogy to the circumstances under which a Minister leaves office&mdash;if there is no quite parallel case, you have the cases of the judiciary.  If judges have to retire from office by reason of age or ill-health&mdash;not, mind you, because public opinion has changed in regard to them &mdash;but if after five years, through age or ill-health, a judge of the High Court has to retire, he gets a pension of £416 and, if he retires after seven years, he gets £660; and a judge of the Supreme Court gets a pension of £800 after seven years, while the Chief Justice <Col N="668" /> gets a pension of over £1,000.  Nobody can say that any of these gentlemen should be compelled to come and plead poverty or even, if you like, to plead not too affluent circumstances in order that he may receive his pension.</P>
    <P>There ought to be a cessation of this sort of talk, based upon the idea that Ministers hold sinecure posts, for the whole of this agitation is based upon that idea that Ministers do not carry particularly heavy responsibilities. What body of men in this country were carrying the responsibilities which Ministers here were carrying during the last international crisis&mdash;responsibilities they are still carrying since we are not yet out of the crisis?  If there should be an upheaval in Europe, what body of men in this country would have to face the responsibilities that Ministers would have to face?  Yet, all the time, we are met with the sort of criticism that we have had here from Senator MacDermot and which has been repeated in the newspapers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>What criticism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That men should come and plead what is virtually poverty in order to receive a pension. In my view, a man who has held a Ministerial position is entitled to live in comfortable circumstances afterwards, and I do not mind saying that to anyone, because, if he has done his duty as a Minister, in my opinion he has done that sort of duty which a slave has done who has been chained to the treadmill day in and day out during his whole period of office.  During his period of office he is never able to call his soul his own, or even his life his own.  He is an object of criticism no matter what he does.  Whether he goes out on the street or stays at home, he is an object of criticism.  If he goes to a racecourse or has a motor car, he is criticised.  He is criticised for doing any of the things that any other individual can do without anybody pointing a finger at him or proposing to investigate his private means before he draws a pension to which he is entitled if he has earned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no parallel for the proposal put down here by Senator MacDermot, and I ask the Seanad&mdash;it is the first <Col N="669" /> time that I have spoken on this Bill with any heat&mdash;not to accept that recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no parallel for this proposal, neither is there any parallel, so far as I am aware, for these pensions, and the Minister forgets that, whereas judgeships are rare and are positions strictly limited in number, to which men only attain in later life, Ministerial appointments may be very numerous.  The Ministry itself is not large, but the Ministry may change very often; men may come and men may go; men may come for a very short time because the country, in a wave of misguided enthusiasm, let us say, may elect to power a Government of which the country afterwards strongly disapproves&mdash;a Government so incompetent or so misguided that it is soon swept out of office, even before the expiration of the term of the Dáil for which it was elected.  That being so, there is really no sense in comparing the pensions of Ministers to the pensions of judges or any other sort of pension.</P>
      <P>As for what the Minister says about the responsibilities Ministers have to bear, certainly I have never said a single word that tended to give too low an idea of the weight of these responsibilities. I realise them to the full, but let the Minister not speak of the position he or other Ministers occupy as being so totally undesirable that any sensible man would shun it.  The position of a Minister has great compensations. It gives great power and prestige, and, if a man is interested in his work, great happiness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I perfectly agree that a Minister should be properly remunerated.  I perfectly agree that he should be preserved from the fear of anything approaching indigence after he retires from office, but it seems to me that we concentrate all our attention here upon the merits of the individuals in the offices with which these various Bills deal.  If we had only to think of that, we would tend, no doubt, to be even more liberal than we are being, but we have got to compare one sort of occupation with another sort of occupation; we have got to compare the practice of other countries with that of our own; we have got to take into consideration <Col N="670" /> the ideas of people; and if we do all that, we are not always free to hand out salaries and pensions which the warmth of our feelings towards particular Ministers or the strength of our regard for the dignity and value of their office might lead us to do.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is certainly not to bring Ministers into contempt or anything approaching contempt. It has never been my practice to sneer at the Ministerial office.  I have the highest respect for it, and, although I do not want to seem to be throwing bouquets, I have always had the highest individual opinion of the present occupants of the Ministerial office, and have borne testimony in all sorts of circles, over and over again, to their courtesy and efficiency.  That, however, does not alter the fact that the people of the country have to be considered, that distress is widespread, and that it is our duty here, even if it hurts people's feelings, at any rate to consider whether a pension ought to be paid to every Minister that comes into office in this country and stays in it for as short a period as three years, irrespective of whether he really has any need of such a pension or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator consider the effect of his proposal? This proposal is going to hit the man who sits longest in office.  It allows a man with the shortest service to get off more lightly.  But, apart altogether from that, these pensions will only be granted on application and if they are granted the names of the recipients will be set out in the Finance Accounts, so that any person may go and satisfy himself who is in receipt of a Ministerial pension and in the circumstances any individual, if he so desires, can satisfy himself whether the person concerned should have applied or not.  I consider that is much the more dignified way to proceed in this matter than the Senator's proposal. The Bill, as it stands, has, at any rate, more regard for the position of Ministers and does not evince a continuous distrust of them which, if justified, would justify the impeachment of Ministers as a body.</P>

      <P>The intention of the Government is to leave it to the honour and judgment of those who apply for the pensions, and I am satisfied that we are leaving it in good hands.  I am not going to bind any man in the way this recommendation proposes.  I think it would be quite wrong to read into this legislation anything which would evince public distrust of those who have been Ministers.  The circumstances of everybody are best known to themselves.  If a person feels that it is necessary in order that he should continue to serve in public life as effectively as he served therein during the period he was Minister, my view is that he should apply for the pension.  It is in the public interest that he should do so.  We have heard a great deal about the merits of Ministers and about the people who should be Ministers.  I am convinced that it is going to be much more difficult to get Ministers of the same calibre in the future than it has been in the past.</P>
