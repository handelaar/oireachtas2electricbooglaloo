      <P>The purpose of this Bill, a Chathaoirligh, is to remove certain anomalies which we have found to exist.  Section 18 of the Statutory Declarations Act, 1935, authorised that a statutory declaration can be taken and received by a justice of the peace, a notary public, or any other officer by law authorised at the time of the passing of the Act to take such declarations. Section 21 of the same Act provided that a person who makes a false statutory declaration under that Act is guilty of a misdemeanour.  Under Section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, it was provided that Peace Commissioners would have power to take statutory declarations.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, however, do not contain any provision making it an offence for a person to make a false statutory declaration before a Peace Commission or an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the object of this Bill is to provide against that anomaly.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as Senators are aware, is one of a formal type introduced periodically for the purpose of securing statutory confirmation for orders made under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  Orders made under that Act cease to have statutory effect unless confirmed by legislation within a period of eight months.  Two or three of these Bills are produced, therefore, at various times of the year for the purpose of confirming the orders outstanding on the date of their introduction. There is a number of orders scheduled to this Bill, and the earliest date on which any of them would cease to be operative if not confirmed is in March next, but it has always been our policy to produce these Bills for consideration by the Dáil and Seanad as early as possible, subject only to the convenience of the Houses and to the factors affecting the allocation of time.  None of the orders confirmed in this Bill is of major importance; some of them are of quite minor importance, and, perhaps, it would serve the purpose of Senators if at this stage I gave a rough indication of their nature.  If there is a desire to discuss any one of them in greater detail, it could, perhaps, be best done in Committee. Orders Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were made for the purpose of exempting from duty certain component parts of articles which previously were made subject to duty, because of definition, but were admitted free under licence.  It has been found practicable to follow the definition in each case, so that component parts will be admitted free of duty and without restriction.  Reference No. 5 is of a somewhat similar nature.  It varies the nature of the licence duty, so as to permit the issue of a licence, not merely to a manufacturer but also to a wholesaler in cotton blanketing. No. 6 reduces the duty on dry and powdered milk.  Reference Nos. 7 and 8 impose the minimum duties to be effective on goods to which the order relates.  Reference No. 9 relates to the order which imposed a new duty on golf balls, the manufacture of which is about to be undertaken here. Reference No. 10 is a formal order, revoking the duty which hitherto <Col N="447" /> applied to Irish-made woollen cloth exported under bounty.  With the termination of the bounty the necessity for that particular duty ceased. Reference Nos. 11 and 12 effect variations in the duty previously operative upon the articles mentioned, certain articles of asbestos, rope, cord and twine.  Reference No. 13 imposes a new duty on sheets of ebonite made out of artificial horn, the manufacture of which is to be undertaken in the South of Ireland.  Reference No. 14 effects no change in the duty, except to insert a licensing provision which will permit parts of wireless telegraphy apparatus to be imported free of duty.  Reference No. 15 effected a new duty, by extending the existing duty on articles made from tin, tin plate or tinned plate. Reference No. 16 provides for the remission of duty on certain component parts of boots and shoes hitherto dutiable which are not manufactured here.  Reference No. 17 postponed the operation of the duty upon steel, which would have become operative on the 1st November until the 1st April. Reference No. 18 imposed a new duty on plates and sheets bearing advertisements.</P>
      <P>Senators will notice that none of these matters is of great importance. Some new duties may have to be considered, but in respect of most the orders arise out of variations in circumstances which had to be adjusted when they arose.</P>

      <P>I always enjoy these debates in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce opens the proceedings, but I feel that the length of his speech to-day was quite out of all proportion to the extreme importance of the issues which are implied in the Bill we are asked to confirm.  I object absolutely to the whole method and principle of legislation of this kind.  May I read to the House the powers which are taken under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... the Government may, if and whenever they think proper, do by order all or any of certain things and among others vary, in any <Col N="448" /> manner or respect whatsoever, in regard to goods imported into Ireland on or after a specified day any Customs duty in force at the passing of the said Act or imposed by any Act passed or order made after the passing of the said Act or any qualification, limitation, drawback, allowance, exemption, or preferential rate in force at the date of such order in relation to any such duty.</P>
    <P>If the Government has power to do all that sort of thing, what is there left for the Oireachtas to do?  It is mere humbug to come before this or the other House, and to pretend that we have any real power to deal with the legislation in all the miscellaneous orders which are made and withdrawn under the Act.  Whatever excuse there was at the time the Act was first enacted, there was no excuse whatever for it remaining on the Statute Book the day after the economic war came to an end.  I consider that the whole economic policy which has been adopted, using the powers contained in that Act, involves far too much interference with the details of our economic life, as it introduces into our economic life principles which are quite incompatible with the freedom of a democratically governed State.  I see that one of the hundreds of orders&mdash;the only one I had time to study in anything like detail&mdash;states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners may, at any time after the importation of such article, require the importer of such article to show to their satisfaction, within such time (not being less than seven days) as they may specify, that such article, since the importation thereof, has been used solely in weaving or knitting goods by means of machinery or has not been used at all or has, as to part thereof, been used solely in such weaving or knitting as aforesaid and has, as to the residue thereof, not been used at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, if the material in question was used for tying up parcels it would be liable to pay duty afterwards, although, in the first instance, it was imported free of duty.  The State has power to inquire into such elementary details of the business and life of individuals <Col N="449" /> as are referred to in that article.  If that article stood alone it would be a matter of trivial importance, but it is typical of thousands of such detailed interferences in ordinary businesses of business men and citizens and I protest against it absolutely.</P>
    <P>I consider, under the régime which has been inaugurated under this Act, that so far from private enterprise of the right kind having been stimulated and encouraged, the only kind of private enterprise that is really encouraged is the enterprise of private business men haunting the portals of the Minister's office.  All efforts to promote industrial development by interference in the organisation and with conditions affecting particular businesses take away with both hands what is given with one hand.  The favour which the Minister endeavours to confer on one industry has reactions which neither he nor far-seeing business men could see on other industries, not to mention the situation of consumers generally. When he gives a favour to one industry he finds, much to his surprise, that he has hurt other industries, and then they must be given similar favours, and the final result is that, so far from any industry being favoured, our whole industrial life has been damnified.</P>
    <P>The policy in question has introduced such enormous complexity and unintelligibility into our general economic life that it has made it almost impossible for any ordinary member of the Oireachtas to follow the matter with any understanding.  I consider that economic relations are difficult and complex enough without the State, by its policy, adding to those complexities and difficulties. But more important than anything else, by complicating our economic life in that unnecessary way, the Government have made it impossible for the Oireachtas to do its elementary duty and to understand the legislation affecting our economic life, which it is its duty, if it possibly could, to understand before it agrees to its enactment.  In that kind of way practically the whole of our economic life and the policies affecting <Col N="450" /> it have been, in fact, withdrawn from the power of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The general effect of all this interference is to increase the cost of production, both agricultural and industrial, all round, and to give a position of economic privilege to certain lucky economic interests.  It used to be said in the nineteenth century, and said truthfully that our country suffered from an agrarian monopoly operated in the interests of an alien aristocracy.  It could be said with equal truth that in the régime inaugurated under this Act the country suffers from industrial privilege operated in interets which are not always necessarily native to the soil.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, with the present enormous complexity of our economic policies and relationships, to get exact information with regard to the way in which the thing really works out. Some people are injured by them; other people are benefited by them.  The people who have been, in effect, enabled to sit on a gold mine as an indirect consequence of some of these policies are not going to tell us exactly how they are profiting at the expense of the general public.  The people who find themselves injured in their interests by certain aspects of these policies are afraid to say anything out loud, because they hope in due course to obtain a favour from the Minister which will, perhaps, put them in a position where they will be sitting on a gold mine, too.</P>
    <P>If we want to consider the general effect of the economic policy on our industrial life we should consider what is the position now of our major exporting industries as compared with what it was, say, eight or ten years ago.  I consider that industries which are capable of doing an export trade and are still, under whatever difficulties, attempting to do an export trade are, in the very nature of the case, industries which are suited to our circumstances and which are likely to be more efficient than others which must depend exclusively on the home market.  According to official figures, we exported in 1930, 3,300,000 square yards of linen piece goods.  In 1936 we exported 1,700,000 square yards of <Col N="451" /> linen piece goods.  In 1930 we exported 682,000 square yards of woollen tissues, the manufacture of which is one of our most important national industries, and, in 1936, that export was down to 327,000 square yards.  Another of our important export industries is beer and stout and, as to that, I find there is a downward trend in the volume of exports and that tendency is likely to be accentuated in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I am prepared to discuss these matters at any time with the Senator, but I had no intimation that they were likely to be introduced to-day.  If the Senator, or any other Senator, wants to discuss these matters, I shall be happy to discuss them on some other occasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the subject with which I was dealing does relate directly to the general policy, of which this Bill is an outstanding example.  My contention is that all our concentration on the effort to develop industries which can only hope to cater for the home market has indirectly injured the position of those other more important industries which used to be able to cater for the export market as well as for the home market. I would not like any Senator to think I am altogether hostile to the ideal of industrial development, but I suggest with all seriousness that if we would further the development of industry we should aim at dibbling industries rather than sowing them broadcast. Every agriculturist knows the difference between dibbling and broadcast sowing.  What seems to have happened is that the Minister has pursued a policy of sowing industries broadcast in much the same way as turnips have <Col N="452" /> to be sown and we have reached the position in which these industries have grown up and are choking each other. They should be deliberately thinned, leaving only one industry to grow where perhaps eight or ten were sown, because only one-tenth of them has any hope of attaining adult maturity.</P>
      <P>The economic health of the community is sound when prices and incomes are so related to one another, in the economy as a whole, that production can continue to expand, and when everything produced is in due course consumed.  In general, I am an advocate of <i>laissez faire</i> in economic matters, but I agree that there are times when the State might usefully interfere, but only in order to secure the more complete consumption of things which it is socially desirable should continue to be produced in any case.  I think every effort made by the State to remove obstacles from the channels of commerce, obstacles which interrupt and delay the circulation of goods&mdash;all such efforts by the State which tend to improve and increase consumption are to be applauded.  If all else fails, and if there is reason to think that the poorer sections of the community are not able to consume to an extent which is desirable for social reasons, there are occasionally times when the State is justified in redistributing the national income in the interests of the poorer classes, so as to increase their consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the efforts of the Minister in restricting commerce&mdash;for, after all, these regulations have an effect primarily in restricting commerce &mdash;are indirectly efforts which result in the restriction of consumption. Whenever you put restrictions or obstacles in the way of the ready movement of goods along the different stages of production from producer to consumer, you load these goods with increasing charges at every stage in their distribution, and consumers, in the final result, having to pay these higher charges, find themselves restricted in consumption because of the relationship between the prices they must pay and the incomes they receive.  The Minister may say that while he has frequently, in the <Col N="453" /> course of his public duty, found it necessary to restrict consumption of imported goods, nevertheless nothing could be further from his desire than that he should restrict in any way the consumption of goods produced at home.</P>
    <P>One effect of the industrial policy which has disturbed the price relationships between industrial and agricultural goods is that it was found necessary artifically to raise the price of certain agricultural products in order to restore something approximating to a normal relationship to non-agricultural prices.  One of the policies for such raising of certain agricultural prices has been the policy of paying bounties on the export of butter and eggs.  The effect of such bounties in such a case is to pay the agricultural producer a premium for not selling his goods in the home market and the effect is to reduce the consumption in the home market of our own agricultural produce below the level it would otherwise be if such goods were allowed to move freely to the market which was unaffected by any consideration of bounties.  So that, indirectly, the policy of restricting the import and consumption of foreign goods has led inevitably to another policy of restricting the consumption in the home market even of our own agricultural goods.  Unintentionally, but effectively, the policy of the Minister has, I think, helped to create a kind of new plutocracy of economic privilege and has redistributed the national income in a sense favourable to the industrial interests which managed to profit by it.  In that particular aspect of his policy the Minister has been catholic in the widest and non-theological sense of the term, and I freely and gratefully admit that many people, many of my co-religionists, have been too fortunate in sharing the largesse which was available for distribution when they profited by the policies of the Minister.  But the policy, whether it profits Christian or Jew or Gentile, is all wrong and contrary to sound economic principles.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter might be mentioned and it is this&mdash;in the post-war period there were certain general causes in operation tending to <Col N="454" /> dislocate the price and income relationship, especially between agricultural prices and incomes and non-agricultural prices and incomes.  During the war, as we all know, all prices rose to a considerable height and, by degrees, wages, in transport and distribution for example, were adjusted to correspond to the cost of living as it was in 1920.  In due course, there was a downward movement in general prices but the incomes associated with transport and distributive services, other than the incomes of railway shareholders, were not adjusted downwards in the same degree as, in the event, it was found necessary that agricultural incomes should be adjusted downwards. So that, for one reason or another, there was a tendency in the post-war decade for the price relationship between agriculture and industry to alter in a sense unfavourable to agriculture.  In my view, the natural balance between agriculture and industry should be such that the real wages of agricultural labour should bear a close correspondence to the real wages of unskilled labour in the towns.  In fact, in terms of money, the wages of unskilled labour in the towns should be slightly higher than the wages of agricultural labour and, in that case, there would be a natural and, I think, a healthy tendency towards a gradual drift of surplus agricultural labour from agricultural into urban employment.  But, in actual fact, the wages of our urban labour are now out of all relation to agricultural wages.  There is hardly any wage in urban employment for unskilled labour below £2 a week, whereas, as we all know, agricultural wages are more in the region of 25/- a week, if so much.  So that, so far as economic inducements are concerned, there would be a tendency for hundreds of thousands of agricultural producers to flock into urban industry, to obtain the higher real wage there paid, if only it was a physical or economic possibility to absorb such a large number of ex-agricultural labour. That being the situation, the Minister's industrial policy, in so far as it has tended to maintain and increase non-agricultural prices and incomes, has tended to aggravate a disorder in our <Col N="455" /> economic structure and in our price relationship which was already acute even before the Minister inaugurated this policy.  That agricultural prices are only at about pre-war level, whereas the cost of living and the cost of production for agricultural producers are at least 170 per cent. of pre-war, is, I think, the most important fact in the whole of our present economic situation.</P>
    <P>In a normal economic relationship, our export industries, being, in the very nature of the case, our most efficient industries, the ones we are best fitted to exploit and develop, should govern the remuneration obtainable by the factors of production employed in other industries which, in the nature of the case, must cater for the home market, but at present the remuneration of the factors of production employed in non-agricultural industry bears no relation whatever to the remuneration which it is possible for the various factors of production in agriculture to obtain.</P>

      <P>If the Senator confined his criticism to the procedure under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act under which the orders in the Schedule are made it will be quite in order and relevant and will not unduly widen the field of discussion.  It is the Second Reading of the Bill, and I am giving him every latitude, but I would ask him in continuing to be mindful of the statement of the Minister and not unduly widen the scope of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask you to pull me up should I travel beyond the field of what is strictly relevant, and I will endeavour to confine my remarks to what is relevant.  May I confess that instead of the policy which is exemplified in this Bill I personally would like to see a policy of concentrating on promoting a dozen or perhaps a score of really important new industries and abandoning completely the effort to promote hundreds of small-scale industries which can never achieve any real importance and the effort to promote which is only complicating our economic life.  I should like to see a tariff fixed once for all with a prospect of continuity and fixity which would secure the future of certain industries chosen by a disinterested expert council and all other tariffs completely eliminated. The Minister should remember that the effect of the tariff medicine becomes proportionately less and less the more he applies it to new and fresh industries. The more industries are protected by tariff the less is the advantage of such protection, and when you have come along the whole scale the effect of that protection for <Col N="457" /> good may be completely negatived by the indirect effects for evil of such policies on the whole economic situation. It follows conversely that if you reverse the policy and if you allow the weakling industries to die, deliberately to die, your action in so doing will strengthen the constitutions of the other industries which somehow manage to survive.  In fact, it may be necessary, to secure the life of the ones which are worth preserving, that you should give the weakling industries every opportunity to die, and the best and simplest method of securing their early demise is to remove all artificial protection and leave them to the healthy open air of free competition. As things are, we cannot keep all our new industries alive by artificial respiration and we will only strangle our economic life as a whole if we do not abandon the futile attempt.</P>
      <P>As regards the policy of which this Bill is an example, I would urge the Minister to abandon these usurped powers of legislation and taxation and give them back to the Oireachtas where they belong, and tell business in general to mind its own business instead of haunting the portals of the Minister's office.  There are enough uncertain factors in business to which business men have to adjust themselves without the additional uncertainty arising from the fact of their whole attention being devoted to attempting to forecast how the ministerial cat will jump.  Therefore, I would eliminate that uncertain animal entirely from the horizon of our business life as far as may be.  I do not know, Sir, whether you will rule me out of order or not, but what I have just been saying seems to have an important bearing on the problem of reunion, which is very close to the heart of many of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I sit down, may I say that I did, in another place, advocate reunion for non-economic reasons, but I was unable <Col N="458" /> then&mdash;in fact, I did not attempt&mdash;to mention a single economic argument in favour of it.  In conclusion, may I suggest that if the Minister and his Government will concentrate on an economic policy of the kind implied in the Report of the Banking Commission, then I think it will be possible for me to advocate reunion for economic, as well as non-economic reasons.  At present, I can think of no economic argument in favour of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amazed to hear Senator Johnston found his arguments on the principles which he mentioned.  Coming from him, and the institution he represents, it was certainly surprising.  It seems to me that he must be living in a fool's paradise if he believes that, under modern conditions, this country could pursue the policy of free trade which he has advocated as the only sound economic principle on which we could work. Every country in the world to-day has found it necessary for its economic salvation to set up a tariff wall against imports.  If we look at conditions in our country, and examine, as Senator Johnston suggested, our best industries which have an export trade, we shall realise that certainly most of the products of our agricultural industry could hardly survive if we had free trade.  I could give you one example, or several examples if you wish.  Take the dairying industry.  It is protected to-day, and, if it were not protected, the prices ruling would be half what they are. The same can be said in relation to the bacon trade and the egg industry.  In fact, that applies to practically all phases of the agricultural industry to-day.  Every single one of these items can be imported more cheaply than we can produce them.  I shall not say that they can be imported at an economic price, but they can be certainly imported at a price lower than that at which our farmers can produce them.  If we were to accept the general principles which Senator Johnston advocates, namely, to sell in the dearest market and to buy in the cheapest market, and if we were to buy every form of agricultural produce in the cheapest market, we could go out of production altogether in the agricultural <Col N="459" /> industry.  That being so, it seems to me that the only policy that any Government in this country under existing conditions can pursue is a policy of protecting what is fundamental to our own basic industries.</P>
      <P>For generations England boasted of the fact that it was a great free trade country, and that it meant to maintain a policy of free trade.  The English people boasted of the fact that they were the greatest nation of shopkeepers in the world.  But even that great free trade nation within the last decade had to drop completely that policy for a policy of protection, and had to preserve the home market for her own manufacturers.  When you see a country like that, with old established industries, having generations of experience behind them, finding it necessary to go in for a policy of protection, surely to goodness a country such as ours, which is only in its infancy as regards the development of its economic resources, must give adequate protection to native industries during their early growth.  On the other hand, this country, I believe, has no future in front of it, if it is to depend solely on agricultural production. Whatever misgivings the people may have in this country with regard to protection, or whatever the future may hold with regard to agreements or anything else, I personally am quite satisfied that our only hope of success lies in an even more intensified policy of protection and the development of every single resource at home to provide our people with any article that they may require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that we should go in more strongly for that.  If we had confidence enough in ourselves to go 100 per cent. on that policy we can easily see what could be achieved.  Within the last five years we have seen a nation that had an unemployed population of over 5,000,000.  To-day it has not 50,000 unemployed.  I do not say that we here should employ the methods that were adopted there, but I do say that we should have confidence enough in ourselves to go all out on a policy of providing all our own requirements.  The nation that I <Col N="460" /> have referred to adopted that policy and succeeded with it, and I believe that if we had more confidence in ourselves we could succeed too.  In the matter of industrial production we have learned a lot in the last five years, and what I maintain is that as we gain in experience our costs of production will become less.  With that possibility before us, there is no doubt whatever but that a number of our industries which some people are trying to disparage to-day will become even more successful than some of those which are and have been doing an export trade.  I believe that when we have greater experience we will reach that position.  All over the world emigrants from this country have reached the top of the ladder in every sphere of industrial life in the countries they have gone to.  Our young people to-day are gaining experience in industrial methods. They have five years' experience behind them now, and it is my belief that the new methods which are being employed in industry here, and the enhanced skill of our workers, will in time rejuvenate the whole outlook of industry in this country.  Our people have helped to do that in America and in the other countries they have gone to, and I believe that the same result will be achieved here.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that such a position can be brought about if we have sufficient patience and a fair amount of perseverance.  If those engaged in Irish industry both employers and employees get reasonable time, I believe that what I have suggested can be done.  To achieve that result it is necessary, of course, that those engaged in the Irish retail trade would not be so nervous or so sensitive in regard to the whims of those who deal with them. If, in every aspect of Irish life, we had that confidence in ourselves and in the future that I have been speaking of, then I believe that we would have success in Irish industrial life, but we will never have success while we have people going through the country whining&mdash;economic quacks I call them. You have those people going around for ever talking economics.  There is no such thing to-day as economics in every <Col N="461" /> aspect of life.  True economics is the amount of good that you can give to the people by putting them into work &mdash;giving them something to do.  I am not too sure at all that it should be a question of economics.  If you can put people into work and give them a sense of responsibility you, at all events, are doing something good.  I do not think that we should look at this so much from what one may call the hard-headed £ s.d. point of view of life. There are much greater things in life than £ s.d.  We should look to the future of our country and be prepared to make any sacrifices that are necessary for its good.  If you succeed in putting people into work, then in many cases you are taking them out of mischief. We should have confidence in one another, confidence in the future, not be afraid of hard work, and be ready to go ahead in a spirit of perseverance. In that way we will succeed in overcoming the drawbacks that we have had to face in the early stages of our industrial development.  If we proceed on the lines that I have indicated, we will succeed in building up our country and in giving it a sound industrial life.  It is far better in my opinion to do that than to allow ourselves to be led away by the theories of the so-called hard-headed economists.</P>

      <P>I feel that after listening to Senator McEllin, I would need to wander very far indeed from this measure before it could be said that I had transgressed the rules of order. I hope, however, to keep as close as possible to the Bill under discussion. I do not think anybody here has any desire to be unusually critical of Irish industries.  We all realise that this is a very sensitive period for Irish industries, particularly in view of the London Agreement made on behalf of those industries by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Because of that Agreement, the position is a sensitive one, and no one will desire to add to the general feeling of instability and insecurity, of which there is evidence in the case of many of our new industries.  If I have anything unpleasant to say, I do not want it to be thought that I am doing it in the frame of mind of one who wants to <Col N="462" /> say unpleasant things for the pleasure of doing so.  Senator McEllin put the matter in another form when he said that if we want to do things right here we must face the facts of life.</P>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with a number of industries in this Bill.  We have got to face the position with regard to them.  As the Minister himself has repeatedly said up and down the country, they are not going to live unless they can justify themselves by their competence and efficiency.  The great trouble in regard to this Bill is this, that the Minister is asking us to confirm orders which have already been made by him.  He wants the House to assent to that.  The House has the right to refuse to give that assent, and indeed there are very grave reasons why the House should carefully examine the position.  Senator Professor Johnston put the position very well in the admirable speech to which we have just listened.  There are very grave reasons why, when the Minister invites our co-operation in this matter, we should carefully examine what exactly the Minister desires to have done and the repercussions therefrom. It seems to me that the Minister thinks that traders up and down the country can alter their business just because he chooses to make an order.  The Minister has made a number of orders calculated to put a number of people out of business, to upset business absolutely and to change completely the prospects of people overnight. In my judgment that is not as it ought to be.  This measure, in my opinion, is itself evidence of a lack of clarity of thought and a lack of policy on the part of the Minister in the matter of our new industries.  The Minister has come before the House with this Bill, and is actually asking for power to remit duties which he has already imposed&mdash;certainly in one or two instances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is altering them in five or six instances, as far as I remember.  I cannot exactly indicate the ones in which an alteration is being made, but if what I say <Col N="463" /> is not true the Minister can correct me.  That, however, was the impression that I got when the Minister was speaking.  I am not able, as I have said, to indicate the particular order or orders that he did refer to, but I understood him to make a reference to a number of orders, and that in these instances he is actually altering duties which have already been imposed. That, in my opinion, is all wrong.</P>
      <P>What is the position with regard to these orders?  Is it not this?  An order is made to-day imposing a duty. Following the making of it people buy goods.  They find that when the goods have been purchased, paid for and brought into the country, the Minister comes along with another order varying the amount of the duty already imposed.  The people who have purchased goods under the original order are left with the goods in their shops, while their neighbours who did not buy in are then enabled to go out and buy in supplies of the same goods at a lower price.  The result is that those who purchased under the old order are left with the goods in their shop windows, while their neighbours, having bought at a lower price, are in a position to trade on more favourable terms.  I am quite certain that the Minister knows that that is so.  I say that is unfair and unjust, because the result of it is to worsen the position of traders up and down the country. It is action of that sort on the part of the Minister that is creating instability and insecurity in the minds of the business community.  It is as bad a thing in its way as some of the things that the Nazis are doing in Germany, and apparently Senator McEllin would, as regards some aspects of their policy, like to imitate them.  The result of all that has been that you have reduced the traders in this country to this state: that, as Senator Professor Johnston has said, they are not prepared to tell you what the facts are. They are afraid.  That is not as it ought to be, but it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the position with regard to the boot trade in the country, of which I myself have a certain amount of information, and of the kind of products <Col N="464" /> that the farmers are being asked to buy, the difficulties that have been created because of the monopoly given to these people in Cork, the difficulties of obtaining their products, and the difficulties of obtaining products from abroad.  Some one said to me a fortnight ago that there is not a farmer in this country who will not be incapacitated with rheumatism in another year or two if they have to go on wearing the kind of things served up for the last 12 months or more.  I know that it is not pleasant to be saying these things, but what is one to do? Am I expected to address the Minister in one of the passages in the House or go into his office?  I do not say that I would not be received.  That is the problem, and that is the situation. I am satisfied about that, and apparently the Minister is quite satisfied, because when he goes down the country he would not talk as he talks about the necessity for efficiency in our industries only that he is quite convinced that there is a grave necessity for it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should make his office a clearing house for the complaints, grievances and difficulties of the traders down the country who are supplying the people with the commodities which they must buy if they are to clothe themselves; that he should listen to them and have some appreciation of their difficulties and of the conditions which his orders are creating for them.  I can say, as far as my experience goes, that that is the feeling of the people in the trade down the country.  It is all right for the Minister to be pushing his industrial policy for all it is worth and with all his great energy; but there are other people in the country as well, and the Minister ought to take cognisance of the kind of service the industrialists are giving to the people.</P>
    <P>There are all these difficulties with regard to customs regulations.  I have been shown communications by traders that they have received from the customs authorities regarding goods ordered.  The goods were there for a week or a month or two or three months, and it was not until they communicated <Col N="465" /> with the firm in England which sent the goods that it was possible to obtain the goods.  There was no chance of being able to get the position elucidated by appealing to the people at home.  There are so many orders and so many different kinds of things affected by these orders that it is quite clear that the customs authorities hardly know where they are. That is inevitable.  The Minister should have realised long ago the complexities he was creating for the business community and the people who want to be served by these various orders that have to be changed perhaps in a week or month after they are made.  All that instability and uncertainty is definitely very bad for trade, and it is having its effect on the new industries here. Senator McEllin would go out for a whole-hog policy of tariffs.  He says that the future depends on a more intensive tariff policy.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into all that, but I would point out that the great difficulty for us as the main producers in the country is that all the products which we have to buy to-day have to be bought somewhere around a figure of 170 against a pre-war figure of 100.  We are paying 170 for what we were paying 100 pre-war and we get around 100 or 110 for what we have to sell.  That is the consequence of this industrial policy of the Minister so far as we are concerned.  Even if, after paying 170 for the commodity, it was as good as the commodity we got pre-war at 100, it would not be so bad.</P>

      <P>I said at the beginning that I do not want to be unduly critical.  I want to assure the House that I have no desire to be.  On the other hand, as purchasers of the commodities which the Minister is trying to manufacture here, the farming community, I believe, are placed under a disadvantage not experienced by any other agricultural population in the world.  I think that is not fair.  We have a perfect right to protest in the only way and in the only place left to us to protest.  So far as I can see, if the traders have grievances or difficulties, there is very little redress for them at present.  They must bear their burden silently, because in many cases they are afraid of something worse happening if they began to talk. I put it to the Minister that that is not as it ought to be.  I do not know that the Minister desires that such a situation should exist, but I can say that I have tried to get information which was given to me by two or three people put on paper and the answer I got was that from their point of view it might not be suitable for them and satisfactory for their business if it came out that they were telling the truth.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to believe that the information was not absolutely correct.  As a matter of fact, I was present when a representative of some of the firms concerned was being taken to task for the way they were doing their work and there was no question then of this Bill being on the mat.  I suggest that, instead of the Minister taking up this attitude, because that is what the people think <Col N="467" /> he and his Department will do and are doing, he should take up the other attitude; because if industries and industrialists are to be helped and encouraged they can only be helped and encouraged by the people to whom they are supplying the goods having confidence that they are capable of supplying the right kind of goods; and, if they do not, that there is a Minister in charge to whom the people can come with their grievances with a hope of finding redress.  The Bill is undoubtedly objectionable but, like another Bill which we had here the other evening, it is all part of a scheme and of a policy.  It is being carried out, in my view, hastily and without a proper plan.  The Minister would not be asking us to support him in passing orders varying and altering the duties if there was proper planning before the duties were fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally am only interested in one manufacturing industry in this country, and that is a comparatively old one, but I have been, in the nature of things, in touch with a very considerable number of our manufacturers, including those of the most recent.  I do not want to follow the last speakers in their general lines, but I cannot resist making two definite comments.  One is that I am convinced that however just certain criticism may be with regard to Irish products, a fair and impartial examination will show that certainly in the last few years the improvement has been much greater than any of us could have expected within the time. I do not believe in stifling criticism of Irish manufactures nor do I believe in wild criticism.  I urge on my friends on both sides of the House not to accept&mdash;I speak as a retailer as well &mdash;everything they are told in a shop as an excuse either with regard to customs or with regard to particular goods.  A very large proportion of the goods which I, as a retailer, sell are now of Irish manufacture.  I do not mark &ldquo;Irish manufacture&rdquo; on them. I simply sell them on quality.  That is, to a certain extent, due to tariffs. If my friend, Senator Johnston, thinks that there are a large number of gold <Col N="468" /> mines in the country upon which people are sitting, I can assure him that they are not as numerous as turnip seeds and that there is no need to thin them out.  There are, I suppose, a few gold mines but I have not found them and I am not quite sure that the word &ldquo;gold&rdquo; should be applied to them as a certain amount of the profits in these cases are paper profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, the last speakers have provided a criticism of this particular method of dealing with duties, because they have shown that it is almost impossible to deal with any long list of tariffs without dealing with the policy behind them.  That is perfectly correct.  I have knowledge, direct or indirect, of a number of the changes proposed here and I have no criticism to offer.  If there had been any strong criticism from one side of any of the provisions of this measure I would have heard of it through the association to which I belong.  I am, however, convinced that the time has come when the Minister should seriously consider whether he should go on using this particular Act for this purpose.  I think that it is impossible for the most competent Minister or the most competent staff to know the complete incidence of any particular tariff until it has come into operation.  I believe equally that it is impossible for any manufacturer to know that.  It will be, therefore, necessary, as long as you have a tariff policy, to provide some comparatively simple means of making the adjustments which prove necessary during the operation of a particular tariff. Though I am opposed to this system, if I were to be asked immediately to vote for the abolition of the Act, part of which was read by Senator Johnston, I could not do so unless there was some other scheme, but I should urge on the Minister to consider the setting up of a small expert committee to go into this system and see how far it would be possible to reduce licensing powers.  It is probably a good thing that we cannot put questions to Ministers in this House. If we had that power I would put down a question to the Minister asking <Col N="469" /> the number of hours spent by manufacturers in the Department's premises in Lord Edward Street in any given year.  The answer to that question would provide an argument against the licensing system, not to speak of a number of other things.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there is one thing on which I would like to lay emphasis. The Minister has a certain sense of humour&mdash;sometimes more than at other times.  I can see him smiling when he signed the particular order which appears in the paper this morning and I can hear him saying, &ldquo;I got these powers to operate the economic war and, now, I am using the same powers to carry out the economic peace.&rdquo;  This Act is being used to carry out the recommendations of the Prices Commission in respect of the Agreement with Great Britain.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister and the Government that these changes&mdash;they are not minor changes or they would not be dealt with by the Prices Commission&mdash; should, in each case, be implemented by a Bill so that they could be given public discussion.  I do not think that public discussion would do any harm and I do not think that it would cause the Minister any embarrassment, though it might cause him some trouble.  Many people think that the operation of the Prices Commission is going to be very unfair to and do great injury to Irish manufacturers.  I do not agree with that.  I do not accept the advice of the Deputy who urged that the proper thing to do was to howl.  I dislike howling before one is hurt.  To my mind, the changes which will inevitably take place will be most effective if the Minister carries public opinion with him as the changes are being made.  That can be brought about by dealing with the matter in the older way.  There cannot be urgency to the extent of a week or a month. I think it is wrong and bad policy to use this particular Act for carrying out the provisions of the Agreement with Great Britain in so far as they are represented by changing orders recommended by the Prices Commission.  I protest against the procedure which has been adopted.  I can see that it is easier for the Minister to adopt this procedure, and I recognise that the <Col N="470" /> Government is bound under the Agreement to carry out these recommendations. But the Government has a majority in the Dáil, and even if they had not a more faithful majority here, this House could not stop them, so that there is no danger.  This is a kind of thing on which public discussion would be valuable.  I do not think that the public would gain very much by detailed discussion of the provisions of this Bill even if we were competent to discuss them.  But the time has come when the powers given under this Act should be limited to minor changes.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh dúil agam labhairt ar an gceist seo ach tar éis bheith ag eisteacht leis na Seanadóirí eile, ba mhaith liom cupla focal a rá.  I did not think that we were going to have a general discussion upon our industrial revival, but, since the discussion has entered that domain, it is reasonable I should answer some of the points made by previous speakers.  You, a Chathaoirligh, as well as I, remember the late Arthur Griffith and the endeavour he made to put new life into this country.  He compared this country to a &ldquo;one-armed nation.&rdquo;  That was because we were depending chiefly upon agriculture. Our industries were then definitely strangled, and the general belief is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is doing at least one man's part to undo the evil then done.  He has been succeeding wonderfully well, according to the opinion of the people with whom I come in touch.  Senator Johnston referred to the reduction in the export of beer and spirits.  We all have common-sense enough to know the cause of that decline in the export of beer.  The firm of Guinness were the greatest exporters of beer we had. Guinness have now another brewery in Park Royal, in London, and I understand that that brewery is taking away from the production in the Dublin brewery.  Possibly that accounts for the decrease in the export of beer.  I was struck by Senator Baxter's remarks with reference to our industries.  He referred particularly to boots.  I am sorry he is not here now.  The question of boots is one of which I have some knowledge.  In my young days in this <Col N="471" /> city we had tanneries working.  I, myself, used the leather that was tanned in these tanneries.  I used that leather in the boots that I wore.  These tanneries, however, were strangled.  The position was that the whole tanning industry was gone.  Now, we have the position that, not only have we a boot-making industry in this country, but the tanning industry has also been revived.  For instance, the tannery in Portlaw is doing very well.  I was in Clonmel last June 12 months at a meeting in connection with technical education, and I found that the industry generally was going very well there. The same applies to Cork.  Senator Crosbie referred, I think, to the question of the supply of Irish-manufactured boots in Cork.  He need not go as far as Cork in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce having been down in Senator Baxter's native county&mdash;I am speaking subject to correction&mdash;in connection with the opening of a boot factory.  According to Senator Baxter, a lot of the consumption prevalent in the country is due to bad boots.  Well, all I can say is that I will bring Senator Baxter along to the City of Dublin and can show him where he can get boots manufactured in the old handicraft way&mdash;similar boots to those I am wearing myself and that I have been wearing for years.  I can tell the Senator that there are handicraft workers in the City of Dublin whose work can compare with that of anybody in any country both in regard to price and quality.  If Senator Baxter is agreeable I will bring him to a place in the City of Dublin where he can get such boots, and I can assure him that he need have no fear with regard to bad boots in the future.  As I said at the start, Sir, I did not intend to labour this matter, because I understood that we were only dealing with quotas in connection with this measure and that we were not dealing with new legislation.  For that reason, I am only confining myself now to dealing with the statement made by Senator Baxter.  I do not think Senator Baxter is present at the moment, but when he comes back I <Col N="472" /> should like to tender to him the advice I am now giving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Healy, Sir, I had no intention of intervening in this debate, because I did not think that any Senator of this House would oppose the passage of this particular Bill.  We are asked to pass this measure merely to give the Minister power to do certain things which, in his opinion, are necessary in connection with the industrial development of this country.  Now, Senator Johnston suggests that the Minister has put obstacles in the way of the development of Irish industry. I say that anybody who puts obstacles in the way of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the development of his policy is definitely putting obstacles in the way of the development of Irish industry.  My reason for saying that is that a great many people, many of whom do not necessarily agree with my particular political views, agree with me when I say that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce has done more than any other person has been able to do, so far, for the development of Irish industry.  Senator Johnston, in his speech, dealt with almost everything except guinea pigs' tails.  He dealt with these the other day, as I understand, and I am surprised that he did not deal with them to-day.  However, apart from that, the Senator went on to say that he believed it was a bad thing that parcels coming into this country should be opened as a result of the activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Surely the Senator will agree that such activities are necessary, even though they prove irksome at times.  For instance, I had an experience the other day.  Rather, it was not my own experience, but the story was told to me and, naturally, I took the story to be what one might call a hard-luck tale. According to the story, the customs authorities were asking for £5 on a particular parcel of goods, and my information was that this was a parcel of second-hand goods.  I called up the Department, and then I found out that it was a parcel containing a number <Col N="473" /> of new frocks on which the duty for each article would be about 15/-. That convinced me that there is a necessity, even though it may involve a certain amount of inconvenience, for interference by the Customs authorities.  It convinced me that such interference, even though, as I have said, it may lead to inconvenience, is necessary for the good of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that a lot of what has been said in the speeches of Senators Baxter and Johnston, to the effect that we cannot produce goods properly in this country, is due to a certain inferiority complex in this country.  For instance, Senator Baxter talked about people dying of consumption because of the bad quality of Irish boots that they had to wear.  Well, I remember being in jail on a certain occasion; I had a pain in my head and when I complained I was told by a British soldier that the pain in my head was due to the Irish cigarettes I was smoking. Well, I have always been smoking Irish cigarettes and I am still smoking them.  I suppose we may take it for granted the people in this country were suffering from rheumatism, when there were very few Irish boots or shoes being manufactured here. According to the argument that has been put forward, if people are now suffering from rheumatism, it is because they are wearing Irish boots and shoes.  Senator Baxter knows&mdash; he must know&mdash;that the fact that the people here are now wearing Irish boots or Irish shoes has nothing at all to do with their general health.  He knows quite well&mdash;he must know&mdash; that the boots made here can compare favourably with the boots made in any other country.  Just like Senator Healy, I have been wearing Irish-made boots since I was a kid. I have been wearing Irish hand-made boots, as Deputy Healy told the Seanad he has been wearing. I have worn nothing else, and I think that these boots will carry me as far as Senator Baxter's or Senator Johnston's boots will carry them.  I think that this idea of an inferiority complex with regard to Irish-manufactured articles should be banished <Col N="474" /> out of the minds of the people of this country, and I hold that the only way to get anywhere, so far as the industries of our country are concerned, is to create a pride in the products of our own country and a confidence in the minds of our people in our products&mdash;a confidence that the products of our country are as good as, and, in fact, better than, the article that can be produced in any other country.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being opposed by certain people because it gives the Minister power to alter tariffs, and it was suggested that the original Bill should have been abolished at the termination of the economic war.  I believed, at that time, that to call that particular issue an economic war was a misnomer&mdash;that it was an intensive effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is going on still, and I believe that, as the years go on, that war will become intensified.  There will always be in this country, as in every other country, the necessity to examine from day to day our position with regard to competition with other countries so far as the marketing of our goods here at home and in competition with other countries is concerned.  That will always be so, and I suggest that it is a ridiculous idea to expect that the Dáil or the Seanad should be called here every time that, for any reason, the Minister should feel it necessary to reduce or to increase a tariff because certain things, over which he has no control, have happened in other countries.  If certain things, as I have said, over which he has no control, take place in other countries, and which may affect our country very materially, the Minister must take action.  Is the policy suggested that the Minister cannot make any alteration whatsoever in any existing tariff without calling the Oireachtas together to consider the proposed alteration?  In other words, is it suggested that, if during the next <Col N="475" /> two or three weeks of the Christmas holidays the Minister should feel that it was necessary to modify a tariff in any way, he must be under the handicap of waiting until the members of the Oireachtas have returned after the Christmas holidays and have deliberated and satisfied themselves as to what the Minister should do with regard to that tariff.</P>

I say that that was not the Minister's policy at all, that it was the policy of the people.  In fact, I find myself cheering when I look forward <Col N="476" /> to the making of this new political Party.  Possibly, it was the Bill which was introduced yesterday, conferring certain honours on Leaders of Opposition Parties in the House, that put it into their minds.  I do not know.

      <P>I would ask the Senator to look up his own speech in the Official Debates, and he will find that he did refer to the decentralisation of industry.  In fact he went so far as to say that instead of having those industries here, there and everywhere else he would suggest, I think, a dozen big industries.  The policy of the people, as expressed by the people very definitely in election after election, was to have greater decentralisation of industry, to have a greater number of small industries in the smaller towns rather than to have all the industries collected here in the City of Dublin, Cork, Galway, or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I was very disappointed to hear the statement made by a responsible Senator like Senator Baxter.  I had a rather high opinion of him since I came into the Seanad. I thought he was very fair, but now he has gone down quite a lot in my estimation.  The statement made by Senator Baxter here is a statement which we have been listening to for years and years&mdash;that the Irish people are not fit to produce something as good as is produced outside.  As a matter of fact, I have met people who would argue that Player's cigarettes have not been so good since they were manufactured in this country.  I have also met people who argue that the Sunlight soap manufactured here is not as good quality as that produced on the other side.  That is the kind of slave mind which we should like to see put down.  I say, as one who has always supported Irish manufacture as much as possible and wherever it was available, that Irish-manufactured boots, Irish-manufactured clothing, Irish-manufactured farm implements and everything else are second to none, and I am disappointed at a responsible Senator like Senator Baxter making the statement to which we listened here.  It is all right coming from somebody at a street corner who does not realise what he is saying, because it has been dinned into the people for years that we are not fit to produce those commodities. That is what we want to see put down.  I say that Irish-manufactured goods are second to none.  I am one of those who are not afraid to criticise a Minister, and I say that the Minister for Industry and <Col N="478" /> Commerce has done more work in five years than any other man in the Empire has done in a lifetime.  I am one of those who realise the position as it is to-day.  Senators may laugh at my statement, but you have only to go around the country to find in every county a monument to the Minister.  I was down in my native town this summer, and in the thread factory in Westport I was delighted to see at least 300 hands earning good wages on the manufacture of first-class thread.  Is it not far better to see them working in this country on the manufacture of that thread than to see them going over to England to manufacture it? Similarly, with regard to boots, I would suggest to Senator Baxter that in Westport he will find boots which will keep rheumatism out for a life-time if it has not already set in.  I do say that we have full confidence in the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and consider that he is quite capable of dealing with those tariffs.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary to spend a lot of time in discussing the tariff policy.  It has been debated time and time again during the last five years, so why waste time in discussing it now?  Irish manufactured goods require no defence.  I am not going to enter into a defence of goods which I consider do not need any such defence.  The Minister has come before us asking us to pass this measure giving him authority to alter those tariffs.  It is very necessary that there should be no delay in assenting to that. If the Minister had not this power it would be very hard for him to prevent the dumping of goods in this country. It is very essential that the Minister should have power at any time to make such alterations as will prevent injury to Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas said that one of his objections to this type of legislation was that it tended to divert attention from details to questions of general policy.  It seems to me, however, that that is merely a matter of regulation, and that however desirable it may be to ensure that <Col N="479" /> measures of this nature get a detailed examination when they come before the Oireachtas, it is equally desirable that we should discuss questions of general policy from time to time.  The only matter that arises for decision in that connection is the best arrangement to ensure adequate discussion.  When I intervened in the course of Senator Johnston's remarks I did so for the purpose of drawing attention to the fact that I had come here with the intention of discussing golf balls, milk pails, and other things mentioned to the Schedule to this Bill, and had received no intimation from anybody that I might be expected to discuss the relation between industrial and agricultural wages, or the causes which had effects upon the exports of certain industries none of which were affected by any of the orders scheduled to this Bill.  I submit to the members of the Seanad as a reasonable method of procedure that Bills of this kind should be discussed for what is in them, and that if they want to discuss questions of general policy they should make other opportunities for doing so.  I have no desire to shirk discussions of general policy.  On the contrary, I welcome them, because it is apparent that quite a number of members of the Seanad require education upon this matter, and I am prepared to do my part.  But if we are to have, as we had on every occasion recently, discussions upon some aspects of general policy on a Bill of this kind, it is clear that the details of these measures will not receive the attention they deserve.  Questions of policy, in the long run, are settled by the people, and no decisions made here are likely to alter policy to a substantial extent, except over a period of time.  No matter how definite the people may have been in their decisions in relation to our industrial policy, no matter how firmly convinced the majority in the Dáil or the Seanad may be as to the wisdom of that policy, it is inevitable that, from time to time, details relating to its application will be open to question, and to improvement in method of administration, or in the application of policy resulting from suggestions made here.  It is because I hold that view that I dislike <Col N="480" /> Bills of this kind being made the occasion of a discussion on general policy, as the occasion is really inappropriate for it.  Senator Johnston in the course of his address used many very impressive phrases.  I am sure those who read his speech in the Official Debates will be able to add considerably to their knowledge of the jargon used in class-rooms and text-books, but behind the phraseology of these weighty phrases and professorial jargon we recognise theories which are in fact very old acquaintances.  We met them all before.  We thought some of them were dead.  We thought that others of them had grown hoary with old age and had got beyond the stage when they could be trotted out again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not professing any heresies.  I am frankly unable to decide whether I should describe the Senator's views as archaic or Utopian. Some of the views he gave expression to can be found in musty volumes in old libraries, while others bear on a condition of affairs which never before existed upon earth and perhaps never will exist upon earth.  At any rate, he has given expression to a plan.  I would like to bring to his attention the fact that in part that plan has been tried.  He has not asked us to adopt a new idea.  He is adopting as a new idea something that we have tried and the results of which we know.  We have often before heard that phrase of his, &ldquo;the healthy openair of free competition.&rdquo;  It was quite a stock phrase for leader-writers in newspapers in the past, when the idea of industrial revival was mooted. That phrase is not an original one. Our industries were exposed &ldquo;to the healthy-open-air of free competition&rdquo; and they just disappeared.  It may be that they were weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt to point out that I advocated what might be called selective protection to secure industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And these protected industries were all well wiped out.  If the <Col N="481" /> people in Germany, or the people in Japan decided to maintain a standard of living much lower than our standard, and if every country was prepared to depreciate its currency, and to put itself in a position to sell goods cheaper than we could make them, our industries would be wiped out.  The Senator's theory has been applied in the past by other countries.  It is probably a good sound theory if we could visualise a world in which purely economic ideals were going to operate, in which national boundaries had disappeared, and we had a universal State in which people could move freely.  The Senator and others like him have, perhaps, forgotten that these theories do not apply now.  What these theorists forget is that other people have a say in the matter People who arrange these things are not prepared to adopt practices to suit their principles, merely to prove that their theories are right.  It is a grand idea to concentrate on a half dozen big industries and to develop an export trade, but where is the guarantee that the people of other countries would allow you to have that export trade?  Are you satisfied that they are going to allow you to have an export trade?  Are you prepared to stake the whole future prosperity of the country on the certainty that, over a long period of years, these half-dozen industries will maintain an export trade?  I think Senator Johnston, in the name of commonsense and stability, is asking us to take a gamble so big that we would be reckless fools if we attempted it.  All these theories are very well in an atmosphere divorced from reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston's objection to the Bill was the type of objection that one would expect from theorists who never attempted to deal with practical problems, or were never called upon to apply the theories to world facts. It is quite easy to say that the Government should not have power to deal with the imposition and the modification of tariffs by order, but in practice no other system is possible. If you admit that a protectionist policy is in force, and that that protectionist policy is going to continue in force, then the power which the Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, gave <Col N="482" /> the Government was essential, if it was to be implemented at all.  In the circumstances of this country, within a few hours' sailing of a great industrial nation, it is practically impossible to prevent public information being secured whenever a new industrial project is being mooted.  It is physically impossible to apply a protectionist policy at all without the incidence of some such powers.  Our predecessors were by no means a protectionist Government.  Yet they found that it was essential to have such powers, and passed the Provisional Imposition of Duties Act, 1931, to give them these powers.  Their Act was defective and could not be made operative.  They realised, even in the period of selective protection, that powers imposing new duties by order, subject to subsequent confirmation by the Dáil, was essential to efficient working, and anybody who has got away from the atmosphere of theory, and considered these matters in their practical application, has to realise at once that no other procedure was possible.  Apart altogether from the difficulties that would arise in relation to parliamentary time, every separate order we made or unmade would have to be the subject of a separate resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not propose to follow Senator Johnston or, for that matter, Senator Baxter through most of the arguments they used.  I am prepared to deal with these on another occasion, as I do not want to take up the time of the House dealing with them now.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words to Senator Baxter.  His speech to-day was the product of a mentality which, in my opinion, is the curse of this country.  I have no doubt that the existence of that mentality here is quite natural, having regard to the fact that we have been in slavery for 700 years.  I submit that the Senator should reconsider his own principles. He referred to the fact that I have frequently spoken about the need for efficiency in our industries.  I have done so, but I have also, and on a recent occasion, condemned those who are always looking for faults to find, those who can say nothing good of the <Col N="483" /> products of our industries.  It may be that Senator Baxter does not really believe that the wearing of Irish boots is going to cause rheumatism, but the fact that he said that is going to be given some publicity in the newspapers and it will constitute another brick to throw, it will supply more ammunition for those who want to assail our industries.  I do not know if Senator Baxter plays golf, but, if he does, then the first time he slices a drive or misses a putt, I daresay he will attribute it to the fact that he is playing with an Irish-made golf ball.</P>

      <P>It is part of my duty to keep up all the pressure possible in order to bring Irish industries to a state of maximum efficiency.  Those who know what has been done in that respect will, I am sure, be the first to pay tribute to the existence of it.  I may say that the industries that have been established have responded to that pressure and in many respects we have reached a degree of efficiency much higher than I had thought possible in the limited period that our industrial programme has been in operation.  There will always be people who will say that that is not so, people who will endeavour to run down our industries.  For instance, if an Irish-made motor tyre is punctured there will be people ready to declare that it is due to the fact that it was an Irish-made tyre and not to the fact that it was a nail in the road that caused the puncture.  Again, if a regiment of the Abyssinian Army was supplied with water bottles made in the Nenagh factory the fact that the Abyssinians lost the war would not necessarily be due to their soldiers carrying water bottles made in Nenagh, but yet you will find people prepared to argue in that way. Senator Baxter is one of them.  If the Senator could only realise the <Col N="484" /> utter nonsense he has been talking here I feel sure he would never do it again.</P>

      <P>I should like to point this out to Senator Baxter, that it is the development of that type of mentality <Col N="485" /> that takes a pride in the progress of our own industries that is going to bring us to the stage of efficiency that we all want, and we will not attain that ideal by denouncing our workers, our industrialists, as incompetent or lazy.  Senator Johnston asked in relation to the Bill, what is there left for the Oireachtas to do when a Bill of this kind is produced?  I submit that members of the Oireachtas should at least read the Bills.  It is quite obvious from the remarks of Senators Johnston and Baxter that they did not read this Bill.  Surely their first object should be to find out what the Bill is about, and what the orders relate to. They will find that most of them are of comparatively minor importance.  They are certainly of a character which would not justify the procedure which the Senators appear to desire, the submission of separate resolutions and discussions in each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It is possible to get that separate discussion if the Senators want it.  We could take this Bill in Committee and deal with each of these items separately. It is possible for the Oireachtas to revoke every one of the orders and in that way you would secure the control of the people's representatives over the powers of the Executive. Senator Johnston read out an extract from the order relating to ply yarn, and he talked about the excessive powers given to the Revenue Commissioners. I would ask him to apply his mind, or to induce his professorial colleagues to apply their minds, to the problem of getting a definition of ply yarn which will enable a customs official to distinguish ply yarn from thread.  If he can get that, I am prepared to put it into the order instead of having the section to which he objects.</P>

      <P>The only way of making a distinction was by having some direct relation with the purpose for which the imported article would be used.  I do not think it is objectionable to deal with the recommendations of the Prices Commission by orders under the 1932 Act, particularly at a time when it would not be convenient to come to the Oireachtas in the ordinary course, by way of financial resolution. It is undoubtedly correct that, when removing a duty, different considerations operate than when a duty is being imposed.  Under our law a duty becomes operative immediately the order imposing it is made, or a resolution is passed by the Oireachtas in relation to it.  But in removing the duty it is always possible to allow a period of time and, in fact, it will in the ordinary course always be necessary to have an order removing the duty, or a resolution, from a named date ahead.  That was done in relation to the orders to which Senator Douglas referred.</P>
      <P>While I would favour the submission of these matters to the Dáil in the ordinary course, if that can conveniently be done, I would not move by order under the 1932 Act because I think, in relation to these matters, it is essential we should give evidence of our good faith by acting expeditiously on the reports of the Prices Commission.  The proper way to get an individual discussion upon one item in the Schedule is to move an amendment in Committee to take it out. That singles it out for discussion and we could debate that exclusively without reference to any of the other items.  That could be done in connection with any of the items, if Senator Douglas or any other Senator so desires.</P>

      <P>I would like to help the Minister.  I believe he came in to talk about golf balls.  I came for the purpose of asking one question about golf balls and when the debate took what I may call a high flight I did not like to intervene, but I would like to ask him whether he has any idea as to the amount of employment given by the manufacture of golf balls here.  The Dunlop golf ball, of course, is a good ball.  Nobody objects to having it, and I am not one of the people who object to having Irish industry at all.  I was a persecution, I think, to a great many people in my youth worrying them about Irish manufacture, but is there any guarantee with regard to the price of those balls from the company who are making them and who will have practically a monopoly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as price is concerned, the undertaking is that the price will be the same as now charged. There is a slight qualification to that because I gather&mdash;and this may be of information to some golfers present&mdash; that the cheaper balls give a lower profit than the dearer ones and, consequently, the price at which each individual type is sold depends upon the <Col N="488" /> maintenance of the proportion of the market which each represents and, on the assumption that the same proportion of cheap balls as against dear balls will be sold here as in Great Britain, the price will be the same.  I think that is just a safeguard the firm put in for their own protection.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not here to take part in the debate on the Second Reading, but I gather <Col N="489" /> those who did take part gave the Minister some little annoyance.  I will do my best to spare him further annoyance, but I feel so strongly about this whole question of his economic policy that I cannot accept the suggestion the Minister made that we should abstain, on the very few occasions we have an opportunity to do so, from discussing the general policy of his whole new tariff quotas and new system of regulation.  Listening to the Minister, I was forcibly reminded of a measure we passed yesterday and of the necessity and the equity of a measure we passed yesterday, that is, the necessity for providing even more liberal pensions than we do for ex-Ministers, because I consider the Minister, in devoting his service to the State, has missed an opportunity of reaping a very large income in the profession of the law.  I never heard such an able piece of special pleading as the Minister made in defence of his policy.  To hear the Minister one would imagine there is no discontent, that all except a few disgruntled people out of touch altogether with business, are perfectly satisfied with the whole consequences of his policy and that industry is bearing no burden and that everything is proceeding smoothily and happily.  This question is so big that I do not profess, or do not intend, to range over the whole field of our policy, but I just wish to give some figures which are authentic.  I cannot be expected to disclose the concern to which they apply, but I wish to show the difficulties with which industry is being burdened to-day and to show that not only is industry burdened but that all the consumers are burdened. You cannot impose a burden on any industry without the necessity either of that concern going down under the burden or else the necessity for passing on the costs to the consumers. The Minister gibes, I am afraid rather light-heartedly, at the old economic doctrines.  I wonder if he will gibe at this one: that the raw material of one industry is the finished product of another, or, put the other way round, the finished product of one industry is the raw material of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest and, I think, almost the <Col N="490" /> most unsuitable venture on which our new economic policy has embarked is that of steel manufacture.  There is a very small market.  The Minister told us&mdash;I propose to follow his example in carrying the war into the enemy's country&mdash;that he fully expected to level steel prices in this country down to world prices and even create an export trade.  He did not say that to-day.  I cannot give him the reference but I have a clear recollection that he said words to that effect in the Dáil.  I can quote recent prices, within the last year and a half, for fabricated steel for the erection of buildings in connection with a certain new industry.  I suggest that the buildings of an industry are that industry's raw material and the cheaper you get the buildings, naturally, the cheaper at which you can supply the products to the public. Here are actual quotations given for fabricated steel and I need hardly tell you the industry in question had to exhaust to the full the output of home manufacture before it was permitted to import under licence.  Everything practically is under restriction for import from abroad.  The price for one class of fabricated steel delivered at site&mdash;Belgium calculated at £12 15s. 0d. a ton.  The Irish price was £25 10s. 0d. a ton.  For another class of fabricated steel, Belgium quoted £16 5s. 0d. a ton.  Irish price, £30 a ton.  Another class&mdash;Belgium, £16.  Irish, £30 6s. 0d., and in one case, on a certain building, it was calculated that if the Irish price was paid the building would cost an additional £25,000.  I brought that specific illustration before you sooner than range over the whole background of this policy.  It is to be expected that these variations will occur, where you start unsuitable industries, industries that have to import their raw material, into a market where the demand is very restricted and small.  Of course, in this case, even that does not apply for this is merely fabricated steel. The steel would probably come from Belgium in either case.  I am comparing fabrication in Belgium with fabrication of the same steel in this country.  I hope the Minister will not <Col N="491" /> tell me I am seeking every opportunity to besmirch Irish manufacture. It is far too serious a thing for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Senator is he sure it was the same steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it was steel that satisfied the manufacturer.  The business concern was prepared to use that steel, and would have used it if they had been allowed to buy it, on the same quotation.  I cannot answer the technical question as to whether it was on the same specification, but it was foreign steel in either case.  The only difference was the fabrication abroad against the fabrication at home. Of course, there was no Irish steel made at that time.  The difference in price was on the fabrication alone.</P>
      <P>One more instance.  I cannot mention the name but the Minister can get it himself, I understand, from the Prices Tribunal.  A certain article, supplied in quantity and used in quantity on the railways, can be imported, my information goes&mdash;I am open to correction&mdash;at 10 per cent. cheaper than it can be made at home and yet carry a duty of 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not want to blame Irish manufacturers for these results.  I think they are labouring under a great handicap.  There is a very small market and naturally they are building up their experience and the Minister will tell the House that in course of time these differences will disappear.  We can only deal with the thing as we see it and I think we all agree that it is very unfortunate that the country should have to pay these prices for the luxury of thus having such as there may be of this new economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I want to refer.  What remedy has the consumer?  The Minister will, I know, say the Prices Tribunal.  I can only say that that answer is, to my mind, a perfect mockery.  I know that the Prices Tribunal have given some little relief, say 10 per cent., possibly where there was 100 per cent. difference in price.  But the whole <Col N="492" /> philosophy of the thing is wrong.  You are pitting the wits of the Prices Tribunal against the wits of the manufacturers. It is a battle of wits the whole time and I have very little doubt as to who will get the best of the battle in the long run.  I do not consider that the Prices Tribunal, even if it had the time to go into these matters, is any effective protection to the public.  I know of one case regarding which the Minister answered a question in the Dáil where five months elapsed&mdash;a lot of correspondence, some in Irish, went meanwhile backwards and forwards&mdash;before a certain question, that is, the question of the additional price of motor cars, was considered before the Prices Tribunal.  It was eminently a matter that could be investigated very quickly because the information that the motor car assemblers would have been able to supply would have told the whole story.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that I am taking every opportunity I can to discredit Irish manufacture.  That is not my intention.  I am perfectly sincere about this matter.  I am convinced that intolerable burdens are being placed on Irish manufacturers by this economic policy.  Such is the system of control that those who are in a position to give the full facts are very often afraid to speak.  A certain amount of pressure is put upon them and they know that difficulties will be put in their way if they speak out openly.  They know that it is in their interests not to speak about these things, but I feel it my duty and privilege on an occasion like this to bring these matters before the House. I am not going to deal with the remedy.  I agree with the Minister that we have got to accept this Bill and I do not desire to trespass further upon the indulgence of the House, having expressed my opinion on how this policy is operated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want briefly to say a word or two to express my resentment of the Minister's attitude towards the point of view which I have already expressed on this Bill.  I am not going either in this House or outside it to permit the Minister, or any <Col N="493" /> of the sheep behind him, to put me in the category of those who stand against the progress and development of Irish industry.  Perhaps I have spent as much of the money that has come my way in buying the products of Irish industry as either the Minister or anybody in his Party.  As long as I can remember, the development of Irish industry has been a policy which I have been sponsoring and standing for.  I am sure it is a very long time ago since I put on the first pair of Irish-made boots.  I think the Minister is standing in his own light, and doing his industrial policy a grave disservice, when he tries to brow-beat either myself or others who have sufficient moral courage to say what they know the facts to be.  I could say quite a number of other things which I know are true, but which I know would not be in the least helpful in getting our people to buy the products of Irish industries.  I want the Minister to understand that my one desire is to see Irish industries built up on the right lines.  Equally I want him to understand that I have none of the slave mind and that I am not easily intimidated.</P>
      <P>The Minister described Senator Johnston's policy as archaic.  He evidently believes that his own policy is something new and modern.  One would think that the Minister's policy, if it is so irreproachable, would have shown some indication of progress to-day but what are the facts?  Has his policy stopped emigration, raised the standard of living or reduced the price of the commodities we have got to buy?  I do not know by what standard you are going to measure progress, but the new industries have done nothing whatever to increase the population.  The facts are that there has been a definite decline in population right along from the commencement of this more intensified industrial policy.  These are the facts and, measuring them by the results, I do not know that the Minister can feel very satisfied.  I am not satisfied either.  That is the truth and no matter whether the Minister likes it or not the truth must be stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not been planning. <Col N="494" /> He has been imposing tariffs indiscriminately and thoughtlessly.  As Senator Keane has pointed out, he has imposed new tariffs and brought new industries into existence, but these industries can only flourish and thrive if they are provided with raw materials at an economic price.  Other industries have been brought into existence with the object of providing these raw materials and immediately a heavy tariff was placed on these raw materials, so that existing industries which require these raw materials were seriously handicapped.  The Minister does not like us to say that but that is the fact.  Whatever applause he may be able to stir up amongst people here who pretend to stand for Irish industry&mdash;some of them probably will go out later and buy whatever they think is the best value for their money &mdash;this is not a policy that is going to get real industrial development and progress here.  I have expressed my views on this Bill because I believe I have a perfect right to do so.  We are here to talk of things as we find them.  It should be our desire to get the collective wisdom and experience of every member of the Oireachtas directed on all these problems.  If we are just to be scouted out of the House and sat upon every time we attempt to express our views, we cannot obtain that cohesion and organisation that are necessary for succesful consideration of these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  Recently a statement has been made that gas masks are regarded as wearing apparel and that a duty of 60 per cent. was charged upon them.  I am told that a very large consignment was arriving here during the crisis and that the people who were importing them were told that they would have to pay a duty of 60 per cent. on them.  One would think, after listening to some speeches in this House, that they should be allowed in free of duty.  Is the Minister taking any steps to initiate the manufacture of them in this country?  I think, after all we have heard here, we should realise the necessity for them.  The statement to <Col N="495" /> which I refer has been made by a very representative man in business and I should like to know if there is any foundation for it.  If there is, it is Customs gone mad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I enjoyed thoroughly listening to the Minister replying, especially when he got really hot and bothered in the effort to deal with my rather academic effort.  It has been said that when you know you have a bad case it is a good idea to abuse the other side. I greatly enjoyed the abuse which the Minister levelled at me for, I daresay, I am right in thinking that when he referred to my professorial and academic status he meant that as a term of abuse.  On the point that the giving of protection as a means of stimulating industry is effective only in proportion as it is used sparingly and discriminatingly, I would remind the House that there is a tariff of 30 per cent. on finished collars which are made in Eire.  Well, that is very nice for the people concerned, but the fact that they pay a 40 per cent. duty on the material which they must use for manufacture of those collars greatly diminishes the advantage to them of the tariff which they enjoy on their finished products.  In other words, the more tariffs you have the less advantage any particular tariff is to any particular industry.  That is the whole point of my remarks to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been accused of bringing out certain hoary economic doctrines.  They are old, if, indeed, commonsense is old, but they are not so old, as I said by way of interruption when the Minister was speaking, as some of the heresies which are stalking abroad not only in Ireland but in the whole world to-day.  The heresies in question were well known in the 18th century, and were referred to at that time as the mercantilist doctrines.  The whole of the French economy was affected by those mercantilist ideas, with the result that industrial development in France was strangled by over-regulation, and agriculture, too, was penalised by the general tendency of the State to discourage agriculture in <Col N="496" /> order to favour industry.  We seem to be repeating the same errors and heresies that brought ruin to that great State, and were among one of the primary causes of the French Revolution.  But, of course, the tragedy is that history is written in vain for those who make history, because those who make history, like the Minister, never seem to be able to learn from history.</P>
    <P>One final point I would like to emphasise, and it is that you can have no wise economic policy for any particular industry unless you have an economic policy which is wise from the point of view of the nation as a whole. Now, the Minister has not one economic policy.  He has as many economic policies as there are industries whose problems are submitted to him by the people concerned therewith.  My whole criticism of him is, that he has no general conspectus of the economic life of the nation as a whole, and especially of the terriffic importance of the relationship between agriculture as a whole and industry as a whole.  It must never be forgotten that agriculture is our major export industry. Normally, half our agricultural produce is exported.  Industrially speaking, we import far more by way of industrial raw materials than we export by way of industrial finished goods.  It follows from that situation that, since we must depend on foreign sources for our industrial raw materials, we can only hope to continue to pay for those imported industrial raw materials if we can continue to export agricultural products.  In other words, we depend for even the possibility of maintaining industry for home consumption here on our ability to continue exporting agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>That point was emphasised, and was one of the most important points so emphasised, in the report of the Banking Commission.  It was pointed out that our strong creditor position and the tremendous solvency of our present international financial position are really the result of the large-scale agricultural exports which we made in the years of high war prices.  One of the members of the Banking Commission told me that we were the only country in the world whose farmers <Col N="497" /> had the sense to keep their war profits, but the profits which they made in the Great War have been dissipated largely by the consequences of the economic policies pursued in the last six years. The fact that even our industry depends for its ability to buy those raw materials on the prosperity of our agriculture is a fact which I would like to brand into the mind of the Minister, and with that final remark I sit down.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to say on the question asked by Senator Foran about gas-masks.  Perhaps his information is correct, and perhaps it is not.  If he wishes I can make some inquiries into the matter.  In any case, he may be sure that the difficulty in connection with the definition of wearing apparel is one that has often arisen before.  That difficulty can be removed by the use of the powers given in the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, without immediate reference to the Oireachtas.  So far as Senator Baxter is concerned, I would like to say this to him: that if at any time in his life he has seen an Irishman working hard, I would like him to say so; that if at any time he has purchased an Irish product and found it to be as good as any made abroad, that he would say so; that if he has ever seen an Irish farmer wearing Irish-made boots without getting rheumatism, he would say so&mdash;in general that, now and again, he would give the old country a boost.  We do not object to getting kicks; what we do object to is getting nothing but kicks.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnston accused me of putting into practice principles which, he said, had brought not only ruin on French industries but was among the causes of the French Revolution.  I am not a betting man, but if I were I would not be afraid to lay six to four against anything of the kind happening here.  However, I do not think that any of us are going to live to see if his prophecies are likely to prove to be strictly accurate or inaccurate.  Of course, it is obvious that we must continue to export our agricultural produce in order to pay for the raw materials we import.  The Senator has fallen into the fallacy, which others before him have fallen into, namely, that there is necessarily some conflict between the prosperity of our agriculture and the development of our industries. That conflict does not exist, and I think that, in so far as factors have appeared which would seem to indicate the existence of such a conflict, they were due to temporary causes, defective planning or other remediable causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Senator Sir John Keane is the maker of propaganda <Col N="499" /> against our industries; I think he is the victim of that propaganda.  That is obvious from his remarks.  He started by reminding us that the finished products of one industry are often the raw material of another and proceeded to talk very much about the price of fabricated steel.  In present circumstances, the steel fabricators have to buy the unfinished product from firms competing with them for fabricated work.  Very frequently they are unable to purchase the raw steel at a price which will enable them to compete under fair terms with the foreign firms.  That is due to the fact that the steel trade is tightly controlled by an international <i>cartel</i> which has received governmental recognition in most European countries and which is, in fact, able to dictate prices and allocate markets, etc., and if the Belgians were able to sell fabricated steel at a price which our steel manufacturers could not compete with, that was due to the fact that the <i>cartel</i> had decided that our steel manufacturers would not get the steel and that the Belgians would be facilitated in cutting prices. That is a form of control over industrial activities and prices much more effective perhaps than our Prices Commission and much less obtrusive, and about which Senators should concern themselves a little more.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that when I spoke about the new steel plant that is being erected in Cork I said that there is no reason, in my opinion, why steel could not be produced here as cheaply as it is being sold in Great Britain.  I think we could do it cheaper.  In saying that, I recognise that the British price is a <i>cartel</i> price.  It probably contains a number of uneconomic elements. But, if the plant erected in Cork is properly equipped and efficiently managed, it will be able to get its raw materials, its coal and labour, as cheap as any similar plant in Great Britain and will be able to work better because, from all the documents I have read on the subject, the British plants are, on the whole, extremely inefficient.  It is undoubtedly true that, on occasion, for specialised classes of goods like the goods required for a railway, to which the Senator referred, Irish firms cannot <Col N="500" /> compete at anything like the price at which English firms, which turn out these goods in millions against the thousands required here, are able to supply, particularly if the foreign firm is anxious to retain a position in the market here.  But, when Senators seek to compare the price quoted for an English product against an Irish product, there are so many factors which they must take into account before they can be satisfied that there is a fair basis of comparison that it is almost impossible to do so.  One must be satisfied that each price is yielding a profit to the person selling the goods, that there are not other factors, such as I referred to in the case of fabricated steel, operating, and that in every way the price quoted by a foreign firm is capable of comparison with the price quoted here.  That investigation can only be carried out by such a body as the Prices Commission, and they found considerable difficulty in getting some foreign firms who quoted low prices to show that these prices were in fact economic.</P>

    <P>1.  In page 3, Section 2, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the word &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo; shall be construed as not including any area which is, for the time being, not within the area and extent of application of the laws enacted by the Oireachtas;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>2.  In page 4, at the end of Section 2, to add the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;The word &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo; does not mean Ireland as defined by Article 4 of the Constitution, but only that part of the national territory which is under the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;&mdash;(Senator Douglas.)</P>

      <P>I take it that the Government amendment No. 1 would cover the point raised by Senator Douglas' amendment. I may say that this is the same wording as is used in at least one other Act, that is the Finance Act, 1938.</P>

      <P>My objection to the Minister's amendment is exactly the same objection I have to my own amendment.  My object in putting it down was to draw the attention of the House and the country to the fact that the Government has introduced a Bill here which uses the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; to refer only to the Twenty-Six Counties.  I consider that this is a highly undesirable state of affairs and while it may legally be remedied either by my amendment or by that of the Minister&mdash;I am satisfied to withdraw mine in favour of the Minister's&mdash;it will not put the matter right.  If the constitutional position is such that the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is to be used in all legislation as referring only to that part of Ireland over which the Oireachtas has control, then I suggest that, even if a constitutional Bill is necessary, the Government should remedy the position.  I think it is an absurd position that in this Bill we speak of going from Ireland into Northern Ireland, which means from Ireland to Londonderry or Ireland to Belfast, and that if I go to Belfast I should, according to the Bill, say I am leaving Ireland to go to Belfast. I am only showing the absurdity of the position.  I certainly consider that it was right to draw the attention of the House to it and that this House should draw the attention of the Government to it.</P>
      <P>For the moment, this Bill has to be passed.  The word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is used and clearly it only means the area under the control of the Oireachtas at the moment.  The Minister is putting in an amendment to show that that is all it does mean.  But the fact remains that the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is used there in a manner which I say is not desirable.  I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>If the method <Col N="502" /> proposed here by the Minister is necessary, it indicates that something more general and more definite should be done than the constant insertion in every Bill which the Oireachtas will be called upon to pass of this particular type of amendment.  Surely it is not contended that in every Act we pass we will define &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in this particular way.  The draftsman, with whom I have the greatest possible sympathy, drafted Section 30 in such a way as to raise the point to which this amendment of the Minister's is the answer.  Section 30 says: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to export eggs unless the eggs are exported... by being transported by a farmer or his servants from Ireland into Northern Ireland in the course of his business as a farmer.&rdquo;  In other words, for a purely political reason, and as the result of a mixture of undiluted politics with the fundamental law of the State, with the Constitution, we find ourselves in a difficulty to which there is no solution except solutions which are, each one of them, objectionable.  Here the proposed solution is to use Ireland in all Bills and then to define Ireland as not to mean Ireland at all. The other solution is to outrage the English language and our whole national tradition and to confuse Irish people all over the world and English speakers everywhere by saying that the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is to mean Twenty-Six Counties of Ireland only. Originally the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; was brought in merely, I suggest, through political spite.  We had an example of it here in the endeavour to completely upset and destroy the word &ldquo;Saorstát,&rdquo; which certain people with delicate consciences could not stand.  It would be interesting for the House to know that the word &ldquo;Saorstát&rdquo; was originally devised as the Irish translation of the Irish Republic.  &ldquo;Saorstát Éireann&rdquo; was a term which you could use, and you could apply it to Saorstát goods or Saorstát products. The position at present is that the draftsman cannot draft a Bill to say what it means unless he puts in, in advance, this definition.  Customs men find it difficult to draw up customs regulations.  You cannot call our goods <Col N="503" /> Irish goods or Éire goods.  When the negotiations with the British were in progress recently some people found that the genitive of Éire was Éireann and they started making an adjective of Éireann and talking of an Éireann minister.  In this connection a knowledge of Irish is a drawback.  You have got to define &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in this fashion or you have got to outrage the English language or the Irish language by calling these Twenty-Six Counties Ireland or &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  People who have the advantage, or perhaps I should say the disadvantage, of knowing Irish have to listen perpetually to a mispronunciation every day by all kinds of people of that word.  One cannot use Irish or Eireannach or Gaolach, because none of these words expresses the meaning.  What we are reduced to now is to outrage the Irish language by using the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  A number of English people are beginning to address correspondence here to &ldquo;Éire.&rdquo;  I have seen some letters myself addressed to the National University, Dublin, Éire.  These people think it is something funny on the part of the people of this country to use this new-fangled word, calling the Twenty-Six Counties &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was once said of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he was waging war upon the arithmetic table and that he could not succeed.  We now have a war being waged upon geography, upon the Irish language and the English language.  That cannot succeed either.  In Derry in the month of September this year I was asked by a British Customs officer: &ldquo;Are you coming in from Ireland?&rdquo;  and although I am a very enthusiastic person and a very painstaking teacher I could not undertake to tell that very courteous young man about it.  He did not intend it as an insult.  But we have done this in the Constitution in a mixture of spleen and propaganda in an endeavour to convey that by calling something out of its name we are changing its nature.  We are not able to do that.  In attempting to do it we are causing immense difficulties for the Parliamentary draftsmen and for those who have to draft regulations dealing <Col N="504" /> with the customs.  We have made it extremely difficult even for ourselves in ordinary speech.  It has made and is making Irish speech just as difficult as English speech.  A newspaper here on the day that the Constitution came into operation&mdash;a paper that does not go in very much for Irish&mdash;had this line in its headings: &ldquo;Ní h-í an Éire seo an Éire a bhí anallod ann&rdquo; which means when translated: &ldquo;This Ireland is not the Ireland that was there long ago&rdquo;.  Indeed it is not.  This amendment must be accepted now.  I do think that some consideration should be given by the Government to the removing of the error that was made in changing the name of this State, because in Bills you will be constantly up against this kind of cumbersome thing.  That can surely be done.  The Ministers are freely and gracefully, as we heard yesterday evening, acknowledging their past errors and that being so, it would not be any harm for them to acknowledge this one and make reparation to the Irish and English languages.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I could attempt to cross swords on constitutional matters with the two Senators who have preceded me.  Certainly not in the matter of eloquence.  But I do certainly think that the outrage of calling these Twenty-Six Counties &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; happened in 1922, because we had grown then to have great admiration for the Irish Republic which was then known as &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;.</P>

Ministers may be admitting certain errors and I admit having committed an error in taking this seriously.  I made a mistake in taking this seriously.  I now see it was put down in order to have a talk on constitutional matters.  I do not want the amendment.  I am quite all right legally without it.</P>

      <P>I confess the amendment does not please me either, but on both sides of the House there are people who are pleased with it.  I am not competent to interpret the particular Article of the Constitution of which this is a translation, but when we are putting into a Bill of ours terms like these demonstrating that in our view Northern Ireland is not in Ireland we are doing something that is undoubtedly wrong and I do not think this House should subscribe to that sort of thing. I think that is something at which we will have the finger of scorn pointed. In addition, other people can argue: &ldquo;Look at what they are saying themselves.&rdquo; I cannot find a solution because I was not responsible for creating the position in which these terms have to be used.  Though the Minister and Senator Hayes are not satisfied that the amendment is an improvement of the position&mdash;though I think it is some improvement&mdash;I am satisfied that it demonstrates something anyhow.  It demonstrates that the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; there does not mean Ireland.  That in itself is something anyhow.  It is some improvement on what is in the Bill.  What is in the Bill is wrong but I do not think that we in this House ought to accept either in this or in any other Bill passing through that we are ever going to say that Northern Ireland is not part of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Minister that my amendment was <Col N="506" /> not put down for political purposes, but in a perfectly genuine desire to see whether there was not a way out of the difficulty.  The question of whether or not this should go in is a matter for the House to determine, but on the question of whether or not I think it should go in my mind would be helped very much in the matter if the Minister would give me an answer on a point which I wish to make.  I wish to assure him that I have a perfectly genuine reason for this.  Let us suppose that a firm has a contract entitling them to the sole distribution of goods in Ireland, can he say what is meant there by the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;? In the Minister's Bill, it seems to me, a certain distinction is made, and I want to have a clear definition as to what is meant by the term &ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo; Is it what we always knew as &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in legal documents or not?  If the term &ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; which existed in legal and business documents for many years, has now ceased to mean the whole of Ireland, and only means a part of the country, I suggest that the Minister should not put forward his amendment.</P>

      <P>I thought, Sir, that Senator Baxter was sitting down just when I was proceeding to rise.  As a matter of fact, I thought he was getting nervous because I might be saying something against him, as he <Col N="507" /> usually does against me, and as I, I must confess, usually do against him. However, as we were of the same mind on the last evening, I should like to say I disliked the phraseology here just as he did, and I still object to it.  I believe that, by using the phraseology employed in the Minister's amendment there is a certain exclusion, but I also believe there is a further exclusion in the amendment proposed by Senator Douglas.  I certainly think that it is ambiguous, to say the least of it, to have any enactment in which there is any reference to transporting goods from &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; to &ldquo;Northern Ireland.&rdquo; No matter how the phrase can be qualified or justified legally, I hold that it is inaccurate, in an Act of this Oireachtas, to have it inserted in that manner.</P>

      <P>Now, however, when Senator Hayes comes along to speak of the Constitution being passed as a result of a certain amount of spleen and propaganda, I do not think he is speaking from the point of view of the Senators here, but rather from the point of view of political Party prejudice, and for the benefit of people outside.  Surely, at this hour of the day and at this stage of the nation's progress, Senator Hayes should not wish to repeat statements like that in this House.  If the Senator wants to remove an outrage&mdash;the outrage which is really the cause of all this thing here&mdash;let him proceed to join with the rest of us in an effort to remove Partition.  Once Partition is removed Senator Hayes and his followers can take steps to see that any ambiguity that may be here in this Bill is removed, because the Constitution defines Eire as the whole country.  I think that the difficulty that we are faced with is that we have an area which includes a portion over which we <Col N="508" /> can legislate, and also an area over which, at the moment, we cannot legislate. Let Senator Hayes speak of removing outrages by endeavouring to remove the evil of Partition, instead of saying that the Constitution was passed for purposes of spleen and political propaganda.  Surely, the Senator should have reached a stage of his education by now to have got beyond that kind of thing.  Apart from that, however, I still believe&mdash;and I put it to the Minister that some change could be made in paragraph (f), so as to make it read &ldquo;being transported by a farmer or his servants from the area of jurisdiction of Ireland into Northern Ireland&rdquo;, or some such words as these. I think that that would cover what we mean to convey here and that it would not create the ambiguity at present conveyed by using the phrase &ldquo;from Ireland into Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>This point was raised by Senator Douglas on the Committee Stage.  In the Bill, power is taken to direct any exporter to export his eggs by any specified route.  I explained that the object of that was to see that the eggs would go by routes on which we would have facilities for adequate inspection. Senator Douglas was anxious that the interests of the transport company concerned should be safeguarded, so that we should not have the power to safeguard any one transport company more than another.

      <P>In page 29, Section 52, sub-section (1), to delete clause (ii) of paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this matter on the Committee Stage, and since then I have made inquiries from small purchasers of eggs&mdash;collectors throughout the country.  The Minister stated that at a conference which was held with those who take part in this work, that is, itinerant collectors throughout the country&mdash;I think he said there were three of them present&mdash;they agreed that this regulation could be carried out without any trouble.  As the section stands, the position is that the Minister can make an order which will require the collectors of eggs to put in a docket with each purchase.  In the West of Ireland, anyhow&mdash;I am sure that the people on the other side of the <Col N="511" /> House know this as well as I do, and I would ask them to support me in appealing to the Minister to delete the sub-section which I am asking him to delete&mdash;at this time of the year and during other parts of the year as well the man who is going around purchasing eggs may buy as small a number as six from one producer, ten from another, and perhaps a score from another.  If this regulation is made he will be required to put a docket with the eggs purchased from each person, the object being, of course, to ascertain subsequently, if some of the eggs go bad, the actual source from which they were purchased.  The object is all right, but I have it from a number of persons who take part in this business that if it is not impossible it is certainly very difficult to have such a regulation carried out.</P>
    <P>It might also have another repercussion. If this regulation were made, a collector might say to the person who wished to sell a small quantity of eggs: &ldquo;I cannot take them.  You must get a larger quantity because it takes three dozen to fill a tier in a container.&rdquo;  The producer would then have to take the eggs back and keep them for perhaps another week, with the result that they might eventually be sold in a more or less stale condition.  In any case, I am assured by the persons engaged in this business that it would be most impracticable to carry out this regulation, and I would ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I shall have to oppose very strenuously the suggestion made by Senator Conlon.  What I stated here the last day is true&mdash;that the representatives of collectors on the consultative council said that they could not see any difficulty in this. At least one of them, to my recollection, said that he had always done it. I think that the collectors who are opposing this are not too clear on what is required.  They will in any case under other parts of this Bill have to use a prescribed container for collecting those eggs.  Senator Conlon said that one tier would hold perhaps three dozen eggs.  That may be so; I do not know.  They just put the eggs on the bottom tiers in rows.  They need not <Col N="512" /> have one tier for each producer.  The idea is that, even if one producer supplies only seven eggs, when they come to the last of those a docket is to be put in with the name of the producer. It is just a docket torn out of a small book.  They then start off with the eggs supplied by the next producer, even if it is in the middle of a section, and at the end they put in a little docket with the name of that producer, and so on until they fill the container. It is not necessary to have a container for each producer; it is not even necessary to have a separate tier in the container for each producer.  It does not matter in the least how many eggs any particular producer supplies.  It is all the same whether it is three, or three dozen, or 20 dozen.  They go ahead until they come to the last egg in his particular lot, and then put in a docket.</P>
      <P>It is not really that we want to get back to those people to prosecute them.  Prosecution, of course, is possible; it is an offence, remember, under this section, for any person to sell a bad egg.  Therefore, if a producer sells a bad egg, and it is traced back to him, it is an offence, but I have no intention of prosecuting a producer who sells a few dozen eggs to a collector and has his docket put beside them.  When the wholesaler examines them, and finds there is a bad egg, it is reported to the Department. There is no intention whatever of prosecuting that producer.  The intention is this, that the wholesaler may be able to say to the collector: &ldquo;There were so many bad eggs in the lot you sent up to me, and they are attributable to the following producers,&rdquo; giving the numbers sent by each producer.  If there is an odd bad egg amongst a producer's supplies, probably no notice is taken of it even by the collector, but if the collector is continually getting a number of bad eggs from one producer he will take action.  He will say to the producer: &ldquo;Unless you give me good eggs in future I will not take any more eggs at all from you.&rdquo;  The producer will then have to do things properly, collect his eggs every day, and get rid of them as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> That is the whole object of this particular paragraph which Senator Conlon asks to have deleted.  It is a most important provision to have there, because we cannot make the improvements we are out to make unless we can trace the eggs back, and find out who is the individual producer who is sending up the bad eggs.  I do not at all believe that the collectors are going to have the trouble of which they are afraid.  As I say, the collectors who were present, and heard the matter explained properly at the Consultative Council meeting, said they would have no trouble, and I think that the other collectors, when the matter is explained to them again, will probably have no objection to this regulation.  I would earnestly ask the Seanad to oppose the amendment proposed by Senator Conlon, because I genuinely believe that this is one of the most important provisions in the Bill if we want to get an improvement in our egg trade.</P>

      <P>Beginning literally <i>ab ovo</i>, this discussion has ranged over a wide territory, and even brought us into consideration of matters of high constitutional import.  My contribution to the debate will concern itself with homelier aspects of the questions involved.  The Bill in its Title purports to make further and better provision for the sale and export of eggs.</P>
      <P>It necessarily has, also, for its aim an effort to recapture our place in the sun of egg marketing by the increased production of bigger and better eggs under hygienic conditions.  This is part of the plan in which the Minister will need the co-operation of the women of the countryside, a fact which justifies my intervention in this debate.  It occurred to me at one period that if the Minister could be got to accept an amendment making it compulsory on the man of the house to turn over all profits from egg-raising to the <i>bean a' tighe</i> that co-operation would be assured.  I was prevented from moving such an amendment by my fear of rousing the opposition of that strong champion of individual liberty, Senator Sir John Keane.  Fortunately it has been rendered unnecessary by the fact that through a custom which is well-nigh universal, the egg money is, in most farming households, the <i>bean a' tighe's</i> perquisite, her pin money. At least such was the case in my youth. In the old house where it was spent, I remember many anxious looks being directed to, and many anxious calculations centering around, the egg money-box when the sitting-room carpet had ceased to resemble even remotely a carpet, and there was the question of <i>mater familias</i> endeavouring to replace it at some local auction.  I believe that salutary custom, which is most conducive to domestic harmony, still prevails, and that egg production in the ordinary farmhouse comes under the direct management of the women of the house.  There would not be that matrimonial happiness, which is almost universal in this country, if it were otherwise.  For that reason, it seems to me desirable that the Minister should make a special attempt to interest women in this particular piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was greatly edified by what Senator <Col N="515" /> Counihan said in his admirable speech on the Second Reading stage. He suggested that poultry instructresses should try to get in touch, not only with the bigger producers, where the best modern methods are already in use, or easy of introduction, but with the ordinary farmhouses, where egg production has hitherto been carried on in a rather casual and haphazard way.  I entirely agree with that proposal.  I also suggest that in those happy parishes where the Minister has one of his excellent schools of rural domestic economy, he should try to have the women of the parish, and of the neighbouring countryside, invited to a discussion with the instructress on the best methods of egg production, and of getting loans for poultry houses.  I suppose it would be Utopian at this stage of our development to suggest that there might be in these schools, perhaps during holiday time, occasional rural week-ends for farmers' wives and daughters, in imitation of that admirable experiment which has been so successful and so stimulating for the menfolk.  It is a great pity that women cannot be got together in these schools to discuss their problems with the instructresses.  The Minister might, at an appropriate date, call the poultry instructresses into conference, the main object of which would be to get the women of the countryside interested in the effort to get bigger and better egg production.  The industry is admirably suited for small holdings and could be made a great asset in the national Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that what is needed is a larger output of eggs. Unfortunately eggs of different sizes are being produced by different breeds of poultry.  The great drawback to the industry is in procuring proper breeds. There are not enough poultry stations, and the price charged for sittings of eggs from pure breeds is higher than it should be.  I believe the charge should not be more than 50 per cent. over the current market price.  In that way people would be encouraged to get more sittings from pure-breeds of poultry.  While that matter cannot be dealt with under this Bill, I hope the <Col N="516" /> Minister will introduce a Poultry Bill later.  Male birds that are not purebred should be got rid of, and the only way to do that is to have stocks of these birds at poultry stations.  Reference has been made to stale eggs and the danger that, if sold, prosecutions might ensue.  I believe that inferior or mixed breeds of fowl are to blame for stale eggs.  Eggs from pure breeds are able to remain fresh longer than those produced from mixed breeds. The Bill will give very little assistance until we have proper breeds of fowl and suitable eggs for export.</P>

      <P>A point arose on the Second Reading, when I contended that the increase in the cost of feed was the main factor in causing a diminution in the poultry population. In his reply the Minister stated that the poultry population began to diminish in 1929 or 1930, and, not being a walking dictionary of statistics, I accepted the statement.  Since then I have had an opportunity of looking up the facts, and I find that the poultry population of Eire in 1929 was 22.1 millions; in 1930, 22.9; in 1931, 22.8; in 1932, 22.5; in 1933, 22.5; and after that year there was a drop of 2,000,000 registered. In 1934 the figures were 20.0 millions; in 1935, 19.5, and in 1936, 20.3 millions.  In other words the poultry population reached maximum in 1930, and remained practically at that maximum level until 1933, when it dropped.  I submit that the cause of that drop was the Minister's policy in artificially increasing the price of feed. To bring the point out more clearly, I have the figures of the poultry population in Northern Ireland, where feeders were not handicapped, but were able to get the advantage of the cheap Indian meal and the other feeding-stuffs that existed in 1933.  The poultry population there in 1926 was 7.9 millions, and it rose to 10.15 in 1933; 10.3 in 1934, then fell to 10.1 in 1935, and in 1936 reached the maximum level of 10.6 millions.  That year our poultry population was below the level it had reached some years ago.  My contention is that the figures bear out my statement, that the main factor in reducing the poultry population was the policy of having the cost of feed <Col N="517" /> artificially dear.  If the Minister denies that, he must admit that the main object of the policy of the maize mixture scheme was to increase artificially the price of corn and oats for growers of these crops.  If his policy succeeded in making barley and oats dearer for the people who grow them, it must have succeeded in making barley and oats dearer for the people who had to use them as a raw material for poultry and other forms of animal production.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I had not the good fortune to hear the remarks of Senator Mrs. Concannon, but I heard that she mentioned my name and that it provoked merriment in certain quarters. That being so, I am tempted to read two extracts from a letter which I received since the Second Stage of this measure came up for consideration.  It is from a practical lady in the country who keeps poultry and who knows what she is talking about.  I shall read two short extracts bearing upon the question of the price of foodstuffs. This lady says: &ldquo;I have asked many cottage women what they have done with all the hens they used to have and, without one exception, the answer has been: &ldquo;We cannot afford the price of meal.&rdquo;  She goes on: &ldquo;What is the use of officials flying all over the country in grand motor cars&mdash;a sheer waste of money.  How much better to halve or quarter the officials (I do not mean their bodies!)  and use the money saved on their salaries by reducing the cost of feeding?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether <Col N="518" /> the lady referred to by Senator Sir John Keane keeps accurate costings. It is very hard to keep such figures in the case of poultry.  I think the only true guide in these things is whether they are on the increase or whether there is a decrease.  I mentioned figures to which Senator Johnston referred, which showed that the biggest reduction in our exports was from 1929 to 1931.  We went down by a 1,000,000 in those two years.  Since 1931 we have not gone down at that rate, because if we did we would not have anything at all.  The reason that time, I take it, was that people thought that poultry or egg production was not paying. This year our exports are going up and the explanation probably is that producers think eggs are paying.  For the first year since 1929 our exports and our production generally are going up.  There appears to be a turn in the tide.</P>
      <P>We have heard extracts from a letter quoted by Senator Sir John Keane where a lady consulted many cottage women as to why they got out of poultry. Many of them cannot have got out of poultry, because there was never a bigger reduction than 10 per cent.  If we go back for 16 or 17 years, years for which we have statistics, we will find that there is no bigger difference than 10 per cent.  If the cottage lady had 20 hens originally, she would have 18 or 19 now.  Such sweeping statements about the poultry industry do not represent the facts. Poultry can be divided into turkeys, geese, ducks and fowls, such as hens and chickens.  I took certain figures over a period of six months and those figures included cocks as well as hens.  There has been no great reduction that could be traced to the maize meal mixture, at any rate.  The numbers began to decline in 1930 and there was a steady decline until 1936, when there was a turn.</P>

That was the year of the maize-meal mixture.  Next year it was 9,500,000, the following year 9,100,000, and in the next year it was up again to 9,500,000.  I have only the estimate for 1937.</P>

      <P>There was a decline all along until the slight turn in 1936.  I should like to stress the fact that there was no greater difference than 10 per cent.  With regard to the point raised by Senator MacCabe, we have been doing everything we could to improve stocks in the country.  In the breeding of cattle or pigs, as in this case, it would be impossible to look after every farmer's stock, but as regards poultry, we are doing all we possibly can to put it within the reach of any farmer to get a good stock of eggs, chickens, pullets or cockerels.  With regard to Senator Mrs. Concannon's point, I think we have anticipated the suggestion of holding a conference of the county instructresses, trying to get them to pass on the same enthusiasm to the women throughout the country to go back into poultry, to impress on them that it should pay, and asking them to do their best.  I do not think it is necessary to pass a law that the proceeds of the poultry should go to the woman.  We usually pass laws here to protect the weaker partner, but it is not necessary in this case.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that this is a very minor Bill.  I have under contemplation rather large questions arising out of the pig and bacon industry as a result of reports which I have received from various quarters, including one from the Prices Commission, <Col N="520" /> which I believe will soon be published. I think it will be necessary&mdash; I am convinced it will&mdash;to make certain amendments in the present regulations, and perhaps in the present legislation, and I am almost certain that we shall make changes in the constitution of the two boards&mdash;the Pigs Board and the Bacon Marketing Board.  Those two boards are due for re-election on the last day of December and the 10th of January, respectively. I think it would be rather a loss of time to go through with the election of these boards, considering that we are going to bring in new legislation early next year which will have the effect of changing those boards completely, and their personnel. This Bill, therefore, is merely to allow those boards to carry on for a year longer or, alternatively, until new legislation is passed, and I expect that new legislation will be passed early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the House is not going to refuse the Second Reading of this Bill because, as we realise, the Minister, under legislation, has been regulating the pigs and bacon trade for a few years now.  There were references to it in the discussion on the previous measure, I think on the Second Reading. I think the Minister interpreted me as having said on that occasion something to the effect that that legislation was a failure.  I do not think he is correct.  If the Minister will look up the debate he will see that is not so.  What I did say about this legislation was, and what is true of it is, that it has not brought the satisfactory results that were anticipated from it. The truth is that the producers, anyhow, are not satisfied with the results flowing from the passing of the Pigs and Bacon Act and the consequent setting up of two boards under that Act by the Minister.  I am not going into any arguments here as to the causes of failure or, if I might rather put it another way, the lack of confidence of the producers in the machinery which the Minister is operating at present. There is in my county and, I know, in other counties as well a great deal of criticism of the operation of these boards I suppose there would be <Col N="521" /> criticism anyhow.  No matter how well anything is done we will still have some who would not be satisfied, but, I think it is true to say that, if we are to judge by the fruits, and if we are to look at our pig statistics, we cannot be satisfied that the legislation has brought the good results that we would have hoped for from it.  I pointed out then, as I believe, that you are not going to achieve marvellous results from the regulation of trade or too much interference with it.  I am quite convinced of that.  I am not, on the other hand, one of those who are prepared to take the risks of causing the upheaval in the trade which we would inevitably have if these boards were to be abolished to-morrow.  Confusion and dislocation of trade would be something that neither the producers of pigs nor the manufacturers in the factories would desire.  I do not think we can take any risks at all in that matter and we have no choice, therefore, if the Minister is not going to hold the elections, as he would be entitled to under the existing legislation, but to prolong the life of the boards.  I want, however, to make this comment at this stage.  The Minister apparently is satisfied that there are large questions arising now from the experience which he has had both with regard to the regulations which were made under the Act and the fruits of the legislation itself.  Both, apparently, are to some degree faulty.  He indicates that he holds the view that there will have to be changes in the boards, their constitution and so on, but what exactly is in the back of his mind he has not put very clearly before the House.  Perhaps it has not assumed sufficiently concrete form yet for him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It occurs to me at this stage that perhaps it would not be out of place to suggest to the Minister if, by the fact of the Oireachtas passing this Bill, he is now in the position of continuing the life-time of the present boards for another 12 months, unsatisfactory as they are deemed to be in the country, would it not be advisable to refer the whole question of the pig industry in the country and the results of the legislation and so on to the new agricultural commission which, we understand, <Col N="522" /> will soon be made operative?  He could ask them for an interim report. He would thus have the opportunity of getting the producers and the people in the trade and so on to go there and give their point of view, and if you were going to come again with legislation here, asking for it, you would have something that would be fairly complete.  I imagine it would be possible to get a short examination of that problem now.  There is no necessity for an examination of the vast and comprehensive fashion that you had at the previous inquiry and you could, I think, get a better and fuller view of the effects of your legislation if you were able to bring producers, curers and your own experiences departmentally as well as the consumers before a body of men who would examine in detail the consequences of what has flowed from the legislation which has been passed.</P>
    <P>I myself do not feel that it is wise of the Minister to come here with proposals that are merely the results of departmental examination of the position. I think you might do that and that you would have further proposals later.  My view is that, now that you have an opportunity of continuing the present conditions for another 12 months, you could easily, if the commission were asked to do so, inquire into the present condition and get suggestions for more comprehensive legislation that would suit the situation and the circumstances for perhaps some years to come.  My view is that it would be better to wait and to get that rather than come forward with new proposals that will later perhaps have to be amended by additional proposals resulting from the findings of this commission which the Minister is setting up.</P>

      <P>In reference to one thing that Senator Baxter has said, first of all I would like to say that I think that the law and the regulation have been very successful in some respects, in fact in most respects, but, as a result of a very painstaking and definite examination undertaken by certain officers of the Department and also as a result of the receipt from the Prices Commission of a report on the bacon <Col N="523" /> industry, I think that changes could be very usefully made.  I do not think, therefore, that it would be necessary to refer the question to the agricultural commission because you have two very definite committees that have examined it, each from a very different point of view.  They agree in some respects and disagree in others but I think that where they agree perhaps we can take them as being matters that should be adopted and where they disagree we will have to try and take the best alternative.</P>

Senator Douglas took the cynical and despairing view that, if you consulted the people in any shape or form about a measure like this, they would always decide against giving anybody an increase of pay or an increase of allowance.  I do not believe that that is true.  In that respect, I find myself more optimistic about democracy than some of the Senators who spoke yesterday.  I quite agree that, at the sort of country meeting where bands are playing, drums are beating and banners are flying, you will get a larger measure of applause if you talk about the overpayment of officials in Dublin, the overpayment of members of the Legislature and so forth, but you get a truer insight into the point of view of the people and the reasonableness of the people if you go among them in a more private fashion.  For my part, when I was a Deputy, the only sort of meetings I cared to hold or that seemed to me to do any good, either to myself or to my constituents, were impromptu Sunday morning meetings beside the Chapel where frequently under wet and bleak conditions, one got up shivering and miserable on a wall, talked to the people in an unrhetorical fashion about this, that and the other thing, and encouraged them to ask questions.  My general experience of the plain people, as they were so often referred to yesterday, is that when you approach them in that way&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are eminently reasonable, and that they would be perfectly capable of judging of the merits of such a proposal as this.  We <Col N="526" /> should not take the cynical and despairing view that consideration of any such matter must be kept away from the Irish people, that a measure of this kind must necessarily be smuggled through behind their backs. That seems to me to be not only an undemocratic doctrine, but to be flying in face of the actual facts.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that if the people do not approve of this they can show their views about it at the next election.  Of course that is not so. They will be presented then with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  They will be presented with sets of Party candidates from the big Parties who are already committed on the subject.  It is not to be expected that every other issue will be disregarded, and that a host of new candidates will be put up just to deal with the question of Deputies' and Senators' allowances.  The time when it should have been considered by the country as a whole was at the last election.  It was a matter of decency to include it among the various things which they had then to consider.  To my mind if that had been done it is very doubtful whether all the people who are now supporting the measure&mdash; I do not say in this House, but who are now supporting the measure else where&mdash;would, in fact, have been found supporting it.  Consequently, I am still of the opinion that it is wrong to pass such a measure as this without some kind of consultation with the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested by various Senators opposite, with a kind of logic which I confess I do not follow, that for me to say the country should have been consulted is paradoxical, in view of the fact that I was not a candidate myself at the last election.  It seems to me if that is so, almost every Senator&mdash;in fact every Senator&mdash;in this House is similarly precluded from such a discussion except those who went actually to the constituencies and who were rejected by them.  It appears to me that that line of argument is unreasonable. Senator Quirke's statements as to whether or not I could have got a constituency to elect me are utterly valueless, just as valueless as would be bare assertions of the same kind on my part.  I merely say that, as far as my <Col N="527" /> leaving of the Dáil was concerned, it was certainly not because I thought I could not get elected in my constituency or in any constituency in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of no approval having been obtained from the country, I come to the point that the Shanley Committee's findings have been arbitrarily set aside.  Here again Senator Douglas, and with him I think Senator Johnston and Senator Tierney, have taken what seems to me the rather surprising line of saying that we must leave a matter like this to the Government to decide, and that we are bound to accept their view as to what is necessary for Deputies.  If there had been no such thing as a Committee of Inquiry, I could perhaps understand that point of view, but why should we prefer the views of the Government to the views of the Committee of Inquiry unless some sort of substantial reasons have been offered to us by the Government for preferring their views?  In point of fact, the Government have been more vague in explaining how they arrived at their conclusions than the Shanley Committee was.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would seem to me that a Senator who refuses to make any sort of attempt to use his own judgment about what is a suitable and adequate allowance, if he is going to rely on some external authority to decide it for him, should be much more ready to rely on the findings of the Shanley Committee than upon the decision of the Government to bring in this Bill.  I do not suggest for a moment&mdash;I have never suggested and have never said a word to suggest&mdash; that the Government were acting in bad faith in this matter, or that it was the consequence of some sort of improper or semi-corrupt bargain between them and their followers.</P>

      <P>It would be very helpful if the Minister explained right away.  I mean to imply nothing.  I mean to say perfectly plainly what I am saying, and there is no innuendo behind it.  I say, in regard to this measure as to many other Government measures, that one starts with the assumption that there is a Party desire for it.  That assumption in this case has been fortified by the fact that the Minister told us yesterday that a number of Deputies have been pressing for this increase for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a Government, and obviously a Government depending upon a Party for its support, is more accessible to the views of Deputies and of representations by Deputies than an impartial committee of inquiry is, and, all other things being equal, my inclination, <Col N="529" /> and I think the inclination of any ordinary man in the street, is to accept the views of a committee of inquiry rather than the views of a Government, and that is not implying for one moment that there is any improper or fraudulent influence being used upon the Government in arriving at their decision.  I merely say that I would prefer, <i>a priori</i>, in connection with this Government as I would in connection with any other Government, the findings of a committee of inquiry to theirs on such a subject.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister said that yesterday's discussion had been conducted on too low a plane, and God knows I agree with him; but, in so far as his observations referred to the fact that I attempted to give the actual figures of what a Deputy's political expenses were, it seems to me that his remark had no sensible application.  If we are to be ruled out from discussing the subject of Deputies' Allowances, that is one thing.  Well and good, let us face that situation.  But, if we are to discuss the subject, I ask in heaven's name how can you discuss it except by trying to form an estimate of what the expenses are.  The Minister seems to think that there is some other more high-falutin' and high-toned method of dealing with the question.  One should go back, I think he said, to first principles or something of that kind.  But what better principle is there than to be just, fair, and equitable?  I do not know how to form a view as to what is just, fair and equitable except by looking into figures.  When you come to a question of finance, figures are surely paramount, and this is a question of finance.</P>
    <P>The figures that I suggested yesterday were not, in my view, seriously challenged. Some Senators said that I allowed too low a figure for charitable subscriptions.  I am quite prepared to accept that.  I said that I put forward that figure very tentatively and subject to correction.  I can considerably alter that figure for charitable subscriptions and still leave a large margin. One Senator said that it was absurd to allow for Deputies being 100 days in the year in Dublin, because if they were 100 days in the year in Dublin then they could not possibly carry on <Col N="530" /> any other business in their own constituency: that their politics would be a whole-time job.  I was trying to be as generous as possible.  I do not think that the average Deputy does spend 100 days in Dublin, and so I wished to allow for the maximum that the average Deputy was likely to spend. It has been suggested that the figure of 15/- a day is an insufficient figure. Of course, if you include all the social amenities, and if you include the upkeep and support of a family and so forth, it is, but I was not attempting to include anything of that sort.  I meant it to cover only one thing which I find it literally does in my own case cover, and that is board and lodging and nothing else.  Similarly, I heard nothing in the debate to convince me that my allowance for postage and secretarial work was too low.</P>
    <P>There does, however, remain one item to which more serious exception is taken, namely, the item of transportation within the Deputy's constituency. As to that, of course, if a Deputy is going to hire a motor-car several times in the week to go long distances through his constituency, I agree that he will quickly exceed the figure that I suggested of £2 a week or £104 a year.  But I think that it should be normal for a Deputy to have a small car of his own, and you can run a small car on something not far from £100 a year.  You can use a small car for all sorts of things besides your political duties.  You can even use it, if necessary, for going to Dublin, although a Deputy gets first-class railway expenses to Dublin.  It does not seem to me that the State would be doing badly or ungenerously in making a contribution of £104 a year to the individual Deputy running a small car in his constituency, or in making other arrangements if he preferred them.</P>

      <P>Every figure that I put forward was put forward as a suggestion for Senators to take cock-shies at if they liked, and was put forward in the hope that if my figures were wrong, and were bad figures, some alternative ones would be suggested. I should have thought that it was the primary and obvious duty of the Government, in putting forward these proposals, to put forward figures of their own so that we could form some sort of an idea of the basis on which they were working.</P>
      <P>I am not setting up any suggestions that I have made as being infallible or anything like infallible.  I just put them forward to the best of my ability as a contribution to the consideration of the subject.  If, instead of getting up and shouting out personal abuse, as so many of the supporters of this Bill did last night, they had put forward figures that they considered were more correct, it seems to me that they would have been contributing a great deal more than they did to the value of our discussion, and also that they would have had much greater effects on the minds of people down the country reading the reports of our debates.  I do think that the whole of our discussion yesterday&mdash;and perhaps it is going to be the same to-day &mdash;was conducted upon an acrimonious tone for which there is no sort of excuse.  If we are going to sink in this Assembly to talking about each other's accents, I do not know where we are going to end.  We will be talking about each other's clothes and the shape of each other's faces soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did consider, in view of certain innuendoes made by Senator Quirke and Senator McEllin yesterday, asking the leave of the Cathaoirleach to make <Col N="532" /> a personal statement at the beginning of our proceedings to-day.  On the whole, I came to the conclusion that I would not do so, not to make too much fuss about a personal thing.  But I should like to say now just this and then I will leave the matter&mdash;that I would ask the Seanad to accept my assurance that I never either made any gift in my constituency that I afterwards withdrew, or ever made any undertaking of a financial kind in my constituency that I did not carry out and much more than carry out.  With that I will leave the subject, merely saying that, if I should ever have any evidence of innuendoes of that sort again, either inside this House or among Senators outside, I would ask leave to make a statement and to give full details that I would much rather not give, because they would look like doing what one Senator very unjustly accused me of doing yesterday, and that is making a parade of benevolence.</P>
    <P>Passing from that most disagreeable subject, I ask what is the general theory of this Parliamentary allowance under the changes that we are being asked to make to-day?  I gather that the Minister for Finance is still most eager that it should be called an allowance, and not a salary.  He reproached me for not drawing attention to the fact that the Shanley Committee stated that it contained no element of salary, and that it contained no element of consequential loss.  I did not draw special attention to that remark of the Shanley Committee because I understood that the Minister's proposals also are by way of containing no element of salary and no element of compensation for consequential loss.</P>
    <P>If the new figure of £480 per year is to be a salary, then everything is changed.  There ought to be income-tax on it&mdash;and we advance a long step further on the road towards making politics a professional occupation.  But, as I understand from everything the Minister has said, that he still holds that normally the position of a Deputy or Senator ought not to be a whole-time occupation, that we continue as before to regard it as normally a part-time occupation, with the great <Col N="533" /> majority of members doing other things outside, as they do to-day, having other gainful occupations outside Leinster House, if that is so, he has no right to reproach me for leaving out what the Shanley Committee stated about salary.</P>
    <P>As regards consequential loss, on what possible basis can you assess consequential loss?  I cannot think of any. As I said yesterday, a man may make enormous sacrifices to go into politics, either out of a desire to shine, or out of pure unalloyed patriotism.  He may give up magnificent positions, and people have given up positions in this country and in other countries for that purpose.  But there is no means of assessing a figure that the State could possibly pay by way of compensation, and it is not the business of the State, in my opinion, to pay consequential loss.</P>
    <P>It was apparently believed by some of the Senators opposite that I was anxious to introduce qualifications that would henceforth have to be fulfilled by members of the Dáil and Seanad, and that I wanted a system under which everyone would have to pass examinations in economics and so forth.  Those who thought I meant that misunderstood me.  What I did say was that if you make politics a professional occupation with your eyes open, if you determine it is right and normal for the bulk of the people in politics to be living out of politics, then it would become appropriate to impose qualifications, and then the people of the country would have the right to say that, just as they expect men in other departments of life to spend money on university education, obtain certain degrees, and pass certain examinations before they can occupy a post of profit, so too, they would have a right to expect that members of the Dáil and Seanad would be able to do something more than make effective orations in the country, or even in the Dáil or Seanad; and something more even than go round and find out what the people want attended to in the way of claims for old age pensions, or blind pensions, or bog roads, or all the rest of it.  If we once become a profession, the <Col N="534" /> people will have the right to demand more of us than that.  But, as I said yesterday, and I repeat to-day, I do not think that it would be in the interests of the country that politics should become normally a profession for the bulk of the people who are taking part in it.  For that reason I would ask the Seanad to restore the figure proposed for the allowance to Deputies by the Shanley Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>As I did not speak with reference to this Bill yesterday, I feel that I ought to say a word or two about it to-day, especially as my name was taken perhaps not altogether in vain by Senator MacDermot. I think we ought to approach the consideration of this problem in a spirit of sincerity and without any false modesty and also from as impersonal a point of view as it is possible to arrive at.  In the first place, if it be agreed, as it is agreed, that there should be some remuneration by way of allowance or salary for Deputies and for Senators, I think we are all agreed that the work of Deputies is very much more onerous than the work of Senators, and that, therefore, Deputies should receive a higher allowance than what has been proposed for Senators. Therefore, if <i>x</i> pounds per year be the appropriate salary for Senators, 4<i>x</i> ÷ 3 seems to be indicated as an appropriate salary for Deputies.  We are, perhaps, inclined to attach excessive importance to this kind of debate, to the detriment of the other matters which sometimes come before us in which issues of far greater importance and far greater financial value to the nation, as a whole, are involved.  I could easily point to policies which have been legislated by both Houses and which have cost the nation millions of pounds a year without giving rise to any serious debate in the Oireachtas.  Yet, when we come to deal with a matter of this kind, which concerns merely the private financial position of Deputies and Senators, we have the most terrific debates in both Houses and an unhealthy amount of public interest outside these Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one way of looking at the matter; that is: Are we worth our proposed <Col N="535" /> allowances or salaries or are we not?  In my view, if we are worth anything, we are worth considerably more to the State than the salary of £360 a year each which it is proposed to give us and we ought to have no shame whatever and no false modesty about accepting the allowances which have been proposed for us in this Bill.  It has been said that one effect of payment of Senators and Deputies will be to introduce an undesirable element of professionalism into our politics.  I agree with Senator MacDermot that it is most desirable that disinterested public service should continue to be a permanent feature of our public life but, at the same time, I see nothing disgraceful and nothing humiliating in treating political life as an honourable profession.  After all, if it is an honourable way of making a living to cure the ills of the human body, as our doctor-friends attempt to do, surely it is honourable to attempt to cure the ills of the body politic, which is the primary function of the professional politician.  Therefore, let us have more and better professionalism in politics and the spirit of the right kind of professionalism. If that be so, I see no objection to remunerating such professionalism in exactly the same way as, and for the same reason that, we remunerate doctors and lawyers.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter is this: it is in the interest of the public that both Deputies and Senators should be as independent as possible in the exercise of their public functions and that they should, as far as possible, be able to devote themselves to the public service without any hankering thought of private financial anxiety.  The less independent, financially, Deputies and Senators are, the more dependent they will be either on Party funds or on payment of some kind or another from external interests which find it worth while to subsidise them, either indirectly or directly.  Therefore, the independence which you deny Deputies and Senators if you do not pay them an adequate allowance will only make them dependent on external, specialised interests which are, perhaps, not on all fours with the public interest.  The Seanad represents and, <Col N="536" /> I think, rightly represents the special knowledge which is derived from the association of members with special vocations, and that special knowledge is of importance to the State. But it is the duty of Senators, as of Deputies, in the last resort to prefer the interest of the nation to the specialised interest which may have had much to do with sending them to this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks apply equally to Deputies and Senators. My point is that, if they are not financially independent, they are more likely to be dependent on specialised interests of one kind or another and to be tempted to prefer these specialised interests to the general interest of the nation, which, in the long run, it is their duty to support.  There are serious practical difficulties in fixing these allowances.  One has to take into account the fact that the expenses connected with public life for Deputies are not the same in individual cases but vary very much.  If you fix an allowance based only on the average expenditure incurred by Deputies, then that allowance is not adequate for the marginal cases&mdash;the cases of those Deputies from the western seaboard whose expenses, for one reason or another, are above the average. Therefore, you impose, in that way, a handicap on certain Deputies in taking part in public life which does not apply to certain other Deputies whose expenses are, naturally, lower.  That being so, if your allowance is to be of such an amount as to make it possible for 100 per cent. of Deputies to play a part in public life without serious financial sacrifice, it must contain a surplus over and above the necessary expenditure of other Deputies who find themselves in a more privileged position and whose expenditure is not necessarily so high.  Admit that there is that element of privilege and surplus; in my view, the principle of equality requires that the payment of all members should be the same, and <Col N="537" /> if some of them, more fortunate than others and in receipt of a surplus in consequence, that is only the financial measure of their greater obligation to render public service in consideration of the privileged position they occupy.</P>
      <P>Another type of member has to be kept in view.  That is the member who has no other source of income during his membership than the allowance he receives for his services in the House. The allowance must be fixed at such a level as to enable a person who has no other means of support, no other way of keeping his wife or children than that allowance, to play a part in public life.  Otherwise, you deny these persons access to public life, and your constitutional position is, to that extent, undemocratic.  I feel that at the back of Senator MacDermot's mind all the time is the thought that, as a matter of course, all Deputies and Senators should have an income from some continuous source which would run on whether they take part in political life or not and that, therefore, they should spend the whole of their allowance on expenses wholly and exclusively arising in connection with their service in the Oireachtas. Although that may be the situation of many Deputies and Senators, it is not the situation of all Deputies and Senators and, in fixing the allowance which we think is adequate to the case, we must take into account the situation of the less privileged members.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak to-night, but as a member of the committee whose findings have been so questioned by the last speaker, I must, in justice to them and to myself, say something about the figure we fixed and why we fixed it.  As I said last night, it was hard to determine what we were asked to do.  After consultation with the Government, we decided that we were asked to find a fair and just amount for an allowance.  We were told that it was not to be a salary. It would be impossible to fix an average salary for the average Deputy. You would have to take too many things into account.  One would have to specify whether the T.D. was married or unmarried; or there would be the test of providing for his family <Col N="538" /> and for their education.  It would be impossible to deal with the matter that way.  We went into the whole question of the possible cost of the services demanded from a Deputy.</P>
      <P>We got evidence even from the people from the West of Ireland, and we then struck what we thought was just and equitable and what was perhaps a generously adequate figure. There were two dissentients.  There were two who suggested an increase of £5 per month, and they did not desire to sign the Majority Report.  On that account I think I must stand for my signature in loyalty to my colleagues who spent so much time dealing with this question, and went into all its ramifications.  We were not so feeble in our imaginations as not to survey the whole of Ireland.  We discussed all corners and all angles of the problem, and I think we gave a very considerable amount of time to it.  We honestly thought that we had arrived at some objective result.  If we were asked to define the salary, I do not think we could have done so, but I feel to-night that I must be consistent, out of loyalty to those who signed that report with me; therefore I will not support Senator MacDermot's amendment.</P>

I gave my views last night. My views are well known.  I intend to vote against this recommendation.  I believe that Senator Alton's views are perfectly honest and sincere but there is just one point to which I would wish to draw his attention.  I think the committee on which he acted considered what would be a reasonable allowance for a Deputy.  The Senator honestly gave his judgment as to what that allowance should be.  But then there comes in the question of consequential loss.  I referred yesterday to the speech of Deputy MacEoin.  For instance, you have some Deputy who has come from a long distance in Cork or Kerry.  He comes up here to Dublin to attend to his duty.  The allowance <Col N="539" /> he is given may go far to cover his expenses in Dublin but what about his work at home?  That work is left undone. Has anybody considered that side of the picture?  The Deputy's livelihood and the upkeep of his family depend on that work.  Is there any consideration at all given to that point?  I forgot last night to make that point clear.  I am trying to make it clear now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator MacDermot directed his attention to another aspect of the problem I would be more in sympathy with him.  If the Senator differentiated between the T.D.'s in Cork, Kerry or Donegal on the one hand and the T.D.'s living in Dublin I would be perhaps in agreement with him.  I am living here in Dublin and my attendance here does not entail any additional expense on me.  But the man from a long distance, the man from Cavan, say, has these heavy expenses to meet.  It would be understandable if the Senator proposed an amendment in that direction.  But we who are living here in Dublin have also other disadvantages.  Here is a programme that I will have to face to-morrow morning.  I will have to be in Cork Street fever hospital at 9 o'clock.  I have to attend an old-age pension meeting at 10.30.  I must be at a meeting of the Port and Docks Board at 1 o'clock and at a meeting of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee at 3 o'clock.  I have to attend a meeting of the City of Dublin Vocation Committee at 7.30.  Will anybody tell me how, with that programme before me, I could be at home working at my own business?  This is part of the programme we have to go through here.  I did not intend at all to speak but just to clear up the question of consequential losses.  But I know very well that if a man has to attend in the Dáil for three or four days he cannot, when he goes back to his home in the country, concentrate on his business. His mind is taken off his business for some time after going back and, therefore, his business must suffer as compared with that of the man who is constantly minding his own work.  I will finish by saying that I intend to <Col N="540" /> vote against Senator MacDermot's amendment.</P>

      <P>I also intend to oppose this recommendation.  I oppose it because I believe it is necessary, if we are to have the right type of Deputy, to increase the allowances to Deputies, and, for that matter, to Senators.  I would like to express my resentment at the statement made by Senator MacDermot when he suggests that our attitude in connection with this Bill and the attitude of the people who yesterday supported it was tantamount to smuggling the thing through behind the backs of the people.  I suggest there is no smuggling or no going behind the people's backs about anything that is being done here.  The Bill has been discussed very fully in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has been supported by practically every section in both Houses.  I think it comes particularly bad from Senator MacDermot, from ex-Deputy MacDermot, the Deputy who formed the Centre Party and who, when he had that Centre Party formed, made a compromise with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is too bad that Senator MacDermot would not learn some manners.  When the Senator found that he had suited his own purposes he cashed in on the Centre Party for a Front-Bench seat from Cumann na nGaedheal.  That is the kind of gentleman who comes along here to accuse the leaders of every Party in the <Col N="541" /> House of smuggling this Bill through behind the backs of the people.  I really feel very sorry for Senator MacDermot.  I feel sorry because I am perfectly convinced that he does not know anything about what he is talking and that he has no idea whatever of the conditions under which the average Deputy in the country is working. I am sorry for him because of the fact that he is supposed to know of these conditions, for he was for years a Deputy of the other House.  For that reason one would have thought he should know something about the work of a country Deputy.  If he knew anything at all about it he would know quite well that one constituency is different from another, and that while a man may be able to travel for £2 a week in the constituency of, say, Louth&mdash;I hope there is nobody here from Louth to contradict me&mdash;he would have no chance whatever of doing any such thing in Tipperary, Cork, or those other country constituencies that have been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing is absolutely ridiculous, and the man who says that it is possible to do anything of the kind is only making himself ridiculous before the people.  The Senator, however, goes further and says that a Deputy should be able to supply himself with a small car.  Where will the price come from for a small car?  The Senator says that it would not cost very much.  I suppose he would suggest that a Deputy should be able to purchase a second-hand car for about £20.  Well, I suggest that, if a Deputy went to Senator MacDermot and asked him whether or not the Senator would advise him to buy a second-hand car for £20, the Senator would say: &ldquo;For heaven's sake, do not do that, or the car will break you in the long run.&rdquo;  Now, however, the Senator finds great fault with us because we did not put up some alternative figure to the figure suggested by him yesterday, in connection with which 90 per cent. of the people would laugh at him.  I suggest that that would be a reasonable question to ask the Committee of Inquiry which was set up to deal with this <Col N="542" /> matter, but that it is not a question for this House to determine.</P>
    <P>The Senator goes further and considers himself very much hurt, and evidently feels that the people should consider him hurt, because an attempt was made to convey certain ideas by way of the innuendo, according to him. I shall speak for myself, and I say that there was nothing in the way of innuendo in anything that I said on this matter with regard to the Senator. I have gone to the trouble of reading over what I said, and I cannot find that there was anything by way of innuendo, nor would I take back anything that I said.  Neither, in the same way, will I take back anything that I am saying now.  I should like now to deal with what Senator Johnston said, but before I finish with Senator MacDermot I should like to deal with another point.  I think Senator MacDermot said that I suggested he was insisting on certain qualifications.  The thing was quite obvious&mdash;that he was insisting on certain qualifications.  He evidently resents the suggestion that a Deputy or a Senator should interest himself in such things as bog roads.  I say that it is the duty of a Deputy or a Senator to interest himself in anything on which depends the welfare of his constituents or the progress and wellbeing of the people of this country. Again, I suggest that it is just this kind of inferiority complex, or superiority complex, according to the way you look at it, but I think the Senator should be above that kind of thing.  I am sure that, when Senator MacDermot was a Deputy he did not bother about bog roads or old age pensions, and so on, and therefore I suggest that he is not in a position to tell us here what the ordinary Deputy, in the ordinary course of his duties, would have to meet by way of expenses.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston made comparisons between the amount of work done by Deputies and Senators.  Again, you cannot make comparisons of that kind. You cannot say that because one Deputy has more work to do than another Deputy, or because one Senator has more work to do than another Senator, <Col N="543" /> and so on, that a certain rule should be laid down.  In practice, it does not work out that way at all.  We all know that there are Senators here who have practically nothing to do, but we also know that there are other Senators who have even more to do than some of the T.D.s. I think there is no question about that.</P>

I can assure the Senator that I am still bothering about these things, and I suggest that, instead of making such utterly reckless accusations against me, he should make inquiries in my constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with Senator Counihan's views, but I must say&mdash;although I do not wish to quarrel with the Chair&mdash;that I was astonished that Senator Quirke was allowed to say the things he was permitted to say.  However, since they were said, I suggest that I have a right, if not even a duty, to reply to them.  I have never depreciated attention to the wants or needs of the people in regard to these multifarious matters which concern the people, as Senator Quirke has suggested, nor did I ever say that the Deputy who attended to such matters was an inferior kind of Deputy.  To the best of my ability I attended, as a Deputy, to such matters and I am still, to some extent, attending to them.  I did say, however, that if we are going to change the whole basis of politics by increasing Parliamentary allowances or salaries or by professionalising politics, so to speak, then the people would have a perfect right to expect something more from Deputies in addition to the performance of these duties, and that, just as people in learned professions are expected to be able to qualify with university degrees, by passing examinations and so forth, the people would have a right to expect from those who entered into professional politics that they should have attained to a certain scale or degree of knowledge in a number of very important subjects in which politics are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to this question, again, of a motor car&mdash;I hate to go back on these questions again&mdash;I say that by the time you have taken the <Col N="545" /> normal length of life out of a car, it has not cost you a lot.  I have had a car for a number of years, and I may say that it is a very humble make of car, but I suggest that if you amortise the cost and so on over a number of years, it would not mean adding very much to the figure I suggested. Senator Quirke also referred to my connection with the Centre Party, and suggested, in effect, that I had no business talking about Bills passing through without the people being consulted because I consented to a merger of the Centre Party with Fine Gael.  I cannot conceive a more childish argument.  The merger of the Centre Party with the Fine Gael Party was agreed to with the full will and consent, not of the Centre Party in Parliament alone, but throughout the country.  The subject was discussed in and out, and the conclusion that was eventually come to for a merger was practically unanimous.  The Senator suggests that it was brought about because of some ambition on my part to sit on the Front Bench.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Senator that I had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by the dissolution of the Centre Party.  As a result of that merger, I may say that I entered a situation that, to me, was a thousand times less attractive than the situation in which I was, and I would venture to say that I could have attained a position on the Front Bench even if the Centre Party had never been created.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the speeches on this subject, in my opinion no Senator has made a more able case for an increase of Deputies' salaries than Senator MacDermot.  He gave us a list of figures yesterday which brought us as far as £324, but I submit that he omitted a very important item and that is that the Deputy or Senator who has to come up to Dublin, say, for 100 days of the year to carry out his ordinary duties as a Deputy has got to have a substitute at home <Col N="546" /> to carry out his ordinary work there. Now, I am allowing the sum of £2 a week or £104 a year for the substitute at home.  A farmer Deputy who usually carries out his own farm work has to employ a man to take his place. Even if he is not a large farmer he has to employ a man to milk the cows and do the ordinary work which he himself would do.  That would cost at least £2 a week.  I fail to understand where Deputy MacDermot got the figure of 15/- a day as an allowance for a man who comes from the country to stay in Dublin.  I know that I failed to accomplish it on that figure.  I would very much like to live modestly when I am here, but I cannot do it on the 15/- a day to which Senator MacDermot refers.  I am allowing £1 per day for a Senator or Deputy when he is in Dublin.  That, together with the payment of the substitute to carry out his ordinary work at home, brings us to the figure of £453, so I think that Senator MacDermot should go over that question again.  As I say, I think he made a very good case for the increase.  I think there would be no discussion of this if we just asked ourselves what is a Deputy?  The word itself explains that he is deputising for the people who elected him.  That necessitates going around amongst the people who elected him and doing the work he is asked to do.  I think that under the circumstances the sum of £40 a month is a modest one.  I believe, too, that it could have been brought about much more easily under a different system.  I believe that if better facilities were given for the carrying out of their work by Deputies &mdash;clerical assistance and otherwise&mdash;it would probably cost much more in the long run, but we would have heard less about it because the real sum would not have appeared.  That is all I have to say in the matter.  I support the Bill.  I rose merely to bring forward those few points and to state that I think Senator MacDermot did really make a good case for the increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator MacDermot complained that, although I stated yesterday that the debate on this matter had been pitched upon too low a plane, I had done <Col N="547" /> nothing to elevate it, in so far as I had confined myself to criticism of the speeches of those who were opposed to the proposal for an increase in Deputies' allowances.  Of course, as to the nature of the speech which I must make, I am entirely in the hands of those who attack the proposals that come here from the Dáil.  I have to reply to the arguments which they have seen fit to advance, and the tone and quality of my speech are naturally determined by the tone and quality of their speeches.  To-day, we had from Senator MacDermot not the sort of speech which Senator Johnston delivered, a speech which did go to first principles, and which did discuss this matter in the way in which I think a body claiming to be less partisan than the Dáil, more calmly deliberate than the Dáil, ought to have discussed it.  It was in the hope that some of those who were criticising this Bill would have approached the subject to-day from that point of view that I said I was disappointed that the debate had been pitched upon such a low plane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I was disappointed in my anticipations that perhaps we should have the subject approached in that manner by the critics of the proposal here to-day.  We had Senator MacDermot starting off by saying that he did not see why this proposal must necessarily be smuggled through behind the backs of the people.  The debates in the Dáil and the debates here are open to the Press, and certainly the Press has given full publicity to the proposals contained in this Bill and in the other Bill which the Seanad is soon to be called upon to consider.  It is a complete misrepresentation of the facts, and I would say it is a slander of the Government, and a slander of the Dáil, which has passed those Bills, to suggest that they are being smuggled through behind the backs of the people. The Senator said that as a matter of decency those proposals should have been included in the programmes which were submitted to the electorate.  If there is one thing that the debates in the other House have made clear it is that this is not a Party proposal. There have been differences of opinion amongst all Parties in regard to this <Col N="548" /> matter, but a majority of the members of the Dáil, consisting of representatives of all Parties, has approved of those proposals.  Almost in the same sentence in which the Senator contends that this matter ought to have been submitted to the people during the heat and turmoil of an election, he proceeds to say that if it had been so submitted perhaps some of those who are now speaking for this Bill would have been speaking against it.  Therefore, he at once concedes that it would not have received the sort of calm, serious consideration which it deserves; that, in fact, it would have been dealt with in exactly the spirit in which he has endeavoured to deal with it here to-day.</P>
    <P>The Senator, in suggesting that this matter should have been included in a Party programme, quite forgets the history of the whole matter of Parliamentary allowances.  I think it was first introduced in Great Britain after the general election of 1906.  It was introduced after that election.  It was passed through Parliament, and the principle of providing an allowance to recoup members of Parliament for expenses which they necessarily incur in representing their people was never submitted to the electorate then.  In 1923 I think the same problem had to be dealt with by the administration of that day.  They determined that the same sort of situation which in England had necessitated the adoption of this principle of recouping members for expenses, had arisen here, and would have to be dealt with in the same way.  The matter was not submitted, even as part of any general election programme, to the electorate as a whole, and, in my view, quite rightly was not submitted.  In Great Britain last year, when the position of Members of Parliament was again being considered, in the light of the increased demands which were made upon their time, and in the light also of a change in the complexion of the House of Commons, the matter was dealt with in Parliament, and was not submitted, as the Senator contends it should be, to the people.  I think we have a right to expect that a Senator who has taken a leading part in the <Col N="549" /> public life of this country, and who had the benefit and the advantage of participating in the debates on the Constitution, ought to realise very clearly that the Parliamentary mandate finds no place in our Constitution, and that the general consensus of opinion is that it would be quite wrong for the Executive and the Legislature to introduce any such proposal into our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Senator contends that we dare not touch a proposal of this sort unless we go to the people.  This has been a simple proposal.  We had a number of other plain, simple Bills before the Seanad to-day.  They may touch some members of the Seanad, and may touch some members of the Dáil much more closely in their personal concerns, and might, from the point of view of serving personal interests, be of much greater importance than the proposal we are now considering.  But the Senator has not contended, before the Oireachtas considers these measures, before they are enacted and become law, with the signature of the Uachtarán, that these proposals should be submitted to the electorate for their approval.  Of course, the Senator knows very well that if we were once to accept that position in regard to any measure, except such a measure as is provided for in Article 27 of the Constitution, it would be quite impossible for the Oireachtas or the Government to do the work which the people expect it to do.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I say that a Senator who used arguments of that sort used arguments which, in my view, are altogether unworthy of this House, and unworthy of those who have to consider the reactions upon the general representative system here of a proposal of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Senator has relied, in the attitude he has taken up in regard to these two Bills, upon two things. Firstly, upon an estimate which he has prepared, to his own satisfaction, as to what the expenses of a Deputy may be expected to be.  According to the estimate which he prepared and which, in my view, is not a comprehensive estimate of the expenses a Deputy may have to incur, he finds from that <Col N="550" /> narrow and by no means comprehensive estimate, which tots up to less than £360 a year, that there is no general case for touching this question of a Deputy's allowance at all.  As I said last night, I did not intend to criticise this estimate of the Deputy in detail, but we have heard from Senators who have to come up from the country and reside here in the city, that it certainly costs them more than 15/-.  Senator MacDermot said it cost him 15/- a day to live in Dublin.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Senator that there is nothing in the Constitution, in this Bill, or in the Statutes of the Oireachtas which binds us to conform to the Deputy's ideas of what is befitting for members of either House of the Oireachtas.  When the Senator gets up and suggests a price it immediately suggests a certain class of accommodation.  He then said that was just what it cost him for board and lodging.  Again, I am not in the position of a Deputy coming from the country, but I say that while a Deputy, living in the country, may be able, possibly, to live there on less than 15/- a day, he has, of course, home comforts and the conveniences of his own household at home.  When he comes up from the country I do not think those who sent him here to represent them are going to contend that he has simply to content himself with bare board and lodging; surely, at any rate, he is entitled to the accommodation and comfort he would have at home.  It is not possible to get that in the City of Dublin in the sort of temporary and irregular way that Deputies have to attend here, unless a reasonable price is paid, certainly, in my view, not unless you are prepared to pay a great deal more than the Senator mentioned.  These figures are not intended for this House, but are held up to the country as the figures for which country Deputies might secure accommodation in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did deal with one item in the Senator's estimate, an item with which I personally have good reason to be very familiar.  I say that during the period when I was in opposition the amount which I had to spend on secretarial assistance was certainly very much more than £1 a week, and I was not by any means an exception in that regard.  I am perfectly certain <Col N="552" /> there are many Deputies who do not do a great deal of front bench work who would have to spend just as much, because I was rather fortunately situated in regard to my constituency, and I did not then have anything like the same heavy correspondence as other Deputies might have.  I have been appalled at the amount of work which Deputies have to do, the amount of correspondence which Deputies representing certain country districts have to undertake, and they have no remedy in that regard.</P>
    <P>The people who elect Deputies are not going to be guided either by my ideas or Senator MacDermot's, or Senator Hogan's ideas as to what a Deputy should do for them when they elect him, as to the amount of correspondence which he ought to be prepared to undertake, and the amount of personal representation he is prepared to make on their behalf.  They are going to be the judges of that, and in many constituencies they certainly set the standard very high, and expect a great deal from Deputies.  Therefore, it is quite wrong for the Senator, because he has been able to do his work as a Deputy, and only had to spend £50 a year on secretarial assistance, to assume that that applies to every other Deputy.</P>
    <P>The point as to whether, even in allowing 100 days for attendance in Dublin, the Senator was fair to Deputies was also raised.  While I was waiting for the Seanad to come to these items on its agenda, I happened to be in the library, and I saw there a number of Deputies from the country working away, even though the Dáil was adjourned over a week ago.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that you cannot simply estimate the number of days upon which Deputies have to attend in Dublin by the number of days on which the Dáil sits.</P>
    <P>In my view, and it is the view of the Government, and I am certain it is the view of responsible members of the principal Opposition Party in the Dáil, and of many members of the Labour Party, the Senator's estimate was entirely too low, even for the expenses, not of the average Deputy, but of a great number of Deputies who live in <Col N="553" /> remote constituencies, or in large, sparsely-populated constituencies, or in constituencies in which political rivalry is keen, because it is the keenness of the political rivalry that very often determines the amount of work which a Deputy will have to do.  All these factors have had to be taken into consideration by us and, so far as the Senator's estimate of what a Deputy's expenses may be is concerned, I think it should be thrown over, because it is, in relation to certain significant items, an under-estimate.  As a Senator here says, it is too low in regard to accommodation. I think the general consensus of opinion in the Seanad in regard to that particular item which Senator Hawkins has challenged is that it is much too low.  From the point of view of discussing this matter, if it can be discussed at all, on the basis of an estimate prepared by somebody, then Senator MacDermot's estimate is not a fair one, and is not one that should be accepted.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect, and it has relation to what the Shanley Committee has said on the question of &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo;.  In paragraph 26 of the report the Committee make this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We wish to make it quite clear, however, that in our view no element of salary is included in the present allowance and that there is no provision for what is termed consequential loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am making no reflection on the Shanley Committee.  I think the direction they got as to how they should deal with this question of a Deputy's allowance was not precise enough, in so far as it was altogether too exclusive.  It quite obviously was taken by the Shanley Committee as excluding from consideration any question of consequential loss.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot has laid down this as a general proposition: That it is not the business of the State to compensate for consequential loss.  I agree with that general proposition in so far as it relates to consequential losses of profits or income which a Deputy or Senator may incur by reason of the fact that he is a member of the Oireachtas.  I agree with that view if <Col N="554" /> you are to consider this allowance merely as an allowance towards expenses; but it is quite clear that there are consequential losses of another kind, that there are some Deputies and Senators who may incur consequential losses of a capital nature.  Senator Hawkins has pointed out how some of them may arise.  If a man works on his own farm he cannot walk off and leave that farm look after itself.  He may have to employ a person to look after his cattle and see that the ordinary operations of husbandry are done in due time.  He may make no profit out of the employment of that man.  The only thing he may do is to safeguard himself against capital loss of a consequential nature.  He may be anxious to keep his farm from going out of good heart and keep his cattle from going dry.  If he is a professional man, he has to have someone to meet his clients so as to avoid losing the goodwill of his business.</P>
    <P>That involves consequential loss of a capital nature and that is the nature of consequential loss that I think a Deputy or a Senator is entitled to safeguard himself against out of his allowance. I hold it is a legitimate item of expense which some Senators or Deputies must meet and, therefore, I would join issue with the Shanley Committee on this ground. I say that the Report of the Shanley Committee, with the allowance at its present figure, includes nothing for consequential loss of what might be described as a capital nature.  We know that these losses do undoubtedly occur and that there should be some token&mdash;I would not say that we can put it at much more than a token-allowance towards them.  We know that these losses do arise and that Senators and Deputies are entitled to be recouped for them to such an extent as may be possible.  It is not possible to do that in any general way and it is not being done on any large scale here, but it is a factor that has to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>There are other questions of expense which Senator MacDermot left out of consideration altogether, and a consideration of them only goes to show what a very difficult matter this is <Col N="555" /> The question may arise, for instance, as to the attire befitting a member of the Oireachtas and the residence in which he may have to live once he becomes a Deputy.  He may be able to live quite comfortably as a private citizen in a house in which he has not a room to receive people who would come to talk upon confidential matters.  I mean, as long as people are not coming to see him about their own private personal affairs but merely coming to pay him a social visit, his accommodation may be quite limited and he may be quite happy; but, the moment he becomes a Deputy, he has to be prepared to receive people in private and hear what they have to say to him in private and that may mean, in the case of some elected representatives of the people, that they may have to change their residence, that they may have to get a slightly larger house than that in which they reside.  It may happen, too, that a person who is a manual worker and who wears ordinary, working, everyday clothes five days in the week and only puts on his good clothes, his society garb, on Saturday and Sunday, may have to spend something more even on clothing for himself. None of these things&mdash;neither the question of attire nor the question of residence&mdash;would be a matter of legitimate expense to a man in moderate or in good circumstances but, quite obviously, it might be a matter of very serious import, say, to an agricultural labourer elected to the Dáil or Seanad, or to an unskilled worker representing an urban constituency.</P>
    <P>All those matters have to be taken into consideration and, in fixing this allowance, we have got to give regard to all of them.  As Senator Johnston said, it is the person who necessarily incurs the greatest amount of expense to whose case you have to give the greatest consideration and whose position must exercise the greatest weight when you are determining a question of this sort, and not the case of the Deputy who can afford to do with very little because he has special facilities or because his constituency may be a comparatively convenient one, or for <Col N="556" /> one reason or another, which is not a reason that is generally applicable to the whole body of the Assembly. Upon that basis, and in consideration of that fact, and after consideration of all these factors and bearing in mind, as I say, what the Shanley Committee left out of consideration and what they did not take into consideration at all, the question of consequential capital loss, the Government have felt that the Deputy's allowance ought, in the present circumstances, to be increased to £40 per month.</P>
    <P>I would just like to deal with the point that was raised by Senator MacDermot in his opening statement, in which I felt that he had taken up the allegation that Senator McLoughlin made in his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill yesterday, namely, that the Government had been coerced to do this by pressure which had been put upon them by members of their own Party.  I have here what I did say&mdash;and certainly I did not say anything which would warrant that gloss being put upon my words&mdash;that, &ldquo;for some years, not merely recently but earlier&mdash;(and when I said that I had in mind experience going back to 1928 or 1929), there have been strong representations by many Deputies that the allowance at present paid to them was not sufficient to cover all the expense involved in the exercise of their responsibilities&rdquo;. Those representations have been made in open debate in the Dáil from time to time.  They have been made privately when the question arose of getting people to stand as candidates at the election, and I know that those representations have not been confined merely to the leaders of our Party or the leaders of our organisation, but they have been fairly general and, therefore, it was in that sense that I used the words I did use on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The other point in the Minister's remarks that I wish to refer to is what he said with regard to getting the approval of the country.  I quite agree, and I said so yesterday, that the doctrine of the mandate in the sense of its being necessary to get an explicit mandate from the country for every measure you pass through is a bad and foolish doctrine, and I would not attempt to uphold it for a moment. But what I did say was this&mdash;that this is not an emergency measure in any sense, neither in the sense that anything very terrible would happen if it was not passed at once nor in the sense that it arises out of some new and unexpected set of circumstances.  It is, from the Minister's own confession, a subject that has been under consideration for years past, but, much more important than that, it is a measure that affects our interests here in Parliament and nobody else's except the taxpayers', and we are making ourselves the sole judges as between ourselves and the taxpayers.  If there had been merely a Bill to carry out the recommendations of an impartial committee of inquiry, even then, I, personally, would prefer to see a Bill produced before a general election rather than afterwards, but in this case we have an impartial committee of inquiry overruled, and the members of the Oireachtas, by their own action, are making themselves the sole judges in their own cause without giving the people of the country any kind of opportunity to pronounce their will upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 45, that the figures &ldquo;30&rdquo; be deleted and the figures &ldquo;20&rdquo; be substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House by speaking at any length on this recommendation. I merely say that I think the case for fixing the allowance in the Seanad at £20 is stronger than the case for fixing the remuneration <Col N="558" /> of the members of the Dáil at £30. We certainly have not got anything approaching the expenses of members of the Dáil.  There may be exceptions to that, but, personally, if we confine ourselves strictly to expenses incurred in relation to our necessary public duty as members of the Seanad, I cannot see how our expenses could amount to more than the figure of £20 a month that was suggested by the Shanley Committee.</P>
    <P>The subject of the remuneration of Senators was raised at the Second Chamber Commission, of course, of which I was a member, and I have to admit that the Second Chamber Commission reported in favour of the figure of £360 a year, but merely as being the same as the Dáil.  Now I, personally, in the Second Chamber Commission had advocated at an earlier stage that the remuneration of the Seanad&mdash;I ask Senators and the Minister to forgive me if I am using the wrong word in &ldquo;remuneration,&rdquo; but it is very difficult to be sure just what is considered the right and tactful word in these matters &mdash;that the allowance to Senators should consist, as it does in the North of Ireland, of two guineas for each attendance and nothing more.  I found that the majority were against me on that, and as there were a great many other matters about which there were differences of opinion in connection with the Second Chamber, I did not want to multiply minority reports and reservations.  Therefore I let the question of remuneration go and was content to abide by the suggestion of the Commission that the remuneration of Senators should be the same as that of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I may say that I think that the main consideration in fixing that figure was that it was undesirable to draw a distinction between the Seanad and the Dáil, that it might detract from the prestige of the Seanad if Senators were paid less than members of the Dáil. Personally I did not think that was likely.  I do not think it would affect our prestige at all and in any case under this Bill there is going to be a distinction.  As there is going to be a distinction between the Seanad and the Dáil, the initial objection to having such a distinction vanishes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> For that reason it seems to me that we should adopt what appears to be the more appropriate figure to the expenses that are really imposed upon us by our position as Senators.  That is the figure suggested by the Shanley Committee&mdash;£20 a month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel again bound, in consistency, to support this recommendation. I should perhaps be wearing a white sheet but I hope the Seanad will forgive me if I have erred in subscribing to this figure.  We had, as we said in the report, &ldquo;No exact evidence as to the volume of business which will be transacted by the new Seanad Eireann or as to the extent of the public duties of members of that House&rdquo;.  We had only one member of the Seanad to give us any information about the work done in the last Seanad.  We did our best and we put down that figure as a tentative figure. I feel it my duty to support the recommendation of Senator MacDermot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Seanad not to accept this recommendation. It is quite clear from the statement which we have just heard from the Shanley Committee's report, that they were quite unaware of the amount of time which Senators would be called upon to devote to public business and had no guidance whatever as to the amount of expense in which Senators would be thereby involved.  We have a considerable number of Senators who come up here from the country.  We have Senators who say that the demands on their time are as great for them as the demands upon the time of any normal member of the Dáil.  I think that what they have said should carry at least as much weight with the Seanad as anything that has been said in favour of the recommendation. Furthermore, I think we must take into serious consideration the fact that the Shanley Committee put forward the proposal to reduce the allowance of Senators as a tentative one only.  My feeling is that if a change of this sort is to be made, it should not be made tentatively, at least not in a way in which it might possibly hamper some members of the Oireachtas in doing their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> I think the fact that we have had so little experience of the work which the Seanad would normally be called upon to do is a very strong argument against making any change.  Undoubtedly if there is any relation between the duties which a Deputy may have to discharge, and the duties which a member of the Seanad may have to discharge, and if because of that relation, we are prepared to assume that the duties of Senators in general may be somewhat lighter than the duties of Deputies, I think the only conclusion to be derived from that is that we should not fix the allowance paid to a Senator at quite the same level as we should fix the allowance paid to a Deputy.  In the light of all that, but particularly in view of the fact that, perhaps, as time goes on, members of the Seanad may be asked to do a great deal more public work than has heretofore been required of them, I think it would be exceedingly impolitic and imprudent for us to make any change in the position which has obtained here since 1923.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That sub-section (1) be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a proposal to abolish the exemption from income-tax which is at present granted in respect of the parliamentary allowance of members of the Dáil and of the Seanad.  The justification for the proposal is that in my view, the provisions of the Bill have increased the allowance to a figure where it really deserves to be called a salary.  As such, it seems to me that it should be subject to income-tax as is the salary of everybody else throughout the country.  I do not know whether the Minister has any precedents drawn from any other country for the exemption of the entire Deputies' and Senators' allowances from income-tax.  I personally have not heard of it anywhere except here. <Col N="561" /> Whether it is done anywhere else or not, it seems to me unfortunate at present because I think that it makes a bad impression on the public at large. I think that Deputies who have the spending of the country's money should be fully liable to income-tax just as everybody else is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, I find myself in agreement with this recommendation of Senator MacDermot. After all, if I am right in thinking that an important proportion of Senators and Deputies spend the whole of their remuneration in work wholly and necessarily connected with their public duties, then these particular Deputies and Senators will not have to pay any income tax in respect of their Senatorial or Deputies' allowances. I think, in the case of the more favoured members of the Oireachtas who will find themselves in possession of a margin over and above what they must spend on duties wholly or necessarily connected with the country's work, it is only right and proper that they should pay income-tax in respect of that portion which they regard as remuneration for honourable professional service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Senator MacDermot or with Senator Johnston in what they have said in support of this amendment.  The principle of paying income tax on salaries was accepted unanimously by the Shanley Committee, but we have agreed that we are not dealing here with salaries but with allowances. Therefore, the allowances, in my opinion, should not be subject to the payment of income tax.  In any event, the amount involved would be quite negligible, and is it worth while considering it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Alton has reminded the House, the Shanley Committee, upon which Senator MacDermot has hitherto relied, recommended the continuance of the existing statutory exemption from income tax of the allowance payable to members of the Oireachtas.  That is because this allowance is intended to be an allowance towards the expenses necessarily incurred <Col N="562" /> by a member of the Oireachtas in fulfilling the functions imposed upon him either by the Oireachtas itself or those whom he represents therein. Accordingly, if we have got to be consistent in that regard we cannot make that allowance assessable to income tax.  If we should propose to make it chargeable to income tax, we immediately change its nature altogether. It then becomes a salary&mdash;a remuneration for services, wages earned or something else&mdash;but it certainly is not an allowance towards expenses.</P>
      <P>It may be, as has been said, and I am sure it is so, that in the case of some Deputies there is a margin, but there is no reason why there ought not to be a margin, because nobody knows what contingencies a Deputy may have to face in his own constituency, contingencies which may quite easily wipe out the margin.  When you have what is meant to be a general comprehensive figure of that sort, it would be, in my estimation, unwise to refuse to make provision for these unforeseen contingencies which may arise.  Even if you were to say: &ldquo;Very well, so long as it is unused we have got to regard that margin for contingencies in the nature of income,&rdquo; think of the job that you would be imposing upon the unfortunate officers of the Revenue who would have to come in and meet members of the Dáil and members of the Seanad and start going through the list of expenses which these Deputies and Senators would present to them.  The unfortunate civil servant would have to tell a member of the Oireachtas, possibly a future Minister&mdash;even, mind you, a future Minister for Finance&mdash; that he should not spend so much money upon such and such an item in his constituency.  A mere consideration of the practical difficulty of trying to regard some part, because that is what it will come down to, of this allowance as income chargeable to income-tax makes the purpose of the proposal an entirely unfeasible one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacDermot wanted to know what was the practice elsewhere.  We were told yesterday by Senator McLoughlin that in Great Britain only £100 is exempt from tax.  Of course, that is not quite the full extent of the <Col N="563" /> matter.  The first £100 is automatically exempt from tax.  Any further sum certified by a member as expenses arising from membership is also exempted, and the exemption is provided by administrative arrangement. So that we may assume&mdash;in fact, I feel perfectly certain&mdash;that in the majority of constituencies in England the full allowance is exempt from income-tax. I can quite easily say this: that, if you were to make a Deputy the sole judge in the matter, as you would have to do, practically every Deputy and every member of the Seanad I am sure could quite conscientiously claim exemption from income-tax for the whole of his allowance.  Accordingly, I think it would be unwise from the administrative point of view, on account of the practical difficulties that you would be imposing unnecessarily on the officers of Revenue, to adopt the recommendation as submitted, or even if you were to adopt the method which has been adopted in Great Britain, in order to ascertain the net sum which would be assessable to income-tax.</P>
    <P>I think it would be entirely unjustifiable to accept this recommendation because, by accepting it, you would change the whole nature of this payment and make it not an allowance towards expenses but a recognised salary for members of the Oireachtas. From a revenue point of view, what is going to follow from that?  That immediately the Minister for Finance would be faced with a demand, not merely for the sum which was necessary to pay the salaries to members of the Oireachtas, but also the sum which was necessary to enable them to meet the expenses of representing their constituencies, so that instead of there being any saving to the public purse, if you adopted a recommendation of this sort, ultimately and eventually there would be an increased burden on the public purse, and the farmers, of whom we hear so much, would have to pay more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <P>The Minister seems to think that in putting forward this amendment I have been inconsistent with myself because I am now proposing something which the Shanley <Col N="564" /> Committee did not recommend.  The explanation is very simple.  If the figures of the Shanley Committee had been accepted I would not be making this proposal.  My suggestion is, that by changing the Shanley Committee's figures the allowances have, in fact, been swelled into salaries.  I am still puzzled as to what the logical position is, and how it would be described by the Minister himself in the case of those people who will be solely dependent on their £480 a year.  There will be some such.  We have heard in the Dáil that there are some such already, and far from saying that there should never be any such, I have said throughout that there always must and will be some such.  In the case of a man who is living on his £480 a year and who is supporting his wife and family on it, how exactly does the Minister justify treating him in an entirely different way from the way in which he treats a civil servant earning the same amount?</P>

As a member of that committee, I want to say this on that question&mdash;that if we were to consider it as a salary, then we would have considered £700 or £800 a year for Deputies.  Therefore, I think that this increase of £10 a month in the allowances to Deputies cannot be considered as a salary.</P>

I dislike mentioning names about such a subject as this, but I have before me a speech by another Deputy who was not opposing the Bill, and whom I interpreted as having made a similar statement with regard to himself. But what I wanted to get at was the logical basis of the thing.  Assuming there are in future, even if there are not now, some men in politics with nothing to live upon except the £480 a year salary, I should like to have an answer to a civil servant who says to me: &ldquo;I have £480 a year and I have to pay so much away in income tax; here is a member of the Dáil who has the same income and who is completely freed from income tax.&rdquo;  Is there any answer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The position is that we are anxious to extend the travelling facilities available to Deputies, but we have to make sure that these travelling facilities are availed of for purely public business.  For instance, we cannot have a Deputy making an application and saying that he wants to go on a visit to Ardnacrusha and using that for the purpose of addressing a meeting of a political organisation in that particular neighbourhood.  Therefore, somebody has to exercise some control over the use of these travelling facilities, and that is the purpose of that proviso.</P>

      <P>Perhaps you will when it is put into operation.  For instance, if the necessity arose, it might be desirable for a party of Deputies to visit districts in the congested areas, or to go down and inspect the works <Col N="567" /> at Ardnacrusha, or some other public work which was being carried out. This would enable the responsible Minister concerned to invite members of the Dáil to make that inspection. But it certainly is not intended to allow a Deputy resident, say, in Dublin, hearing of a fire somewhere in Louth, to set off helter-skelter in order to be first on the field and see the fire for himself.  There is no other way in which we can safeguard that except by inserting a proviso of the sort mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given reasons for suggesting that the figures recommended by the Shanley Committee were not over-generous and were wiser than those adopted in the Bill.  As the least member of that committee, I may say without arrogance that the members went about their work in a very thorough way and were very impartial and conscientious in discharging the task imposed upon them. They were conscious that the figures proposed were moderate&mdash;that, in fact, they erred on the side of moderation. The general principle underlying our decisions was that it was essential for the welfare of the nation and the proper administration of its most vital business that its Ministers should be free to devote themselves completely to their work.  We appreciated, and had evidence of, the strain of Ministerial work on those who hold office and we thought it was essential that such men should be freed, as far as possible, from the petty anxieties that beset more ordinary citizens&mdash;that the difficulties that confront the ordinary citizen in trying to make both ends meet should not beset the holder of office and that not only should we not allow the wolf to be prowling outside but that the Minister should not be obliged to listen to him scraping at his door.  We considered that a Minister should be enabled to concentrate on the vital work of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another determining reason was that to the office of Minister a certain dignity and certain obligations attach, and that it was desirable that he should have the means, without undue economy, to maintain a position in keeping with his high office.  I agree with what Senator Sir John Keane said last night, that recognition of social worth and distinction does not depend on money but the absence of a sufficient income can handicap a man in the position of Minister very seriously.  He has to meet Ministers and distinguished men from other countries, and it is desirable that he should meet them on a level.  He should not be humiliated by feeling that he is unable&mdash;to put it crudely&mdash;<Col N="570" /> to entertain them as they entertained him.  A certain amount of show is essential in these matters.  I do not like anything in the nature of a blatant ostentation or a vulgar parade of wealth, but a sufficient show of hospitality on particular occasions is very desirable and is good for the mental as well as the physical health of Ministers. It is desirable that they should have the means of relaxation.  I could give many other reasons for this amendment, but I confine myself to a few.</P>
    <P>The Minister who is present to-night spoke elsewhere of ensuring &ldquo;good and clean government&rdquo;.  I think that we have, and have had in the past, good and clean government, but that is because of the exceptional men who were called to office.  There are, and have been, in other Governments, if you know your history, abuses, due often to insufficiency of remuneration to people in high office.  That is a delicate point, but it is well to be frank about it.  After all, we are human, and the greatest political philosopher who ever lived once remarked that you should not overstrain human nature. You will be overstraining human nature if you expect persons to live up to a very high standard&mdash;the high standard of those about them&mdash;on insufficient income.  I have confidence enough in Irishmen to believe that we should struggle through even if we had to do our work for nothing, but I do not think it is fair to subject men to such ordeals.  Economy is a very good thing but, in certain cases, economy is foolish.  In the present instance, anything like cheeseparing is worse than foolish.  It could possibly be criminal.  Even if the figures in the Shanley Report seem to some members of the Seanad to be liberal, it is, I think, wiser to err on that side than to err on the side of parsimony.  Therefore, I propose Recommendation (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to state as briefly as possible the reason why I put down my name as sponsoring the first six recommendations, particularly the first four.  It seems to me that all matters of remuneration, whether they be concerned with allowances for Deputies or Senators, or salaries for Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, <Col N="571" /> must always, of necessity, be matters of considerable delicacy and difficulty, and that they are not matters which should be frequently discussed: that is, that as far as possible there should be a maximum amount of agreement&mdash; no attempt to make any Party capital one way or the other&mdash;and that there should be a very considerable period between the date on which the matter is discussed at length and the date on which it may have to be raised again. The difficulty always is: Who is to decide what is to be the figure?  Yesterday, while I did not question the right or the necessity of either House of the Oireachtas criticising and giving their views on such a matter, I stated the opinion that, in the matter of allowances to Deputies and Senators, the Executive Council was the body which, ultimately, should make up its mind as to what should be given, and that it should stand or fall on it.  Now, when it comes to the matter of Ministers' remuneration, the position is somewhat different.  You could say that, if the Oireachtas could make up its mind, or the Dáil, at any rate&mdash;because the Dáil has the power of voting on such a matter&mdash;that that is a matter to be dealt with by them.  It seems to me, however, that that is a particular case where the persons who hold the office for the time being are not necessarily the best persons to judge what should be the remuneration over a long period for a particular post, which, after all, is not particularly referred to them or to their immediate successors, but, as I said, might have reference to a period of 10, 12, or 20 years, and perhaps very much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a committee was set up.  That committee was representative.  It was quite fallible.  It was just as likely to make a mistake as any of us, but it did give considered judgment and it gave that considered judgment without having any particular Party interest to serve.  That committee was not going to be re-elected in the next general election.  It was not going to stand for the Seanad or the Dáil in the next election, and there were no political interests to influence its report.  The committee <Col N="572" /> made a considered recommendation with regard to the salaries which should be paid to Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  The Government, at the present moment, for reasons best known to themselves&mdash;I say that advisedly because, although I have read the discussion, they seem to be mainly keeping their reasons to themselves&mdash;have decided not to adopt that recommendation, but to adopt a rate of remuneration that was decided upon some 20 years ago after considerable consideration by a committee, certainly, but one with very much less experience. Now, I believe that it would be a wise thing for this House to recommend, not particular items as our considered judgment, but to recommend to the Dáil that if there is one matter which should take precedence, or which they should press at any rate on the particular Executive of the day, in the matter of accepting the report of an outside committee, it is the matter of Ministers' salaries.</P>
    <P>I hold the view very strongly that you can be penny wise and pound foolish and that, possibly, disastrous results may follow in the future as a result of such a policy.  Such a matter must be looked at from the point of view of a long period of, let us say, 50 years, or even 100 years, hence, and disastrous results may follow from setting too low a standard.  I am not going to attempt to argue that you are going to get a more honest Minister after 20 or 30 years than, say, after 10 or 15 years, any more than I would attempt to argue that you could get a more honest Minister after 2,000 years than after 1,500 years.  I do say, however, that you cannot expect to get the type of character and ability which, ultimately, we must have in this State, regularly, as Government succeeds Government, in the position of Ministers of the State, unless we are going to base the standard of emolument on what we would expect to pay&mdash;and would have to pay in any case&mdash;for a competent managing director of a company.  We have been discussing the new industries of this country.  I wonder how many Senators have tried, by advertisement, to get an experienced managing director for an industry that would employ, let us say, 500 people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> If they have, and if they have had to go outside this country, as, in most cases, they would have to, in order to get the experience, at any rate, at present, they will find it extremely difficult to get a person to take up such a position at the rate of remuneration proposed in this Bill for a Minister of State.  If, in addition, the person concerned is liable to be dismissed at any moment because of some mistake or some action about which the directors disagree&mdash;and, in this case, the directors are the Dáil&mdash;if, as I say, the person concerned may be dismissed at short notice, and that his pension will be nothing if he is dismissed within the first three years, and a quite small pension if he has served that period, and that the maximum pension for a certain period is £500, you will not get a competent managing director for £1,700 at all under those conditions.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that, when we have a committee which has given careful consideration to this matter, and when we know something of the requirements of the case, we should forget altogether the particular merits or demerits of the gentlemen who happen to be Ministers at the present moment.  Some people here hope that these gentlemen will remain in that position for a very long time, while other people here, for similar political reasons, hope that they will remain in office only for a short period, but the fact remains that we are not considering what is a proper remuneration for the gentlemen who hold these positions at the present moment, but what is the proper remuneration to provide, not alone for these Ministers, but for those who may succeed them in the future.  We must proceed on the assumption that we have to provide for to-morrow.  That, in my mind, is the only consideration on which to approach a matter of this kind.  If the Seanad agrees with me with regard to the sum that I suggest is the proper sum for, shall we say, an unknown Minister to whom you are looking for proper service in his capacity as Minister, then they should make a recommendation to that effect.  It is not a matter of personalities, as I have said. We must look to the future.</P>
    <P>If the Seanad disagrees with me, <Col N="574" /> then there should be no such recommendation; but I think that, so far as our views are concerned, whether or not the Seanad agrees with me, we should not be influenced by the question of bringing the Dáil back, because, if we are going to consider any Bills merely from the point of view of bringing the Dáil back or not, we could have saved a lot of talk.</P>
    <P>Now, I have put down a further amendment, to be added to these amendments, if considered desirable. I am not particularly enamoured of it.  I only ask for the first six amendments, but I think that this amendment is relevant, and in any case it could not be moved at all unless the six are carried.  The effect of the amendment would be that, if the Government had made up their minds that it is not politic or wise that Ministers should be paid this additional amount at the moment, we should make it clear that this has nothing to do with personalities and that the increased amount should come into effect after the next general election, when, of course, Ministers would have to be found and when nobody, however optimistic he might be, could foretell who would be Minister.  I am not moving that at the moment.  It will come on afterwards.  But if the House believes that you should take the present Government at their word when they do say, &ldquo;We do not want it,&rdquo; then we could get over that difficulty in the way I suggest.  I only mention that because it is the best way out for those in favour of it.  That particular point does not arise now, but it would arise afterwards if these recommendations were adopted by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say much on this recommendation but merely to support what has been said by Senator Douglas and the others in favour of it.  I regard this as a very important matter.  I hope the Seanad will pass all these recommendations and that during the interval allowed by this festive period Ministers will reconsider the point of view put before us last night by the Minister for Finance with regard to Ministerial <Col N="575" /> emoluments.  I regard this as a most important matter, and I now put forward these recommendations.  We are not considering them at all from the point of view of the present Ministers or any particular set of Ministers, but from the point of view of the country as a whole.  I believe most sincerely that it is not for the good of the country as a whole that we should fix too low a standard of remuneration for the men who in the future are going to be the leaders of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>It is open, of course, to the Government, if they like to make what they consider to be a virtuous gesture on this matter, to reject this decision if the Seanad chooses to come to it, and to say that they will not accept these increases for themselves.  I believe if they come to that decision they are acting on a sort of false virtue, and they are coming to a very wrong and a very unwise decision, not merely for themselves, but for all those who will come after them, and indeed for the interests of the Irish people as a whole. I urge very strongly that though a gesture of that kind might have immediate attraction from the viewpoint of securing popularity, yet in the long run it will turn out to be an injurious gesture to the best interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the salaries of the Ministers and the salary of the Taoiseach, as fixed in the Bill before us, will in the long run prove to be adequate.  I believe that it will be found in a very few years that Ministers will see that they cannot maintain any proper standard on the salaries set up in this Bill, and they will be compelled by force of circumstances, whether they like it or not, to come again before the Oireachtas and ask to have these salaries raised.  It is most injudicious and most unwise for us in a matter like this to take action which in our hearts we all know will have to be gone back on and changed in the course of a few short years.  I am sure the Minister for Finance himself will admit that the salaries as fixed in this Bill are not adequate. Whom does it benefit then to have <Col N="576" /> these salaries solemnly passed into law, and laid down as a standard and considered adequate by this House or the Oireachtas as a whole?  Who is to benefit?  We say there is no benefit attaching to that sort of gesture.  It is a mistake to believe that you can acquire any real popularity or any support which is worth getting in the country by a gesture of that kind.</P>
    <P>Last night, on the Second Reading of this Bill, I said a good deal about our social standards and I was taken to task by Senator MacDermot and Senator Sir John Keane for, as they said, riding my favourite hobby horse.  I admit it is a matter which I take very seriously and I regard it as one of the most important issues that could be considered by a body like this.  We do not realise in this country&mdash;because most of us have not had experience&mdash;that our standards in this respect are probably the lowest in the whole civilised world and that in every other country you will find that Ministers and other high representatives of the State, no matter what are the figures of their salaries, are placed in a position to represent their country in the eyes of the world and to live lives in the eyes of the world out of all proportion to the lives which our Ministers lead here.  That is entirely owing to the false puritanical standards that have been adopted and which are again being put into practice under this Bill here.  It is all very well for Senator Sir John Keane to say that these are matters of the heart and that money does not enter into it.  Everyone knows that the heart may be all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, gold.  It may be said it would be difficult for us to provide against extravagance in the sort of men we should have at the head of the State in this country.  We ought to trust the Irish people not to put men in these positions who would act extravagantly.  But I hope we will have less charges bandied about of Ministers not being worth their salaries and so on.  That sort of talk does more harm to Ireland in the long <Col N="577" /> run than anything else.  It saps the morale of the people.  It contains the germs of a sort of false Puritanism unfair to this country, a sort of Puritanism which our history in the last couple of centuries has made possible. Everybody knows that I take that point seriously and regard it as of the utmost importance.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the argument that Senator Quirke put forward last night, an argument that, to my mind, was most astonishingly naive, but it had its value.  In apologising for the discrepancy between his words a few years ago and his words in the Seanad during these debates, he suggested that he was entitled to say what he said seven or eight years ago, because at that time there were very few incomes over £500 a year.  He was adopting a sort of Marxian doctrine. He said that because there were few incomes over £500 a year, seven or eight years ago, nobody was worth more than £500.  He proceeded then to make the further point that now, owing to the intensive activities of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, we have had numerous incomes amounting to over £2,000 a year derived from his activities; whereas he said at the present time and in the recent past it was true to say that there are quite a considerable number of new men, private persons, in this country who have incomes that rise above that figure of £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a very bad thing for us to say that the heads of this State are going to be deliberately kept at a figure that is lower than would be earned by quite a number of ordinary professional or business men.  It is not at all uncommon for an able lawyer here in Dublin to make far more than £2,000 a year.  It is not at all uncommon for a specialist in medicine or surgery to make more than that income.  If it is possible for men who devote themselves to their own business to make large incomes like that, why should it not be possible for the leaders, the men who are chosen to represent the country in its public objects to live lives of equal comfort to those attained by successful business and professional men in their own <Col N="578" /> country?  Why should there be that discrepancy?  I say the standards we should set for our Ministers and for the Taoiseach should not be far below what a good professional man can earn.</P>
    <P>I do believe that in this Bill the standards we are setting are considerably below what good professional men can earn, while the calls upon Ministers are enormously above the calls that fall upon one of those private individuals. We heard a good deal about the calls that fall upon Deputies; they are nothing to the calls which fall upon Ministers.  We have taken the step of raising the allowances of Deputies.  It is not a matter that I think is worth having all the arguments we had about it, but we raised the allowances of Deputies and we kept the allowances of Ministers&mdash;whose work and duties are out of all proportion to the work of Deputies&mdash;at a figure which was originally too low to my mind, and which will certainly prove too low in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that the making of provision for Ministers' pensions in this Bill was to some extent raising their emoluments above the figure actually set out, the figure of £1,700 a year.  I think we should consider those two questions as entirely separate ones.  It is one thing to make provision for individuals who may find themselves in difficulties once they have ceased to be Ministers.  That is, I think, a duty which falls upon the Oireachtas, and which ought to be met. But that is one question.  The question of seeing that our Ministers here are put in a position fittingly to represent this old and noble country, with all the traditions that it has, not as private individuals but as leaders of this country, is an entirely different question, and should be considered not from the point of view of what a particular individual will make out of those salaries but from the point of view of what is to the real interest and the real honour and dignity of our people as a whole.  I urge most sincerely on the Minister for Finance that he should accept those amendments.  If he does not accept them, I urge the Seanad to accept them over his head, and to see that the Dáil is called back even during <Col N="579" /> the Christmas holidays in order to give this very serious and far-reaching question the deliberation it requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to see recommendations of this sort coming from the people who have put their names to this amendment.  I personally join with them in asking this House to send those recommendations to the Dáil.  I might further say I do not think it is right that in this debate the Minister for Finance should in any way be a party to influencing the independent decision of this House in a matter which concerns him for perhaps only a few years, but which concerns the whole future of the administration of this country.  I have always held the view that a Minister of State should not get a lesser income than those whom he is directing in the carrying out of the business of his Department.  It is illogical that he should do so.  I always held the view that a Minister of State should have such an income that he need have no feeling of uneasiness as to the future of himself or his family; that for him no sacrifice ought to be necessary in order to make it possible to serve his country efficiently.  I also feel that no man is better able properly to perform his duties than the man who is highly paid.  That applies to every one from the highest to the lowest in the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we have heard criticisms of the amounts paid to the Judiciary. Those salaries were allocated on the basis of their responsibilities, on the basis of making them independent in their judgments, on the basis of raising that profession to such a high standard that it would not be possible to influence their judgments by any means.  I think what applies to that profession applies with even greater force to Ministers of State.  I do not think a Minister of State would be able to set a very high standard of life for himself and his family, even on the suggested salary, when we consider the type of home that a Minister of State in this country should have when he is in office.  After all, a Minister of State is not expected to live in a bungalow. I have always been of opinion that a <Col N="580" /> Minister of State should be in a position not alone to provide a house for himself and his family, but to provide the type of house to which, if need be, he could bring foreign diplomats to discuss matters of importance directly affecting this country.  It used to be said in the past that the breakfast table of Downing Street won many a good bargain for England.  In this country, I should like to see the breakfast table of Dublin used for the purpose of driving a hard bargain for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether in agreement with Senator Tierney's views as to the development of the cultural and social aspects of this country.  I should like to see him tabling a motion some time, and giving the House the benefit of his views on this subject.  Perhaps I would have something more to say then.  I am satisfied that Government administration here could very well imitate the administration, the domestic arrangements and standards set up in Downing Street and in other countries. All that could be done by having a higher ideal of those who might be in a position to lead the people along lines that would ultimately be for the common good.  When a Minister of State assumes the responsibilities of his Department, he has to relinquish all his commercial connections and any revenues he derives from them.  That being so, it seems to me that he is making a great sacrifice.  As a general rule he has no guarantee, after relinquishing a commercial post, and serving for a number of years as a Minister, that he can go back to a commercial career.  I am not too sure that any commercial career could afford to release people like that, and to take them back later.  Generally speaking, when laying down a basis for the future conduct of the affairs of the country, I hope the standard will be reasonable; one that would help a Minister to do his duty freely and with the utmost discretion, without any financial misgivings or without regard to any other motives.  The only way to do that is to pay Ministers properly. The better they are paid the better it will be ultimately for the country. Under these circumstances I hope <Col N="581" /> Senators will take a very strong and an independent stand on this question. I hope the Minister for Finance will let the House come to a decision in its own way.  The House is not going to be impressed because of the difficulty there might be in having to bring back the Dáil or otherwise.  The decision we are going to take is an important one and is well worthy of capable consideration.</P>

      <P>I concede right off that the arguments in favour of the amendment have been put very strongly and very logically.  If there were not other considerations that, apparently, have not been taken into account by the various speakers, the House would have no other alternative but to accept the amendment.  I agree absolutely with those who said that the country should get the very best people available to manage its business.  Writing in the daily papers yesterday a Doctor of Philosophy said that from the point of view of the Church&mdash;the Catholic Church&mdash;it was of first rate importance that the country should have the most efficient Government it was possible to have.  That is so.  I admit that in the commercial and professional life of this country there must be quite a number of people whose incomes are considerably above what is at present being paid to Ministers.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us how many people, for instance, are paying super-tax, or give some idea of what the position is in that respect.  I agree that it is essential, from the point of view of getting work efficiently done, and wise decisions taken by Ministers, that considerations with regard to the maintenance of their homes, and provision for their families, ought not to be of such a character as to influence or pervert their views, so to speak, towards life; that they ought to occupy a position, in relation to other members of the community, so as to be able to exercise a balanced judgment on problems which they have to solve, and which are of overwhelming importance to the country; I accept all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that any decision of this House on the question before it must have relation to conditions in <Col N="582" /> the country at the present time.  I realise, of course, that many arguments have been advanced with regard to the future.  I have no desire to relate them to particular individuals. That would be a wrong and an unjustifiable line to take, and would be a fault on the part of the Seanad.  Let us, however, realise that, in my judgment, a more inopportune moment could not have been chosen by the Government for the introduction of these two measures.  That is my opinion.  I believe there has been very considerable criticism of these measures; criticism that they would not have experienced if we had not passed through, as far as rural Ireland is concerned, the unfortunate season we had this year.</P>
    <P>I think psychological reactions on the part of the people generally, and the decisions which Senators Alton, Tierney, Douglas and McEllin would have us take, would be so unfavourable, and would create such difficulties for the Ministry, that no increase in their salaries would compensate them for the problems they would have to solve as a result of such action.  I agree that there is nothing sacrosanct about £1,700 or £1,800 a year, but I put it to the House that there is a considerable improvement in the present position regarding Ministers' salaries compared with what it was previously.  I am sure members of the present Ministry and ex-Ministers will be the first to recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>It is true that Ministers to-day, allowing for the present salary of £1,700, have facilities with regard to cars and drivers that were not enjoyed in the past, and that all Ministers in future are going to be provided with pensions.  There was no such provision in the past.  That, in itself, must be a very comforting consideration for every Minister.  There is the further provision that if&mdash;as none of us desire &mdash;a Minister should be called to his last account his wife and children will be provided for.  All that is a very great improvement on the position that existed in the past, and we have to take it into account.  We have also to realise that it is only dawning slowly on the people that they have to pay <Col N="583" /> for the management of the country's affairs.  It is only slowly dawning on them.  I am quite convinced a great many of the people believe that they could get the country managed without paying anybody at all for doing it; that a crowd of men, for the honour and glory merely, would come along and land little crocks of gold into every house in the country.  I suggest that the Minister, and perhaps Senator Quirke, by his confession last night, even more than the Minister, did a certain amount to convince the people that the management of the country was a comparatively inexpensive work and that the people might realise and understand that it was unreasonable to expect that any considerable sums would have to be paid for managing the country's affairs.  You cannot run from one extreme to another.  Even if you like the people to forget, the people do not.</P>

      <P>I could say that some of us would see to it that we are not going to permit them to forget, but I do not think that would be right, and I do not think any responsible Deputy or Senator would think otherwise.  I am quite convinced we are not going to benefit our people here by attempting to lower the dignity and the status of the Ministers, or even of ourselves. I do not agree with that at all. I have a great deal of sympathy with the attitude of mind of the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the other Senators who spoke on this matter.  I submit that you must relate our actions to the facts of life outside.  You cannot get too far away from these conditions suddenly, and you cannot forget that a certain tune&mdash;it was not one note but a big long tune&mdash;it was played to the people, and the trouble is that they did not forget, and the others do not forget, that that tune was played.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the reason or whatever the logic that could be advanced for these recommendations, you have such a situation in the country that to accept these recommendations would be definitely unwise.  I do not believe they would be in the best interests of <Col N="584" /> the State at the present time and, while I would like to peer as far into the future as Senator Tierney or others, I think in this we have to step very cautiously.  Senator McEllin indicated how much has been done over a breakfast table in Downing Street and I, too, am quite convinced that it would be all to the good if the Ministers could afford to collect into their homes a good many sensible people who would talk about the affairs of life outside, not purely the politicians, but the people who have to make their living day after day under the restrictions or regulations, or relieved from the regulations, which the Administration here imposes.  If it were possible for Ministers to meet these people and discuss with them the ordinary problems of the day, I believe they would get a great deal of valuable information which they can only get from some of us&mdash;and then we are hammered for giving it.  It would be beneficial if the Ministry could afford to do something like that.</P>
    <P>I know every Minister in this country, and the ex-Ministers, too, have and had responsibilities, and it is comforting that it is so, with regard to wives and families.  That is the foundation of Christian life and society here.  These must be their first consideration.  While it is difficult, I admit, not to concede that the recommendations which are being urged by four Senators who have gone before me should be accepted by the House, while it is difficult for me to oppose them, yet I feel in the country's best interests that the acceptance of them by the House would be unwise.  I think the consequences of them would not be healthy. I believe the depression in the country, the disastrous season, has imposed such hardships and disabilities on the bulk of our people that a proposal like this is something you could not stand over with the people in their present plight, and whatever the wisdom of it for the future&mdash;in order to get on to the future we must live through the present&mdash;I believe the Seanad should not agree to accept these recommendations.</P>
