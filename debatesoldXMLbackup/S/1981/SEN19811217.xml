      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is <Col N="1564" /> placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purport of the amendment made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendment to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendment made by the Dáil.  For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of that amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to apologise to the House for being a few minutes late.  I am limping a little and I was slower getting across from my office than I had expected.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is as follows.  In the Dáil yesterday, Deputy O'Malley expressly pointed out &mdash; although, in fact, we had adverted to this possibility ourselves &mdash; that in its original form section 1 (2) (b) obviously made it possible for the permanent company namely, Irish Life, to acquire not only the Church and General Insurance Company, which is what the immediate occasion of this Bill has been, but also, apparently, any other company at some later stage, even though no such intention exists at the moment, in the non-life field.  The specific apprehension which he expressed, the basis of which I share with him, is that at some future date a Government here would be pressured by political motives or public opinion into forcing Irish Life to take over some large insurance company in the motor busienss. His apprehension was that in this way the State might find itself saddled, via the Irish Life Assurance Company, with another very large loss-making operation, because motor insurance by itself is in general not an attractive proposition, although it is hard to persuade the public of that.  Virtually every company year after year make losses on their underwriting business in the motor field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to meet the point raised by the Deputy I moved an amendment at <Col N="1565" /> very short notice which had the effect of taking out the words in (b) "a subsidiary company or subsidiary companies".  It was that plural dimension "subsidiary companies" which upset the Opposition spokesman and I proposed, and the amendment was accepted, to replace those words with the words: "a company formed and registered in the State", or &ldquo;a company or companies formed and registered outside the State".  The point is that the singular formulation in the first half of that phrase clearly indicates, by contrast with the alternative singular and plural formulation in the second part of the phrase, that only one acquisition of a company in the non-life field within the State is here contemplated.  That permission will have been exhausted by the time the Church and General are acquired, or by the time that the dominant interest in the company has been effectively acquired by Irish Life.  They will not, thereafter, have any right and it will not be possible under this legislation for any Government to force them to acquire a company such as a motor insurance company or any other such company in the non-life field.</P>
    <P>No objection was expressed in the Dáil to the acquisition by that company of companies outside the State.  I hope, in fact, as I said when last in the House, that we are only seeing the beginning of an aggressive period of history on the part of the Irish insurance industry abroad.  There is no objection to that; no such objection was voiced.  There is no objection either to Irish Life expanding in the life field, but the life field is covered, not by (b) but by (a) of that subsection. Therefore, in a nutshell, the purpose of this amendment is to rule out, so far as it can be done, the possibility that Irish Life might, in addition to Church and General, subsequently acquire a company in the non-life field specifically related to the apprehension that it might be obliged by political pressure to take on motor business.</P>

      <P>I appreciate and understand fully the explanation given by the Minister for making this amendment.  I agree with it, but it re-created in my <Col N="1566" /> mind some of the uneasiness I expressed earlier as to whether a parent life company is responsible for a loss-making subsidiary. The Minister stated earlier that he accepted that a subsidiary's activities were cocooned.  If that is the case, then there is not so much reason for having this amendment, because while there might be pressure to take over a loss-making business, that loss-making subsidiary, if it were cocooned, could never affect the fortunes of the life company.  I wonder if the Minister would clarify that matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about the cocooning is that both the parent company and the subsidiary, in any kind of situation, are legally distinct entities and the obligations of one do not rest on the other. Of course, the parent company may feel obliged to bale out, for reasons other than legal reasons, its loss-making infant. The point which is really being aimed at here is not to insulate Irish Life against the legal danger that if they were to take over a loss-making motor operation they themselves as a company would be stuck with the results.  The purpose is to prevent, at one remove, the State from being saddled with this unless of course in the wisdom of the Oireachtas at some future time, legislation is enacted which would confer that power on Irish Life.  At the moment the intention is to prevent it from exercising such a power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974.  This convention is the fifth in a line of conventions on safety of life at sea &mdash; commonly known as SOLAS Conventions. The Bill, therefore, is totally concerned with safety and, when enacted, it <Col N="1567" /> will enable Ireland to enforce the highest international safety standards in respect of Irish-registered ships and other ships which use Irish ports.  I will now set out the background to the latest SOLAS Convention.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1974, a conference of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO), which is the United Nations specialised agency concerned with maritime affairs, was held in London to consider a revised convention which would replace the 1960 SOLAS Convention.  The conference had two main objectives. The first was to incorporate into a new convention all the amendments to the 1960 convention which had yet to come into force.  Some of these amendments were up to eight years old and were clearly needed to improve safety and yet, under the terms of the 1960 convention, they could not come into force until there had been a large number of positive acceptances by individual governments.  This led to the second objective of the conference. Apart from the need to implement past amendments, it was plain that action was needed to quicken the pace at which future amendments would come into force.  The conference, therefore, agreed to adopt an accelerated amendment procedure to prevent delays in the future. As a result of its deliberations, the conference adopted the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974.</P>
      <P>The 1974 convention replaces the Safety of Life at Sea Convention adopted by IMCO in 1960 and is the latest in a series of conventions going back to 1914. SOLAS 1974 includes the numerous technical improvements incorporated in the amendments to the 1960 convention. These include changes in the regulations concerning fire safety, radio equipment, the carriage of grain and equipment to improve the safety of navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important feature of the 1974 convention is the new &ldquo;tacit acceptance&rdquo; procedure which will make it much easier to bring future amendments of a technical nature into force.  The new procedure means in effect that, with regard to future <Col N="1568" /> technical amendments to the SOLAS Convention, contracting States will be automatically deemed to have accepted them within a specified period unless they take specific steps to seek an extension of the period.  This procedure does not apply to the main articles of the convention or to the more fundamental provisions of the Annex, that is provisions relating to scope, surveys, inspections and certificates.  Here, amendments can only enter into force six months after their being explicitly accepted by two-thirds of the contracting States.  As a result of the revised amendments procedure being included in the latest convention, it is envisaged that SOLAS 1974 will be the last SOLAS convention in the series.  In the future, technical amendments can be incorporated as they arise, thus avoiding the need to draft a new convention due to a backlog of amendments, as in the past.</P>
    <P>In consideration of recommendations by its Maritime Safety Committee, the Council of IMCO decided on 25 May 1977, to convene the International Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention, which was held in London in February 1978.</P>
    <P>As a result of its deliberations the conference adopted two Protocols, the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, (SOLAS Protocol) and the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, (MARPOL Protocol). In this Bill, we are only concerned with the SOLAS Protocol.</P>
    <P>The SOLAS Protocol modifies certain requirements of the 1974 convention and adopts some additional requirements. These modifications mainly concern the type and frequency of inspections and surveys and the duration and validity of certificates.  A significant addition calls for intermediate surveys, that is surveys within the period of validity of certificates, to be made for tankers of ten years old and over.  The protocol is particularly aimed at increasing tanker safety. Revised fire safety measures for tankers are set out in it.  For example, it requires that tankers of 20,000 metric tonnes <Col N="1569" /> deadweight and over shall be fitted with a fixed deck froth system and a fixed inert gas system.  Under the 1974 Convention this requirement applied only to tankers of 100,000 metric tonnes deadweight and upwards.  The additional requirements contained in the protocol reflect international anxiety over the growing number of accidents involving oil tankers.</P>
    <P>We in Government, and indeed the country as a whole, are acutely aware of the risk of such accidents occurring, especially when we recall the disaster at Whiddy Island in January 1979, in which 50 lives were tragically lost.  The importance of the contribution which this protocol can make to increasing tanker safety was recognised in the report of the Whiddy Tribunal, which urged the implementation of the requirements of the protocol, in respect of inert gas systems, as soon as possible.  Implementation of the SOLAS Protocol will, therefore, give effect to that particular recommendation of the Whiddy Tribunal Report.</P>
    <P>The 1974 SOLAS Convention came into force between contracting States on 25 May 1980.  The SOLAS Protocol came into force in May of this year.  Recognising that both of these instruments can make a significant improvement to the safety of ships and the lives of persons on board, the Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention, referred to earlier, adopted a resolution calling on those States which contemplate becoming parties to the SOLAS Convention to do so in respect of both the convention and the protocol simultaneously.  The convention and its protocol are treated as two distinct instruments, even though both are concerned with the safety of life at sea and one is, in effect, an extension of the other.  Both instruments are required to be ratified separately and only parties to the Convention may become parties to the Protocol.  This Bill, when enacted, will enable Ireland to accede both to the 1974 SOLAS Convention and to the SOLAS Protocol.</P>
    <P>Having laid out the background to the convention, I now turn to the Bill itself. The IMCO text of the convention is a long and complex technical document.  In comparison, the Bill appears to be short <Col N="1570" /> and simple.  The reason is that existing statutory powers allow for the making of the necessary regulations to implement the vast majority of the requirements imposed by the convention.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of provisions in the 1974 convention which cannot be implemented under existing powers. Power to implement these provisions is provided for in section 2 of the Bill. The convention lays down, for the first time, rules on the oil fuel used in machinery on board ship by prohibiting the use of fuel which is liable to ignite at low temperatures.  Subsection (4) of section 2, therefore, makes amendments to the 1952 and 1966 Acts to enable the necessary regulations to be made.</P>
    <P>Processed grain, which can be as hazardous a cargo as natural grain in that it is equally liable to shift and disturb a ship's stability, is now made subject to the grain regulations which currently apply only to natural forms of grain. Also, the convention now covers all ships carrying grain, regardless of the volume of cargo in relation to the size of ship. The previous position was that only ships whose cargoes of grain exceeded one-third of their tonnage were affected.  Subsection (5) of section 2 provides the powers to make rules in respect of these two developments in the grain regulations.</P>
    <P>I shall next deal with the question of future amendments to the convention, which is covered in section 3.  I have already stressed that the conference which framed the convention was concerned to accelerate the pace at which amendments come into force.  The procedure which was eventually adopted is contained in Article VIII of the convention. I shall not go into the complexities of the new amendment procedure but the aim is clear &mdash; to accelerate the introduction of amendments needed to maintain up-to-date safety standards consistent with the fullest possible consultation between contracting governments.  No government would be bound to accept or implement any amendment to which it objected, so there is no question of a loss of national sovereignty.  Section 3 provides me with the power to implement by the making of regulations any future <Col N="1571" /> amendments made in accordance with Article VIII of the convention.</P>
    <P>The next section of the Bill, section 4, is a very important one in that it makes provision for offences in respect of ships which are unfit to go to sea without danger to human life.  I already have powers, under sections 459 and 462 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to detain an unsafe ship, either absolutely or until the ship has been made safe.  Section 4 provides for the imposition of fines of up to £50,000 on the owners and masters of such ships.  These powers, taken together, provide a strong deterrent to be used to prevent substandard vessels from entering Irish ports, and they effectively implement a recommendation on that subject contained in the report of the Whiddy Tribunal of Inquiry.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides me with the power to make regulations requiring such ships as are specified in the regulations to carry adequate and up-to-date charts, sailing directions, lists of lights, notices to mariners, tide tables and all other nautical publications necessary for the intended voyage.  This power is necessary to give effect to the requirements of SOLAS 1974 in respect of nautical publications.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill amend the legislation relating to passenger certificates in order to improve the enforcement of the law in this area.  This has been achieved by providing the Garda Síochána with the power to examine passenger certificates and to detain vessels which do not comply with the requirements of the law relating to passenger vessels.  The fines for contravention of these requirements have also been increased.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 10, 11 and 12 simply amend certain sections of existing Merchant Shipping Acts for the purpose of extending the provisions of such sections, so that effect can be given to the requirements of SOLAS 1974 in respect of pilot hoists, navigational equipment and cargo ship safety construction certificates.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as Senators will note, is primarily an enabling measure.  The actual process of giving statutory effect to the detailed technical requirements of the <Col N="1572" /> convention will be done through technical regulations to be made under powers contained in previous Acts and in this Bill.  These regulations will take the form of statutory instruments and they will be laid before the Dáil and Seanad in the customary manner.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of this Bill which is a technical, enabling measure designed to enforce the convention requirements.  There are some very important points in the Bill for the enforcement of safety standards at sea. One of the most important sections is that enabling the Garda to examine passenger certificates, while in section 4 there is provision for offences in respect of ships which are unfit to go to sea without danger to human life.  This section provides for the imposition of fines of up to £50,000 and puts the onus on owners to have the ships in proper mechanical order.  It is important that this recommendation, which was contained in the Whiddy Report, be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously a very sensible and non-controversial Bill.  The contents of the Bill have been fully explained.  It is concerned with one of the sources of greatest danger to our ecology, to tourist areas, to marine life, biology, and is something which could not have been provided for 20 or 35 years ago.  We are dealing with one of the greatest manmade hazards in our civilisation, a far cry from 50 or 60 years ago when a shipwreck generally meant good news for the people in the areas close to where the ship was wrecked with the unexpected bounty of tea, rum or whatever might be washed ashore.  All that has changed and it did not take the Whiddy disaster to bring home to us the consequences of what happens when the highest safety standards are not rigorously enforced, especially when we are dealing with the larger tankers.  Already a name like <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> has found its way into everyday language, symbolising the incredible disaster which can befall marine life, oyster <Col N="1573" /> beds and also entire areas which depend on tourism for their income.</P>
      <P>The problem is largely because of pressures on the owners of tankers to build ever bigger tankers, to keep these in operation for an ever greater length of time, and to cut corners to ensure that maximum use is gained from these tankers. Inevitably when high capital and operating costs are involved safety often tends to be the greatest sufferer.</P>
      <P>It should not have taken disasters to bring home to us the consequences of what we are dealing with and I am glad that the Bill is so much concerned with safety.  I am especially pleased that there will be provision for intermediate surveys of tankers which are ten years old and over.  Over the past number of years many faults which were unforeseen and unprovided for in the design of these tankers arose after a certain number of years in service.  There was no provision for periodic inspection to ensure, if necessary, that these ships would be taken out of the water completely.  Some of these, as was the case with the tanker in the Whiddy disaster, virtually constituted sailing time-bombs capable of going off at any stage and bringing disaster on a scale hitherto unthought of.  I am also glad that provision is made that tankers of 20,000 tonnes and over will have a fixed deck froth system and a fixed inert-gas system.  The fact that up to now tankers of under 100,000 metric tonnes did not have to have these devices was a very severe omission and is something which I am glad is now being remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The heart of the Bill is in sections 4 and 5.  The provisions for fines in these sections are probably adequate. The main point is, are these going to be enforced?  Do we have the means to ensure that ships will be examined periodically to ensure that they are up to the highest standards?  Will the new regulations be rigorously enforced?  Will ships coming into Irish ports know that they face the certainty of a rigorous inspection?  Will we have a situation which is common in so much of our road traffic regulations at present where we <Col N="1574" /> have excellent laws to ensure high standards of safety in regard to the condition of engines, tyres and on the age of vehicles and regulations which insist that trucks are not overweight, that they go at a certain speed in the interests of safety, and which ensure that it is illegal for trucks to emit noxious fumes in built-up or open areas.  The likelihood of these laws being rigorously enforced is very slight and as a result during the beet season we have trucks which are grossly overweight travelling at excessive speeds for much the same reason as determines the unsafe use of tankers &mdash; simply because of the problem of recouping the large capital outlay on these trucks.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that we have the means to enforce the very high standards which are being laid down in this Bill, to ensure that the services responsible will not be undermanned and will have the technical expertise available so that ships cannot use our ports freely in the knowledge that regulation safety standards will be let go.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I hope that section 5, which deals with charts and so forth, will be examined and that we will have the means to ensure that it is appropriately enforced.  The Bill is an important measure on an extremely important topic.  It is not controversial.  There will be general agreement that it is necessary. However, I would feel more reassured if I knew that the means of implementing it rigorously were available and if they are not that steps will be taken to ensure that they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who have spoken.  It is, of course, a very desirable measure.  There is some significance in the fact that the convention which is of such long standing has only now come to be implemented.  One of the features of the Bill is that it enables us to participate in the future implementation of regulations without having to go through all the tedious procedure of summoning international conventions.  Yet, our sovereignty is protected, as I mentioned in opening the debate, in that amendments of a technical nature agreed on are <Col N="1575" /> enforced among the contracting nations unless a contracting party specifically seeks an extension of time within which to obey it.  Of course, we must obey it at some stage because to refuse to obey it would mean leaving the international Community in that particular area.</P>
      <P>If there are more fundamental amendments which relate to the surveys or inspection of ships it is a question of scope and they can only come into force when two-thirds of the contracting parties adopt them.  So there is protection for our sovereignty and, at the same time we obviate the long delays that have occurred in the past in bringing these in.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Manning is a relevant and key point to the success of this legislation.  That is, in regard to the enforcement procedures.  There is one significant new enforcement procedure or power provided for in that the Garda are given power now to inspect passenger certificates.  Very often, in areas where over-loaded boats are moving out, there is no nautical inspector from the Department on the scene and it would be impractical to have one on every quay in the country.  But, very often, a member of the Garda is on duty and he can call to see the ship's certificate and can check that no over-loading takes place.  This is something which needs this extra power and is something which is, I am afraid, abused from time to time.  The new power for the Garda will, I hope, put an end to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general enforcement of the more technical matters, I am glad to tell Senator Manning that, over the years, extra marine surveyors have been recruited on to the staff of my Department and there are plans now to increase further the complement of marine surveyors in the coming year.  We would like to increase it by even more than is planned, but there are constraints at the moment.  However, we are satisfied that we will have an adequate force, both in terms of numbers and skill, to enforce these new regulations and to ensure that our own Irish registered shipping complies with all these regulations and that foreign shipping using our ports will also <Col N="1576" /> comply with them and to ensure that there will be no question of Irish ports being areas where foreign masters can come in in the knowledge that they are not going to be inspected or where they can trade without any danger to them of the sanctions under this Bill if they are in breach of the regulations.  I assure Senator Manning that we are conscious of the need to enforce these regulations, we have the staff and we have the provisions for increasing the staff and if in the future it turns out that even more will be required we will arrange to get them.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what the Senator's worry is.  It is a bit difficult to bring this in under section 3.  There is no suggestion that anything in this Bill or our adherence to these international conventions or protocols is going to diminish our sovereignty. The absolute freedom of every person is diminished only in the sense of having to live within an ordered society; we have to obey the rules.

      <P>In regard to subsection (6), perhaps the Minister might explain the thinking behind it.  I can imagine why it might be felt necessary.  This is where one is taking an action against somebody because he has contravened a section of the Act.  It states:</P>
      <P>It shall be a defence in proceedings for an offence under this section to prove that at the time of the alleged offence&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case the ship concerned is not registered in the State, the said ship was obtaining shelter;</P>
      <P>In other words, in respect of ships which are not registered in the State and which happen to be in the State only to get shelter, we appear to be satisfied with a different set of criteria; we do not expect them to conform with our regulations. This, obviously, should apply to any ship coming into our waters, irrespective of how it came in or for what reason it came in.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>

      <P>There is a certain apparent contradiction within the spirit of the Bill and this exemption.  But it was designed to avoid hardship and not to avoid inhibiting mariners in coming into our territorial waters in circumstances where the safety of the ship required that they come in.  If we had a very strict regime and they knew they were in some technical breach they might be tempted to stand off in dangerous conditions.  I understand that this is a standard provision in international maritime conventions. I recognise that there is a slight contradiction between it and the purpose of the Bill, but on balance this is apparently what the industry feel it should be provided for.</P>

      <P>The Minister will see from the copy of the Bill before him that section 15 (3) cites the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1979.  There are five or six different Acts which are involved in this.  There is the Act of 1966, Convention of 1974, the Act of 1952, the Act of 1966, and this new Act now.  Would the Minister give some consideration in due course to having a consolidating measure with regard to the Merchant Shipping Acts?  It makes pursuance by the legal profession very difficult when the whole question of our legislation is now being spread over nearly 100 years.  Effectively, our legislation starts in about 1880.  In respect of this and many other measures which are a lot worse, there are five or six Acts and there are items constantly being put into them and it is very hard to get a real idea of what the law is at any time.  Very often people have actually been charged with things under the wrong Act just because nobody knew that it had been subsequently amended. Cross-referencing is quite poor on occasion. Would the Minister consider having a look at whether it would be possible to have a consolidating measure?  I am only using this as an opportunity to get a general point across to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I take the point.  It would, of course, be desirable to do as the Senator suggests with regard to all these Acts stretching back over such a long period. But that is quite a formidable task for an over-pressed section in the Attorney General's office.  It is going on in regard to some areas.  The latest one was the consolidation of the social welfare legisaltion. One year afterwards part of it is out on its head straight away.  So, in this area, where there would not be such frequent changes, it would be desirable and it would be a great ease to lawyers, particularly those who might only occasionally do marine law.  Those who are doing it all the time would know their way very thoroughly through this maze.</P>

      <P>When I had to move the adjournment last evening I was giving some time to the issues before us in this Bill which arise in two very definite areas, the social implications of the Bill which the Minister stressed in his opening statement, and the whole question of the effect of this Bill through the very many years in which it has been in operation <Col N="1580" />&mdash; the original Rent Restrictions Act came into force in 1915 &mdash; on the housing stock of the country.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill reacting to the Supreme Court decision on a case brought before it in relation to the unconstitutional nature of the Rent Restrictions Act.  I feel also that in reacting to that Supreme Court decision &mdash; and I know the Minister for the Environment, and the Minister of State in particular, were both very concerned to get the right balance in relation to the Bill that will eventually be enacted by these Houses &mdash; it is extremely important that we do not react too speedily. We are guided to some extent by the kind of person that this Bill is meant to deal with, by the fact that in this State at the moment there are about 30,000 tenancies which would fall within the ambit of the Rent Restrictions Act.  Within those tenancies are to be found in many instances the elderly meek, proud, old people, the typical old lady whom one can meet in so many parts of the city of Dublin and, indeed, in every town throughout the country.  Particular attention will have to be paid to the way in which this law is enacted and the way in which it affects them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern in dealing with the elderly and in having this measure enacted in the right way is principally on the question of whether the District Court is specialised enough to handle the question of the fixing of rents between landlord and tenant; whether the District Court, if it was developed into a more specialised rents tribunal or something close to it, could not more effectively handle these cases. The best example I can cite is the way in which the Circuit Court handles its own areas of responsibility in relation to landlord and tenant matters where, certainly within the Dublin Metropolitan courts, there is a degree of specialisation given; the experts come in and there is a real understanding of the issues, and the judge and those contributing to the exercise are well informed in these areas.  One obvious advantage that could be got from developing a more specialised court, perhaps within the District Court system &mdash; and I understand fully the Minister's concern to keep the matter of litigation <Col N="1581" /> and costs that may in some instances fall on the tenant down to the very minimum &mdash; is to try to equip ourselves within the District Court system, to have it simple, to have it specialised, to have it understood by everybody as a procedure that will be trying to catch up with a very long period of total protection and of rents fixed over the lifetime of the tenants and those who will appear before the court.</P>
    <P>One necessary extension of the District Court procedure, if we could get it into a specialised nature, would be equally to extend the area of subsidisation of rents that will arise in some cases to the District Court hearing itself.  I find it hard to contemplate that we are going to have large numbers of old people, men and women, old couples who have lived in accommodation, perhaps in very poor standards, over a long period, coming into these courts, facing a court situation, which in itself is a new dimension in their lives and something they have not experienced before, and having to undertake, immediately after their appearance in court, a visit to some agency such as the Department of Social Welfare that they are not used to visiting and, because of their pride and the type of existence they had up to then, have not been used to the cap-in-hand attitude of having to seek support from the State in that form. I would suggest to the Minister of State that, perhaps, in dealing with the Committee Stage of this Bill, which affects the elderly and very many other people who at this moment are concerned about the details and provisions of this Bill and how it will affect them, we could, in the final drafting, introduce some provisions whereby the area of subsidisation could arise in court and that the Department of Social Welfare or whatever other agency would be involved could be there taking part in a specialised court hearing that would be much more expert, much more likely to determine their case sensitively.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important.  It is vital that we act in this area to allay the fears of people who were unnerved by the Supreme Court decision last year.  But it is equally important when we are enacting the law that we try not to rush it too fast, that we bear in mind it has been in existence since <Col N="1582" /> 1915.  If there are amendments of the type I suggest that can be brought in usefully to give a more satisfactory outcome and to look after the people who will be affected by it, then I think this could add considerably to the final Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn yesterday said, in many ways, what I would like to say about this Bill.  There is evidence in the Bill of such a failure to understand the people who will be the victims of this legislation that it is imperative that much of what was said by Senator Quinn should be reiterated by myself and, I hope, by a number of other speakers.</P>
      <P>The problem has to do with the way our society has chosen to organise itself. It has to do fundamentally with our Constitution. There is no solution at this stage to the conflict between the interests of those who own property, in this case landlords, and those who need access to shelter, in this case the tenants short of a constitutional amendment.  If the Government wish to tackle this problem of vulnerable tenants in rent-controlled accommodation they will have to talk about changing the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn, I do not understand, and I do not know and I have not met, the people who, it is anticipated, would object to a change in the Constitution to make it clear that the rights of property are always subordinated to the common good and, as the Pope said recently, that the ownership of capital and the ownership of property are subordinate to the needs of labour.  He said this in his recent Encyclical which, though rather distorted on the women's issue, is quite a radical document.  If we are going to tackle this problem what we will have to do is to remedy a Constitution which was well-intentioned but which is defective because it has written into it the details of the social teaching of one particular Church at one particular point in history and which has advanced far beyond that thinking now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in another debate, I do not believe that the real problem in this area is the Church.  The problem is the conservatism of those who lead our society. That is why our vulnerable, old people <Col N="1583" /> are going to be subjected to the sort of terror that this legislation is bringing to them.  I stand over that.  Let any Member of this House pick up a telephone and ring Father Donal O'Mahony who runs Threshold, the organisation which looks after the interests of tenants and landlords &mdash; that is the way they have always organised themselves &mdash; and ask him what his members, most of them old, vulnerable, single people think of this legislation.  They are extremely worried. Unfortunately they are not articulate or vocal; they are not organised; they do not have a lobby.  So they will not be heard. They cannot take to court cases where a landlord does not carry out his legal obligations because they cannot afford to.  Even if they could afford to, or even if the free legal aid system would help them, they are not organised enough to be able to do that sort of thing.  Everybody knows the sort of people I am talking about.  That they would be able of their own volition to go to a free legal aid centre, one of the seven that are currently operating, and do all that is necessary, defies imagination.</P>
    <P>These are vulnerable people.  It is our responsibility to protect them.  This legislation is not protecting them.  This legislation is giving a vestige or a modicum of apparent protection; but there is no fundamental protection for them.  I can testify to this.  As I said, Threshold are the organisation who have most to do with it and they will testify that they are dissatisfied with this legislation; they will testify that old people living in rent controlled accommodation are dissatisfied with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there are individual cases where the landlords suffered very badly from the old Rent Restrictions Acts.  I acknowledge that there were cases of tenants who were far better off than the landlords who owned the property. I do not acknowledge that the concerns and the welfare of that minority were what motivated the recent court action which brought about the situation we are now trying to remedy.  I do not accept the crocodile tears that were being shed by spokesmen for landlords at that <Col N="1584" /> time.  I do not believe they were sincere. I do not believe they were motivated by concern for suffering landlords who were in impossible situations.  I do not accept or believe that.  I believe they were motivated by greed, by self-advancement and by the worst aspects of the capitalist system; they had property which was potentially extremely valuable and they wanted to get rid of an unnecessary impediment, tenants who could not pay decent rents, who would not pay decent rents and who could never afford to pay decent rents. They wanted their property and wanted the people who were between them and their property out of the way.  Unfortunately the courts interpreted our Constitution, and judged that they were entitled to that.  No rights of individuals or poor people could prevent them from having unlimited access to their property.  There is no fundamental limitation in this legislation on landlords' rights.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that in a society where we have 40,000 old people living alone the vast majority of them are in private accommodation.  Successive Governments refused to acknowledge that single people have a housing problem.  They introduced spurious distinctions between accommodation and shelter.  The Housing Acts refer to hostels for single people but the Department of the Environment in their housing package, introduced by the last Government and still being implemented by this Government, pretend that there is some distinction.  Most of the people who are affected by this legislation are single, old, vulnerable people who live in appalling conditions. Our final gesture to them in their old age is to make them feel insecure in the small, tiny, inadequate place they call home.  I am not speaking in rhetorical terms.  I am speaking about specific aspects of this legislation which will create insecurity in the mind of any tenant in rent controlled property.</P>
    <P>Why must the market determine the rent?  Effectively what the section says is that it is the market which will determine the rent of the property and nothing else. I do not understand that.  Is that a constitutional provision?  If it is, it is a further indictment of our Constitution and of its <Col N="1585" /> inability to protect the vulnerable and weak from the powerful and those who own property.  No figure has been mentioned for a rent subsidy.  I find it obnoxious that we will have to pay subsidies which will go into the pockets of many of the wealthy people in our society in order to guarantee homes for the poor.</P>
    <P>The present conception in the State's thinking of a rent subsidy is contained in the supplementary welfare system.  The maximum rent subsidy under that is £5 per week.  In most areas of the larger cities where rent controlled accommodation exists, the market rent for a couple of rooms is of the order of £20, £30 or £40 per week.  Are we going to offer these people £5 per week rent subsidy or are we going to offer them a £25 or a £35 a week subsidy?  I have no reason to believe that realistic figures have been thought out on this question.  I have no reason to believe anything until I see the legislation in front of me, but I would be delighted if somebody could tell me is there a figure in mind?  Are they talking about a percentage of the commercial rent or are they talking about a flat rate?  The only thing I know about the present official thinking is represented in the supplementary welfare system and that is a maximum of £5 per week for a flat.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the philosophy behind legislation like this.  I do not understand whom it is intended to protect. It will not protect old people.  It will give them five years in which to find the means to pay commercial rent for a property.  I do not understand why this is not a matter of conscience.  As far as I am concerned, these are the real issues that should stimulate and challenge the conscience of the people &mdash; the threat to the security of old, vulnerable people because of the way we have chosen to organise ourselves and because of the values that have become predominant in our society.</P>
    <P>If we had a real conception of what conscience is about this legislation would be regarded as a question of conscience as much as the matters which are connected with our sexual function tend to be matters of conscience.  This is a question of our collective conscience and what we are prepared to do to protect those <Col N="1586" /> who are vulnerable, those who are alone and those who are least able to defend themselves.  I am sure there have been very few hostile or negative representations made about this legislation from individual rent controlled tenants.  I am quite sure that very few tenants in the 30,000 or so rent controlled dwellings are in a position to make any real, vigorous representations on their own behalf.  We are all aware of the representations made by those who speak for landlords and about the threats of immediate further litigation on court action if the legislation goes through.  We know who is powerful. We know who is vulnerable.  This Bill is not in any way on the side of the vulnerable and the powerless.  It is another attempt to strike the mean between good and bad and regard yourself as the better for doing so.  This is an attempt to balance the interests of the vulnerable and the interests of the powerful.  What has happened is that the powerful, because they are powerful, will be able to exploit their rights to the full.  The vulnerable will not understand their rights, will have nobody to explain their rights to them and will be further threatened and made even more vulnerable and we will not even know about it.</P>
    <P>The one thing I disagree with Senator Quinn about on this legislation is his prediction that the consequences will be social chaos.  I wish I could believe that because then we would probably be forced to amend this legislation.  We will not have social chaos because those who will suffer will disappear quietly and aimlessly into institutions or they will just die because of the pressures put on them. They will fade away and there will not be a major social upheaval.  Those who will suffer are those who will not be able to answer back, those who will not be in a position to organise themselves and will not reply with violence, direct or indirect. They will not act politically.  They will just quietly fade away and we can pretend there is no problem because most of the time that is what we do.</P>
    <P>These people have been living in the most scandalous conditions for years and we have done very little for them.  About 40,000 old people live alone, half of them <Col N="1587" /> with only an outside toilet.  Ten per cent of them have no electricity, two-thirds of them have no hot water, one-third of them have no water and no electricity and no facilities for washing, cooking or cleaning, Whatever limited rights many of them may have to their accommodation are now threatened.  I do not understand the way we have organised our values.  I do not understand this legislation coming from a socially reforming Government.</P>
    <P>When one speaks about protecting the poor, the vulnerable, the threatened and voiceless one must remember that the poor are not a homogeneous mass of a million people.  They are a collection of various inarticulate groups who do not have a sense of common purpose or common interest.  If we legislate like this for one group who are poor and legislate in similar principle for all the other groups who are poor we will do nothing for any of the poor.  What is needed and what is implicit in most of what was said by Government spokesmen is an amendment to our Constitution.  If we want to protect those who, because they live in prime property areas and the commercial value of the property has soared, are a threat to the financial interests of those who own the property, we need to have a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Threshold asked me to raise one question. Threshold are the people who would be in the best position to talk about this Section 12 of the Bill deals with the recovery of possession.  I have terrible suspicions about the motivation for that section.  I am not imputing any ill-motive to the Minister.  I just wonder who persuaded whom in this case.  There is an extraordinary discrepancy between section 12 of this Bill and section 60 of the 1980 Act dealing with landlords and tenants. That Act deals with compensation on termination of tenancies.  It gives a tenant a period of 12 months notice from the date when a court decides that the tenancy can be terminated.  There is no provision for such a stay of execution in this legislation.  The 1980 Act puts no upper limit on the amount of compensation that a tenant can claim if his tenancy <Col N="1588" /> is terminated.  It makes reference to the pecuniary benefit accruing to the landlord which is referable to his getting possession. This Bill, for some reason, specifies that the maximum amount of financial compensation over and above his expenses that a tenant can get is two years rent in the new accommodation.  I do not understand why a Bill which was designed to protect the most vulnerable is less protective than previous legislation in regard to the possibility of the landlord repossessing the tenancy, which is the matter of greatest concern to the tenant. I do not understand why the compensation should not be generous and substantial.</P>
    <P>People in Threshold told me about a family living in a two roomed flat in Baggot Street ten years ago, who got £15,000 compensation from a property developer. Another family in the same area were accommodated by the ESB in a house in Stillorgan which is now worth about £40,000.  This legislation is purporting to protect tenants in rent-controlled properties, vulnerable, threatened old people.  This legislation gives them a maximum of about £2,000-£3,000. If one takes the rent at about £30 a week, then one is talking about £2,000-£4,000 a year.  That is the maximum compensation that a landlord has to pay and he is liable to pay multiples of that figure purely by getting vacant possession.</P>
    <P>I accept that the section refers to cases where planning permission has been obtained for redevelopment.  If planning permission has not been obtained for redevelopment and the only obstacle to that redevelopment is a tenant, then the capital gain to the landlord will be enormous. The amount of that capital gain that he will have to transfer to the victimised, homeless tenant is about £2,000-£4,000. This is the sort of money that some of these landlords, if one is to believe their own testimony, would spend on cigars in a year.</P>
    <P>That section makes the whole alleged purpose of this Bill suspect.  If that is the concept of protection of a tenant, if that is the philosophy of protection of vulnerable people, if that is the philosophy of concern for a most vulnerable, inarticulate <Col N="1589" /> and underprivileged group, then it not only calls this Bill into a question but the commitment of this Government to the abolition of poverty into question.  It would appear that they have drawn back further from the 1980 Act by the provisions they have introduced in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have read and heard about the need to give incentives to landlords to provide rented accommodation for people who cannot afford to buy their own houses.  I have seen the evidence of the way this incentive works.  The result is that half the houses within a two mile radius of the Regional Hospital and University in Cork are brought up by speculative landlords because they know there will be a market among students for them.  That has pushed up the price of houses for young married couples in the area.  I am not impressed by the argument that we have to give an incentive to private landlords. There is no shortage of people who want to buy property to turn into flats or want to by-pass the planning laws and fit more flats into their house.  No argument about incentives could justify anything in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is well-intentioned.  I do not think it goes anywhere near allaying the fears of a vulnerable, old, inarticulate, poor group in our society.  It does not meet the fears of the only group who can speak for them.  It does not meet any of my reservations.  It would be scandalous if this Bill were rushed through.  There are possibilities of amendment.  Section 12 is extraordinary, in the sense that it gives less protection and less consideration to the tenant than the 1980 Act did. I do not understand that.  It should be amended.  To leave the fixing of rent exclusively to market forces is immoral. It is insensitive and wrong.  That section of the Bill should be amended.  To suggest that a five year period is a reasonable time in which to adjust the rent to a commercial rent, is wrong and unfair and penalises the tenant.</P>
    <P>The basic thrust of the Bill is an attempt to resolve an impossible dilemma which is that our Constitution says people do not matter when it comes to property. Property is supreme.  It would be more honest and fair and, in the long term, <Col N="1590" /> much more valuable to these people if the Government were to take their courage in their hands and introduce an amendment to our Constitution which would simply say that where there is a conflict of interest between the common good and the rights of property, the common good must be seen to be the more important.  That is not socialism.  It is basic, fundamental Christianity that almost all of us in this House claim to practise.  Nothing else will protect old people in this sort of rented accommodation. Nothing else will properly balance the rights of landlords and tenants. If we must have this legislation, then let us have something more human than market forces to determine the proper rent for a property. Surely a question of justice between a landlord and a tenant could be considered in determining this? The problem is that anything other than market forces for the determination of rent would be regarded as possibly being unconstitutional.  If there is advice to that effect I would like to hear it.  If that is the case, there is no way one can protect these tenants.  I appeal to the Minister to amend section 12 to bring it into line with section 60 of the 1980 Act.  This would give people some further protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>Old stereotypes die hard and one of these is the preconception that all tenants enjoying restricted rents are elderly or poor and that all landlords of restricted property are rich and rapacious.  There are, I understand and accept, many tenants &mdash; perhaps even a majority of three out of five as Threshold and other concerned bodies have suggested &mdash; who would be unable to afford an economic rent.  But if so there must also be quite a number, two out of five, who are neither elderly nor poor and who could well affort to pay a proper rent.  Similarly, there must be many landlords who are themselves in the category of the elderly or the less well-off and who cannot justly be expected to subsidise the rent of tenants who are as well, or perhaps even better off, than themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often express concern in this House about equity, particularly in taxation and <Col N="1591" /> other charges on individual members of the community.  I do not know how we can reconcile this concern with our practice hitherto in relation to rent restrictions. We have legislated to exact contributions from one random section of citizens for the benefit of another random section without any regard to the capacity of the one to bear the burden or the genuine need of the other.  To continue along these lines would be indefensible.</P>
    <P>When the first extension of the rent restrictions code was discussed here on 16 July last, I tried to illustrate the unsoundness of the code by likening it to a law which declared that, in an area where it was known that quite a number of poor persons lived, all the residents would be entitled to get their groceries at half price from the local traders.  I stressed the crudeness and inequity of any statutory provision which did not distinguish between those in need and those not in need, and which inflicted a levy on suppliers of a commodity or service irrespective of their capacity to bear it.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan asked what was the relevance of an economic rent.  He even suggested that to be bound by market considerations was in some way immoral.  Last July I tried to give my view of why the economic case for rent restrictions was not valid.  It seems to me that so far as rents are kept below an economic return, existing properties must go into dilapidation for want of adequate repair and maintenance; new properties for letting at low rents will not be constructed because the return is insufficient. In other words, if one does not accept that an economic rent may be charged, the trend must be towards a dwindling and deteriorating stock of houses for letting.  To my mind, that is neither economically not socially desirable. I take the view that both economic and social requirements would best be met by letting economic rents prevail, subject to control, as long as scarcity exists &mdash; and it will exist for a long time &mdash;either by the District Courts or preferably by a specialised professional body. Control is necessary to ensure that rents <Col N="1592" /> do not exceed what is basically economic because of scarcity considerations.</P>
    <P>That is one part of the principle that should be followed.  The other part is that it should be accepted that there should be a supplementing out of public funds of the incomes of those who are unable to afford an economic rent.  The present system of rent control is unsound and needs to be replaced by a combination of general supervision to ensure that only economic rents are charged and by social payments to supplement incomes in cases of individual need.  This Bill is moving in that direction but perhaps not sufficiently.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke impressively and passionately last evening on what he considered were the deficiencies of the Bill as far as tenants are concerned.  I respect his sincerity but he did sound quite intimidatory, or at least challenging, towards anyone who might dare ask for fair consideration of the interests of landlords, at least a particular class of landlords.  Senator Quinn recognised that neither tenants nor landlords were a homogeneous group.  I hold no brief for either group.  I am interested in fair and equitable treatment being extended to both groups.  One must put prejudice aside in matters of this kind.  I am as concerned as anyone that poor, old and vulnerable tenants should be adequately protected by law and have the support of public funds, where necessary, rather than haphazard contributions from private landlords.</P>
    <P>The Minister presented this new legislation as not unduly favouring either group.  In general, I would not dissent from that but I should like to qualify it in a number of respects.  On the side of the tenants, I should like to see more definite assurance that support from public funds will be available for tenants genuinely unable to meet the economic rent either in full, when that happens, or in the intervening period of phasing-in of the economic rent.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, certain provisions of the Bill seem to be titled rather too much in favour of the tenant. The first of these is the rebate arrangement in section 9 which, while quite satisfactory and <Col N="1593" /> justifiable in most cases, is not justifiable where the tenant is able to afford an economic rent and the landlord is not in a good position to do without it.  The second point where I am doubtful whether the balance is exactly right is in the right to succession to a tenancy of the very extended family mentioned in section 1 (2) (a) of the Bill.  Bona fide residence with the tenant at the date of death is the criterion.  Obviously this is open to some abuse.  I wonder whether it would not give adequate protection to prescribe some reasonable period of residence before the date of death of the tenant?</P>
    <P>The third point on which I am a little concerned is section 17 which deals with the incidence of costs.  I am quite happy that the costs should primarily be put against the landlord's account.  Section 17 provides a reasonable saver where it says that the court may, on consideration of all the circumstances, including the means of the landlord and the tenant, order otherwise.  I suggest it might be helpful if these circumstances were acknowledged to include the adoption of a reasonable approach by the landlord in negotiations with the tenant before resort to the court.  In my opinion, it is very desirable that cases be kept away from the court in so far as possible and that reasonable negotiations be encouraged. This might be helped if it were expressly recognised as a favourable point in section 17 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like first to take the opportunity to thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate and also for their good wishes to me in my new office.  Nobody will argue that the problems with which the Bill before us strives to deal are anything other than very difficult and complex.  When legislative provisions are enacted, about 30,000 families will be faced with great uncertainty as to the future position of their dwellings which they have occupied for so long.  The Government are determined to ensure that measures be taken to avoid this social upheaval and chaos.  The Bill before the House is a balanced measure which in <Col N="1594" /> line with the common good gives reasonable protection to tenants and allows landlords a progressive increase in their return on their dwellings.</P>
      <P>Predictably, the reactions to the Bill have been mixed in both Houses of the Oireachtas and outside.  Since the Bill was introduced I have had the opportunity to receive a number of deputations and to consult with a number of people from the point of view of the tenants who have expressed concern at future consequences arising from this Bill.  I have also had some consultation, particularly with one landlord, and others who expressed grave reservations about the outcome of the Bill and who threatened that it was something which they would challenge in the courts.  This is an indication of how difficult it is to enact legislation to deal with the problem and to reconcile the interests both of the landlord and the tenant.  I shall in the course of this reply deal in some detail with the points made by Senators.</P>
      <P>On the wider forum, representatives of landlords have attacked the Bill on the grounds of the restraints it imposes on them and representatives of tenants have taken issue with certain aspects of the Bill not to their liking.  As regards the Bill being pro-landlord or pro-tenant in its approach, in my opinion it is neither.  It is a balanced set of proposals which takes account of the constitutional advice available to the Government and of the terms of the Supreme Court judgment.  It is manifestly obvious that in the face of the court's judgment, the benefits so long enjoyed by tenants of controlled dwellings could only continue for the limited period required to enact permanent legislation. Equally the Government have a responsibility, in line with the pledge in the Constitution that the State should safeguard with special care the interests of the weaker sections of the community, to protect tenants of controlled dwellings many of whom are among the poorer and most vulnerable sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to deal with the points raised by Senators.  I wish to thank Senator O'Toole who welcomed the Bill.  I feel he was sincere when he said that it <Col N="1595" /> was a difficult piece of legislation and that he felt that as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court it was as far as the Minister could go.  He made a point in relation to the fact that the fire chiefs and the planning people should visit accommodation available to tenants and should inspect it.  I want to say to Senator O'Toole that another Bill which has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Fire Services Bill, deals with the point he raised.  It is also true that planning officers and fire chiefs visit premises of that sort and inspect them.  The new Bill which was passed here one week ago complies with the wishes expressed by Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald suggested that the District Court should be transformed into something resembling a rents tribunal because the District Court would not be capable of dealing with the problems arising from disputes and difficulties between landlords and tenants in coming to an agreement with regard to a reasonable rent.  The Bill provides that in the event of a landlord and a tenant not being able to come to an agreement the rent will then be decided by the court.  It applies particularly to places such as Dublin, Cork and our major cities.  If there is a question of the courts not being able to deal with the cases brought before them, this is something which the Government will have to consider.  If it is found that the courts are not capable of dealing with the situation, the matter will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the courts would be in a better position to decide on subsidisation of rents.  I do not accept this point and neither do I believe that it is something which the courts should be asked to do.  It is a matter for the State to come to the rescue of tenants who are in the serious position where they cannot meet the demands made on them.  I have given a commitment already from the Government that they will come to the aid of tenants who are not in a position to meet these demands.</P>
    <P>To a large extent I am in agreement with what Senator Whitaker said.  The Bill before the House, together with the <Col N="1596" /> assistance the Government have undertaken to provide, seems to go as far as possible towards allaying the objections and concerns raised in relation to the tenants.  This is as far as we can go in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the points made by Senator Quinn.  May I say that, in common with the views expressed by other Senators, I do not doubt the sincerity of his speech, which was very convincing. The Senator has strong views on the matter. There were parts of his contribution with which I would agree but there were some which I could not accept.  I want to say that in a situation of that kind it is possible to quote extreme cases and Senator Quinn did that very effectively from the point of view of the tenant.  I discussed the matter with the tenants' organisations and anybody who wished to see me on the subject.  I will give an example to highlight exactly what Senator Quinn was talking about in one case.  He forecast that a considerable number of people would be on the street as a result of this Bill, that they would have nowhere to go, and would apply to Dublin Corporation for some kind of accommodation.  He said they would be told to go to a top flat in Ballymun or in some other place, if the Corporation were lucky enough to have some kind of accommodation of that kind available.</P>
    <P>Under no circumstances would I claim to know as much about the housing problems of Dublin city as does Senator Quinn and I accept the point he made. On the other hand, a landlord asked me what was my answer to the situation where his daughter, who was a deserted wife with two children, was living in an outhouse while the tenant with a reasonable income was living in a house owned by the landlord and paying rent of £2 per week.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make here is that while it is natural and understandable that public representatives, Senators and Deputies, and people generally with any kind of social conscience or Christian outlook would be more inclined to favour or to look at the problems of the tenant rather than the difficulties of the landlord, as the Minister introducing this Bill, <Col N="1597" /> I do not want to claim here to be either on the landlord's or the tenant's side.  I hope that when the Bill is enacted it will be a fair solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point at this stage that it must be borne in mind by Senators that it is not I who looked for this legislation. It was not the Government who directed me to provide the legislation.  It was not any socialist or conservative group or any group of capitalists or anybody else who decided that this Bill was necessary.  It is as a result of a decision of the Supreme Court where Part II and Part IV of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 were declared unconstitutional. That situation forced the Government to provide a measure which would conform to the Constitution.  That point must be borne in mind but Senators and Deputies have avoided mentioning it.  I do not mind criticism &mdash; that is part and parcel of the job &mdash; but it was unfair to imply that some vested interests was involved, as was implied in some speeches in both Houses.  The Bill was forced on us.  It was something which we could not avoid because of the fact that Part II and Part IV of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 were declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn's contribution could be described as a very eloquent speech but I must take issue with him on a number of points.  Concern for safeguarding the interests of tenants is not reserved to him alone and I want to stress that.  The Government, the Minister for the Environment and I are extremely conscious of the need to safeguard the position of tenants in every way open to us, particularly of those who are less well off and those who got special mention by Senator Quinn.  I do not say that he was not sincere about the cases he mentioned here.  I do say that there is a genuine concern expressed by the Government and for that reason we are coming to the rescue or defence of those tenants.</P>
    <P>This has been manifest in the commitments in our programme and in the speedy way the Government had the temporary legislation passed last July.  There was the undertaking that tenants in need would get assistance in meeting the higher rents they would have to pay.  This <Col N="1598" /> is a commitment by the Government but it cannot be included in the Bill before the Seanad at the moment.  Supplementary welfare allowances which provided assistance in the past are not the concern of my Department.  There may be a new system to deal with it but it is not something which is relevant at this stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to get the impression that as far as the Government and I are concerned this is the end as far as legislation to deal with landlords and tenants is concerned.  I can only express my surprise that Senator Quinn should attempt to cast doubt on the sincerity of what I said in such a clear-cut way not only in this House but in the Dáil earlier this week.  His persistence in this respect can only increase the disquiet of tenants. The Bill is simply not the appropriate vehicle to make provision for assistance to needy tenants.  Perhaps I should repeat that if both Bills are passed, the need for assistance will not apply until 26 April next.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said we should extend the Temporary Provisions Bill much further than 26 April.  I have no legal qualifications and I am sure there are Members here in the House who understand the law much better than I do.  He mentioned that this would give us more scope to have amendments, to discuss the Bill and introduce provisions not already in the Bill.  The reason we had to introduce this temporary measure is that Part II and Part IV of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 were declared unconstitutional. This is the second time we have looked for an extension.  The Supreme Court interprets the Articles of the Constitution. I would point out to Senator Quinn the danger inherent in his proposal and I would ask him to accept that there is no way in which, in my opinion, this could be done because it would be extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn ranged over the constitutional principles at some length.  In many respects what he said was more a critique of the Constitution and the way the matter was interpreted by the Supreme Court than a realistic appraisal of the Bill before the House.  The Bill is <Col N="1599" /> drafted, as it must necessarily be, in compliance with and subject to the constraints imposed by the Constitution. That is what I have been attempting to do because of the peculiar and difficult position in which I find myself.</P>
    <P>I must refer to one particular suggestion the Senator made for amendment to the Bill.  Without going into the details I think I quote him accurately as saying that he felt sure the amendment he was suggesting would be outrageously unconstitutional but that it should be made.  I may be open to correction here because I am not sure whether I am quoting him exactly.  The Government simply cannot legislate in that way, for practical as well as for constitutional reasons.  I should perhaps quote Article 15.4 of the Constitution which is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to this Constitution or any provision thereof.</P>
    <P>The Article states in no uncertain terms how the Government must proceed.  We have ignored one aspect, namely the constitutionality of any Bill that we bring before the House or any laws that may be enacted.  We must recognise what is required of us by the Constitution which, incidentally, Senator Quinn praised highly.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also suggested that the Government should be more ambitious and test to the ultimate the interpretations of these property rights in the Constitution. This is easy to say but it should be realised that if legislation is found to be unconstitutional the options then remaining open to the Government will be much more limited.  I cannot introduce legislation which I consider unconstitutional, no more than I can, as Minister, advocate that persons should break the law.  This is something which I am not prepared to do.  I hope Senator Quinn will accept this point.  Laws which are unconstitutional may not be introduced.</P>
    <P>In a constitutional context I must take issue with Senator Quinn on a further aspect.  In what I accept was his genuine concern for tenants he seemed to advance <Col N="1600" /> a curious proposition.  I understood him to say that certain landlords being a minority interest could and should be denied the full protection of the Constitution and that this could be justified by the resultant benefits to tenants.  This is very close to one of the faults found in the legislation by the Supreme Court.  It is not a proposition to which the Government could subscribe.  It has been widely acknowledged that one of the virtues of our Constitution, whatever faults it may have, is that it protects the ultimate rights of the minorities.  Whether they are landlords or tenants, it is important that the rights of minorities be maintained.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker made some suggestions in relation to private rented accommodation. There is genuine concern by all elected representatives.  In the matter of housing alone, it is a most contentious and controversial point whether one Government or another are doing more to provide and extra number of houses. There are bad landlords and bad tenants also.  If more rented accommodation was available it would solve many of our problems.  One of the difficulties in providing extra accommodation was that the incentive to do so did not exist.  The Bill is now trying to give landlords an opportunity at some stage to repossess their dwellings, where they will have an interest in maintaining them, where the rented accommodation which is available will not deteriorate as rapidly as it has over the past number of years.  This was mainly because sections of the Act were declared unconstitutional.  This is an aspect which is not completely divorced from this Bill. It is one of those areas which we could regard as providing some incentive towards a solution of our housing problem. I hear people talking about the difficulties which students have in getting accommodation and I know there is a difficulty there.  When accommodation is available the rents are stronomical. While we have a duty to those people to control the rent, we must not remove the incentive to provide such accommodation.</P>
    <P>I do not accept there is any room for selectivity.  The Constitution is there to protect all citizens and this sets the guidelines <Col N="1601" /> on which we must legislate.  I am making these points on the constitutional aspect of the Bill.  As I said at the opening stages of the debate, the Government had to have regard for the complex constitutional issues which this legislation raises.  The Government feel that this measure achieves a fair balance between the interests of both parties and the advice available is that the Bill is in conformity with the Constitution.  However, in light of the views to the contrary that have been expressed, the Government have thought it prudent to plan for the possibility of a referral by the President to the Supreme Court.  For this reason the Government have proposed that temporary legislation be extended to 25 April 1982.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable disquiet and concern among tenants regarding section 9 and this was expressed in the Dáil and the Seanad.  If the court decides on a fair rent it has to be phased in&mdash;40 per cent for the first year and 15 per cent in each subsequent year until it is 100 per cent in the fifth year.  There has been concern about this, that it will throw tenants on the streets, particularly those who are in the upper age limit, widows, those living alone and old age pensioners.  I accept there is a difficulty here.  If this law fails in that regard then our whole social services will have failed also.  I do not accept that the State will not come to the rescue of those people who are thrown on to the streets and have nowhere to go.  I accept that the Government will come to their rescue whether by way of supplementary welfare allowance or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The drafting of this section took into account the points raised by Senator Quinn.  If in the first year tenants were subjected to the fair rent fixed by the courts it would be a severe heartache on those tenants and the purpose of this section was to phase-in the agreed economic rent which was determined by the court.  We have got advice from legal experts on this matter that this is the best that can be done.  It is not right to say that this was drafted with no consideration for the tenants and their difficulties to pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> Senator Ryan made some points in relation to the section which I just mentioned. They were repeated by other Senators and I have dealt with them.  There is great urgency attached to this Bill and it is important that it be enacted as soon as possible.  We had no alternative but to introduce the Bill.  The point has been made by a number of Senators particularly by Senator Ryan.  I do not disagree with him.  It also has been made by Senator Quinn very effectively.  Maybe it is not this Bill which we should look at, maybe it is not the law in relation to this problem, maybe it is the Constitution, but that is not a matter for me to decide. I may agree entirely that we could look at it, but there is nothing to prevent Senator Ryan, Senator Quinn or anybody else from expressing that view somewhere, and maybe getting good support. We could look at it to see in what way it is fulfilling what it was proposed to do.</P>
    <P>I thank very sincerely the Members here who gave their views and, while I do not necessarily agree with the views expressed, that does not mean that I do not take note of the points made and that I do not appreciate them.  They were made in a very sincere way and the debate was of a very high standard from Senators who contributed.  I hope they appreciate the circumstances under which this Bill was introduced and the difficulties of trying to reconcile the interests of landlords and tenants.  I hope sincerely that when this Bill is enacted it will at least go a portion of the way to protect the interests of all concerned.  It is not the duty of the Government nor is it possible for them to direct the President to bring this Bill before the Supreme Court immediately to test the constitutionality of it but &mdash;let me express my own personal opinion here&mdash;I sincerely hope that this will be done because it is important that at least we would know in the very near future whether this Bill can stand up before the Supreme Court and become law.  There are restrictions on us in relation to time and that is why I express the urgency of this Bill and the delicate situation we are in.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 22, to delete &ldquo;the District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Fair Rents Tribunal to be established by regulations made by the Minister under this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to create a special rents tribunal to handle <Col N="1604" /> what will almost certainly be a very large number of applications under this Bill. At present as provided for in the Bill these applications will be handled by the District Court.  The District Court already has as much business as it can handle and perhaps is overloaded.  The jurisdiction of the District Court is due to be increased sometime next year which means that it will have a great deal of extra business.  In these circumstances it would be quite impracticable for the court to deal with applications under this Bill.  Varying estimates have been made of how many applications there will be and it is no exaggeration to say that there could be anything up to 20,000.  In these circumstances it is quite unrealistic to expect the District Court to handle them. It is easy to put the provision into the Bill that the District Court will handle them but from a realistic point of view it will not be able to handle them.  Either the court will not get round to handling any more than a very small number of the applications or it will neglect existing business or some of the business which will be coming to it under the new jurisdiction coming in sometime next year.  If the Minister is serious about applications under this Bill being processed, heard and dealt with properly &mdash; and I have no doubt he is serious &mdash; then it is quite impractical to ask the District Court to do it.  In these circumstances the Minister should establish a fair rents tribunal consisting of a president who shall be a judge of the Circuit Court and six other members who shall, because of their particular knowledge or experience, be suitably qualified for membership of such a tribunal. If such a tribunal are established I have no doubt they will be able to deal much more expeditiously with the applications that are likely to arise under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that this amendment be made because the existing District Court does not have the expertise to give these applications the full consideration that would be necessary.  Although the District Court has some experience in this kind of work, this will be a new type of application and for some years to come there will be a huge number of these <Col N="1605" /> applications.  It is appropriate in these circumstances that there should be a new special tribunal to deal with them, a tribunal who will gradually build up the necessary expertise.  Such a tribunal would be the appropriate body to deal with these applications.</P>
    <P>For these two reasons, the impossibility of these being dealt with by the District Court, I am proposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sympathetic to the objective Senator Eoin Ryan is seeking to achieve by moving this amendment. A very strong case can be made for establishing a fair rents tribunal to be the forum to decide on matters to be determined in this Bill, such as the question of the rent to be paid bearing in mind the circumstances and that the premises have been rent controlled earlier, and bearing in mind the provisions of the legislation including that section of 17 relating to the costs of the tenant being borne by the landlord.  It is more appropriate to establish a fair rents tribunal than to use in the longer term the District Court for applications which will be made in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>If this were a Bill dealing with the whole range of applications in the private sector &mdash; in other words if it were the measure which I hope will follow this as soon as possible to give greater security in the general private rented sector and to establish a procedure for the fixing of rents &mdash; I would hope that that procedure would include the setting up of a fair rents tribunal.  I hope that when a Bill has been brought in to do that, the jurisdiction under this Bill will be transferred to such a fair rents tribunal.  I would like the Minister in his reply on this amendment, to indicate whether the Government firmly intend to establish a fair rents tribunal to deal with a much broader range of issues than the matter we are dealing with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have to accept that this Bill is being introduced to cater for a situation brought about by a successful constitutional action in the Supreme Court and that the initial response was one of holding the position for a period of months <Col N="1606" /> and that, even in that time scale, given the complexity of the law involved &mdash; which nobody can understate or try to play down; these are complex issues of balancing between the rights of landlords and the rights of tenants in this area &mdash; it is reasonable at the moment to use the District Court as the forum because it is there, because it is geographically accessible. However, the District Court is not the appropriate forum in any considered medium or long-term span.  The criticisms that can be made of it are very valid.</P>
    <P>I would add to the points made by Senator Eoin Ryan the fact that for a number of tenants &mdash; such as elderly people, a very vulnerable section &mdash; the prospect of going to court is so traumatic, so worrying, that they simply will not go. The solution as far as they are concerned is that if they do not pay the rent the landlord is seeking from them by agreement then they will be brought to court. They will either try to see whether relatives can assist them in paying this increased rent or they will simply have to get out.  The strain of the prospect of going to court is very real for the majority of the kind of tenants that we are talking about in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope that that the Minister will be able to assure us that he has the commitment to introduce a fair rents tribunal to deal with the fixing of rents in private rented accommodation in a very broad sense, broader than the provisions of this Bill.  This has been a major policy consideration of the Labour Party for a very long time and it is necessary.  A defect in our whole system is that we have not had accessible a fair rents tribunal long ago to settle the balance between landlord and tenant in relation to private rented accommodation.  One great advantage of a fair rents tribunal is that they do not have the intimidating or distressing aura a court has for people who are not accustomed to it.  Such a tribunal could build up considerable expertise and could be a much fairer and truer body to assess a fair rent in the circumstances.  If the time had allowed this would have been a better Bill if the forum provided for it was a fair rents tribunal, but I am prepared to support <Col N="1607" /> this measure on the understanding that in a reasonable span the Minister will introduce legislation to establish a fair rents tribunal in a broader context and that he will look at the possibility of transferring the jurisdiction in relation to the former rent controlled premises which we are dealing with here to such a fair rent tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill would not be before the House at all but for a decision of the High Court.  The one thing that strikes me most forcibly about this amendment is that there is a right of appeal from the District Court to a higher court but there is no right of appeal from the rents tribunal if they are set up.  I have not a legal mind but it seems to me that if these people are not satisfied in the District Court they can go on to another court.  Senator Robinson said that people find difficulty in going to court, particularly the weaker sections of the community, but I think they would find a equally hard to go to a rents tribunal. For that reason I can not see that the amendment can be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier today in my reply on Second Stage, a point laboured to some extent was the capacity of the District Court to meet the number of cases which would confront it as a result of this Bill.  I have my personal view that you still would have considerable agreement between the landlords and tenants in a number of cases, I hope in the majority of cases.  At this stage nobody can forecast what the pressure would be as a result of the numbers that could not reach agreement. The machinery is there at the moment and if full agreement is not reached the District Court is the only way in which agreement can be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Senator Robinson's point that it is a great trauma for some people, especially elderly people, to have to go before the District Court but, as Senator Reynolds said, there is considerable urgency about this measure.  Part of the programme for Government from 1981 to <Col N="1608" /> 1986 is that rent tribunals will be set up to determine fair rents for the whole rented market.  It was not part of the Government's programme, nor would it be possible in the time available, to set up such tribunals to deal exclusively with the rent control sector.  It is the opinion of the Government that urgent problems arising out of the Supreme Court decision can and must be dealt with through the courts system which is the body with most experience in this area.  It would be quite impossible to set up the organisation, recruit and train staff, obtain accommodation and set up the procedures for an entirely new form of rent determination in time to have it working when the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act lapses.  This no more than implies the recognition of the reality facing us at the moment.  For this reason I am not prepared to accept the amendment at this stage.  However, the intention of the Government is to set up a rents tribunal but Senator Robinson would be aware of the difficulties it would entail before a rents tribunal could be put into motion. Certainly that would not be before this Bill would lapse and this is the urgency attached to this Bill.  The District Court is the only machinery available at the moment to deal with the problem as it arises once this Bill is enacted.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I am aware that it is in the programme for Government that legislation will be introduced establishing a fair rents tribunal for rented accommodation in the private sector.  I would like to clarify if this is something that would be brought before us in this session.  Are we going to see that legislation brought before this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is dealing with this measure because of a Supreme Court decision in a case which was especially chosen as a test case by the landlord in question.  Fair enough, but there are many vulnerable people in both rent controlled premises and the private rented sector.  It is a matter of urgent concern that we have broad-based legislation, that we establish fair rents tribunals and that we deal with this problem now.  The Minister has <Col N="1609" /> almost given that assurance, but I would like him to give some indication of how far advanced the work of the Department is on this and how soon we can expect legislation on this issue.  It is critically important that we see it extremely soon.  More and more people are being driven further out fom the city because of very high rents.  One-parent families and anyone an a low income find it extremely difficult to avail of private rented accommodation.  The situation is open to exploitation because of no control on conditions under which a landlord can issue notice to quit.  It has been a social problem for a long time and I would like to get from the Minister a degree of urgency in his intention to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister of State has said that he does not know how many applications will be received under this Bill when enacted and that is quite true. On any estimate it is going to run into thousands, and if that it true there is no possibility of the District Court being able to deal with these applications in any expeditious manner.  If we pass the Bill as it stands we are knowingly creating a situation in which the provisions and projection of this Bill will not be available to thousands of people who will wish to avail of its provisions because the District Court quite simply will not be able to deal with the applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances it would be much better to face up to the necessity of creating this kind of tribunal.  The Minister says that it would not be possible to set up such a tribunal before the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act runs out.  In the first place I do not believe that it would be impossible to set up the tribunal.  If the Department really get down to it and view it as a matter not only of urgency but of importance, then it should be possible to set up a tribunal within the time available.  Even if it is not quite possible, if it needs an extra month or two, then the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act can be extended <Col N="1610" /> for another month or two to enable the tribunal to be set up.  It is not an adequate answer.  If there is the belief that the tribunal would be better way of dealing with this problem, then the fact that there are difficulties of setting up the tribunal in time should not prevent the most appropriate body being created to deal with the situation.  I cannot accept this as a reason for not setting up what is the most appropriate way of dealing with the applications which will arise under this Bill.  It will not be possible to deal with them through the District Court.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made on the one hand to the fact that there is no appeal under a tribunal and on the other to the question of appeals from the District Court.  It is true that you can appeal a decision of the District Court.  On the other hand, many of the tenants making applications not only would be extremely reluctant to go to the District Court at all but, if they lost in the District Court, it is almost certain that they would not have the will to appeal or the finance either. From that point of view appeal from a District Court decision is theoretical rather than practical for the vast majority of people who would be involved.  That is a disadvantage from the applicant's point of view but from a practical viewpoint a very serious disadvantage.  If the tribunal have the expertise and experience, in most cases one can be assured that the decision given will be fair and acceptable and consequently the necessity for appeal will not arise, whereas in the District Court, where the matter will not be dealt with as expertly as one would like, there will be a right of appeal.  However, that situation should not arise and would not arise under the tribunal.  I urge the Minister, particularly as he has more or less conceded that a tribunal would in the long run be a better way of dealing with it, not to allow the fact that it may be difficult to set up one within the time permitted to sway his decision as to whether this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in complete agreement with what Senator Mary Robinson said concerning the definition <Col N="1611" /> of a court and the use of the District Court in this matter.  However, we must be practical.  As the other Members have indicated, we must realise that in the setting up of a fair rent tribunal, what was envisaged by the partners in Government was a fair rents tribunal with far wider terms of reference than a fair rents tribunal envisaged under the amendment which we are discussing on section 1.</P>
      <P>Indeed, if the Minister had sought to establish a fair rents tribunal with powers limited only to the consideration and determination of issues which arise in respect of controlled dwellings, he would have got a very frosty reception indeed from this House.  When the question of the fair rents tribunal comes to be considered, there are very many more issues and areas of public interest considerably wider than the consideration of merely those dwellings that happen to be controlled dwellings by reason of fact that they were in existence on a particular date in 1941.</P>
      <P>Consequently, while the District Court is by no means ideal, during the time between now and the implementation of the legislation in April consideration of the wider powers of the fair rents tribunal should be put in train so that the responsibilities of the court under this Bill can, under a Fair Rents Tribunal (Establishment) Bill, be transferred completely to the rents tribunal from the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I do not at all share Senator Ryan's fear that the District Court &mdash; I do not want to misquote him &mdash; will in some way be less experienced and, as a result of that, give less consideration to the matter.  I have found in the District Court by and large that the Justices who sit in the District Court have an immense amount of common sense, are not over-worried about the legal rights of the situation and apply their own common sense.  The common sense which they apply will be in favour of the tenant rather than the landlord.  Consequently, the temporary granting of these powers to the District Court is more acceptable, to me, even though it is not altogether acceptable, than the establishment of a fair rents tribunal which would be seen to <Col N="1612" /> be a very limited body indeed and not to conform to the terms of reference which were envisaged by the programme of the Government when they took office.  For that reason I do not support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I may not have given a commitment to Senator Ryan that, in the event of the problems which he has envisaged in the amendment arising, in particular in relation to Dublin, and to a lesser extent, probably, in Cork, steps will be taken to ensure that the court will be able to deal with them. Beyond that, at this stage, I cannot go.  I do not deny the fact that a problem could arise.  If it arises it will be dealt with at that stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Robinson's request for a commitment to a date for introduction of this legislation, being such a major undertaking, it would be impossible to say now when I would be in a position to introduce the legislation. However, I am aware that it is fairly high on the priority list of the Government.  It has been discussed though, perhaps, not to any great extent.  It is the intention of the Government to deal with it and I sincerely hope to be in a position to do so as early as possible.  I would not like to be forced to make a commitment which I might not be able to honour, but sincerely hope that it will be as early as possible.  A Fair Rents Tribunal is the most important and effective way of dealing with the problem.  I am asking the Senators to accept the machinery of the District Court.  Taking into account that there is the element of urgency attached to this Bill and that the only machinery available is the District Court, to repeat my undertaking, it is likely that there could be problems, particularly in Dublin, and to a lesser extent in other cities, but if these arise I can assure Senator Ryan that steps will be taken to ensure that adequate steps will be taken to put the courts in a strengthened position to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>May I respond briefly by saying that it is refreshing to hear a <Col N="1613" /> Minister who will not give a commitment that he cannot necessarily stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a few such commitments yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>He stated that this is fairly high on the list of priorities.  One of the advantages of debating a measure of this kind in the Houses of the Oireachtas is to get a sense of what other priorities representatives have and, to the extent that it is possible to do so, the message should go from this House that a fair rent tribunal is a very real priority for the Government.  The legislation is necessarily complex but there are good precedents.  Fair Rents Tribunals operate in a number of other countries.  It is now the major way of dealing with problems of balancing the interests of landlords and tenants.  There are examples from which we can draw, with a range of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I do not think that the question of an appeal is the problem.  A system of appeal can be built in.  As has been mentioned by Senator Ryan, unfortunately the question of an appeal is often a very remote prospect for the tenant concerned. An accessible, fair, reasonable tribunal is the first priority.  I also was pleased to hear the Minister's assurance that if there are problems, they will be <Col N="1614" /> localised problems, they will be in Dublin and in other cities like Cork where a number of people may be affected.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to ensure that the courts can operate effectively.  At the moment, there is a severe backlog in various levels of the court.  It got caught in a severe backlog and it is a very serious problem.  The Minister should actively monitor how the legislation is working and not just let it see its way through and allow delays to build up.  Even with that, there are going to be a number of tenants who will not feel that they can exercise their rights.  They will agree to a rent they cannot afford or will be forced to get out because they cannot afford the rent. Again, agencies like Threshold and the private rented tenants' associations should try to monitor the situation and inform the Minister of cases where there appears to be hardship, where a tenant could have a right to go to court but, for one reason or another, is afraid to do so. This information is extremely important so that we know the effect of this legislation and what effect the fact that it is the District Court which will be dealing with it will have on tenants on the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 5, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) any other person who has resided with a tenant for a period of five years for the specific purpose of providing domicilary care and attention.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to add to those who seek protection.  In many cases people of the kind mentioned in the amendment have left their own homes and very often left their jobs, in order to provide domicilary care and attention. As a result, they find themselves extremely dependent on their adopted homes.  The purpose of this amendment is to give them the same protection which is given to the members of the family.</P>
      <P>The members of the family have been defined in the Bill in a very liberal way. The range and kinds of relations who are covered are extremely wide.  It could hardly be more liberal than it is, but it is fair to say that many of the people who would be covered and protected by that definition would be far less deserving of consideration than the kind of person mentioned in this amendment.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister to include as an extra category to those already covered under section 1, persons who are residing with the tenant for a period of five years for the specific purpose of providing domicilary care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The designation of what is to be construed here as the family of the tenant, as set out in section 2, is very broad and includes all those who had protection under the Rent Restrictions Act.  To accept this amendment would be to introduce a wholly new concept of entitlement to succession outside the family.  I do not consider that this can be justified.  It must be remembered that one of the reasons why the Rent Restrictions Act was declared unconstitutional was <Col N="1616" /> because of the over-extensive rights of the tenant to pass on this tenancy indefinitely. For this reason, therefore, whilst I sympathise with the thinking prompting the amendment, I do not propose to accept it.  As the Senator is aware, the definition of the family is a fairly wide one and for the benefit of the House, I will repeat it.  It is &ldquo;the tenant's father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, nephew, niece, grandson, grandaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle or aunt,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;such person is adopted by the tenant under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, or is the illegitimate offspring of the tenant (being the mother or the reputed father of such offspring) or is a person who was in a bona fide residence with the tenant for not less than six years before the tenant's death where the tenant was in <i>loco parentis</i> to that person.  I understand the thinking behind this amendment, but cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash; The Minister shall by regulation establish a Fair Rents' Tribunal consisting of a President who shall be a Judge of the Circuit Court and six other members who shall, because of their particular knowledge or experience, be suitably qualified for membership of such a Tribunal.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection 2 <i>(b)</i>, page 6, line 43, after &ldquo;under section 13&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and has issued the tenant with a rent-book (in cases where this has not already been done) and for the purpose of recording each payment of rent, which rent book shall remain in the tenants' possession&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that there is a rentbook so that a tenant will know exactly where he stands in relation to the amount of rent and the rent that has been paid.  The section provides for a written agreement.  It provides that where the terms are agreed between the landlord and the tenant, or are fixed by the court, they shall be set out in written form and signed by the landlord or his agent and by the tenant and a copy thereof shall be furnished by the landlord to the tenant.  They shall not be enforceable by the landlord until he has registered the tenancy with the housing authority in accordance with the regulations for the time being enforced under section 13.</P>
      <P>From a legal and technical point of view this is very necessary but from the practical point of view, from the point of view of the weekly or other rent it is far more important, from the tenant's point of view &mdash; or for many tenants anyhow &mdash; that there should be a rentbook, that he or she should know exactly what the rent is and that it has been paid and so on. This is an addition which in its own way would be just as important as the written terms of the agreement.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It would be of great practical importance from the point of view of the tenant and in some cases even from that of the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am sympathetic to the objective sought to be obtained in this amendment, although it can possibly be achieved without a formal insertion in the Bill itself.  It is certainly <Col N="1618" /> true that tenants have not, in a significant number of cases, had rentbooks which they should have had.  It is true that a very significant number of tenants have not retained, or had, a copy of the agreement relating to the tenancy and do not know in any detail what the terms of the agreement are and are either afraid to ask for, or have been refused, a copy of it from the landlord, or more likely his agent.  It is extremely important that tenants be given greater protection through procedural rights and guarantees of this kind.  The section itself makes a very important first step in requiring that the landlord provide for the tenant a copy of the tenancy agreement.  I would very strongly support the requirement that a landlord also be required to issue the tenant with a rentbook where this has not been done already and that this be used for recording the payment of rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has very considerable powers to make regulations, in particular power to make regulations in relation to the registration of rented dwellings.  It would seem that the requirement of furnishing a rentbook would be a matter that could be&mdash;and, in my view, should be&mdash;covered by ministerial regulations as one of the procedural requirements for an effective registration.  One of the important controls built into this Bill is that the landlord will not be able to avail of the facilities of the Act unless he has registered.  That, in itself, will be a very important new achievement, in ensuring registration by landlords.  As part of that, the Minister should not only seek to require that rentbooks be issued and that proof of this be furnished when the landlord comes to register, but also a number of other possible safeguards and controls, for example in relation to the provisions in this Bill on the size and suitability of the accommodation itself.  All of this can now be much more effectively monitored and controlled because the provisions of the Bill are there to do it.  I feel that the purpose of this amendment is one which I would support on its merits but it is one which can be achieved by the Minister through his power to make regulations, or can be achieved by declining registration <Col N="1619" /> of a landlord who has not been prepared to furnish a rentbook.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment perhaps in the form in which it comes but if the amendment is not, in fact, passed, I would join with Senator Robinson in pressing that this matter should be included in the statutory regulations because, very often, in the type of case that arises between landlord and tenant, one of the difficulties is that the record of what rent has been paid and has not been paid is in dispute and the tenant is generally in a very weak position as regards proving what rent has been paid or has not been paid where a rent book is not supplied.  It is noticeable that, for instance, under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, it is specifically made the normal method of payment of maintenance by one spouse to another that it should be done through the District Court office. One of the reasons for this is in order to establish an exact and provable record of what has been paid and what has not been paid.  The provision of a rent book and the proper registration of rents in the rent book are a similar type of necessary record which strengthens the hand of those who otherwise may have been simply paying rent in cash.  Very often this sort of tenant is not the kind of person who has a bank account from which he can pay by banker's order and have the bank record to prove his payments.</P>
      <P>Basically, I support Senator Ryan's amendment but, if the House does not accept his amendment, I would join with Senator Robinson in pressing the Minister very strongly to include this matter of rent books and proper records within the statutory regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give it consideration when making the regulations.  At this stage my information is that it has not been successful in Britain and that it has been widely abused.  It is, nonetheless, something which I will have examined when making the regulations.  Whilst the principle that landlords should provide the tenants with rent books is a good one, I do not consider it really necessary in <Col N="1620" /> this case to include such a provision in the Bill.  Already under this Bill a landlord is required to set out the tenancy agreement in written form, to provide a copy for the tenant, to register the dwelling and the rent at which it is let with the housing authority.  The most important requirement is registering with the housing authority.  The landlord cannot enforce an increase in rent either initially or on review unless the rent is registered with the local authority.  The register will be a public register open for inspection. This, I consider, provides sufficient safeguard for the tenant and I would not favour imposing further statutory requirements on the landlord.  This is something that should be left to the individual landlord and tenant and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply on the amendment which has been withdrawn, I have already expressed approval of this section in that it will bring in a number of important safeguards.  Perhaps the Minister could give some indication of the requirements in relation to the registration of the tenancy. First of all, when the landlord registers the premises, will he, at that stage, be required to produce a copy of any agreement or, subsequently, when the rent is being fixed will he have to produce and leave with the office a copy of the agreement?  How is it envisaged that this will work in fact?  It is a very important provision and safeguard and I would just like to hear how precisely it is going to work in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the name of the landlord, and of the tenant, and the rent that will have to be paid will appear in the agreement.  Whatever type of agreement is used it has to be registered with the name of the landlord, and of the tenant and the amount of rent for the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making is that presumably the landlord does <Col N="1621" /> not go along and say, &ldquo;This is the position and the rent is £10 per week&rdquo; when, in fact, the rent is much more than that.  In other words, what kind of proof is a landlord going to be required to bring along in order to register the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibilities of enforcement do not give us much comfort in this area.  We have by-laws that may or may not be enforced and, on the whole, are not enforced and we have small penalties for statutory offences.  I am concerned to ensure that the system of registering the premises and the rent being paid by the tenants in those premises is an effective system.  A good deal will depend on the actual evidence of ownership of the premises and that it is rented and evidence of the rent that the landlord will be required to bring along when registering.  Perhaps this is something that can be dealt with in the statutory regulations but it is important to have that rather formal system registering the premises and of registering the rent.  It probably will be the case that some tenants will check the registration but we are dealing with elderly, very vulnerable people, and we need to be very sure that the protection in the Act will be very effective and fully enforced.</P>

It is intended to make this section effective.  At this stage I cannot say any more on it but I will have a look at it in making statutory regulations.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that one of the proofs that would be required in the event of the landlord seeking to recover money for arrears of rent or seeking to acquire possession of the property is that he had registered the property properly and that the proper rent was <Col N="1622" /> registered.  If he did not do that, he could not force the tenant out.  But it does not completely answer the point made by Senator Robinson because very many people are put under pressure and they pay up and the case does not go to court.  These tenants, also, must be protected. They are probably the most vulnerable people.  But ultimately, if somebody was being asked to leave the property, I presume the Minister will confirm that it would be then necessary for the landlord to prove that he had at all times properly registered the property.</P>

      <P>It states here in section 4 that terms of every tenancy of a dwelling to which this Act applies shall be terms of agreement between the landlord and the tenant or by default shall be fixed by the court.  I am just wondering if there could, in fact, be a whole host of different kinds of judgment made by a District Court justice.  Would the Minister envisage, under the regulations, that some form of guidelines might by issued by his Department to assist district justices in this regard?</P>

The courts are not specialists in the area of housing.  Judges vary from court to court.  Surely to obtain positive legislation in this area, it is not too much to ask the Minister to envisage that such guidelines might be offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make a point on section 17 in relation to liability for costs but maybe I should make it at this stage.  This section provides that the landlord will be liable for the costs of a tenant reasonably incurred on an application to court.  That is a procedure that I approve of and it is a good provision in the Act but we are talking here about the terms of an agreement between the landlord and tenant.  If this is to be an agreement properly arrived at it is probably one in which both parties would require to be advised, in particular the tenant would require to be advised because it is very much in the tenant's interest to know precisely the protections offered even by this Bill.  It is important so that the tenant will not simply be faced with a written agreement and told &ldquo;sign here&rdquo; without him fully understanding it. In those circumstances, it would appear that if the approach being adopted is that the Government are prepared to impose a certain liability on the landlord, if the landlord wishes to apply to the court, then there also should be the provision of assistance to the tenant to enable him to be separately advised on the tenancy agreement being entered into.  That may mean that more agreements would in fact be concluded because the tenant would have the benefit of legal advice and assistance in relation to it.  Alternatively, the tenant who does not have any advice &mdash; and we can take it that in the vast majority of cases agreements would be drawn up by the landlord's solicitors &mdash; would be under two pressures; first, the pressure of not being independently advised, being faced with this legal document, and secondly, the pressure of being told if he does not sign the landlord will apply to the District Court.  The threat of that and the lack of any independent advice would, in many cases, <Col N="1624" /> mean that the tenant would either have to accept a rent that he or she would not be able to afford to pay or else would be put in a very disadvantageous circumstance. Could the Minister say if it would be possible to ensure that the tenant did have legal advice at the stage of approving the agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something which I could not accept.  Most of this legislation is geared towards the tenant rather than towards the landlord.  In the event of a court case, the onus is on the landlord rather than on the tenant to go to court. The tenant need not agree to the rent they are discussing.  If there are any further problems, the tenant does not have to sign the agreement and the onus is then on the landlord to go to court.  The landlord can be responsible, within reason, for the costs as far as the tenant is concerned.  I could not accept the Senator's suggestion in relation to advice prior to the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to extend the civil legal aid scheme to cover the conclusion of legal agreements of this sort so that a tenant in these circumstances should be able to benefit from professional advice?  The reason I emphasise this is because in the majority of these cases the landlord has the benefit of professional advice.  This is a legal document and, in particular, in relation to the scaled provisions of the Act, it could be important for the tenant to have the benefit of professional advice at the stage of concluding the agreement. If that advice is not there then the tenant may be under a dual pressure.  It is possible that the civil legal aid scheme may extend to the tenants who satisfy the means test and the most vulnerable tenants would possibly satisfy it and could <Col N="1625" /> go under the existing scheme and seek advice from the law centre.  If that is the case it should be widely promoted as a safeguard to tenants that they ought to get professional advice on the agreement itself which the landlord is seeking to conclude arising from the provisions of this Bill.  The tenant should have the benefit of professional help at that stage because if a lawyer is available to advise a tenant at that stage he can see whether the landlord has registered the premises, whether the rent which the landlord is inserting in the agreement is to be registered, and whether the scaled provisions in this Bill will apply as provided or, if there was to be some formula in the agreement for gradually increasing rent, that this was fair to the tenant concerned. This is very important because tenants are easy to intimidate, easy to bewilder and confuse and, indeed they may not have the ability to read a technical tenancy agreement.  It depends on how this agreement is drawn up.  In many cases, it may be totally incomprehensible to the tenant except for the figure in it.  The accessibility of legal advice at that stage could be a more realistic help to the tenant than to know, in the abstract, that if they were to go to court that the landlord might be liable under section 17 of this Bill for reasonable costs incurred in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Robinson in what she says about the necessity for legal advice at this stage and to ask the Minister to ensure that at the very least the civil legal aid centres should be able to deal with this matter in regard to tenants who are at a low means level and, not only that they should be able to do so, but that it should be publicised that they would do so.  I take the Minister's point that this Bill is in many ways giving new rights to tenants and is slanted, in a sense, in favour of tenants but it is of no use to some of these tenants to have these rights if they are unaware of the nature of them.  Very often they are not capable of understanding legislation or, as Senator Robinson said, of understanding the kind of agreement that is presented to them.  So the <Col N="1626" /> important thing is not only that they should have rights but that they should know they have rights.  To say that if they go to court the thing will be properly looked into is not quite enough because virtually everyone has a distinct fear and distaste about going to court about anything and, perhaps, rightly so.  The fact that the tenant is told he can go to court and get it sorted out there does not necessarily mean that a vulnerable elderly, perhaps ill-educated tenant is likely to take that step.  He may just feel himself so much under pressure that he will sign the agreement and say it is all right.  So, in addition to making the rights available, I feel that every step should be taken to publicise the kind of rights that are available.</P>

      <P>I accept the points made by Senators Robinson and McGuinness. I can understand the trauma of people who are aged and widowed, as referred to earlier this morning, having to appear before the courts.  I am equally aware that there are people who will be affected and who will have to have access to the court and who will not be aware of what their entitlement is under the Bill.  That is accepted and that is not peculiar to this Bill but to a number of our laws.  This is an on-going thing.</P>
      <P>I understand that there would be at least some tenants who would have access to civil legal aid.  There is no way in which I can include in this Bill a section giving rights to tenants.  That is a matter for another Department.  In that area we have gone as far as we possibly can in the Bill.  There are some voluntary bodies who are there to advise tenants, who do an extremely good job in providing advice, and I would like to pay tribute to them.  I am afraid I could not cover in the Bill at this stage the points which have been raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 7, to delete subsection (2), <Col N="1627" /> lines 10 to 16 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) The gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, would be reasonable and fair, having regard to the respective economic circumstances of the landlord and tenant, and the character and situation of the dwelling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an effort to ensure that at least some regard would be given to the economic circumstances of both landlord and tenant.  During Second Stage reference was made on a number of occasions to the probable plight of tenants under this Bill.  We heard, indeed, some very impressive pleas, particularly by Senator Quinn, in regard to this problem and the situation in which tenants would be put by the provisions of the Bill.  This amendment is an effort to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment deals with the character and situation of the dwelling, which ensures that, by and large, a fair rent will be fixed or that the situation will be looked at from the point of view of what would be a fair rent having regard to the type of dwelling it is and its situation.  What the amendment suggests is that the court should be able to have some regard to the respective economic circumstances of landlord and tenant.  This concept is already in the Bill to some extent in section 9, dealing with rebates.  What the amendment proposes is that it should be looked at when the rent is being fixed.  Quite clearly, the extent to which the court would be able to have regard to the circumstances of the landlord and tenant would be limited because if it went too far in that direction then, of course, there would be constitutional difficulties again in regard to the Bill.  This is merely to extend this concept of having regard to the economic circumstances of the landlord and the tenant beyond section 9 to when the rent is being fixed.  The amendment could play some small part in alleviating very difficult economic circumstances in which the tenant <Col N="1628" /> or the landlord, for that matter, might be placed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The formula for the setting of a gross rent set out in section 6 follows principles set out in both the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980 and in section 9 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  In both these cases no reference is made to the circumstances of the landlord and tenant and such an inclusion would be a major departure from normal practice.</P>
      <P>The use of such criteria in the setting of rents would also involve the court in adjudicating on what would be highly subjective matters and would increase the volume of litigation as both landlords and tenants sought to present their economic circumstances in a more unfavourable light.  The letting value of a dwelling is something which should not be affected by the financial circumstances of the landlord and tenant.  If a tenant, because of his circumstances, needs assistance it should be best provided by the assistance which the Government have undertaken to provide and which I now repeat will be provided for tenants faced with hardship in paying rents.  In these circumstances I could not accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem that any legislation that is passed has to stand, if not by reference by the President, a constitutional test.  Taking into account the circumstances of the landlord and tenant ties the hands of the Seanad in considering amendments to section 6. However, within the Bill itself there is an additional criterion which is used on one occasion in the Bill and which I would like to see included in section 6 which, as Senator Ryan has identified, is the area which will give rise to any hardship which may arise and in which the court will be asked to exercise its most subjective judgment. That hardship, according to the undertaking of the Minister, will be alleviated by money from the public purse. <Col N="1629" /> But that is no reason for not seeking to establish the correct position in any case and alleviate the public purse from the necessity of paying what could, in due course, turn out to be exorbitant rents to landlords.</P>
      <P>What we are seeking here is the balance between the interests of landlords and tenants and I do not think that subsection (2) really solves that problem, particularly in the situation where we are going from a highly protective situation, which is in itself artificial and by reason of that has given rise to a certain profile of tenant and certain priorities among tenants, which priorities and profile of tenant will be changed substantially over the next four or five years.</P>
      <P>I would like to introduce into subsection (2) a kind of criterion which is already in the Bill under section 11.  I will just refer to that to explain what I mean. Section 11 deals with the compensation for improvements which would be payable to the tenant in respect of improvements which he carried out and such compensation would be payable at the termination of the tenancy.  There is a system of valuation of the capitalised value of that and the suggested capitalised value is subject to a saving clause, that the court shall determine the amount of the capitalised value, but shall not exceed fifteen times such annual letting value.  So basically what the Bill is seeking to do is to say that if the additional letting value created by the improvements were worth £100, then the maximum compensation which could be awarded to the tenant is £1,500.  Effectively the tenant is being limited to a yield of £100 divided by 15 or 6.66 per cent on the money which he has invested.  The same concept could usefully be introduced into section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have put down an amendment but I was at a meeting of a committee of the Seanad when the House adjourned before lunch.  I did not quite understand the circumstances of the adjournment. The Minister might consider what I have in mind &mdash; if not now perhaps in the context of an enabling Bill to include it before this Bill comes into operation in April &mdash; that is, that the annual gross rent <Col N="1630" /> shall not exceed a sum which is 5 per cent of the open market value of the property. The open market value of the property shall mean the sum which, in the opinion of the court, the property without further improvement would be sold for between a willing seller and a willing purchaser for use as a single unit dwelling to which this Bill applies.  The purpose of that is to put a limit on the amount of rent which could be charged and to form a relationship between the investment which the landlord has in the property and the amount of rent he can get from it.  If the property is an artisan dwelling &mdash; and many controlled dwellings are &mdash; and if without further improvement, it is worth in an urban centre, say, £15,000-£20,000, in the case of a property worth £15,000 in its present condition, not in its improved condition, for use as a single dwelling then the maximum rent which could be levied under my proposal would be £750 or 5 per cent of £15,000.  If the property was worth £20,000, the maximum rent which could be levied would be £1,000.  If the property was worth £30,000 the maximum rent would be £1,500.  That would meet all the criteria of fairness which caused the previous legislation to be struck down by the Supreme Court.  The achievement of a 5 per cent return on one's money in an investment which is as secure as house property and which appreciates in value is a moderately good return because it is inflation-proof. The type of yield which insurance companies and pension funds expect from property would lie in the region of between 5 and 7 per cent at present.  This percentage is already recognised by the Bill in that it limits the amount of compensation which can be obtained by the tenant to a factor of 15 which is equivalent to a yield of 6.66 per cent.  If my amendment read 6.66 per cent of the open market value of the property, it would be exactly similar to what is included in section 11 (2).</P>
    <P>Guidance should be given to the court in arriving at gross rent.  The criteria which it should use should be based on the fact that rental properties on houses on the open market yield quite a small return.  If one was to buy a semi-detached <Col N="1631" /> suburban house in an urban centre of population at present for £30,000 one could not reasonably expect a rent of more than £30 per week for it for use as a single dwelling.  If one divided it into flats and applied for planning permission, one might achieve a lot more than that. As a single dwelling one could not expect to receive more than 5 per cent of the open market value of the property.  The fact that people buy a single dwelling is an indication of the security and value which is placed upon the inflation-proof element of their investment.  The 5 per cent would be reviewed in five years' time and further reviewed in another five years' time.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to accept this now because it is not realistic to expect that he would do so.  It would be a useful additional safeguard for tenants in that it would indicate to the court the determination of the Legislature to ensure that the yields which landlords should get on house property should be quite low because of the extra security which that property gives by way of preserving the capital sum.  This is a most important consideration and one which should be pointed out to the court because the court is used to hearing people getting 15, 16 or 17 per cent return on their money and might erroneously think that such a return is a necessary part of investment in something as secure as a house.  For that reason, the Minister should give serious consideration to the introduction of this additional concept in a small enabling measure to be introduced prior to the coming into operation of this Bill.  I am not looking for an absolute guarantee from the Minister merely a guarantee that he will consider the matter. That is all I can reasonably expect at such short notice.</P>

      <P>I used the word &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; because the Senator read out a very precise wording which could constitute an amendment. I accept the point that I am speaking to the section and that there is no amendment before us.  The form of amendment suggested by Senator O'Leary would give objective guidance and a ceiling on the maximum rent that could be fixed by the court.  It has the benefit of being an objective mechanism and takes account of inflation.  It is geared towards the rise in value of the property itself.  There is a need for some kind of ceiling because of the way in which the going rate may be ascertained.  Take for example, a widow or an elderly single person living in rental premises at present where there are two rooms and a bathroom-wash-up area.  Who would seek to become tenants of that property if it was on the open market?  If, as is the case with many of these rent controlled premises, it is fairly central there is a demand from single young people on very high earnings, by comparative standards.  Two or three young people working in banking, insurance, Aer Lingus and so on can pay between them a very high market rent because they have a considerable income and their outgoings are much lower.  They can afford to pay that money and, therefore, what they would offer would determine the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the suggestion put forward by Senator O'Leary.  I do not see the need which he sees for an enabling Bill to bring this measure into effect.  I do not understand that formulation.  I would prefer to consider this on Report Stage in the form of an amendment.  I do not like to be under the constraint, in relation to a measure of this social importance, that we cannot put forward amendments. The whole object of having a Bill discussed in the Dáil or the Seanad is that we have an opportunity to examine it, look at its social implications and put forward amendments.  The amendment proposed by Senator O'Leary and some of the other amendments suggested are improvements to the text of this Bill and should be seriously considered even in the time constraint of the necessity to fill <Col N="1633" /> the gap created by the judgment of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Given that the market rent may be determined by a number of single persons who, combined together, can afford a high rent for properties which are sufficiently central to be attractive to them as a base, would the Minister clarify the meaning in section 6 (2) of the term &ldquo;a willing lessee&rdquo;?  Will this be confined to one person seeking to be the lessee or is it possible that it could be a number of people coming together to share the premises?  It is important to clarify that so that we know the market value we are talking about.  I support the proposal for an amendment put forward by Senator O'Leary.</P>

      <P>What I am replying to is something that is not really before the House.  I said earlier this morning that this is not the end of legislation in this area.  There will be subsequent legislation. While I have not had time to examine the points raised by Senator O'Leary, I accept there is some validity in them and they are worthy of examination.  I undertake to have them examined.  I cannot give any indication as to whether I can accept them.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of market rent.  The basis is similar to that in the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1979 disregarding any element for goodwill which relates exclusively to business premises.  Subsection (2) specifies the criteria to be applied to calculation of the gross rent.  It is to be the amount which the court considers a willing lessee would give and a willing lessor would take on the basis of vacant possession, having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and the letting values of dwellings of a similar character and situated in a comparable area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am concerned about is if the willing lessee is three single people working in secure and well paid employment who want relatively central private rented accommodation and are prepared to pay a proportion out of each <Col N="1634" /> of their salaries, are they a lessee for the purposes of determining the market rent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not relate to any single individual.  It could include a number of people.  It is a general term rather than a specific one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed that was the case but I am happy to have it clarified. It reinforces the need for a ceiling and the need for having a fair maximum rent.</P>
      <P>Many rent controlled premises are reasonably centrally located and the market value now is a very artificial one.  It is what people like that are prepared to pay.  It bears very little relationship to the premises themselves.  There is a great scarcity, particularly in Dublin, of private rented accommodation that is centrally located.  I am concerned that the market value would be artificially high.  As it stands at present under section 6 there is no ceiling on it.  The court, as I read section 6 (2) is obliged to bear in mind what the asking price is and if the landlord has a lessee and it is three people involved in banking or insurance who are prepared to pay £100 per week, then that is the market value.  There is no ceiling on it.  This is a matter that the Minister might consider for Report Stage.  It is not a complex amendment and, as Senator O'Leary said when he suggested the formula for it, it is already a formula which we are applying to assessing the value that a tenant could get for improvements made on the tenancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to what I have said, the Minister made the valid point that I did not have an amendment before the House.  He pointed out quite forcibly to me the value of having such amendments before the House by the manner in which he dealt with my suggestion. I should like to assist the House by saying I disagree with what Senator Robinson said even though I appreciate her sentiment.  I doubt that the situation is as bad as that.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the court, a willing lessee not already in occupation <Col N="1635" /> would give and a willing lessor would take for the dwelling, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values...</P>
    <P>The letting values have already been discussed. The other terms of the tenancy include the fact that it is a premises which was previously a controlled premises and which is now occupied by somebody who has some considerable rights, even existing rights, under this Bill.  &ldquo;Having regard to the other terms of the tenancy&rdquo; includes in this case the fact that it is a tenancy of a particular character and one of the essences of that character is that it is a tenancy to one person, it is a tenancy to a family and not a tenancy to a group of individuals.  I hope that the proper interpretation of this section is that &ldquo;having regard to the other terms of the tenancy&rdquo; includes the terms of the tenancy which give rise to the right to have a fixed tenancy for the remainder of the unexpired portion of the relevant period and the other attendant rights.  As a result, what we would have is a willing lessor and a willing lessee stepping into a tenancy as it exists and this would exclude the possibility of something being quoted which would include four or five people taking a joint tenancy in the situation described by Senator Robinson.  I support her concern but I hope that situation is already covered by subsection (2).  I should like an assurance that it is.</P>

    <P>That points out clearly that somebody cannot bring in a fictitious tenant with a high rent.  The court will have access to all the relevant factors in relation to determining what would be regarded as a reasonable rent. This section provides the necessary safeguards because the rent is determined &ldquo;in the opinion of the court&rdquo;.  It meets the requirements which <Col N="1636" /> are the concern of Senators Robinson and O'Leary in that regard.</P>

      <P>I missed part of this debate but I am familiar with the general position. Am I right in assuming that this clause can only be in the form that it is because of the provisions in the Constitution? The comparison between the value of what works may have been effected by the tenant, to which Senator O'Leary referred, is not calculated in the same way and, in essence, this is the way compensations under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, which covered most of the compulsory purchase legislation, were assessed.  In effect the hands of the Minister, the Attorney General's office and the parliamentary draftsman's office were tied both by precedent and the interpretation which was anticipated that the Supreme Court would put on the constitutional provisions. Is that not the case?  We have little or no leeway.</P>

      <P>On the reply that the Minister gave to the earlier points that I made, I am not reassured by the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the court&rdquo; because the court will form its opinion on the basis of the evidence offered in court.  There is nothing to prevent a landlord coming into court and saying: &ldquo;Here is a draft agreement in which I have a lessee, and the lessee happens to be three people combining together, who are prepared to pay me this rent.&rdquo; It is not fictitious, it is real. Therefore I do not see that that provision is helpful.  The problem about the court is that it will not have the kind of informed opinion that a rents tribunal might have.  The District Court will deal with this as part of its landlord and tenant application and then it will go on to deal with criminal work and other civil work. A district justice will be dealing with a range of cases.  He will gain experience in time in the matter but there will not be an overall assessment of the property market and the detailed research that a <Col N="1637" /> tribunal might build up if it had special staff.</P>
      <P>I did not follow what Senator O'Leary said about the other terms of the tenancy or how it would relate to the fact that is is a rent controlled tenancy.  It seems that the fixing of the rent is done in relation to the market value to potential tenants who, by definition, would not be rent controlled tenants.  They would be prepared to move in if the premises were up for rent and they would be prepared to come in at a particular figure.  I fail to see how one can read in any qualification in the phrase &ldquo;other terms of the tenancy&rdquo;. If the Minister can do that I would be very interested to hear it.</P>
      <P>If the court fixes the new rent by reference to a rent which a willing lessee, who would be willing to have vacant occupation of the premises, would be prepared to offer, that willing lessee could not take up the tenancy in rent controlled circumstances but must be prepared to come in on the open market as a lessee.  Therefore he would be prepared to pay whatever is the going rate for premises of that kind in a locality.  By the nature of things many rent controlled premises are very well located.  They are centrally located and it is for this reason that we must be concerned because there will be pressure on tenants to move out of them and/or go on the corporation housing list.</P>

      <P>There is something in Senator Robinson's point.  What yardstick will the court use?  If four people swear in court that they are prepared to pay a given amount for a house in a particular area, that is the type of yardstick the court will use and that is ultimately what will determine the rent.  It is worse than that.  Suppose a house next door becomes vacant, is there not the danger that because people in one house are prepared to pay £300 a week this will affect the rent of the other houses?  There will have to be some protection for tenants.</P>

      <P>It could be, but we are confining the court to a very narrow margin. The court would have wider powers of examination than what was mentioned by Senators Robinson and O'Leary.  If such a situation arose the court would have information on accommodation in similar areas.  The court will determine what is a reasonable rent for a specific property and this is a safeguard.  I accept that there is a danger that landlords may try to get an inflated rent for certain types of accommodation.  It does not necessarily mean that the court would accept their evidence.  There is sufficient protection there.</P>

      <P>This is precisely the point.  Courts do not suddenly pluck down from the air what they think is reasonable.  They can only act on the evidence that is brought before them. That is the way courts function.  Landlords do not have to be unscrupulous, lying or anything else to produce this kind of evidence.  They can very readily produce it because there is a certain class of young professional people who will move into the centre of the city, look for these kinds of dwellings which they can get in a rather run-down nature and then spend a considerable amount of money on renovations. If I was a single person working in the Four Courts, as I do, I would be delighted to have a dwelling of this kind and would be prepared to offer considerable money for it.  This is the kind of evidence that could be produced to the court.  The idea that the District Court can spend a great deal of time carrying out a thorough examination of the whole <Col N="1639" /> area and the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the rent is fictitious.  This is an advantage a fair rents tribunal would have compared to the District Court. This point was made before on the Courts Bill, 1980, in regard to the custody of children.  The District Court has a long list to deal with and we are not always thinking of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court which is sitting in the same place all the time but of rural District Courts which have to get through a whole list in one day and then move to some place else the next day.  It is not within the mechanics of the District Court to deal with a long and extensive investigation of this type and this is where I see the danger arising.</P>

      <P>To add to what Senator McGuinness has said, what I think would be the case, where I see the danger potentially for some tenants and where I see the need for some kind of ministerial response <i>vis-à-vis</i> legal aid, is that the landlord in order to establish what a willing lessee would pay for property in that area would seek the professional services of an auctioneer or valuer.  That person would come to the court and say that in an area of a half a mile of this property the following rents have recently been obtained by a firm on a certain date. There is an established procedure for such a method of valuation.  Obviously if you are going in seeking the highest rent possible from the court you pick the most favourable examples.  It is selective evidence and there is no obligation for it to be anything other than selective evidence. The landlord is marshalling the best possible face that can be put on his presentation of what a willing lessee would offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, and it certainly happens in commercial valuations that go to court, the exact opposite procedure attaches to the other side, with the lowest possible rents recently established within half a mile of the property and the court attempts to arbitrate between the two having regard to what other factors may be relevant.  I am a bit concerned that in <Col N="1640" /> section 7 the landlord is simply obliged to give tenants a month's notice, informing them that he or she proposes to go to court to have the rents reviewed and in that time the tenants will have to obtain comparable professional advice if, as Senator McGuinness pointed out, the court is not to have biased or one-sided evidence placed on record before it, thus forcing the judge in the absence of any other information and having regard to the way in which the courts operate, to fix a rent which would be somewhat over the market level.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the constraints under which the Minister has to operate but I am simply asking him to recognise that that problem will exist.  Perhaps in his reply he will give some indication of how he proposes to deal with it or what kind of provision, if any, he envisages in the regulations that might be made available for tenants.  Would it be possible for tenants in a local area like that to avail of the services of the valuation office of the local housing authority who would be in a similar position and who could offer some advice?  Unless there is some kind of recognition of the plight of potential tenants, either through the mechanism of free legal aid or through the availability of existing services, there is a danger that the court may fix a higher rent than what would necessarily be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGuinness states that the court makes decisions on the basis of whatever evidence is available and that is quite true.  I would refer her to the Bill which says &ldquo;having regard to all terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of dwellings of a similar character to the dwellings and in a comparable area.&rdquo; In relation to the point raised by Senator Quinn, I accept the point that it is very likely that you would have a situation where landlords would bring along auctioneers and people to the court to try to increase the value of the rent.  It is specifically stated in the Bill as well that this course would be open to the tenant and the court could determine it was reasonable that the landlord be obliged to pay the expenses.  This section is as far as we can go in protecting the tenant.</P>

      <P>Second Stage debate rightly identified this as essentially the nub of the problem that will likely occur to some of the tenants.  I accept some of the points made by Senator Whitaker and by the Minister in his reply to Second Stage.  We are not talking about the majority of landlords or the majority of tenants.  We are talking about a specific potential category of people whose number is indeterminate and whose vulnerability will range quite considerably depending on what market forces operate, depending on what time they go to court and depending also in all honesty on how anxious the landlord is to extract or to obtain from the court his full commercial rights.  There is nothing to prevent a landlord from reaching an agreement below what he or she would reckon is the market value of the property and what he or she would obtain from the court if they went to court.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question that was raised by the Minister of something being outrageously unconstitutional, I should clarify my point.  I think this House can interpret the entire body of the Constitution and honestly and sincerely put forward something which this House and the other House of the Oireachtas and the Government of the day may consider to be constitutional.  The fact that they suspect that this present, rather conservative membership of the Supreme Court will give it another interpretation is not necessarily acting outside the provisions of Article 15.  I am trying slowly but surely to come back on board the legal ship of good government and it is in that context and in that spirit I am making my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> The problem in section 9 is that for some people, not for all, they will not be able to pay even 40 per cent of the rent that will be fixed by the court after the due processes in section 9 and the previous sections have been completed.  The Minister has given on behalf of the Government, in this House and in the other House, very clear explicit commitments and I say without reservation that I accept fully the sincerity of those commitments. I have no reason to doubt them whatsoever. What concerns me frankly is the method and the manner in which those commitments will be made.  The Minister of State referred to the proposal I made on Second Stage specifying a category of tenant, the elderly, the single, the widowed, someone getting a pension, on fixed income and so on and so forth and giving them special treatment.  I think the Minister's reply was that it was not relevant to this Bill and, therefore, it could not as such be brought in.  I think it is relevant to this Bill.  In fact, had this amendment seen the light of day a little bit earlier, in some shape or form it could have been so incorporated by a willing Government to a willing Oireachtas.  I say so because it is the local housing authority who will have responsibility for administering this Bill when it becomes law.  The registration of the agreement, the inspection, the holding of the register and all the other things will be the responsibility of the housing authority in the area in which the dwelling or dwellings are located.  I think it is fair to say that there is a consensus of concern to ensure that in the case of a tenant who through no fault of his own is unable to pay the market value of the property he has occupied for many years he should not be made homeless.  We have of course suspended the normal forces of the free market for that category of person if he goes on to a local authority housing list.  In many areas of our society we have suspended the normal forces of the free market in relation to health and education and in relation to access to justice.</P>
    <P>There is that consensus in the House. I appeal to that consensus and to the Minister's own clear commitment in this area to consider the method that is <Col N="1643" /> implicit in this proposal, which is out of order, but which nevertheless I think will enable him at some stage, perhaps on Report Stage, to put some flesh on the commitment of the Government in relation to the way they propose to meet the crisis situation which may arise when some tenants cannot pay their rents.  What I am now discussing is the manner in which the commitment will be made. That commitment is not in doubt but its manner of implementation is up for discussion. The Minister gave the impression in his opening speech on Second Stage that the social welfare supplementary allowance system in a generalised way would be the method to ensure that where a tenant is caught in the circumstances of having to pay rent in excess of his income he would not be made homeless.</P>
    <P>I have done some research on this and I find that the situation in Dublin city would be as follows should such a system be invoked.  Take, for example, a social welfare recipient &mdash; a non-contributory pensioner or a widow getting £27.75p.  If he goes for a supplementary welfare allowance, for a rent allowance, his rent will be paid but his net income will be reduced to £18.55p and the balance of the money from the social welfare cheque, plus whatever money the community welfare officer decides to allocate, will be paid towards the rent.  I am not very familiar with operations in this area but the practice apparently is that a maximum rent allowance of £5 will be made available.  This is set out in the guidelines and it is administered through the health boards.</P>
    <P>For any rent requirement in excess of £5, a separate individual application will have to be made to the Minister for Social Welfare and that would daunt the most fearless person.  Let us be quite clear, the speed with which the Department of Social Welfare move is something which we all wish to see improved.  Quite frankly, overloading it with another range of problems on 25 April or 26 April is not going to hurry up the process of improvement there.  There will be some form of delay.  Therefore, there will be a <Col N="1644" /> certain degree of worry and a certain degree of concern and the landlord may find that that person is in arrears of rent very quickly.  It is the view of the Labour Party that the supplementary welfare system in its present form, or even in an amended form, is not the right method to deal with this particular problem for the reasons I have put forward and also because it is the only area effectively in which the community welfare officers would have to get involved.  It is the only area of housing in which they are involved.  There is a multiplication of public service involvement in the area of housing administration which I believe is both inefficient and counter-productive.</P>
    <P>The Bill in at least four sections makes specific references to the local housing authority as the body on which responsibility would be conferred by the Minister in relation to administration of other sections of this Bill.  I can readily understand why the Minister and the Custom House want to have nothing to do with the problems of rent and of payment but it is not a sufficient defence to say that it is not really relevant to the provisions of this Bill.  I believe that this option is one that has been thought about in the Department of the Environment because it is a sensible option.  There are many reasonable and good administrative procedures as to why it should be so and I will try to argue some of them in the House.  I am specifically talking about those tenants who are going to be in need of assistance and certainly not the kind of person who undoubtedly exists and who has exploited a legal situation to his benefit. I do not think these people should be assisted further.  I envisage a situation where the process of law takes place and where the court fixes the rent on the basis that we have just agreed to in section 6. That person would then be advised by the court that if he is not in a position to pay this rent he should go to the local housing authority immediately.  In the Dublin area that person would go to Jervis Street which is geared to dealing with rents, and inspections and so on.  The housing authority would send out an inspector and look at the accommodation of that person, for example, two rooms <Col N="1645" /> built 60 or 70 years ago or whatever, and assess what the rent would be relative to the person's income.  This is happening every day in Dublin Corporation and other local authorities are in a similar position.  The administration is there, the expertise is there and also the expertise to deal with people who get into rent arrears, who have problems in collecting rent and the security problems of collecting cash and so on.  It is also under the responsibility of the Minister's Department but the Department are trying to say somehow or other the method of bailing out people in this instance is not relevant.</P>
    <P>If they were to maintain that analogy, an old age pensioner would be assessed as a differential tenant and would pay rent similar to what an old age pensioner would pay in a local authority-owned property of a similar type and age with similar facilities.  The differential rent system, as the Minister well knows, means that a rate is struck for each new dwelling as it is being built and it is subsequently adjusted.  The base rent is established at the outset.  That could be done instead of that person getting poor law relief, charity or social welfare to which there would be some resistance in some cases.  Many of the people I am referring to would be people who might not be old age pensioners but who could very well have a fixed income from capital savings which debarred them from getting a pension until such time as they had exhausted their capital savings.  It would remove what unfortunately exists at present, some of the stigma of getting this kind of assistance.  They pay in their nearest rent office or, alternatively, the rent officer will come and collect as in the case at the moment.  Dublin Corporation have such people on the road every week of every month.  That takes care of one side of the equation.</P>
    <P>The other side of the equation relates to the landlord.  The landlord would be legally granted a rent subject to whatever discount remained in relation to improvements and so on but there would be a net rent due to that landlord in the first year which would be 15 per cent higher in the second year and so on over the five years. <Col N="1646" /> The local authority would pay that landlord the rent directly.  In some cases if the landlord owned a house in which there were five or six separate tenancies it would be a combined rent cheque paid with a certain implicit degree of administrative saving.  Let us not forget that we are talking about tenancies which by their very definition are not going to be short-term leases so there is going to be a fixed drawing cheque, something which could be set up on a computer programme and which would not have to be altered frequently. Rent reviews are every five years.  It would have to be changed every year for the first five years and after that once every five years if the rent was changed and so on.  There is potential administrative neatness and tidiness in such organisation.  The local authority would have the cash flow of the tenant's money coming in and the money going out to the landlord on the other side.  That is the problem, because the balance of the money going out the other side has got to come out of the Estimate of the Department of the Environment. The Minister and his officials and everybody within a mile of the Custom House have said that this kind of rent collection system is not relevant to the legislation. Perhaps I am being somewhat flippant and I do not wish to be, but I feel that it is immensely relevant to the entire legislation because it closes the gap in relation to all the other provisions.</P>
    <P>The one fear that is shared by every Member of this House is that people who are unable to pay their rent and who have no alternative accommodation will somehow or other be made homeless through no fault of their own.  There is nobody in this House who wants to see that happen. The Government recognise that and have clearly given a commitment that if there is any possibility it might happen they will make sure that steps will be taken to ensure that it does not.  In my Second Stage submission I think I convinced a number of people that it is going to happen to some people and that the number could vary.  I do not think that anybody in this House has any doubt that it will happen to some and that the Government have a commitment to ensure that these <Col N="1647" /> people will not be left homeless.  The Minister referred to the social welfare provisions as being the code under which the rescue operation would be undertaken. I submit to the Minister that the Government have not yet finalised precisely how that social welfare system is going to function and that when they begin to analyse its application they will find that the Department are not willing to so operate it and, secondly, there are overlaps and bureaucratic duplications which have a cost implication which we do not need and which would be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>That really is the nub of the submission which is made in this proposal which I fully accept is technically out of order because it will involve expenditure on the legislation.  I accept that but the Minister should seriously consider the proposal.  It has been discussed by members of the Labour Party.  We feel that subject to somebody coming up with a better proposal, it is the most effective way of dealing with the problem which will undoubtedly arise.  With this law about to be enacted we need some clear, hard-edged commitment to those people who are currently tenants. They should not be left wondering, as they have been for the past year, what is going to happen to them, what is going to be the outcome of, firstly, the Supreme Court decision, secondly, the temporary legislation which effectively froze it and thirdly, the system under which they will get assistance in the event of their not being able to pay their rent.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of human anguish out there for many people and I have directly encountered it.  If there was sincerity and passion in my contribution yesterday it was something I was communicating to this House because it had been communicated very clearly to me.  It is the topic of conversation of many people, particularly elderly people when they meet socially in the areas in which they live.  The Government should design a system to ensure that these people do not become homeless.  The Labour Party believe that this is the system.  We accept that it will cost money but the State has <Col N="1648" /> not made provision for them.  The final advantage is that if you wish to devise through the budget and the Finance Bill 1982 a system that can equitably and within the law properly tax unearned income of those landlords who are not dependent on it as their sole source of income, then you have a very clear cut record of the way the money was paid in the first place.  There is no gap in the transaction between the tenant and the landlord.  It is clearly on record from the local authority to the recipient landlord, the amount and the date, and the possibility of evasion, which every Minister for Finance refers to at some stage in the two-hour budget speech, simply is not there.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a requirement in some of these sections whereby the landlord is obliged to do certain things and if the landlord does not do these things he will be in breach of this law.  The process of policing it, as we know, is pretty limited at the moment but the landlord will have a far more healthy regard for the monthly source of the cheque than for this legislation when it becomes law.  Because implicit in that situation will be the recognition by the landlord that the monthly source of the cheque is the local housing authority which simultaneously under another section is also responsible for policing various sections of the legislation.</P>
    <P>That is the serious and considered submission which we are putting forward.  At some stage in the process of this legislation, if that is possible, we would like a clear commitment from the Government that people will not be made homeless.</P>

      <P>With regard to the rebates in this section, the section lays down a certain percentage for each year and the years are specified.  It is not a question of the specified rebates operating for five years beginning on the date of decision by the court.  In the course of my submissions on an earlier amendment, I suggested to the Minister that it might take a considerable length of time before applications to the court were heard, and when I say considerable time I have experience of other areas where <Col N="1649" /> there can be a delay of anything up to three years before an action is finally disposed of.  In this situation because of the very large number of applications there are likely to be, if an application was not reached for perhaps two years what would the situation be in regard to a rebate for the time that has already elapsed?  The reference is not to a rebate for each year beginning from the date of the adjudication by the court but for specific years.  This may give rise to some very unusual circumstances and could mean that arrears of one kind or another might be involved.</P>
      <P>Arising on an earlier amendment I suggested that some regard should be had to the circumstances of the landlord and tenant in arriving at a rent, but the Minister was unable to accept that.  Nevertheless, in this section the circumstances of the landlord can be taken into consideration when deciding what the rent should be or what the rebate should be on the rent.  We have the curious situation in this Bill that the economic circumstances of the tenant may not in any circumstances be considered but the economic circumstances of the landlord may. It seems that to that extent it is a discriminatory Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the very clear and detailed submissions made by Senator Quinn as to why there is a need for the facility in certain cases to bring some tenants in under the differential rent scheme.  The case is strengthened by the discussion we had on section 6 when it was clear that there is not any feeling as to the rent which the court may be obliged on the basis of the evidence offered to it to fix.  We are faced as legislators with the bleak situation that we have vulnerable tenants who are in many circumstances old, on fixed low incomes in rent-controlled premises which have become very valuable because of their location in a very scarce market, where private rented accommodation is at a premium. I am thinking particularly of parts of Dublin that I know and I am sure the same is true of other cities.  As legislators we have a responsibility to identify this <Col N="1650" /> problem and within the limits and constraints of the Constitution try to meet it. As the Bill stands at the moment we are failing at two ends.  We are failing to import a mechanism, and here I support the type of mechanism that Senator O'Leary mentioned which is compatible with the Constitution.  Why should it be impossible to devise an objective criterion for fixing the maximum rent proportionate to the value of the property itself, when it is not in conflict with the Constitution or with property rights?  In various ways through planning controls we control the value of people's property.  Similarly, I see no constitutional objection as such to a reasonable return in the rent which the landlord will get for his property but I do not approve of an open-ended situation where we know the demand is very strong particularly for private rented accommodation which is centrally located.  Even if the court is required under section 2 or 6 to look at other properties the same would apply. The demand for them and the potential market value will also be high and will therefore be inflated by these factors but it would appear that the court would have to abide by the market value.  In the absence of that kind of control it is at least reasonable to expect that a number of tenants will not be greatly assisted by this provision for rebate.  The provision itself is very good.  There will be rebates over a five-year period so that there would be an easing into the market rent, but it is of no use at all to a tenant who cannot stretch even perhaps to the first step in the rebate system.  In such a case the market value and therefore rent fixed by the court on the application of the landlord is by a quantum factor totally out of the reasonable reach of such tenants and it would be impossible for them to stay there unless they were aided or assisted in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn had reservations about trying to meet this problem through the supplementary social welfare system making a contribution towards the rent. In some cases the rent support will have to be quite significant once the market value has been fixed for the property.  It is unlikely that that will work through the <Col N="1651" /> system for one of the reasons given by Senator Quinn, that a payment of more than £5 per week would require a special application and a special reference of the system.  If the amount is £20 per week, that becomes a destabilising factor in the system itself in that through the social welfare system certain people are getting considerable assistance in their rent, more perhaps than they are getting in their allowance under the social welfare system, or almost as much again as in their allowance.  There would be pressure on those people to move out of the rented accommodation and to go on the corporation housing list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had more or less concluded my submission in support of the proposal put forward by Senator Quinn in the form of the amendment which has been ruled out on the grounds that it would involve expenditure.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn proposed that where the tenant would not be able to pay the rent fixed and would not really benefit from the rebate system under this section because the rent itself would be out of reach even with the benefit of the rebate, it should be possible to bring the tenant within the differential rent scheme.  He has put the case for this very strongly and cogently.  He, emphasised &mdash; and I agree with him here &mdash; that it is appropriate that it would be the housing authority who would decide to allow a tenant to benefit from the rent differential and then administer the scheme, so that that would be the appropriate mechanism for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more one looks at the provisions of the Bill the more concerned one must be at the lack of financial protection for tenants.  In saying that, I and others who <Col N="1652" /> have been making submissions on these points have been emphasising the position of vulnerable tenants on low incomes who have been in rent-controlled premises for a long time and who would not be able to pay a significantly increased rent.  There are, of course, other people who have exploited the system effectively as tenants who could have afforded a higher rent, and have benefited from the control of the rent.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to strike a balance but it fails to ensure that there is, first of all, a ceiling on the maximum rent which the court would fix under section 6.  Partly as a result of that, the system of rebates provided for in section 9 will not be sufficient protection for tenants.  I share the view expressed by Senator Quinn that the proposal which the Minister suggested in his opening speech, that such tenants might be assisted through supplementary welfare and thereby their rents might be partly paid, is not going to work as effectively as a system of differential rent and that it would create considerable anomalies and difficulties in the system itself.  It would potentially put great pressure on individual tenants.  They would be under pressure if their community welfare officer was not particularly sympathetic to them, or thought that the amount in supplement of the rent was very large for a person living in that area and that they should move to another area, go on the housing list, be transferred to an old people's home and so on.</P>
    <P>We need to be very clear, as legislators, about what our priorities are. We are committed to ensuring that we have protected and secured the position of vulnerable tenants who have been in rent-controlled premises, who have being made secure under the rent control Acts which have now been struck down by the Supreme Court and who must be given a similar security and a knowledge that they are in a secure position by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel very constrained and unhappy that it has not been possible to give this Bill the time, consideration and openness to amendments that one would like. I hope that on this very important issue <Col N="1653" />&mdash; as Senator Quinn said it is the kernel of the effect of the Bill &mdash; the Minister can give a definite assurance that a mechanism such as is contained in this amendment could be adopted by the Government. It is extremely important that a significant number of people who are extremely apprehensive at the moment be reassured about their position.  It is very important that we, as legislators, having identified the nature of the problem &mdash; that clearly has been done in this debate &mdash; ensure that the Bill passed, even in the urgent time-scale which is required, does cover satisfactorily the particular problem and provide protection for vulnerable tenants in the circumstances. I hope that the Minister will be able to give a very definite assurance on this and that he will accept the merits of the scheme proposed by Senator Quinn, which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Robinson about the time restriction in regard to this legislation.  Because of a court decision and because of the extremely restrictive Constitution within which we are trying to initiate legislation it is very difficult to make a substantial input into legislation by way of amendment. The constitutional problems which have arisen in other debates in this House indicate how urgently our Constitution needs to be reviewed.  Crusade or no crusade, obviously we have many problems in which the common good is not always protected, in spite of what the Constitution might piously say about it. Senator Quinn's amendment which has been ruled out of order sets down views with which many agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have not yet specified which agency should deal with the matter of rebates or with the area of assistance when the inability of existing tenants to pay is determined.  It is the feeling of most Senators that the proper agency to deal with that matter would be the Department of the Environment who are competent, structured, staffed and partly financed to deal with the whole question of rent, whether income-related or otherwise. I have concern for sections of the community living in rented type accommodation <Col N="1654" /> who are not social welfare recipients, who are on fixed or quite low incomes, who would be subjected to quite a lot of stress from landlords under this necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Department of Social Welfare might deal with this area simply because that Department in carrying out an existing odious means test go into a whole lot of areas involving private lives, for a whole lot of reasons which are obnoxious to many on this side of the House.  We would not accept that that Department should use their energy in this way in regard to legislation that we might pass here.  We are now voicing the opinion that it should certainly not be the concern of the Department of Social Welfare but of the Department of the Environment, who are the statutory body already set up in this field.  Could the Minister of State give us an assurance that our views will be put to the Government, to indicate how the Seanad feels that the matter at ground level should be dealt with when these anomalies arise and when rents start going up as a result of this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it surprising that this section has given rise to the greatest concern among tenants.  One must bear in mind the background to a section of the 1960 Act which was declared unconstitutional in relation to what was regarded as fair rent.  Under this section a landlord can apply to the court to determine a fair rent.  The section says that in the interests of the tenant it will be five years before that fair rent is paid &mdash; 40 per cent in the first year, phased 15 per cent each year and at the end of the fifth year the maximum rent which was determined by the court five years earlier will be paid.  That is to ensure that it will not create a great hardship for the tenants involved and will ease their burden.  Can one imagine the owner of rented property foregoing payment of a rent regarded by the court as a fair rent, in the interests of the tenant? This is what the section is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a few points raised which I want to comment on.  I did not say, as Senators Robinson and Quinn thought, that the new scheme of aid towards tenants <Col N="1655" /> in difficulty would be operated under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  What I did say &mdash; and I sincerely hope this is what came across &mdash; is that the scheme that operated up to now under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was the only assistance provided for tenants who were in difficulty or on low incomes.  It is very difficult when I am pressed so hard, to give a clear-cut commitment on the assistance which will be available to those tenants who are in difficulty after 25 April 1982. I am not saying that this will be under the Department of Social Welfare.  There will be a new scheme.  I am repeating my own firm commitment and that of the Government that there will be assistance for those people who are in difficulty or on low incomes and who find themselves in financial difficulty as a result of the increase in rents.</P>
    <P>An important point has been made by Senator Ferris, that under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme assistance was confined to social welfare recipients. I want to give a commitment to the Seanad at this stage that the scheme which will operate will go outside the area of social welfare recipients, that it will not be confined to that category of persons, but that it will extend to people on an income, who are not in receipt of any social welfare benefit, but who can prove that there is hardship, or difficulty for them in meeting the demands made by the increase in rent.</P>
    <P>I had discussions earlier with Senator Quinn and I have noted points made by him.  If I saw any merit in it, I would, before the new scheme is announced, make a submission to the Government regarding provision of aid under a differential rent system.  There is no way that you can operate such a system under a local authority unless they are owners of the property concerned.  A differential rent system operates in council houses and the only other way in which this could operate &mdash; and this is included in this section &mdash; would be if the local authorities were in a position to buy the rented accommodation.  This is something which I do not envisage, I could not give any <Col N="1656" /> commitment to the Seanad here today because the costs would be astronomical.</P>
    <P>There was a case made here by Senator Ryan, which I mention briefly in relation to section 9.  This section has the effect of providing an important subsidy for tenants in the initial years of new tenancies. It is possible that this provision is open to constitutional challenge.  However, the right of a landlord to apply for a reduction in the rebate where the circumstances so warrant greatly strengthens this section. In order to limit the extent of speculative gains to landlords, this right is restricted to landlords who owned the property before December 1960.  That is very relevant. With effect from that date, rent control was put on a permanent footing. Accordingly, any landlord who bought a controlled dwelling subsequently did so in the knowledge that his return would be limited by the control on rent.  He would, of course, have bought the property at a price well below its true value since it was a controlled property.  The level of rebate is tied to particular years rather than to the date of the tenancy agreement, to limit somewhat the benefits to tenants of delaying proceedings.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to provide assistance to those tenants who are in difficulties and I can see this need arising in a number of cases.  It is also very important, where State funds are being used to subsidise people who are in difficulty, to try to make sure, as far as possible, that some of that money does not go into the hands of landlords, also that by creating a system of subsidy for those people it would not have the effect of increasing the rent and that the subsidy would be directed towards those who are in need.  I am sorry that I cannot go beyond the commitment that I made, or give specific terms.  It would be very difficult for me to say at this stage, even if I had a free hand and had authority from the Government to say it, what kind of scheme would be introduced.  It will require detailed examination and will not arise untill 25 April 1982, when the new Bill comes into effect.  I can give an assurance that the scheme of assistance will be announced well in advance of that date.  Beyond that I cannot go.</P>

However, it would be useful if the Minister would, for example, give to the House his views on the administration of whatever rescue system is decided upon by the Government.

The section, as the House is aware, relates to the question of possession of dwellings.  Paragraph (d) (iii) worries me slightly.

      <P>Let me give an example then of how it might possibly be put to mal-use.  There is a situation at the moment in Dublin where young couples with young children are simply barred from being offered accommodation by landlords in certain properties.  They will not accept married couples.  In fact, they will not accept couples of any kind and certainly will not accept couples with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not accept children. The landlord could say to a household of a family with a young child, or perhaps a difficult or elderly person who objects to rock music or whatever, that it was &ldquo;in the interests of good estate management',' to quote a phrase, that the landlord get vacant possession of that dwelling in the house, so that the entire house could be let to students who could annoy each other with their own respective noise and rock music.  It is that kind of open-ended phrase that would worry me.  The effect of it would be that someone who had security of tenure could be dislodged.  The only compensation for which they would be eligible would be as set out in the last portion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the landlord pays such a sum as the Court considers reasonable to meet the <Col N="1659" /> expenses incurred by the tenant in quitting the dwelling, together with a sum not exceeding two years' rent of alternative accommodation which is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the tenant....</P>
    <P>I am pressing the point to emphasise how necessary the fair rent tribunal is and how necessary it is to put a proper corral around what this legislation really is doing.  My fear is that it is conceivable that, in the interests of good estate management, it would be preferable to have a particular category of people, or to remove a particular type of tenant who, it was alleged, was causing problems.  Is that the meaning that the court may take from that phrase?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on what the court would interpret to be in the interests of good estate management.  It was included in the Rent Restrictions Act and there was no reason to delete it. There could be many instances of what would be regarded as in the interests of good estate management, but they will not come to my mind.  The court would determine, within reason, what was in the interests of good estate management. It was something that was considered as a safeguard.</P>

      <P>I am agreeing with the section because this is a very good measure and it will apply to all dwellings let for rent, not just the dwellings covered in the main by this legislation in the form of rent controlled premises.  It is long due to <Col N="1660" /> have a proper system of registration, which would be enforced and obligatory on all landlords.  I very much welcome it. Perhaps the Minister has given some indication of the possible content of the regulations regarding the details which the landlord will have to supply on registration. The first issue on which I would like some clarification is the identity of the landlord.  We have a problem of unidentifiable landlords, even if you can identify the name of some obscure company or properties.  It would be important to try to ensure that the register will be related as closely as possible to the real identity of the real landlord and would try to penetrate any corporate veil or series of corporate veils that might be put up in that regard.</P>
      <P>The question of the rent book has already been mentioned and the capacity that the Minister has here for making regulations should be used to ensure that there is much more knowledge of the properties that are rented in private rented accommodation and their rents &mdash; this would, obviously, have a bearing on the tax revenue of the State as well &mdash; and to ensure accessibility of that register to members of the public.  I would be grateful if the Minister would comment generally on this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Robinson that this is a very important section of the Bill.  It is one of the most important sections because one of its aspects is that, before an increase in rent is obtained, the landlord would have to be registered.  The name and address of the landlord and of the tenant and the rent agreed is necessary for registration. This is a fair control over the landlord and a fair effort to control the number of rented dwellings.  Senator Robinson mentioned tax.  There would be a proper record and a proper register of those landlords and of their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in fact, has quite considerable discretion under this section in drafting the regulations.  Section 13 (5) gives him <i>carte blanche</i> to decide the format of the register.  I am <Col N="1661" /> assuming, first of all, that is the meaning of subsection (5):</P>
      <P>Regulations under this section may contain such provisions as the Minister considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of this section.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister some specific experience that we have had in areas where this kind of property exists, so that he could consider it and, indeed, if I may take the liberty, I will be in contact with him in the New Year, when the regulations are being drawn up.  It has been the frequent experience of tenants that they have not the slightest idea who their landlord is, particularly tenants of property covered by this section and that the property changes hands from time to time. The only person they deal with is the agent.  The agents usually are extraordinarily efficient in collecting the rent, extraordinarily knowledgeable about how much is due and extremely diligent on being there punctually each Friday, immediately after pay day.  They assume an extraordinary complementary vagueness, lack of knowledge and great lack of energy and diligence when it comes to things like having repairs done or providing the name of the landlord or offering information in relation to anything that might be to the tenants' benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great difficulties have been experienced by some tenants, not all, in trying to establish who their landlord is. That is a problem experienced by residents' Association who as a local comically to the Belgrave Residents' Association, the Leinster Road Residents' Association and the Beechwood Residents' Association who, as a local community are concerned with the environment in their neighbourhood.  They have a problem where the external maintenance and upkeep of a landlord-owned property deteriorates considerably. There are regulations that Dublin Corporation have drafted which every landlord is supposed to observe and which regulate such things as provision of dustbins, the cutting of the grass in the front garden, the storage facility area in the front garden for dustbins.  If these <Col N="1662" /> regulations are not observed, chaos reigns.</P>
    <P>To add to a lot of people's problems, Dublin Corporation, in some parts of the city, collect refuse on a Friday and what happens is that people who live in flats put out their black plastic bags on a Friday morning on their way to work, go to work, head off down the country if that is where they come from, or go to see friends and the remains of the bags, if the cats have left anything, are left scattered around, or bins are left out on the footpath, if they have bins; they do not come back until Sunday night.  That is the responsibility, in part, of the landlord. Any public representative in the Dublin area &mdash; certainly Senator Robinson would support this contention &mdash; will know that when those associations which have a concern for the overall appearance of the neighbourhood and who have done good community work have attempted to find out who the landlord of the property in question is and have approached the tenants they simply cannot establish who the landlord is. The obligations of the landlord are not enforced because they cannot get to the person who is responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has exclusive discretion in relation to the drafting of these regulations. That kind of information for that purpose alone is essential.  Finally, the Minister may be able to get legal advice on this point.  If a company owns a property &mdash;I am using the planning laws as precedent &mdash; then the legal action will be the company v the tenant and the court will register that agreement and it will, in turn, be registered under this provision with the local authority.  The tenant could be for example, Oireachtas Holdings Limited, owners of Leinster House, let out to 168 tenants in one house and 60 tenants in the other on a five year lease, or perhaps even a shorter lease.</P>

      <P>The reason why the Minister cannot is that nobody knows who Oireachtas Holdings is and this is my point.  The Oireachtas Holdings will be the registered landlords.  Under the planning law, if Oireachtas Holdings looked for planning permission for an extension to provide such adequate accommodation and appointed the Board of Works architects and the chief architect was nominated, there would be a named agent.  That named agent would be the person to whom information would be communicated and so on.  But that named agent would not necessarily be the person responsible for fulfilling the obligations of the landlord.  I would suggest that that loophole, which I foresee if this thing is not done very carefully and done with the clear knowledge of the problems that have existed in certain areas, is not closed.  If I can presume to advise the Department of the Environment, they should seek an opinion from Dublin Corporation on this and from the larger local authorities in Cork, Limerick and Galway where this is a substantial problem, as to how one would identify some physical person, some named body who can be made responsible for the operations of Oireachtas Holdings or for the landlord or the company or the trust that owns the property in question.</P>

      <P>Having been for many years a member of a local authority I welcome this section.  I understood the frustrations of those who lived in rented accommodation in regard to the identity of those from whom they had rented property.  They were dealing very often with estate agents on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis.  I welcome the section also because the existence of the register will increase greatly the prospects of success of the Revenue Commissioners in pursuing those who are in <Col N="1664" /> receipt of incomes from rented accommodation to get them to pay their fair share of tax.  For that reason this registration will have the further beneficial effect &mdash;the Government are to be commended on the way it is framed because showing the amount of the rent and to whom the rent is payable will make that a precondition for taking any action under the Act &mdash; of increasing substantially the revenue which will be made available to the Revenue Commissioners as a result of the discovery of rented accommodation which previously had not come to their notice.  The increased rents which will arise as a result of the earlier provision will go some way towards reducing the increased burden on the public purse, will result from the subsidies which the Minister has indicated will, one way or the other, be made in due course.  I particularly welcome this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two further comments.  One of them arises from Senator Quinn's contribution.  He referred to the transfer of property from one landlord to another.  It would be important to ensure that the registration be kept very much up to date.  This, presumably, would be something the Minister could deal with in his regulations, including a requirement that on the transfer of property the new landlord will be put on the register.  This should be enforced so that it would not be possible for a subsequent landlord to use the fact that the premises had been registered in the past under a previous landlord to make an application where it was a tenancy which came under the other provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the important things about this section is that it extends to all private rented accommodation; it is a requirement on all landlords to register.  Clearly the inducement to register is much stronger for landlords in formerly controlled premises because they cannot operate the system: they cannot apply for increased rent unless they have registered. I wonder whether the Minister has considered the possibility of extending some of that inducement to general tenancies, even under the terms of this <Col N="1665" /> Bill so that, for example, proceedings in relation to notices to quit or evicting tenants or recovery of rent could not be brought unless a landlord had registered. This could be incorporated in this provision pending the possibility of further and broader legislation covering private rented accommodation.  I feel &mdash; and I think this is borne out by experience &mdash; that the sanctions, even though the maximum is a fine of £500, are not really as effective as the requirement that a landlord, before he can seek remedies under legislation, must be registered.  That is the effective sanction.  That is where one will get the registration.  In regard to the possibility of a housing authority being able to enforce registration &mdash; we have seen the corporation's by-laws &mdash; it is very difficult unless there is an inducement, almost a compulsion, to register; it is very hard to get a high rate of registration. So I wonder if the Minister has considered the matter and, if not, if he would be open to considering the extension of it.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the last point first.  The power referred to in the section refers to all tenancies.  Initially it will only apply to the controlled dwellings. The fact that there is registration covers the point made by Senator Quinn. While it gives the Minister great powers I would like to inform the House that it is the local authorities who will be responsible for administering the regulations. There is mention already of £500.  I think the case made in relation to the problem of the tenants dealing with an agent, dealing with some kind of syndicate, or not knowing the landlord, cannot apply now because the register which is being compiled is under the control of the local authorities and is open to inspection by the public; it can be regarded as a public register.  Therefore the tenant will have access to information in relation to the landlord that he did not have heretofore. That would meet the point made in relation to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify one or two points.  I fully accept that the individual authority would be responsible <Col N="1666" /> for the administration of the register. Will they also be responsible for its design, for deciding what it should contain?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments were, in the context of framing the format of the register. I accept fully that it will be administered at local level.  But in the nature of the sections that need to be completed by both tenant and landlord I think there is a careful input of design to be provided by the Department.  That really was the point of the submission I was making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am on my feet, let me make a more general point.  I am assuming from what the Minister just said that initially this obligatory register would only apply nationwide to those properties which were affected by this legislation but that eventually at a future date, the overall landlord and tenant legislation which is necessary and has been promised and on which the Law Reform Commission have been working in regard to some portions at least, will cover all properties.</P>
      <P>I would just make one general economic point.  The uncontrolled private rented dwelling sector of the housing market suffers little or no State interference of any kind.  There is no price control mechanism whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has, for the last number of years, if not decades, been a real surplus of demand over supply leading at some stages to virtual scarity.  The failure of that totally uncontrolled, totally unrestricted, open private market system to respond to that constant demand is a very worrying thing because if the normal laws of supply and demand, which many economists quote as being more or less a matter of faith than fact, do not operate and do not even lower the price but reduce the scarcity in a climate where there is little or no legal or administrative prohibitions on their administration, I would have some worries that if the Government were to proceed with this, which <Col N="1667" /> interferes on the demand side by discouraging some landlords to stay in the private market sector, unless there are very positive complementary actions taken by the Government on the supply side, there will be an exacerbated problem of supply in the short term.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have been somewhat long-winded and verbose in the way I have stated that and I hope that I have not been too unclear.  But there is the experience of well-intentioned administrations. I refer specifically to the Labour controlled GLC in England which attempted to interfere on behalf of the tenants in the early sixties and interfered entirely on the demand side without intervening simultaneously on the supply side and had the effect, as had the original rent control legislation which we are responding to, of giving those people who were securely housed additional advantages but disrupting the process of the market and disadvantaging people who wished to come on to the market in the future.  In all the technical journals, both on the housing side and on the economic side, this is very well documented.  My fear, quite frankly, is that in a situation where the market has manifestly failed to respond to constant demand, this kind of well intentioned action might cause worse problems.  Perhaps it is an unusual argument for me to make but it is socialists who understand the contradictions of capitalism and can therefore see ahead of the normal liberal well-intentioned but misguided actions of others who do not fully understand the same market system. For the best reasons in the world we could do the right thing today for those people who happen to be tenants, but the mid term and long term effects could be very disastrous.</P>
    <P>The State, in fact, has a major role in this area.  We have to recognise it because there is sufficient evidence in the whole of northern Europe and southern Europe as well that where, for political reasons, the market has been interfered with on behalf of the demand side and the state has refused to take up the logical consequences of that intervention, a bad situation has been aggravated.  There is <Col N="1668" /> implicit in the seeds of this, unless the Government clearly respond positively in the supply side, the potential difficulties which would create a new generation of problems similar to the ones that we are mopping up in relation to the 1995 rent control legislation.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, this section extends to any private rented accommodation or potentially extends.  But the Minister, in his reply, has indicated that it is only intended at the moment to make regulations in relation to the formerly rent-controlled premises.  Is there any impediment to extending in the regulations the obligation to register on all landlords?  As I have already said, the enforcement may not be as complete but is there any barrier to establishing immediately the system of registration?  Why establish a register only for the landlords of rent-controlled premises?  They are more likely to be the ones who will register because if they do not register they cannot avail of the remedies. Why not a general register from the very beginning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are no impediments beyond administrative ones.  It is a matter of setting up the regulations.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Ruairi Quinn, I agree there are problems where demand exceeds the supply. I was rather amazed to hear that point coming from Senator Quinn.  But here is a problem in relation to housing generally and it is not within the scope of this Bill in the strict sense.  There were some inhibitions in relation to the provision of private accommodation of that sort prior to the introduction of this Bill.  I hope that at least it will remove some of the barriers which have been referred to. Prior to the introduction of this Bill landlords were in a position where they could never repossess the houses they had let to tenants and consequently the houses deteriorated rapidly, some to the extent of going out of the market completely.  I hope that the incentive that is provided in the Bill will at least give some new hope in that direction.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete subsection (5), lines 35 to 38.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a tentative blow for local autonomy and local democracy.  It is in line with the comments I made at the end of my speech on Second Stage.  It really is simply saying to an overworked Customs House and an overburdened Minister of State and his officials that the regulations in relation to the standards of dwelling required as set out in the opening part of section 14 are best defined by local councillors and local officials in the main initially, with the proviso that those regulations would be approved by the Minister.  I made the point in some substance yesterday in the House and I do not wish to repeat it, but subsection (5) is unnecessary and effectively removes another area of local autonomy in which, in fact, the local authority can be more efficient and more effective than the Department of the Environment at central level.  By all means, retain for the Department, for the Oireachtas, the right of approval of any such scheme, but leave the initiative and, indeed, the responsibility of the drafting of such regulations to the local authority in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why regulations are to replace by-laws is to ensure that proper standards apply in all local authority areas.  Former by-laws which will continue to operate until the new regulations are made are based on model by-laws circulated by the Department rather than on standards devised by individual housing authorities.  Notwithstanding that the model by-laws were circulated to local authorities more than eight years ago, at a recent date there still remain 34 out of 87 housing authorities who have not yet made by-laws which, I feel sure Senator Quinn will agree, is far from satisfactory.  While under the Bill regulations will be made by the Minister, <Col N="1670" /> all aspects of their administration, enforcements, inspections and so on, will continue to rest with the local authorities as heretofore.  If by-laws operated side by side with the regulations, two systems would prevail in individual local authority areas.  I cannot accept a situation of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put forward a convincing argument as to why this provision should stand.  Of all of the local authorities who have not submitted by-laws within the eight year period, I wonder how many of the public members on those local authorities are actually aware that they are required to draft such by-laws.  I wonder how many of them have been informed by their county manager or by their town clerk that they have the opportunity or the power to draft such by-laws.  If there is a consensus at all in local politics, it centres around the question of housing.  I am quite positive that the lack of response from local authorities may very well be &mdash; and I am speculating &mdash; as much related to the desire for a comfortable bureaucratic life as to lack of interest from local authority members.  I am assuming that the making of such by-laws, subject to the approval of the Minister, is the reserved function of the councillors or related to such.  This is nearly 1982; managers are very wary of informing local authority councillors what their reserve functions are.  The Minister, as a member of a local authority, and indeed every other member of a local authority, will accept that.  To inform anybody of what their full powers are is not the natural vein.  That might be the reason in this case.  I would be happy to circulate all the Labour councillors around the country in those councils who are not yet informed to ensure that particular lapse will be covered.  Even so, the idea of a nationalised system, nationwide, centralised, applicable to all, is not something that I like.  Stardardisation is not necessary.  While model draft laws were circulated by the Department, I do recall that in Dublin Corporation we did modify them in some way.  I would like to see even that kind of autonomy.  It is an argument for local autonomy and, for <Col N="1671" /> me, local government is distinct from local administration which is what I believe is the system we have at present.</P>

      <P>The first is that there is no mention at all of fire safety or fire control.  Second there are no standards laid down for electrical wiring in existing buildings despite the fact that most recent fires were the result of faulty wiring.  I know that new buildings have to have a standard certification of wiring to ESB standards but existing dwellings are not covered under the Bill.  I would like a comment from the Minister on this.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) specifies the areas that might be covered by such regulations. It will be noted that no specific reference is made to fire precautions.

      <P>This section establishes that normally the landlord will be liable for the tenant's costs reasonably and necessarily incurred arising out of an application by the landlord to the court.  That is quite fair, particularly as there is a proviso that the court may alter the incidence of costs on consideration of all the circumstances including the means of the landlord and the tenant.  That is the only circumstance specifically mentioned.  On Second Stage I suggested to the Minister <Col N="1672" /> that perhaps it would be a good thing in the public interest to put in specifically an obligation on the court to consider amongst these circumstances the reasonableness or otherwise of the approach of either party in the previous negotiations. If the onus of being reasonable were put on both parties it might help to clear the decks and avoid unnecessary recourse to the courts.</P>

      <P>I understand that.

      <P>The report before the House today is the 18th Report on Developments in the European Communities, which covers activities in the Communities during the first six months of this year.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that reports on developments in the European Communities are required by section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972, which provides that the Government shall make such a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I should like, therefore, to introduce this debate by giving a brief resumé of recent major developments in Community activity.  I shall, of course, be happy to respond to any queries raised by Senators during the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community at present are going through a further process of enlargement. On 1 January of this year Greece became the tenth member state of the Community and negotiations for the accession of Spain and Portugal are proceeding satisfactorily.  Ireland, along with the other member states, welcomed the decision of the democratic Governments of both these countries to apply for membership <Col N="1674" /> of the Community, seeing their application as an element in their return to democracy.  While we appreciate the difficulties for the Community posed by the applications of Spain and Portugal, we are anxious along with our Community colleagues to bring about a speedy and successful conclusion to these negotiations. Moreover, Senators will be aware that the European Council at its most recent meeting adopted conclusions emphasising the Community's determination to bring the accession negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Turning to institutional matters, I am sure that the House is aware of the debate which is currently under way, on ways in which relations between the different Community institutions can be developed and, in particular, ways in which the Parliament could be given an enhanced role in Community affairs. Fresh consideration of these matters was stimulated by the Report on European Institutions presented by the Committee of Three to the European Council of 1 and 2 December 1980.  The Parliament subsequently addressed itself to the matter with a number of recent resolutions and reports.  An aspect of the debate we may expect to hear more of will be the improvement of relations between the European Parliament and national legislative bodies.  All aspects of the matter will be considered fully on the basis of Commission proposals expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The so called &lsquo;Mandate of 30 May 1980&rsquo; has already been referred to in a number of earlier reports to this House and Senators will be aware of the background to that problem.  However since this issue is the main item currently on the Community agenda I should like to just briefly recall the main issues involved.</P>
    <P>The British Government have for some time now insisted that the level of their net contribution to the EEC budget is unacceptable.  In an attempt to meet these concerns, the Foreign Affairs Council on 30 May 1980 agreed to a scheme whereby for the years 1980 and 1981, Britain would be reimbursed a proportion of their contribution through an adapted financial mechanism, together with special measures involving extra <Col N="1675" /> expenditure of EEC funds in the UK.  As part of this agreement, the Community pledged itself to resolve the problem by means of structural changes.  In this context, the Commission was given the task of preparing a report concerning the development of Community policies. This 30 May mandate laid down some very specific limitations for the Commission report.  It was not to call into question the Community's common financial responsibility for the funding of Community policies, nor the basic principles of the common agriculture policy &mdash; namely a unified market based on Community preference and funded from the Community budget.  The purpose of this Commission study was to attempt to prevent the recurrence of unacceptable situations for any member state.  On 24 June 1981, the Commission issued its report and discussion and negotiations among the member states began shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>It would perhaps be useful if I took this opportunity to outline the major elements underlying the Irish approach in these negotiations.  We accepted the acquis of the Community when we joined.  Senators will be aware that we use the word &ldquo;acquis&rdquo; as a code word to describe Community achievements which are accepted by all and no longer negotiable and are embodied in the Treaties and the legislation derived therefrom. Some elements of this acquis operate to our advantage and others operate to our disadvantage.  The decision to join the Community was based on our assessment of the balance of advantages and disadvantages of membership.  Any attempt to undermine the acquis in one area will inevitably upset this balance for member states, with consequent negative effects across the entire range of Community policies.</P>
    <P>We are fully committed to the acquis both as regards the own resources system and as regards the basic principles of the CAP.  The Community's own resources consist of duties collected from the common customs tariff, agricultural levies and that proportion of the VAT receipts of the member states needed to finance <Col N="1676" /> Community policies up to a maximum limit of 1 per cent.  These resources belong to the Community and not to the individual member states.  To discuss the issue in terms of net budgetary gains and losses is misleading and wrong in principle and could reverse the process of European intergration.</P>
    <P>The basic principles of the common agricultural policy are non-negotiable. We will not accept any deviation from these principles.  There has been a lot of criticism recently of the operation of the CAP &mdash; much of it misleading and inaccurate. In the first place, the cost of the CAP is overstated in the Community budget, where such items as food aid etc. are included in the agriculture section, rather than the development co-operation section of the budget.  In the second place, without a common Community agriculture policy, national Governments would incur even greater expenditure in the support of agriculture.  The real cost of the CAP amounts to no more than ½ per cent of the GDP of the Community. Many of the critics of CAP often fail to mention its achievements, both in terms of ensuring an adequate supply of food to the consumer and in terms of its support of farm incomes.  We can, of course, accept the need for prudent management in the operation of the CAP and, in this context, we have agreed in the past to limited measures of co-responsibility on a product by product basis, as the situation has demanded.</P>
    <P>Our main concern must be to ensure that the Community will use this opportunity to move forward, both through the development of new policies in such fields as energy, industry, transport etc. and through the adoption of concrete measures to promote the convergence of the living standards as between the various member states.  The preamble to the Rome Treaty sets out as an objective of the Community, the reduction of the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions.  However, the Community has had little success in the promotion of this objective.  Irish per capita income as a percentage of the Community average continues to decline.  The <Col N="1677" /> recent National Economic and Social Council report highlighted the fact that whereas in 1973 the level of income per head in Ireland as a percentage of the EEC average stood at 65 per cent, by 1979 this had declined to only 61 per cent. Thus the gap in living standards widened, despite the fact that aggregate Irish GDP increased at a faster rate than that of other EEC states during the same period. The National Economic and Social Council concluded rightly that regional policy is &ldquo;an essential complementary measure to the effects of free competition&rdquo; and that without it, &ldquo;economic integration would lead to increased concentration of economic activity in the more industrialised centre&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The present size of the Community budget, amounting as it does to only 2.6 per cent of the national budgets of the member states, cannot make any real impact on the problem of convergence. With the further enlargement of the Community, this problem will become even more acute.  If the Community wishes to move forward at all, there will have to be an increase in the present ceiling of own resources.  In our view, such an increase cannot be long delayed. The alternative is stagnation and retrogression for the Community.</P>
    <P>Recent meetings, notably the London European Council of 26 and 27 November and the recent meeting of Foreign Ministers devoted considerable attention to the issues raised by the 30 May mandate. Although there is now a greater degree of national understanding of the various views of member states and a degree of progress on some points, the really major areas of concern to us in this debate remain unresolved.  These include future arrangements for agriculture, particularly in the milk sector and the so-called problem of net budgetary contributions.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, another meeting of Foreign Ministers on these important issues has been arranged for mid-January.  The Irish position at that meeting will of course continue to be based on the principles I have outlined. There is of course no hiding the fact that in these negotiations the pressure to limit <Col N="1678" /> the Community's agricultural spending still further is very great.  My prime concern therefore, has been and still continues to be to see that no new obstacles are placed in the way of Irish farmers in the endeavour to improve their incomes and productivity.</P>
    <P>On the so-called British budget problem, we shall continue to express our view that the benefits and costs of Community membership cannot be argued in budgetary terms alone and that the Community resources belong to the Community and not to individual member states. Any problem of this kind is therefore essentially political and temporary in character and the solution to it must correspondingly be temporary and political in character.</P>
    <P>On the external front, the severe difficulties facing the international economy continue to affect the Community's external relations.  These difficulties have led to an intensification of the pressures on the Governments of the industrialised world for a reaction along protectionist lines.  It is our view, however, as a small open economy, that the benefits of any such approach would be illusory and would inevitably hinder the effective, operation of the international trading system. We were, therefore, greatly encouraged by the declaration of the Ottawa Summit in July which expressed the determination of the Community and the major industrialised countries to maintain and strengthen the liberal trading system and to resist protectionism.  The Summit also welcomed the decision to convene a ministerial meeting in 1982 under the auspices of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade in order to consider the overall condition of the world trading system.</P>
    <P>Over the past year the Council of Ministers has devoted a great deal of attention to the Community's unhealthy trading balance with Japan.  There are signs that the Community's expression of concern on the matter has elicted a helpful response from the Japanese.  In June, the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Suzuki, visited a number of Community capitals for discussions on all aspects of his country's relations with the Community. <Col N="1679" /> While Ireland was not included in his itinerary, I am pleased to report that the follow-up mission from the Keidanren, the organisation representing the most important Japanese business groupings, visited Dublin in October of this year as part of a European tour.  The delegation was received by the President and the Taoiseach and had talks with Ministers and representatives of industry.</P>
    <P>We regard this mission as having been very important for the further development of relations with Japan.  The delegation had a brief from the Prime Minister to discuss EEC-Japan relations at Government level.  We hope to have impressed its members with the opportunities for increasing the already high level of Japanese investment in this country and with the wide range of Irish products available for export to the Japanese market.</P>
    <P>The Community has continued its discussion with the US administration on a number of bilateral trading problems and on the general trends in the international economy.  On the question of cheap imports of US chemicals and synthetic textiles, Senators will be aware of the welcome given to the administration's decision to decontrol US oil prices.  However, the Community is maintaining pressure for similar action with regard to natural gas.</P>
    <P>The period covered by this report witnessed an important development in the Community's efforts to expand trade with the People's Republic of China.  In the spring of this year the Commission organised an EEC-China business week in Brussels which provided an opportunity for the coming together of a delegation of 100 Chinese officials and up to 700 European businessmen.  We hope that the meetings and discussions held on this occasion will contribute to a greater awareness on both sides of the trading opportunities opened up by the conclusion of the EEC-China trade agreement in 1978.</P>
    <P>On 1 January this year the Second ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé came into effect.  Senators will be aware that this convention governs relations in <Col N="1680" /> trade, aid and other areas of co-operation between the European Community and certain African, Caribbean and Pacific States and is considered a unique instrument of co-operation between developed and developing countries.  The sixtieth nation to join the ACP group was the Republic of Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides which formally acceded to the convention on 18 March 1981.  Zimbabwe is expected to become the sixty-first ACP state after the completion of formal ratification procedures.</P>
    <P>The ACP-EEC Council of Ministers held its sixth meeting in Luxembourg on 9-10 April 1981.  It adopted a number of decisions regarding the implementation of the new Lomé Convention, notable among which were those concerning the delegation of certain powers to the committee of ambassadors, the composition and rules of operation of the committee on industrial co-operation and the establishment of an ACP-EEC committee set up under the convention to study measures for improving financial and technical co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee of the ACP-EEC Consultative Assembly held its tenth meeting in Freetown, Sierre Leone, from 23 to 27 February 1981.  The joint committee is made up of half the membership of the joint consultative assembly and convenes between meetings of the assembly to review developments under the convention.  At the end of its meeting the joint committee adopted a final declaration which referred to global development policy, enlargement of the European Community, ACP, sugar exports, the position of the least developed landlocked and island countries, as well as reviewing the progress achieved under the various types of co-operation covered by the convention.</P>
    <P>On 16 December 1980 the Council of Ministers adopted a completely revised generalised system of preferences for 1981 which will form the basis of the system for the next ten years.  Ceilings and quotas in all sections were increased by 2 per cent to take account of Greek accession to the Community.  In the case of industrial products there were significant <Col N="1681" /> revisions in the scheme to ensure that the major benefits are accorded to the least developed countries.  The 1981 list of beneficiary countries includes Zimbabwe, bringing the number to 123.</P>
    <P>On the raw materials front the Council of the European Communities took a significant policy decision during the period covered by this report relating to its competence in negotiations arising under the UNCTAD integrated programme for commodities.  Council agreed that, on the part of the Community, these negotiations would be conducted on the basis of a common position enunciated by a single spokesman, normally the Commission.  Resulting agreements would, however, be signed both on behalf of the Community and on behalf of the member states.</P>
    <P>There have been quite significant developments with regard to specific commodity agreements.  Negotiations on the third international cocoa agreement were concluded in November 1980 and the Community and member states signed the agreement on 31 March 1981. Negotiations for a sixth international tin agreement were concluded on 26 June 1981.  Pending completion of ratification procedures, the operation of the fifth international tin agreement has been extended to 30 June 1982.  Negotiations are also in progress for an international jute agreement.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the common fund for commodities is to serve as a key instrument in attaining the objectives of the intergrated programme for commodities.  The preparatory commission established to bring the common fund into operation is continuing its work.  The agreement establishing the common fund was signed by Ireland on 24 February 1981.  The necessary steps are in hand to enable Ireland to ratify the agreement before 31 March 1982.  The International Common Fund for Commodities Bill, 1981, has been circulated. On 1 December the Minister for Finance moved that the Second Stage be taken on 8 December subject to agreement.  As this was not possible in the present session I hope that the Second Stage and all <Col N="1682" /> subsequent Stages can be taken early in the new session.</P>
    <P>Requests from Poland to the Community for emergency food aid, in December 1980, led to a decision by the Foreign Affairs Council to allow Poland to buy food products from intervention stocks at prices 10 per cent to 15 per cent below world market prices.  The quantities of food to be supplied were allocated among the member states.  Ireland was asked to provide 4,000 tonnes of beef.  The Polish authorities then applied to individual member states for credits to enable them to purchase these supplies and we, in common with the majority of our Community partners, agreed to extend such a credit.  In April 1981 the Government decided to provide a credit of IR£4.2 million to Poland so that they could buy 4,000 tonnes of beef from Irish intervention stocks.  This food has since been delivered to Poland.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, a special session of the United Nations General Assembly on International Co-operation for Development was held in New York in August-September of last year.  Agreement was reached at the session on the text of a new international development strategy for the eighties and this was later formally adopted by the 35th Regular Session of the General Assembly.  The text of the strategy is wide ranging and it will serve to guide and influence developments in the field of economic co-operation between the industrialised countries and the countries of the Third World over the next decade.</P>
    <P>The special session did not, however, succeed in launching the proposed new round of global negotiations on economic co-operation for development, although a text on procedures and a time frame for them was agreed by all delegations except three &mdash; the United States, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany.  Discussions continued on the proposed negotiations at the regular session of the General Assembly and were resumed on an informal basis in January of this year under the auspices of the President of the General Assembly.  Full agreement was not reached, however, mainly due to the position of the United <Col N="1683" /> States, which has been conducting a major review of its overall approach to relations with the developing countries since the new administration came into office in January 1981.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the European Councils held this year have discussed the future of the North-South dialogue, with particular reference to the global negotiations. Following the Maastricht Council on 23 and 24 March, a series of Commission proposals on various aspects of Community policy regarding international economic co-operation for development were examined by the relevant expert bodies and approved by the Foreign Affairs Council for submission to the European Council at the end of June. The latter approved the report and said that: &ldquo;co-operation with developing countries and the intensification of international economic relations serve the interests of all concerned and are necessary, not only in order to strengthen the economies of the developing countries, but also to promote the recovery of the world economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Council also called for the completion of preparations for global negotiations &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; and emphasised the importance of the Summit meetings in Ottawa and Cancun, Mexico in this context.</P>
    <P>Senators will know that the Ottawa Summit helped to give a positive impetus to the search for a new way forward in relations between developed and developing countries.  The major Summit meeting held at Cancun on October 22-23 attempted to advance this process further, by relaunching the dialogue at the United Nations in the form of preparations for the proposed round of global negotiations.  Discussions on this matter have resumed in New York during the current session of the General Assembly but the latest information I have to hand is that final agreement in the launching of the proposed round of global negotiations has not yet been reached.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to agriculture and say a few words about this sector, which is of such vital importance to this country.  The prices agreement reached <Col N="1684" /> in early April provided for an overall average price increase of 9 per cent which, together with the green £ rate adjustment of 4 per cent, gave a total increase of 13 per cent.  Included in the agreement were a number of measures concerning agricultural structures, one part of which was a package of special aid measures for Irish agriculture, making provision in particular for aid to the livestock sector.  In October 1980, the new sheepmeat market organisation, which is of considerable interest to Ireland, came into effect.  Agreement was also reached on the new sugar market organisation, which came into operation on 1 July, while another feature of note was the reduction in the New Zealand butter import entitlements to 94,000 tonnes for 1981 and 92,000 tonnes for 1982.  In the agri-monetary sector by the end of the period, monetary compensatory amounts only applied in Germany, Italy and the UK.</P>
    <P>Following a commitment in the prices package to consider further action for Ireland, the July Council approved an extension of the west of Ireland drainage programme by an additional 50,000 hectares field drainage, as well as extra funds for arterial drainage and a 5 per cent interest rate subsidy for development farmers under the farm modernisation directive.  The drainage measure provides FEOGA aid estimated at 30 million ECU, while the interest rate subsidy is for two years and covers new as well as outstanding loans.</P>
    <P>Discussions are still continuing among EEC Ministers for Fisheries with a view to reaching agreement on a revised common fisheries policy.  While progress was achieved during 1980 on certain aspects of a new policy, the momentum was not maintained during the first half of 1981, despite the political impetus given by the Heads of Government meeting at Maastricht on 23 and 24 March, which urged a speedy resolution of the fisheries discussions.  The main outstanding areas for resolution include the difficult problem of the amounts of total allowable catches and within this, the quota to be allowed to each member state for each particular species.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> Linked to the question of quotas is the thorny political problem of access for member states to coastal zones after 1982.  Ireland has held many bilateral and multilateral discussions with interested parties, in particular the British, the French and the Commission on these subjects. Despite the obvious difficulties, we are hopeful that the political will exists among members states to reach agreement on an overall policy, if not by the end of this year at least early next year. The substantial progress registered on certain important aspects of a new policy at the September Council of Fisheries Ministers, namely marketing and temporary structure arrangements, both very important for Ireland, together with agreements with certain third countries, leads us to hope that this momentum will be maintained in an effort to reach agreement on the outstanding aspects of the fisheries package.  We are under no illusion that the solution to the access problem will be easy, but the Government remain committed to negotiate for a 12-mile coastal zone and certain areas beyond for our own fishermen.</P>
    <P>The major topic for discussion in the regional policy area in 1981 has been, and continues to be, the forthcoming review of the regional fund, scheduled to take place by next April.  Ireland has for long called for the development of a comprehensive Community regional policy which could make a genuine contribution to lessening disparties between regions and it is intended to press for this in the review.  Approvals for regional fund operations for Ireland in 1981 will amount to IR£53.5 million.</P>
    <P>Concern about the high rate of unemployment in the Community dominated social policy discussions in the period under review and a Joint Council of Economics, Finance and Social Affairs Ministers took place in Luxembourg in June of this year where it was agreed that there was a need for action at Community level to complement member states own policies. The Commission has now put forward proposals concerning job creation and it is expected that these will be discussed by the Council in the coming months.  Social fund approvals for 1981 <Col N="1686" /> operations in Ireland are expected to total IR £71.1 million.</P>
    <P>On energy matters I am glad to say that, despite the relaxation of tension in the oil market, the Community has not grown complacent about future energy prospects.  Conservation and the fall in demand due to the world-wide recession has fortunately prevented the Iran-Iraqi war from provoking a third oil crisis. Only time will tell, however, whether this fall in demand throughout the OECD regions is just a temporary setback to an accelerating and insatiable demand for oil supplies, or whether it represents a real structural change, with industralised countries switching to other traditional or new and renewable forms of energy. What is certain is, that this period of relative tranquility on the oil market, should be used by the Community to maximum advantage, to consolidate systems of emergency oil-sharing, to develop indigenous and alternative forms of energy, and encourage conservation. Events in the Community within the period covered by this report confirm that it has the will and the ability to make progress in all of these areas.</P>
    <P>As has been the practice in previous reports, the 18th Report contains a summary review of developments in European Political Co-operation over the period under review.  Among the matters which have been the subject of co-ordination of views among the Ten in political co-operation during this period are Afghanistan, Poland, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon, Kampuchea, Southern Africa, the Madrid CSCE meeting and the Euro-Arab dialogue.  Developments on these and other matters are described in the report and I need not go over this ground again in my opening statement.</P>
    <P>What I would like to focus on today is the process of political co-operation itself, which over the years has assumed a growing importance in relations among the Ten member states of the Community. This importance is recognised by the Government and is reflected in the commitment set out in the Government's programme to arrange time for a Dáil debate twice a year on developments in <Col N="1687" /> European Political Co-operation.  It is proposed to implement this commitment by including developments in European Political Co-operation in the debate on the regular motion, introduced every six months both in the Dáil and in the Seanad, noting the Report on Developments in the European Communities.  It is also proposed to ensure that future reports will contain an expanded account of developments in political co-operation, in a separate chapter of the report, so that Deputies and Senators will have the fullest possible opportunity to comment on this important aspect of our membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Foreign Ministers of the Ten at their meeting in London on 13 October 1981 adopted a report containing improvements to the machinery and procedures of European Political Co-operation.  A copy of the London report has been laid before the House and placed in the Library for the convenience of Senators.  Before taking up the ideas that are in that report, it would, I believe, be useful to set out the main features of our present participation in EPC.</P>
    <P>The preamble to the Treaty of Rome states that the objective of the Community shall be to establish an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.  The precise form of such a European union, wisely, has never been defined.  It certainly seems more prudent that the member states should establish gradually the structures, forms and pace of evolution towards European union rather than seek to impose an abstract and, most likely unrealistic, blueprint at the beginning. When we acceded to the Community in 1973 the position was that we not only accepted the <i>acquis communautaire</i> established by the various treaties, we also undertook a political commitment in the context of progress towards European union, to consult and co-ordinate with our partners on foreign policy in the non-treaty intergovernmental framework of European Political Co-operation. The main features of political co-operation as established by the Luxemburg <Col N="1688" /> (1970) and Copenhagen (1973) reports are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The objectives of political co-operation are mutual information and consultation among the member states on all important questions of foreign policy. Whenever possible and desirable, the member states will seek to co-ordinate their views, take on a common position or undertake joint action.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Political co-operation does not have a treaty basis; rather it is a voluntary intergovernmental process and the member states are bound by decisions only to the extent they all agree.  Thus the rule of consensus applies, and this requires the unanimous agreement of all of the member states.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Foreign Ministers meet at least four times a year in the EPC framework &mdash; in practice more frequently &mdash; to discuss a wide range of foreign policy questions. Senior officials also meet regularly to consider the latest development and report to the Ministers.  A communications system links each of the Foreign Ministries of the Ten so that member states can exchange views rapidly in the intervals between meetings.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Political co-operation is essentially outward-looking, being concerned primarily with the Ten's collective relations with the rest of the world.  Consequently its field of application is primarily external.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The means of action available to the Ten are essentially the normal instruments of diplomacy.  These include joint representations to other governments, common statements of position, public declarations, concerted negotiation and co-ordination of voting positions in international bodies.  From time to time, an agreed view reached within political co-operation will influence the economic action of the Community in the field of external relations.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in common with other member states, has been satisfied with the way political co-operation has developed within this framework.  It has been possible to reach a high degree of agreement on a wide range of subjects, for example, <Col N="1689" /> issues arising in the CSCE process and the Middle East conflict.  Within the United Nations, the Ten have managed to co-ordinate their views so that they now hold common positions on the majority of the issues arising at the General Assembly.  Of course, there are some issues where positions still diverge and this is how one would expect it to be, given the varying interests and traditions of the member states and the essential flexibility and pragmatism of the way political co-operation works.  Notwithstanding such divergences, the experience of all of the Ten, including Ireland, has been that to the extent the views of the Ten coincide, we have opportunities to play a far more significant and influential role and serve our interests more effectively on many issues, acting together with our partners in the Ten, than we would have as individual states acting alone.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the deteriorating international environment together with the success of political co-operation in projecting a European presence in the world at large, have prompted suggestions that political co-operation be further strengthened and expanded.  Some of these suggestions focus on improvements in the way that political co-operation works in the practical sense and as such are eminently sensible.  Here I am thinking of the innovations introduced in the London Report on European Political Co-operation adopted on 13 October last such as a rotating support team to assist the Presidency, arrangements to enable the Ten to react to major crises and ways of involving the European Parliament more fully with political co-operation.</P>
    <P>The first introductory part of the London report reiterates the political commitment of the member states to consult on foreign policy questions.  An important element is the recognition that the report gives to the importance of the treaties as the basis for further integration, and the maintenance and development of Community policies in accordance with the treaties, before further steps can be taken to strengthen political co-operation.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, much has <Col N="1690" /> been made of the reference to security in the London report.  I would like to make matters clear.  Political co-operation is concerned with co-ordination of foreign policy.  Within that context discussion has taken place from an early stage in political co-operation of foreign policy matters which have a security dimension.  For example, the member states of the Community have consulted together on questions arising at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and on disarmament issues.  This has not presented a problem for Ireland.  In common with all of the 35 CSCE participating states and the members of the UN, we have to address these issues in any case, and to the extent that Ireland's position is shared by our Community partners, we can together have a greater influence on discussion in these areas by co-ordinating our positions within the Ten.</P>
    <P>That is a situation that has been recognised by successive Governments since we first began to participate in European Political Co-operation upon our accession to the Community.  It is regrettable that our participation in EPC has been represented in some quarters in such a way that could give rise to misunderstanding and ambiguity.  For this reason, I think it is useful and important that the London report makes clear that the scope of political co-operation on security matters is confined to political aspects of security and that defence or military issues as such are excluded.  The relevant paragraph in the report is, therefore, an explicit re-statement, in a form acceptable to Ireland, of the practice established under successive Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>To return to broader issues, in the course of the recent debate on the development of political co-operation and parallel to that debate, other suggestions have been put forward in recent months, which raise more fundamental questions about the nature of the Community and the direction in which it is headed.  In this connection Senators may be aware that the Federal German and Italian Governments recently communicated to their Community partners proposals aimed at establishing a framework for evolution to European union.  These proposals envisage <Col N="1691" /> placing both the Community and EPC under the single institutional aegis of the European Council and extending co-operation to cover security policy, culture and legal harmonisation.  The recent meeting of the European Council, which met in London on 26-27 November, took note of these proposals without going into their substance.  It took a procedural decision to refer them to the Foreign Ministers who were asked to examine and clarify them and to report to a future meeting of the European Council.  No doubt in the course of that work these ideas will be elaborated on further and I hope to report to the House fully on the outcome in due course.</P>
    <P>It is right and appropriate that we should discuss these proposals on their own merits.  While the discussion has not yet reached a sufficient degree of maturity to enable me to go into detail, some fundamental points must be kept in mind in so far as political co-operation is concerned:</P>
    <P>This debate on political development is taking place at a time when the treaty framework of the Community is also facing important decisions both on budgetary matters and on the future of existing and new Community policies.  For us, the relationship between the two debates is particularly significant.</P>
    <P>In our view, the commitment to political co-operation is based upon, and indeed, flows from the commitment to economic integration set out in the treaties establishing the Community.  For this reason, both debates must be considered together.</P>
    <P>Political co-operation on foreign policy is not simply an arrangement of convenience but a means of expressing our growing common interests as a member of the Community, in the wider world.  Moreover, it is hard to see how political co-operation can respond effectively to external problems unless internal cohesion and common interest within the Community are first of all increased and developed.</P>
    <P>I have attempted in this introduction to give a brief summary of the major developments in the Community in the <Col N="1692" /> period covered by these reports.  I will, of course, try to reply to any questions raised during the course of what I am sure will be a very useful and constructive debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few brief remarks on this report.  In the first page of the report mention has been made of the entry of Greece.  Portugal and Spain into the EEC.  While we welcome other countries into the EEC, at the same time I hope that their entry will not affect Ireland in any way as far as finances are concerned because we all know that if the cake has to be shared by others it means we get less.  I sincerely hope that that is not going to happen.  If all European countries join the EEC then in my opinion we are just going to be as we were before we ever entered it.  It is not going to be of any great advantage to any country.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note that as far as agriculture was concerned we got a fair increase last year.  Nevertheless, it was not sufficient, especially as regards the milk sector.  I hope that in the coming year dairy farmers in particular will get a much bigger increase than they have been getting in the past.  I sincerely hope that those threats we have heard from time to time of levies and such things will not materialise.  Certainly Ireland is not responsible for over-production in any form of agriculture and I do not think we should be penalised in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drainage was also mentioned in the report.  It has been said that more money has been made available for drainage in the west of Ireland and we all welcome that.  As far as arterial drainage is concerned, I feel that the amount of money we are getting is not sufficient.  We have a number of rivers which should have been drained 20 or 30 years ago.  The river nearest my home is the River Suir and I would say it was about 30 years ago that a deputation first went to the then Department of Local Government to ask that it be drained.  We were told when the arterial drainage scheme was drawn up that the Suir would be number ten or eleven on the list.  We thought the Suir would be drained 20 years ago.  We know <Col N="1693" /> that lack of money is the cause of the delay and we consider that more money should be made available from the EEC for this purpose.  We have not got the funds ourselves.</P>
    <P>The same could be said about roads. Our roads are no longer able to take the traffic that is now on them and much of this is due to the fact that we have entered the EEC.  Travelling about the country one occasionally sees a sign here and there to say that moneys for this purpose have been granted by the European fund though I have never seen one such sign in my own county, Tipperary.  I cannot understand why we in Tipperary do not get some of this money because our roads are as bad as those anywhere else.  If we are not getting enough money, and we appear not be to getting it, some pressure should be put on the EEC.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of Japan and trade with that country.  This is something I can never understand.  One sees products from Japan, Korea and other countries selling here at cheaper rates than the Irish products.  I know it has been said that we must help developing countries.  Well, I would not consider Japan a developing country: she is way ahead of anyone else. The unfair thing about it is that those countries are producing goods but the wages they pay are much lower than the wages paid in this and some other countries. I suppose you could never describe them as slave wages and we have to compete against them.  At present when unemployment is so high in all the EEC countries there should be some limit set in allowing goods in from Japan and other non-European countries.  This would go a long way towards solving our unemployment crisis at the moment.  We have no say about those goods coming into this country, but when we decided some time ago to have a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign we were told that it was illegal, that we were not supposed to ask people to buy Irish goods only.  I see nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>The aid to Poland by supplying that country with goods and also the loan of money for purchases is a very good idea. I hope that this country will play its full part in helping Poland in every way possible. <Col N="1694" /> I was very pleased to hear also as regards security that the recent talks did not involve Ireland in any agreement with NATO or anyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address myself to this debate on the Eighteenth Report on Developments in the European Communities.  I would like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, on his very comprehensive introduction to this debate.</P>
      <P>We are talking about our involvement in the EEC at present against a background of what is described as the mandate, the mandate being the attempt by some of the larger EEC countries to change some of the fundamental policies within the European Economic Community, these being, as far as Ireland is concerned, principally the common agricultural policy, the development of Community policies and the structure of the budget.  It is obviously vital in the interests of this country that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Agriculture continue to stress within the councils of Europe that this country is absolutely committed and that there is a consensus throughout this country across the political divide to defend the common agricultural policy.  Already through this mandate last year and through the British pressures, the British were successful in reducing very substantially their input into Community funds but there has to be a limit to this.  It would not, in fact, be a Community if each member state could precisely state that what it puts in it must get out in some form or other because if that happens the concept of a Community goes out the door.  If there is to be a Community in which there is regard for less well-off people living in less prosperous regions, there has to be a certain generosity of spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural policy has to be maintained and there is a very strong case for it where this country is concerned.  Agriculture accounts for about 20 per cent of employment in the country and is 14 per cent of GNP.  This is against a background in the farming community where, despite benefits that have existed in the <Col N="1695" /> context of the EEC and subsidisation, since 1978 farm incomes have declined by about 50 per cent in real terms. Against that kind of background if there was any question of collapse of the common agricultural policy, in the rural community of this country it would lead to a revolution.  The case has to be maintained.</P>
    <P>There are those who would argue that agriculture is taking too much of the element of subsidisation from the Community funds.  It is interesting to note that the proportion of the Community budget taken by agriculture declined from 74 per cent in 1977 to 63 per cent in 1981. The position has been substantially eroded in the past six to seven year.  It is important to note, as the Minister pointed out, that in so far as the gross domestic product of the European Community is concerned, only 0.5 per cent of that gross domestic product is going into the agricultural sector.  Against that background there is a strong case to be made. Apart from aspects of subsidisation of the small farmer, which some in the Community are against, there are the very positive benefits that flow to the Community through a support for farm income.  These achievements have to be pointed out.</P>
    <P>One of the achievements has been the securing of adequate food supplies.  The second achievement is the provision of these adequate food supplies in a domestic context.  In World War II problems were created in the shipping lanes of the world and there was a crisis in the provision of food in all countries in Europe, even those not in the war such as our own.  The boosting of a domestic source of supply of food has all kinds of benefits that relate to security and social needs. As well there is the inherent support of farm incomes through the common agricultural policy.  As bad as things are in Irish agriculture at the moment, had there not been the element of support which there has been from the European Economic Community that huge section of the population of this country would be in dire straits.  For that reason I want to congratulate the Taoiseach and the <Col N="1696" /> Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture on their recent activities and the initiatives they have been taking at these meetings to maintain this policy.</P>
    <P>It is very important as well that the Taoiseach recently took the initiative in visiting President Mitterrand in France. Fundamental to the retention of this Community policy is an alliance between Ireland and France because France's basic interests also equate to a support policy for agriculture.  There may have been suggestions that President Mitter-and might have different views on that subject.  I am quite certain that the Taoiseach's visit to Paris has been of immense benefit to this country and I want to congratulate him for taking that initiative.</P>
    <P>I noted in the recent Dáil debate the Taoiseach's statement and the response by the Leader of the Opposition.  The Leader of the Opposition was suggesting that the extent of the failure at the recent Council meeting was the fact that there was no agreed statement.  That may have been a measure of the success of the last meeting of the Council because the move within that Council of Heads of State was to introduce this mandate and to scrap the common agricultural policy.  Any question of there being no agreed statement means that the <i>status quo</i> has been maintained and continuity exists.  It is much better that there be no statement than a statement of a new initiative on a new policy which would be detrimental to the interests of this country.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the regional policy is under review.  A fundamental review of regional policy is expected around April.  We joined the EEC with a massive vote of confidence in a referendum but this confidence has been eroded to a degree since then because of matters such as the erosion of farm incomes and other matters.  Regional policy is also a part of all this.  The recent NESC report proved that Irish incomes as a proportion of Community income are slipping rather than benefiting.  Membership of the EEC was supposed to be all about a regional policy, with a policy to help the periphery, a policy to reduce supports to the centre and to attempt to level out incomes.  Instead of that policy moving in <Col N="1697" /> the direction to which it aspired, matters through the market are moving in the opposite direction.  In 1973, it is interesting to note from the NESC report, Irish income per head as a percentage of the EEC average was running at about 65 per cent whereas in 1979, only six years later, Irish income as a percentage of the EEC average went down from 65 per cent to about 60 per cent.  In relative terms we are slipping and in this context a review of regional policy in April is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I speak especially as a Senator from the west of Ireland.  The statistics show that the province by any standards is the poorest in the Community along with the Mezzogiorno in Southern Italy.  We expected this fundamental commitment to a regional policy which could set up infrastructural development.  Without making a political point, successive Governments in this country of both parties simply did not have the resources to do these things.  It was a great disappointment in the west that the regional policy did not come up to expectations.  Again it may have been useful strategy nationally to declare all of this country a region. This apparently was the strategy adopted, which one can appreciate, to the increase the total cake which Ireland could get.  The problem with declaring the entire nation as eligible meant that the part of this country which is the worst off in Europe did not really get proportionately what it required to take it out of the backward state it has been in.  In addition there was a move within the Community to introduce a policy under which some element of subsidisation from the regional fund would occur on the basis of projects assessed within the EEC, looking at the Community as a region and at regions, such as the west of Ireland and the south of Italy, and would arbitrarily support projects in such regions without them necessarily being supported by national governments.  That has not happened.  In every case at present in the dispensing of regional policy the support will project from a list sent by the Department here to Brussels and the regional people can choose only within those parameters.  There is the <Col N="1698" /> possibility that the Community from Brussels and from its own institutions, will give its direct aid to projects which it considers to be of merit in the peripheral regions.  I am talking now about the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in the west.  In recent years when we have complained to people in EEC institutions about the low level of regional policy the classic retort was usually to suggest that while we might not be getting it out of the regional fund, Ireland is getting immense benefits from the common agricultural policy.  Of course we have been getting immense benefit from the common agricultural policy, but the west of Ireland as a region has not got the proportion of benefits from the common agricultural policy that other regions have, and that has to do with the small size of farm and, until recently, the lesser level of concentration on dairying activities when such a huge proportion of EEC funds for the common agricultural policy are coming into the dairying sector.  An example is the huge dairying output from the Munster counties.  Of course, we do not begrudge them that income and it is marvellous that this is happening, but proportionately the west has not got this major benefit of the common agricultural policy nor has it been getting it from the regional fund.  Obviously a review of regional policy and the regional fund would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I tend to agree with Senator William Ryan.  There are reasons to have reservations about the accession of three new countries to the Community.  Along with him I welcome the accession of Greece and the forthcoming accession of Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Deputy Garret FitzGerald when Minister for Foreign Affairs assured us in debates that the accession of these countries would not be to the detriment of the funding of projects for countries such as ours.  There are immense benefits to western Europe in the accession, apart from the benefits to the new member Greece and the applicants, Spain and Portugal.  These benefits are not economic.  They relate to security <Col N="1699" /> and defence matters and the fragile condition of democracy in Greece, Spain and Portugal.  They include the possibility on their accession in the Community of bolstering inherent democracy within those countries their inclusion within Europe and the decreasing likelihood of losing them to other blocks in Europe or elsewhere. Obviously accession whilst beneficial to larger nations of Western Europe must carry a price with it.  If for these political reasons it is important that these other countries become part of the Community, then the tab must be picked up because with the emphasis on the need for an agricultural policy and a regional policy unless there is an increase in the funding of the budget within the Community, Ireland will end up in direct competition with Spain, Portugal and Greece for a smaller slice of the cake.  That point must be stressed just as much as the necessity of retaining the common agricultural policy.  The case can be made that the Community budget, about which we hear so much from some of the larger European countries, really amounts to only 2.6 per cent of the total national budget of the Community.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we were able to help Poland in their problems.  We supplied them with about 4,000 tonnes of beef and their credits were involved.  That country has had immense difficulty lately.  I am glad to see Ireland playing its part within the whole structure of the Community in helping Poland.</P>
    <P>We had debates in this House recently and around the country on issues concerning Northern Ireland, the question of the unity of this country, the problems which reunification will cause and matters relating to that.  One important aspect concerning the North has not been mentioned at all in this debate.  One of the tragedies in recent years of the division of this island has been that in the broadest terms since we joined the EEC we as a country have benefited enormously from this membership, not just in crude, financial terms, not just in financial support coming in to our farmers or to our industrial workers through the social fund or regional policy, but in so <Col N="1700" /> many other areas.  However, politics in this country had by nature been introspective, taking the reasons for the original divisions between the two main parties as an example.</P>
    <P>The introspection of the political debate did not help this country and opportunities to be outgoing were few. The involvement in Europe has been psychologically immensly beneficial to the country, giving those in the Oireachtas, the civil service and the Government the opportunity to get into a much wider political field.  It was not just a question of lobbying in Europe for more grants for our farmers but also taking part in the great world debates through participation in Europe.  The benefit has been immense in the sense that in a community of ten countries we have a population of only three million people in a total of over two hundred million, yet at all of these forums we have effectively a voice in ten.  The Taoiseach sits with the Council of Heads of State, the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the Council of Foreign Ministers and so on right down the line.  This percolates through Oireachtas participation on committees, through the civil service and through participation by vocational groups, such as the Irish Farmers' Association, the chambers of commerce, the trade unions and other parallel vocational groups within the EEC.  This has been incalculably beneficial to us.</P>

      <P>We have been speaking in this debate in the broad political arena, but on the economic front Northern Ireland have been having problems because of their fundamental dependence on agriculture.  They are part of the British entity and British attitudes and views have always been influenced by the fact that only 5 per cent of the British people are in the farming community. Northern Ireland are part of a political group the views of which were diametrically opposed to those of the farming <Col N="1701" /> community in Northern Ireland.  Over the years there have been close links between the Ulster community and the Farmers Union and Ministers of Agriculture have always represented Northern interests in the farming area.  I welcome that.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's speech the extension of the drainage programme in the west of Ireland by 120,000 acres which in financial terms amounts to FEOGA aid of about 30 million EUA.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note also that the statement regarding political co-operation and security is confined to the political aspect as far as Ireland is concerned and that excluded from this are issues related precisely to defence and military issues. I would like to hear the views of Senator Murphy on this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent visit to Dublin of the President of the European Investment Bank.  We had a debate recently in the House concerning the bank.  We have derived immense benefit in that had their sources and funds not been available in recent years the development which has taken place would have been much less.</P>
      <P>I welcome within the EEC funding the Ortoli Facility in which money has been coming in at subsidised interest rates.  It is significant that since 1973 loans from the EIB from this fund have amounted to £795 million which is a massive injection of long-term funds.  This has been a boost in the productive area as distinct from areas to do with consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been reading through the eighteenth report or, to be more precise, I was browsing through it. I cannot say that I took any pleasure in it, but that is no credit to me because I was not even tempted to take pleasure in it.  If we stand back after eight years and consider how much the Community has been involved in details of our economy, regulations and so on it is quite extraordinary <Col N="1702" /> how little enthusiasm there is at large for the European ideal.  If there was any in 1973 it has diminished certainly since then.</P>
      <P>The European ideal, in fact, interests only those who are directly involved in the rather precious world of Community negotiations.  I am not surprised that a sturdy nationalist like Senator Willie Ryan should be worried about the developments in the EEC.  He drew attention to the Brussels stricture on our &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  Three or four years ago, very early in the life of the last Seanad I was derided for suggesting that the whole &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; concept was at odds with the philosophy of the Community.  I am not surprised that Senator Ryan should have misgivings about that aspect and about the possible consequences of the accession of the new members, but even in such a starry-eyed Europhile as Senator Myles Staunton I could detect some signs of disenchantment.  I would suggest that the level of enchantment with the Community is at an all-time low.  The drafters of such documents as the Minister's speech &mdash; I respect the Minister too much to accuse him of writing it&mdash;and of the eighteenth report take refuge from all these uncomfortable realities in cliches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am sorry to hear it.  The drafters of these documents take refuge in cliches relieved by jargon and bland phraseology.  The Minister's speech, to give him his due, is a little more forthright and meaningful than the eighteenth report itself.  All the difficulties facing the Community are not even mentioned in that report.  There is no sign, for example, of such salient aspects of the Community affairs as the naked self-interest of France, the reluctant membership of the United Kingdom and so on.  There are references to youth employment and to what the Taoiseach called in his report to the Dáil, which is incorporated in this report, the high and fluctuating level of interest, as examples of the difficulties which the Community <Col N="1703" /> is facing.  The speech is a little inaccurate in suggesting that these difficulties have been experienced, as the Taoiseach said, by all countries of the industrialised world.  He might have qualified that more accurately by saying all countries of the capitalist industrialised world.  Nowhere is there a suggestion that the Taoiseach or anyone else has any idea how to lower the high level of interest rates or how to stabilise the fluctuation in interest rates, for the simple reason that in the Community no more than in the national economy have they any hope of controlling credit and interest which are in other and more powerful hands.</P>
      <P>I found a note of bland unreality in both the report and the Minister's speech.  I am glad that the Minister directed our attention to the uncomfortable fact that the Irish standard of living has declined, as the National Economic and Social Council report told us a few months ago.  It also gave us a whole lot more distressing data such as that we have the lowest this and the highest that in the Community, the worst housing, the highest dependency rate and so on. The record is pretty grim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on this occasion I want to make a few points about the section of the report which interested me most, and that was the political section.  Senator Ryan and Senator Staunton said they were glad that the Community was extending economic help to Poland in its present troubles.  So am I, and why not? However, it is different entirely to see the Community pontificating about the political state of Poland.  That does not make me so happy as knowing that the Community and ourselves are giving economic aid to Poland.  I would be quite uneasy about a Community in which West Germany is a prominent if not the dominant partner making political statements about Poland's affairs which, after all, are her internal affairs, let us not forget.  The pessimistic hawks amongst us had been predicting Soviet intervention for the last 18 months since the crisis began but, in strict terms, Poland's affairs are her own affairs at the moment.  It seems that Community pronouncements <Col N="1704" /> on what is happening in Poland politically are extremely unhelpful, given the fact that West Germany is dominant and given the fact that in a sense, the Community is really an elaborate framework to &ldquo;respectabilise&rdquo; West Germany.  That is one way of looking at the Community.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the report, as well, to the Euro-Arab dialogue and I am rather uneasy about that, also.  After all, everything the Community does in the foreign policy field is now a matter of concern to all of us.  All Members are aware of how the protagonists in the Middle East conflict flood us daily with propaganda. No sooner do you get a propaganda sheet from the PLO, than you get one from the Israeli Press Office and so on.  There is no firm position to be taken in the Middle East.  What I mean is that there is something to be said for the entrenched position of both Arab and Israeli.  It is a chronically difficult problem.</P>
    <P>What worries me, again, is that I can see the Community for its own material reasons leaning in the direction of the Arabs and let me say more than leaning in the direction of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.  I would like to hear from the Minister what exactly is the attitude of our Department of Foreign Affairs to the PLO at present.  I know that under the last administration the PLO was discouraged from setting up an office in Dublin.  I hope that position remains the same, because the PLO is, in my book, a terrorist organisation.  Its avowed intention is the destruction of the State of Israel by physical force and I would no more like to do business with the PLO than I would with the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>The Eighteenth Report pays quite a lot of attention to the relations within the Community and Africa and the attitude of the Community to South Africa.  I would be happier about this if I thought that forces within the EEC were moderating their economic ambitions, so to speak, in the African Continent, but the evidence is that some of our partners are economically very much interested in South Africa, for example, the Germans, French and other nationalities.  The interests <Col N="1705" /> in South Africa, the economy there and the connections between the Community and the South African economy are such that we must raise a question mark about the sincerity of their concern for the black African States.</P>
    <P>All of these points can be subsumed in a general point and that is the doubt many of us have about the harmonisation of foreign policy, about European political co-operation.</P>

      <P>I was saying that, having had my doubts about individual aspects of Community foreign policy, I would question the whole idea of the validity of that foreign policy, or the validity of the idea that we have a laudable and significant role to play in it.  At the time of the referendum debates in 1972, in so far as this matter was adverted to at all, which, let us face it, was very little, what we emphasised was the economic advantages of membership.  A Government pamphlet at the time rejected the idea that Ireland would lose its sovereignty and said there would be rather a pooling of sovereignty.  In a pooling of sovereignty, where there is one small member on the periphery, the idea that that small member can make an equal input into that pool is illusory.  The same applies to what was later called harmonisation of policy, which is the basic idea behind the European political co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. G. Hussey Mrs. G. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. G. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter of child abuse on the Adjournment I do so fully aware to the fact that for many years the care and attention of society in general towards the children of the nation has been defective.  This has led to a great deal being written and spoken in recent years, culminating in the report of the Task Force on Child Care Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps unfortunately, there has been an impression abroad that a great deal of talk and a great volume of documentation amount to action.  This is a common confusion which, perhaps, may have <Col N="1707" /> arisen in the question of child care.  It is obvious why I consider this matter of public concern and suitable for early raising in this House.  The country read with enormous shock, and indeed an amount of anger, of a particularly tragic case recently which involved the short and very brutalised life of an innocent baby. It is natural that this kind of affront to the normal loving care which is children's right should give rise to such anger and, indeed one might use the word anguish, if the reaction of many people who contacted me is to be described accurately.</P>
    <P>It is very important, therefore, that we should look at the question of physical child abuse.  It is, alas, a feature of family life which is especially horrible to us but it is part of a general malaise in a family caused by a great many stress-related factors. There are a great many other areas which might be described as child abuse also, such as emotional deprivation and other forms of neglect.  But in this instance we are concentrating on physical child abuse.  Part of the revulsion which is felt at the recent tragedy stems not only from the deed itself but from an almost subconscious realisation that many so-called normal people &mdash; and I suppose most of us would consider ourselves normal people &mdash; might, in some circumstances, be counted among the numbers of child abusers.  There is a line between so-called normal physical chastisement and excessive punishment which amounts to abuse.  That line can be blurred quite easily and tragically and this could happen quite quickly.  In passing, let me say that a major step forward was made by the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.</P>
    <P>Child abuse is a matter of great concern and people are asking as a result of the recent case how one can prevent such a thing happening again.  No matter how much we strive there will be tragedies of this nature &mdash; we will never manage to eliminate this kind of tragedy totally &mdash; but we must continually strive towards a situation where such tragedies will be minimised.  It has been said to me by experienced people in this field that the only way in which we could ensure that <Col N="1708" /> no parent would ever inflict such gross abuse on a child would be to remove thousands of children from thousands of homes in Ireland where clear indications of grave risk exist.  It may seem an enormity to say this but it seems to be the only solution to the problem of so many children in Irish society.  There is no doubt that there are a great many families at risk.</P>
    <P>Dr. Paul McQuaid and Imelda McCarthy published a document in the Irish Journal of Medical Science in January 1981.  In it they identified certain families that are at risk, for example, families where there is marital and social instability, where there is a history of maternal psychiatric treatment, where there is paternal unemployment, where there are criminal or prison records, where there is a high rate of general mobility.  All of these factors are distinguishing features of the families of injured children.  At a later point in that document they talk about marital instability leading to separation, psychiatric disorders, higher rates of unemployment, instability and lack of cohesion in the life style of battering families. They are recognisable features which seem to be present in far too great numbers.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the Department of Health issued a memorandum on non-accidental injury to children.  That phrase &ldquo;non-accidental injury&rdquo; always strikes me as being particularly chilling.  The Department of Health issued this memorandum as a result of a great deal of pressure and publicity mounted by north Dublin Social workers and the ISPCC.  This memorandum amounts to guidance for health personnel and health agencies on the identification, management and prevention of this problem.  It sets out to try to tackle the whole area.</P>
    <P>At this point I would ask the Minister if she is satisfied that these guidelines, which seem to be excellent in themselves, are being observed fully and if she will assure the House that an investigation into their operation will be carried out immediately if she is not satisfied.</P>
    <P>Dr. McQuaid and Dr. McCarthy also point out that there is no official research being undertaken into the whole area of <Col N="1709" /> non-accidental injury to children.  They call for a national epidemiological research programme which, in layman's language, means a research programme into this feature.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the Task Force on Child Care Services.  This task force included in their report a section on non-accidental injury which they very firmly placed as part of the general area of deprivation of children.  In treating non-accidental injury to children they laid great stress on a new structure of child care authorities in each health board area which would deliver and coordinate the services presently available at local level and emphasised that this co-ordination is obviously vital.  The report stressed continually the role of a new body, the Child Care Authority, in their observations on this section; that the emphasis must be on helpful accessible approach: that parents in families at risk would see a child care authority as being helpful, as being a body which the family could approach before the stress factors became so acute as to result in non-accidental injury or other form of gross neglect.</P>
    <P>It worries me that there should be a rather Pavlovian reaction to tragedies like this.  It seems that people wish to assuage a certain guilt, which we all must feel when something like this happens, by trying to find a scapegoat or scapegoats. We must be extremely careful in our approach to a problem like this which will not be solved by simply dumping a general guilt on to a particular section. Social workers should not be asked to carry the burden of society's responsibilities towards neglected or under-privileged families.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister tell us at what point her deliberations are on the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Child Care Services. It is relevant at this point to refer to a document published by Dr. Charles Mollan on 13 August entitled <i>The Welfare of Children.</i> Dr. Mollan is a well known, concerned expert person in this whole field.  What he says places a burden of responsibility on the Minister and indeed on all of us on this side of the House.  He <Col N="1710" /> says that for the first time a Government in Ireland have come into power with a significant part of their programme devoted to the welfare of children and to improvements in the law and services for them and have a mandate from the electorate to improve the position of children in Ireland.  That is, in one way, a glowing tribute.  In another way it places a great deal of responsibility on us.</P>
    <P>There are two items I would like to mention.  Dr. Mollan and others in the task force mention neighbourhood resource centres or community resource centres where stress must be on the community's involvement in self-help, in communication, where the social worker would be more of a facilitater generally, where there would be a great deal of toing and froing and contact, thus reducing the stress load on families at risk.  I would like to call for the establishment of a 24-hour telephone service somewhat along the lines of the Samaritans because I believe that not only do neighbours, friends and concerned relatives need somebody to contact all the time, but parents who themselves feel that they might be at risk of battering their children would have someone to contact.  I believe that should be set up.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister is aware of course that there have been calls for an inquiry. Is there enough information available to the Minister to enable her to proceed with legislation to deal with this kind of tragedy or does she believe that some kind of public inquiry would be useful? A public inquiry is only justified if it is going to be useful.  Does she believe that there should be some kind of public inquiry to help her to formulate legislation and to help to educate the community generally?  This tragedy has given us a guideline that something must be done in response to the many calls and to further the great deal of work which has been done in the area of child care.  I look forward to the Minister letting us know what the position is in this whole area so that the many people in Ireland who have been so deeply concerned at these latest tragedies will know what is being done in their name to alleviate the problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Miss Flaherty) Mary Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Miss Flaherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by the Senator about the need to protect young children from a type of brutality evidenced by recent court cases.  The Senator raised a number of issues.  I will give a general indication first of the current situation and the provisions that are available at the moment.  The general policy at present towards children at risk is to help them and their parents as far as possible without breaking up the family.  This relates to the area of concern which Senator Hussey mentioned, the need for family support services, and this is something the Department would emphasise now and would wish to emphasise in the future.</P>
      <P>Studies of non-accidentally injured children indicate that the parents have personal and social problems because of their own deprived and violent backgrounds, alcoholism, current stresses of unemployment, poor housing or difficulties in communicating with one another. This is a wider challenge to us all and certainly involves much more than the Department of Health.  It involves the response this Government have undertaken in another area by their commitment to the alleviation of this type of deprivation.  That direction of prevention is one that the Department wishes to concentrate on in a very particular way because relief at the points of stress is one way of preventing further situations such as we have read about recently.  An obvious preventive to that kind of violence is the provision of assistance.  Health boards currently provide family support systems in the family's own home; the social worker service is available in dealing with matters related to child care, finance and home management; the home help service can intervene and support a family at particular times.  Health boards also assist in the provision of day care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is a certain amount being done in that area there is clearly a need for much greater development.  There are huge areas that are inadequately provided for at present.  With the commitment to the new legislation in the next <Col N="1712" /> session there will be a commitment for finances to develop this sort of support service.</P>
    <P>That is the wider area, but when we come to the problem of specific cases and detecting incidents the situation is less clear, the directions are less clear.  The Department of Health circulated the detailed guidelines referred to by the Senator, which have in fact been updated since then into a 1980 version.  They are very specific and clear and there is firm satisfaction that they are available to the medical profession.  In the past year the figures of reports show 271 cases and 90 of those cases were confirmed as in fact cases of child battering.</P>
    <P>There is certainly room for extending the knowledge of these guidelines among the general public because the community themselves often come in contact with children who may be at risk and it would be extremely important that they should be aware also of the person who would ultimately take responsibility.  In addition to these detailed guidelines a shortened version has been printed and is circulated to hospitals every six months to coincide with the change of junior medical staff.  These guidelines provide guidance for health personnel who come in contact with children in the course of their work in the detection and management of non-accidental injury to children.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for monitoring this information when it is gathered and coordinated rests with the director of each community care area to whom all notifications of cases are made.  While this system seems to be reasonably effective at present obviously the incident of which we read recently indicates that there is need for further examination and the Department of Health are keeping the situation under constant review.  The latest statistics available on detection are that of the 271 suspected cases reported in 1980, which is the last full statistical year, 90 were confirmed.</P>
    <P>The Department and the health boards run into difficulties in that the existing legal remedies for protecting children at risk are not entirely satisfactory.  We intend to improve this situation under the <Col N="1713" /> proposed new children's legislation being prepared in the Department and which we hope to present to the House in the next few months.  Let me say what the specific provisions in the Bill will be.  The general intention is to strengthen the position of health boards regarding access to homes where non-accidental injury is suspected and to streamline procedures for removal of children from homes where such suspicions are confirmed. The process by which a health board can intervene at present is extremely difficult and tends to be reached only in very much of a crisis situation.  The health board has no direct right to enter.  It only has the right to bring the matter to the attention of the Garda.  The initiative must be taken by the courts or the Garda.  This is obviously an inadequate situation.  It is a situation which we propose to change.  There are difficulties in relation to the parental rights, but the problem in this area seems to come down on one level to the powers of intervention and the method of intervention. The concern here would be to allow intervention at an earlier stage, an uncritical stage and, again, moving towards the prevention situation.</P>
    <P>This change in law does not guarantee anything and if we deal with the specific cases about which there has been a request for an inquiry, the director of community care in the area has given me at this stage a preliminary report subject to sending on the full report which is available to him plus the book of evidence in the court case.  The preliminary report indicates that in one family there had been no previous indications, no warning signals.  They had not come in contact with the health services in any way.  There was no point at which the health service had come in contact with them.  In the other case there was constant surveillance as a result of previous incidents and superficial reports indicate that a medical examination took place only three weeks before the child was tragically killed and that the child was healthy and well.</P>
    <P>This would indicate that we need to examine again our general guidelines for <Col N="1714" /> intervention and this would be extremely important.  The question of an inquiry is one which I would leave open at this stage until I have a chance to look at the full reports and the evidence.  At this stage it is impossible to say definitely but if, at that point, an inquiry would seem to be beneficial because there are questions that remain unanswered, it will be considered. The indications at present are that one family was being regularly supervised by the health services.  In that case the question arises as to whether we need to watch for different warning signals. Certainly there is room for examining that situation.  The general intention is that every effort will be made to extend and improve services.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are currently bringing in legislation to establish the Child Care Authority would I hope, help to concentrate what are at present fragmented efforts in the area of child care.  Bringing together all the organisations at present working under different departments in the area of child care may help to focus on problem families and problem children at an earlier stage, will concentrate the efforts on one authority, will give the responsibility to a specific authority which will be the Child Care Authority established in each health board area.  Hopefully, this authority will have power to intervene in cases of emergency and stress and will also concentrate on developing the maximum support services to prevent such cases occurring.</P>
    <P>There have been two very moving tragedies and I wish to assure all present that the concern expressed by this motion and by calls from other members of the Government for inquiries is being treated seriously.  Following the inquiries, which are under way, if there is need for further action, it will be taken.  The commitment is there to wider action in the area of the Child Care Authority and at present we are proposing that that legislation will become law in the next session of this House.  At that stage we will be glad of the detailed contribution of every Member of both Houses in the processing of legislation that will strengthen our powers to react to such situations and to develop the maximum preventive services <Col N="1715" /> to prevent these situations occurring again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 18 December 1981.</P>
