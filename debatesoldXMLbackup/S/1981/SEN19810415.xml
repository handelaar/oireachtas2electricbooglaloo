      <P>I have considered a request from Senator Mary Robinson to raise, on the motion for the Adjournment this evening, the following matter &mdash; the acceptance by the Department of Labour of a female usher on transfer from the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of sufficient input of social services into the legal system, particularly in matters relating to family law, causes many problems.  There is little use in providing a couple seeking a divorce with a marriage counsellor at the door of the courthouse.  Having brought themselves to this point, there is little likelihood of them changing their minds.  There is no point in closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Such counselling, if it is to be effective, must be given at an early stage.  How many marriages end up in court due to lack of such advisory services is still very much a matter of speculation.  Here we are concerned only with dealing with people who need an easier and faster way of obtaining the reliefs provided for their problems by the law.  The court system needs to be a developing and an evolving one to keep pace with the needs of the people it serves.  The Minister has emphasised in his speech that one of the principal aims of the Bill before the House is to enlarge the jurisdiction in family law matters in order to provide easier access to the courts.  I will therefore confine my remarks to the two sections, sections 5 and 15, which deal with the law as it relates to family matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 proposes to give to the Circuit Court the jurisdiction that up to now has been vested in the High Court to grant on petition a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> which means literally from bed and board and contrasted with divorce <i>ex vincula</i> which is forbidden by the Constitution and means literally breaking of the chain or total dissolution of the marriage. A person who obtains a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is discharged from all matrimonial obligations to his or her spouse but may not remarry.  The granting of this jurisdiction to the Circuit Court will make it easier to obtain this type of relief. <Col N="1582" /> If a couple, for example, from Dingle want to obtain a divorce, they can now do so at a local Circuit Court rather than having to travel to the High Court in Dublin.  This, of course, will also result in an increase in the number of such petitions sought.</P>
    <P>If the Circuit Court is to have the jurisdiction to grant divorce, it follows that it should also have jurisdiction in matters concerning custody and guardianship of children.  This constitutional jurisdiction is conferred on the Circuit Court in section 15 of the Bill.  As I read the Bill, the Circuit Court will now have jurisdiction under Part II of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to deal with custody and guardianship matters previously reserved to the High Court and the District Court will now have the power to enforce such orders made under this jurisdiction.  If a mother, for example, is awarded the custody of young children and if their father drives up in a taxi and spirits them away, she may now, as I understand it, apply to the District Court in order to enforce the order rather than wait for the next sitting of the Circuit Court.  The District Court may also make monetary awards in guardianship matters up to £30 per week.</P>
    <P>However, it does appear that the new legislation also gives the District Court jurisdiction to determine fundamental rights defined and protected in express terms by the Constitution.  The constitutional rights of the child, which certainly include the question of its custody, are described in the Constitution in such terms as &ldquo;imprescriptible and antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.  That such rights are now to be adjudicated on by a court of summary jurisdiction could involve that the constitutionality of the measure will be challenged in the courts. All the judicial cases say that the paramount consideration is the welfare and the benefit of the child; and in a tug-of-love situation who is to protect the child except the judge?  Decisions of such fundamental importance need the deep and serious and thorough consideration of a court of competent jurisdiction with experience in such matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> It is appropriate, now that the jurisdiction in custody and guardianship matters is being enlarged, to make two general observations.  It has never been the custom of our courts, and I hope it never will be, for custody of children to be awarded on the basis of the &ldquo;guilt or innocence&rdquo; of the parent.  I use these words in parentheses and in the legal sense only because to me they seem singularly inappropriate in the circumstances. The welfare and benefit of children is the principle on which the Act of 1964 has operated.  Children are not to be regarded as a good conduct prize.</P>
    <P>The second observation I would make is that, in matters concerning their welfare, children have the right to be heard. It can never be assumed that a child is not necessarily the best judge of what is good for him.  In a situation of marital stress, who can tell what the full facts are?  Marriage is a very positive relationship. It either works, or it does not.  Who knows what goes on behind anybody's front door?  For example, a marriage which has become intolerable to the wife because of her husband's alcoholism or drunkenness does not necessarily impinge to anything like the same extent on the lives of her children.  Not every drunken father sends his family scuttling for shelter under their beds when he appears.  In fact, the children may blame their mother for breaking up their home and they may resent her for it.  Children, as Oscar Wilde said in one of his less sentimental moments, begin by loving their parents, then they judge them; rarely, if ever, do they forgive them; and it is one of the most salutary lessons for parents to realise that they have exchanged the unquestioning affection of their babies for the harsher judgments of young adults.  Children's judgments of their parents, although harsh, are invariably valid and should not be discounted in custody matters.  Children can also, quite successfully, resist the emotional blackmail of their parents to make them take sides in marital squabbles.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters of a more complex, though not necessarily of a more important nature, that have been <Col N="1584" /> dealt with more than adequately in the debate.  I welcome the measures in the Bill which are designed to make the courts more accessible to people who need the relief of the law.  But it is a sad commentary on the state of our family laws that most of the Bills going through the House, including this one, are mainly concerned with the need to protect the individual members of the family from one another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, suggested that the Bill would make it easier for the citizen to have access to justice.  This reminds us how very nominal a lot of our rights and freedoms are. In a parliamentary democracy we are still in a stage of development. People talk about freedom of speech and freedom of travel, ignoring the fact that for most people these are freedoms more illusory than real, that very few people, in fact, can benefit from these so-called freedoms.  And so it is with the question of equality.</P>
      <P>Equality of opportunity in education still has to be achieved in many respects. Perhaps, of all equality deficiencies, so to speak, most important is inequality before the law.  Indeed, it is not too cynical a view to maintain that, in many respects, the law and justice protect society as it is, protects the <i>status quo</i>, and the ordinary citizen is frequently in a very difficult and unjust position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the law.  He finds physical access to the law difficult, as has been pointed out in this debate.  If the justice he seeks is geographically remote from him, it militates against the citizen of poor means and, more generally, the ordinary citizen does not as yet have anything like financial access to justice, educational access to justice in the sense that many citizens simply do not understand what the law is all about, but perhaps most of all, the ordinary citizen is at a psychological disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> the law and the courts.  Equality before the law is still very much an aspiration, not a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without wishing to cast aspersions on my legal colleagues here, it seems that the legal profession itself frequently carries <Col N="1585" /> some measure of responsibility for the fact that we do not have real equality before the law.  One only has to go by chance into any average court session to realise what an extraordinary, archaic atmosphere confronts the ordinary citizen when he goes to court.  The practitioners of the law, from the judge to the legal men who plead before him, seem to be participating in some strange, archaic ritual, using mandarin language and there is a general atmosphere of mediaeval flummery that must surely add to the ordinary citizen's distress in what must be, for him in any case, a traumatic experience. Senator Cassidy touched on this aspect of our courts in her contribution.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting at the moment to note that journalists who are attending the Stardust tribunal have pointed out that, despite the great contrast in education, class and accent between the lawyers and the witnesses, nevertheless, the absence of the usual flummery &mdash; the fact that the members of the tribunal are not clad in legal robes and so on &mdash; has to a great extent established an easier atmosphere at the tribunal and has caused the witnesses to feel at ease.</P>
    <P>I have read with interest the contributions of Senators on the last day and, like Senators Harney and Cassidy, I feel like Saint Paul, who used to use the phrase occasionally &ldquo;speaking as one less wise&rdquo;. One hesitates to venture into this regiment of lawyers.  At the same time, a number of points are of general interest. I am not convinced by the argument that the retention of civil juries in cases where compensation is to be decided is a disadvantage. That argument appears to be made from a particular interested standpoint. It is not a convincing argument to say that they have done away with it in England since World War II.  I appreciate many of the objections or, at least, the reservations many Senators have about the Bill, and I share their objections to the present state of squalor in our courtrooms, to the fact that family law is being dealt with very unsuitably and under very inappropriate circumstances.</P>
    <P>I also share their disquiet at what was already proverbial in Shakespeare's time&mdash;the law's intolerable delay.  It is <Col N="1586" /> incredible that accident claims should drag on for three or four years, for example. I also share the general disappointment at the inadequacies of the free legal aid scheme.  However all these reservations do not seem adequate reasons for not welcoming this Bill.  At the very least, it is a move in the direction of decentralisation of our legal system, and that alone is a good thing.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have a long way to go in making access to justice available to all citizens.  This is only a small step, but it is certainly welcome.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Bill should give people more convenient and cheaper means of help, but as a person in public life for quite a number of years down the country I wonder if this Bill will help when you see the troubles people have with the smallest problem. However, I thank the Minister for at least trying.  It is hard for an outsider like myself to speak on this Bill.  It should help to avoid some of the delays that the Minister is concerned about.  However, even if the Minister does all he hopes to do, will the professional people serving in the field change with this obviously badly needed Bill?</P>
      <P>My father-in-law, the late Senator T. V. Honan, during his long and distinguished public life gave advice to people who came to him with some problem with the law, saying &ldquo;Live without letting them know you are around&rdquo;.  I wonder was he right?  Firstly, the whole scene of the courthouse, courtroom or some of the places that were described here last week certainly need improvement.  At any price, the person with some of the problems would prefer to stay outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing was confirmed in my mind in this House last week, when I listened to, I think, five lawyers, solicitors or barristers of the other side speaking and only one lawyer from this side, that I certainly was a member of the party of the people and that I am at the right side of the House.  I liked Senator Cooney's reference to the fact that all top jobs in the legal world were made by the Government and that he was so glad to see this work so well.  Of course it does work well, <Col N="1587" /> because any Government, no matter who they are, will put the right people in such responsible jobs, whatever party they may belong to.</P>
    <P>It will take time to see if what the Minister has tried to do today in this Bill will make it less difficult, less time-consuming and less expensive for the ordinary man and woman to have recourse to the courts, instead of waiting sometimes up to two months, as I well know.  This has happened to people who have come to me with some of their problems.  Then they go to a solicitor or some such person and arrive back to me again, to try to find the answer.</P>
    <P>May I make a suggestion to the Minister? I do not know whether I am in order&mdash;usually I am not&mdash;but I am going to make the suggestion anyway.  May I suggest after this Bill is passed, that the Minister have published a booklet like the Summary on Social Insurance from the Department of Social Welfare, so that people will know the improvements that he has tried to bring to their world and to the world of law.  This Bill affects the lives of a lot of people.  There is a great mystique about the world of solicitors and lawyers which frightens ordinary persons, the people that I deal with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it succeeds. The Department of Social Welfare booklet is an excellent one.  Every ordinary person like myself can read and understand it.  I suggest that the Minister might do something like that in his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate and I am glad that the Bill has been welcomed generally by both sides of the House, though there may be differences on some aspects of it.  I will try to deal with the general points that have been raised in the course of the debate, but will leave matters of more detailed importance for Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to make clear to Senators the nature of this Bill.  It is a jurisdiction Bill, whose aim is to make new arrangements as to the courts in which the remedies which the law provides <Col N="1588" /> at present can be taken.  The aim in doing this is primarily to make it easier for people to obtain access to these remedies, and a side-effect will be to relieve pressure on the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a Family Law Bill in a sense and it does not purport to deal with substantive family law.  It does not, and is not intended to, alter the nature of existing remedies, or create new ones.  Its principal contribution to the development of family law in this country will be to make remedies, which are at present available only in a diffuse and fragmented way, more easily accessible to those who require them.  This will be brought about by drawing together in a rational way the remedies which relate to family strife and marital breakdown, and giving jurisdiction in these matters to courts which sit in venues throughout the country where costs are reasonable and procedures are uncomplicated.  The Circuit Court is to have jurisdiction in relation to all this &ldquo;package&rdquo;, the District Court will have an appropriately limited jurisdiction to grant all these remedies except divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i></P>
    <P>The Bill has been criticised by a number of Senators because it does not make substantive changes in the law relating to various remedies.  I would like to point out once again that it is a Courts Bill, not a Family Law Bill, and it would be most inappropriate in the context of a Bill of this type to make that sort of change. That does not mean, of course, that the important aspects of substantive law are being neglected.  As Senators are aware, there are two Bills before the Oireachtas dealing with some of these cases.</P>
    <P>Much has also been said about the establishment of special family tribunals and the fundamental question of the suitability of the adversary system for the hearing of family disputes.  The Minister for Justice has dealt with these questions on a number of occasions in the past&mdash;in-deed, he answered a Parliamentary Question on the subject as recently as 2 April (Columns 998 to 100, Question No. 25).  The position is, as he stated, that these questions are being considered by the Committee on Court Practice and <Col N="1589" /> Procedure and by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that, even if we did have a Utopian system with advisers, negotiators, social workers, psychologists, child experts, referees and conciliators at the beck and call of every married couple in the country, we will always need courts jurisdiction for the simple reason that in many, if not most of these cases ultimately the parties are truly in contention.  The time to sift out those who are not in contention, or to change the minds or ways of the parties so that there is contention no longer, is well before the law is invoked&mdash;indeed, some would say that the time in many cases is before the marriage is entered into.  A discussion of such questions is, however, clearly an attempt to broaden the discussion into the area of family breakdown, and that question is far beyond the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Indeed, many of the points raised may well be outside the scope of the law itself. There is a basic fallacy underlying many of the arguments put by Senators.  That is the assumption that the law can be or should be made to be, a means of solving all or substantially all family problems.  It is not, nor can it ever be, that; and it would be wrong to give the impression that all we have to do is to introduce facile changes in the law so as to remedy the situation.  The real danger is that this would only make matters worse.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that much of our court accommodation is in need of modernisation and improvement.  I am grateful to Senator Molony for acknowledging that this unsatisfactory situation is not the fault of this Government alone but something that has developed over a long period of time.  Senators will be aware that responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation, with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities. Senator McGuinness seems to dismiss this as if is were a trivial aspect of the matter; but, of course, any Member of the Oireachtas who has had responsibilities in the area will know from experience that it is at the core of the problem. It is, of course, true that most local <Col N="1590" /> authorities are conscious of their obligations in this regard and the process of improving court accommodation is ongoing. In a number of cases within the past year particular local authorities have provided improved accommodation for District Courts in their areas by obtaining the use of premises such as community halls on a rental basis.</P>
    <P>Quite extensive repairs and improvements are planned for a number of courthouses&mdash;for instance, Kilmainham, Bray, Wicklow and Galway&mdash;and less extensive work is in hands in a number of other locations.  As far as facilities such as consulting and waiting rooms considered desirable for dealing with family law business are concerned, I am not satisfied that the volume of this business will ever be such as to justify the cost of providing these facilities at all court venues.  I think that it would be a useful exercise for Senators who spoke with a certain amount of passion on this aspect to put the matter into perspective.  A statistical analysis of the 1,744 family law cases in 1979 shows that in respect of 257 out of 259 venues outside the Dublin area for which figures are available, in 116 venues there was no such case heard; 34 had one case each; 85 had less than one case on average per sitting, and another 12 had an average of fewer than two cases per sitting.  This leaves only ten venues throughout the country with two or more cases per sitting.</P>
    <P>One solution to this problem might be to direct all family law business to one or two venues in each district where the required facilities either exist already or can be provided without too much difficulty, and this possibility is being examined. Indeed, these facilities have recently been provided at Tralee and Waterford courthouses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the capacity of the courts to absorb the additional business which will accrue as a result of the provisions in this Bill, I repeat here the undertaking already given in the Dáil in this regard: that, if as a result of the close watch I will be keeping on the workloads after the new jurisdiction limits take effect, a need is established for extra judicial posts or staffing, then I will take <Col N="1591" /> the necessary steps to ensure that they are made available.  I am fully satisfied that the available court accommodation can take the additional business, because outside of Dublin none of the accommodation is fully utilised.  The busier provincial venues have more than one courtroom, which gives them ample capacity; and most other District Court accommodation is in use less than one day per month.</P>
    <P>I also repeat that the whole question of courthouse accommodation is being actively pursued at present and, while I am not in a position to give any details of the proposals which may emerge, I can say that these are being pressed forward as quickly as possible and will be brought to the Government without delay.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony had some critical things to say about the civil legal aid scheme which the Minister for Justice introduced over a year ago.  Other Senators also commented on the subject.  As regards the availability of legal aid services, I want, first of all, to make it clear, as the Minister himself has done on numerous occasions already, that there is no intention to limit the number of law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board to seven.  The board intend, and the Government scheme requires, that services under the scheme can be availed of by any person anywhere in the country who is eligible for them.  The initial seven law centres which the board set up merely represent the first phase of their activity. The board have responded already to clear evidence of the need to expand services in Dublin by increasing capacity at their existing two Dublin centres earlier this year and the Minister for Justice gave his consent recently for the establishment of a further large centre in Dublin this year.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the board wish to establish some additional law centres outside Dublin and will be making proposals soon.  In addition the board are empowered under the civil legal aid scheme to make services available in any area on a part-time basis if they consider that to do so would be in the interests of providing reasonable access to legal services for <Col N="1592" /> persons who would otherwise find it difficult to gain access to those services.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board's dynamic approach to the provision of services under the scheme ought to be sufficient assurance for anyone of a firm intention to provide reasonable access to their services on a nationwide basis, and even if this were to involve some people in travelling a distance to avail of these services it should be borne in mind that many people already travel not inconsiderable distances to avail of other services provided by the State.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the scheme of civil legal aid should be widened to include the legal services available from private practitioners hardly conceals the inherent matter of self-interest to the solicitor's profession which has been agitating for this very measure for some time.  This, of course, they are entitled to do.  However, I want to be quite frank about this.  The Government decided against including the private practitioner in the scheme mainly to ensure that the financial effects of the scheme could be kept under control. As the Minister pointed out when opening the Dublin law centres, the Government were concerned at the possibility that, without this feature, the scheme might mushroom into something far beyond the capacity of the community to sustain.  It is hardly necessary to spell out how that could happen, nor do I think it necessary to apologise because the tax-payer's protection arose in the Government's consideration of the matter.</P>
    <P>It has also been asserted that the scheme is inadequate to cater for the needs of persons in the area of family law.  I can only assume that the Senators who make this point are under the impression that in some way the scheme does not extend to some cases in this area or that the financial contributions required are too onerous.  I am informed by the board that &mdash; certainly since the eligibility criteria were altered with effect from 1 February 1981 &mdash; there is no foundation whatsoever for such criticisms.</P>
    <P>There has been also a suggestion that the proposals contained in the Bill have been framed with the object of reducing State spending on the provision of legal <Col N="1593" /> aid.  I have already made it quite clear that the objective of this Bill is to make justice more accessible and less expensive for all potential litigants whether legally aided or not.  If this results in keeping down the cost to the taxpayer of civil legal aid, then it is to be welcomed and I cannot see why Senators should object.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why procedures which were found by an eminent body of lawyers to be unwieldly, over-elaborate and time consuming &mdash; and, <i>ipso facto</i>, expensive &mdash; should suddenly be found justified simply because it is the taxpayer who is to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney expressed the fear that, by giving the Circuit Court the substantially increased jurisdiction proposed, we might run the risk of attracting senior counsel into that court on a much wider scale than at present.  Senator FitzGerald also spoke of the necessity to limit costs if the whole purpose of the Bill was not to be defeated.  I recognised this possibility and I am prepared to face up to the challenge which it presents.  The present statutory position is that the function of fixing scales of costs to be applied in the Circuit Court is a function of the appropriate rule-making body, which is the Circuit Court Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald drew attention to the fact that giving jurisdiction to the Circuit Court in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> will not go very far in relieving the High Court of the burden of work which it has at present.  He is perfectly correct in what he says: the incidence of such cases as a proportion of the total workload of the High Court is negligible.  But I think that we must again come back to the main aim of the proposals in this Bill: that is, to make this and the other remedies more easily accessible to those who require them in the future.  Most of us in public life will be aware of unfortunate domestic situations where one or other of those remedies would have been sought but for the expense of seeking them or the sheer inconvenience of facing a stay in Dublin and leaving one's farm or business untended during the hearing.</P>
    <P>By making divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i><Col N="1594" /> available in the Circuit Court, with the advantages of a local venue, lower costs and straightforward procedures, many more people than at present will be in a position to regard that as a realistic option when considering the best remedy for their difficulties.  It is only reasonable to expect that this Bill, in conjunction with the legal aid scheme, will have a marked impact on the number of cases in the family law area which will actually reach a courtroom, rather than fester under the surface of our society.  The impact of this on work-loads will not be entirely negligible, but, as I have said in another context, this is something which we simply will have to take into account, along with other changes affecting work-loads, when monitoring the effects of these measures in the future.  That is, I am satisfied, the best approach.  It is unfortunate that some of the criticisms levelled at this Bill in the course of this debate seem to indicate that some at least of the learned legal Senators do not appear to have read the basic documents involved.  The jurisdiction proposals before the House are based on recommendations made by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their 20th Interim Report.  This report has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and is available not only to members of the general public but also from the Oireachtas Library.  In that report are contained the answers to some of the specific questions raised by these Senators.</P>
    <P>They complained that there would be no benefit in giving to the Circuit Court jurisdiction in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> as the procedures to be followed in the High Court in this type of action were extremely complicated.  I would direct the Senators' attention to paragraph 21 of the committee's report which deals with this question:</P>
    <P>So far as the recommendation for the vesting in the Circuit Court of jurisdiction in applications for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is concerned it is recommended that the necessary statutory changes should be made to enable this to be done by a civil bill rather than by the complicated form of proceedings <Col N="1595" /> which at present exist in the High Court commencing by way of petition.</P>
    <P>I have indicated on previous occasions, and I will make it clear yet again, that this recommendation is one of many matters which will fall to be considered by the appropriate rule-making body in the interval between the passing of the Bill and the coming into effect of its main provisions.</P>
    <P>I might mention in passing that Senator McGuinness read into the Bill that the guardianship jurisdiction provisions would be excluded from the 12-month moratorium.  That is simply not the case. Section 33 is perfectly clear on the point.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson, in a more general way, referred to the 20th Report and asked whether other &ldquo;professional bodies&rdquo; had made submissions on the proposals in the report.  Once again, the answer is available in the report &mdash; Appendix IV &mdash; and lists the Incorporated Law Society and the body representing her own branch of the legal profession as having made submissions. I regret that Senator Robinson is not here.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion that one can draw from questions such as this is that she has not read the report in question.  This apparently was the position in regard to her attack on the Government's position on the law of domicile which she put on the record of this House on 11 March last and which was based on a totally incorrect claim by Senator Robinson that the Law Reform Commission working paper on the subject contained material to back her stance.  When the commission pointed out publicly that their paper contained no such material, the Senator acknowledged her error in newspaper correspondence, but as far as I am aware nothing has been done until now regarding the record of this House.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some who differ to a greater or lesser degree from what is proposed or some of what is proposed. It is normal that there would not be total unanimity on matters such as these and I have already indicated what <Col N="1596" /> the position is.  I, for one, would consider it unhelpful, to say the least, to engage in Parliament in a review of the position taken by different authorities, particularly named individuals, in this regard. What the Courts Committee have done in formulating their recommendations is to take all the various points of view into account; this is really what they are there for.  Similarly, the Government sought and took into account a wide spectrum of views when arriving at the proposals now before the House.  One Senator seemed to cast an aspersion on the ability and competence of the Courts Committee in this regard.  This I reject immediately. Successive Governments have been well served by the skill and impartiality of the committee and I have no doubt whatsoever that it is a matter of vital public interest that the committee should continue to serve Government, Parliament and the people in this way.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald raised a point as to the increase from £100 to £200 in the limit for valuation of land in Chancery cases. He points out that rateable valuation of land is not affected by inflation, and once again he is correct.  But the point of these proposals is that the new limits, both monetary and valuation, are intended to give to the District and Circuit Courts a substantial real increase in jurisdiction over and above what is necessary to compensate for inflation alone.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spotted what he suspected might be a loophole in section 22, in that a defendant by careful timing of a settlement offer or a lodgment into court might escape from paying any interest before judgment.  I must compliment him on his perspicacity, but I fear I must disappoint him.  The provision at section 22 is substantially the same as a provision in English law, although there are quite significant differences, and my understanding is that techniques of a procedural nature exist in that jurisdiction to ensure that a plaintiff is not hard done by in this respect.  I am not aware of any reason why similar techniques could not evolve here.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of appeals, both the manner of their hearing and the courts in which they are <Col N="1597" /> heard.  As to the suggestion that appeals from decisions of the Circuit Court should be direct to the Supreme Court, I am not convinced that there would be any advantage over the present system of appeal to the High Court: likewise, on the question of appeals by way of transcript alone rather than complete rehearing. These questions raise some fundamental issues, and would also represent a major break with practice as established in the lower courts.  Nonetheless, the points raised by Senators are valid and I would accept that much of the benefit of these proposals would be lost if, in a substantial proportion of cases, there has to be a High Court rehearing.  Of course much will depend on the way in which the High Court will deal in practice with such appeals, and the outcome of the appeals, particularly in the initial stages of the new disposition.  It must be remembered that while appeals will be on a rehearing basis this will be before a judge without a jury and, in addition, the appeals will also be heard locally.  As the Courts Committee pointed out in their 20th Report, such an appeals system has advantages for the litigant.  I have indicated my intention of keeping a close watch on the operation of the courts when the new jurisdiction arrangements take effect, and the suggestions made in this debate will certainly ge among the possible alternatives considered if it appears necessary in the light of experience to modify the appeal procedures. The question of jury trials in civil actions is one which gives rise to forceful arguments both for and against.  The position in this jurisdiction is that there has always been a right to jury trial in High Court civil actions.  This right was done away with in the Circuit Court by the Courts Act, 1971, which incidentally also raised the tort jurisdiction limit to its present level of £2,000.  The main reason for abolisiing civil juries in the Circuit Court was that the right was seldom exercised. Because of the present low level of the Circuit Court jurisdiction relative to the cost of repair or replacement of a motor-car, most running-down actions fall within the jurisdiction of the High Court alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of jury trials in civil actions is one which gives rise to forceful arguments both for and against.  The position in this jurisdiction is that there has always been a right to a jury trial in High Court civil actions. That right was done away with in the Circuit Court by the Courts Act, 1971, which, incidentally, raised the jurisdiction of tort to the level of £2,000.  Because of the present low level of Circuit Court jurisdiction relative to the cost of repair or replacement of a motor car, most running costs fall within the jurisdiction of the High Court alone.  I am sure Senators will agree that the more serious the accident and its effects on those involved, the relatives, the more important it is that the case should be heard in a forum where the jury option can be availed of.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the fundamental nature of the decisions to be made by the District Court under section 15 of the Bill.  There is nothing at all wrong with the District Court dealing with such serious matters.  After all, the District Court can already put somebody in prison for 12 months and that is a serious matter.  We must face up to the fact that the status of the District Court is such that it can deal with custody and guardianship cases.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy made a contribution which I do not consider had any bearing on the Bill in so far as it referred to civil legal aid which has no part or place in this legislation, other than to avail of an opportunity to have a side-swipe at that Civil Legal Aid Board and the system of civil legal aid as introduced by the Government. From that point of view, there was nothing in his contribution which concerned the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan suggested that we get a booklet out.  That is a good suggestion and one I will consider.  It might be premature to propose the publication of such a booklet, immediately after the coming into effect of this Bill.  There are other legislative packages to come before the Houses and be passed.  It might be timely then to consider the publication of such <Col N="1607" /> a booklet and in that context, perhaps involve the Civil Legal Aid Board who I am sure would have a very definite interest. But I take the Senator's point as a worthwhile suggestion.</P>

    <Title>Malicious Injuries Bill, 1980: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on the Second Stage of this Bill. The Bill proposes to consolidate with amendments what is commonly called the malicious injuries code, that is, the statutory basis for the payment out of the rates of compensation for malicious damage to property.  The provisions of the present code are contained in a number of statutes commencing with the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836.  These statutes are listed in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to enter into a discussion of the origins of the code &mdash; to do so would be a pointless exercise &mdash; although I am aware of the criticism that have been levelled at it as being an instrument of colonial subjugation imposed by an alien Government.  On the other hand, there is the view that the code was never intended as such but was primarily intended to deal with the problem of 19th Century agrarian disturbances common to a number of countries.  Whatever its origins, it must be recognised &mdash; and I know that many people do so recognise it &mdash; as having become a non-profit-making and valuable system of communal <Col N="1608" /> insurance against malicious damage to property.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it has been the financing of the code which has given rise to most of the criticism of it which has arisen in recent years.  However, it must be said that the financing of the code has never imposed an excessive burden on ratepayers, and it should not be forgotten that ratepayers themselves whose property was maliciously damaged have benefited under the code.  Up to 1963 the average charge on the rates in respect of malicious injuries did not exceed ½p in the pound for the whole country.</P>
    <P>In more recent years the cost of malicious injuries has increased more in line with increases generally in rates and, by 1979, the annual average charge on the rates had risen to 8p in the pound.  Perhaps a better measure of the incidence of malicious injuries on the rates is the percentage of the total rate attributable to charges in respect of malicious injuries. This has risen from 0.1 per cent in the fifties to 0.8 per cent in 1979.</P>
    <P>In 1974, in order to put a ceiling on ratepayers' liability for malicious injuries compensation, a non-statutory arrangement was introduced whereby if, in any financial year, the cost of compensation to a local authority exceeds the produce of a rate of 20p in the pound the excess is recouped to the local authority from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, provided full relief in relation to payment of rates on domestic and certain other property.  This did not, however, result in increased amounts being payable by those who continued to be liable for rates &mdash; for example, occupiers of agricultural land above a certain valuation and occupiers of industrial or commercial premises, factories, offices and shops.  This is because local authorities are compensated by a grant from the Exchequer equal to the loss in rates income resulting from the relief to ratepayers granted by the Act.</P>
    <P>Since the financial responsibility of local authorities for malicious injuries compensation has been reduced and limited in the ways that I have just mentioned <Col N="1609" /> it might be argued that local authorities should now be relieved of all responsibility for malicious injury compensation. The Government do not accept this argument.  Local authority involvement is a key factor, and this approach is fundamental to the main provisions of the Bill.  The involvement of local authorities means that the services of their professional and other staff can be used at minimal cost in connection with the processing of malicious injury claims and the contesting of such claims in appropriate cases at court hearings.</P>
    <P>To transfer the responsibility to the State would necessitate the establishment of a new and expensive organisation with legal and other specialist staff, probably Dublin-based, which would greatly increase the cost of compensating for malicious injuries, whilst the removal of responsibility from the local authorities would not result in any tangible saving to them by way of staff or accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Malicious Injuries, in a report furnished some years ago, expressed a similar view, which the Government have accepted. Their basic recommendation was to the effect that a system of compensation for malicious injuries to property should be retained and the cost should continue to be payable by local authorities.  The Bill accordingly provides that local authorities will continue to be liable for malicious damage to property, subject to certain exceptions and on the basis that local authorities will be recouped from the Exchequer for any compensation paid in excess of the produce of a rate of 20p in the pound, this being an existing non-statutory arrangement which I have already mentioned and which is being given a statutory basis in section 20 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill proposes to consolidate, with amendments, the law providing for compensation for malicious injuries to property.  The explanatory memorandum, which was circulated to Senators with the text of the Bill, deals in some detail with its provisions and the side notes in the Bill indicate those provisions which are new to the law or new in part.  I shall now outline the main <Col N="1610" /> changes in the law for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>At present all claims for compensation must be heard by the Circuit Court.  A number of these claims are for very small sums.  It is now proposed in section 13 of the Bill that any case where the claim is for a sum not exceeding £2,500 will be dealt with in the District Court.  Senators will be aware that this is the new general limit proposed for District Court contract and tort cases in the Courts Bill, 1980, which was circulated at the same time as this Bill.  Claims for greater amounts will be heard by the Circuit Court, as at present.</P>
    <P>A right of appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court is provided in section 17 and in section 18 there is also provision to have a case stated by the District Court for the opinion of the Supreme Court.  This is in line with the views of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in relation to cases stated in general and as set out in the recommendations of their 11th Report.</P>
    <P>At present compensation is payable where the malicious damage exceeds £5. This figure was fixed in 1898.  In 1963 the interdepartmental committee, having noted that the costs involved in the hearing of certain cases were greater than the amount of the claims themselves and that there was an undue number of trivial cases, recommended that compensation should be payable only where damage exceeds £20.  Section 5(1) of the Bill proposes that the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; should be raised to £100.  This is being done so as to take account of the fall in the value of money since 1963.  In Northern Ireland the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; figure was increased from £20 in 1971 to £100 in 1977.  Section 26 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by order vary the amount of the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; figure.  There is no equivalent provision in the present law.</P>
    <P>Another innovation as far as our law is concerned is the provision in section 12(2) prohibiting the award of compensation in respect of the first £100 of any claim so that no applicant may suffer a reduction in respect of more than one <Col N="1611" /> claim for the same property as a result of actions occurring during any period of 12 months.  There is a similar provision in Northern Ireland.  It is a common practice with insurance companies to provide for exclusions of this type in their policies.  In our present malicious injuries code, however, there is no such provision: if the damage exceeds £5, compensation for the full amount, including the first £5 may be awarded.  I believe that the logic behind the proposed provision is clear.  In the absence of such a provision a person who suffered damage amounting to say £99 would not be entitled to any compensation, whereas a person who suffered damage amounting to £101 would be entitled to the full amount.</P>
    <P>Compensation for malicious damage to property in coastal waters is another matter in relation to which the Bill makes provision for a change in the law.  Until 1979, compensation for damages to property in coastal waters was not payable under the Malicious Injuries Code.  In that year, in an unreported case, Brown v Donegal County Council, the Supreme Court held that by reason of section 685 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, where a vessel is maliciously damaged while lying off the coast, compensation may be recovered from the county off which she lies.  Section 685 of the 1894 Act deals with jurisdiction over vessels &ldquo;being on, or lying or passing off&rdquo; a coast or &ldquo;being in or near&rdquo; a bay, channel and so on.  On the one had, the present law as it stands following the 1979 Supreme Court decision is too restrictive as its coverage is limited to malicious damage to &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As defined in the 1894 Act a &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; is any ship or boat or other description of vessel used in navigation and may not, for example, cover such things as fixed offshore navigation lights, drilling rigs or equipment used in fish farming operations. On the other hand, the distance from the coast within which malicious damage to a vessel will qualify for compensation is too imprecisely described by the terms &ldquo;lying off or passing off the coast,&rdquo; and so on that are used in section 685 of the 1894 Act.  It is for these reasons <Col N="1612" /> that section 5(3) of the Bill, provides that damage to property which is within any harbour or within one mile beyond the coastal boundary of a local authority will qualify for compensation.</P>
    <P>I should mention, too, that the interdepartmental committee recommend that the area of liability of local authorities should be extended to include coastal waters.  The committee's recommendation was not restricted to any particular kind of property nor did they define what they meant by coastal waters.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill provides that local authorities against whom claims are brought will be empowered to settle the claims out of court and to lodge money in court.  These are new provisions in so far as the malicious injuries code is concerned and they follow the procedure that obtains in ordinary civil actions. They are intended to encourage the settlement of claims for compensation before the case comes before the court thus saving the time of the courts and reducing the liability of local authorities for costs.  Another advantage will be that persons whose property has been maliciously damaged and who agree to a settlement will receive payment of compensation much sooner than they would under the present code.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the repeal without re-enactment of the local levy provision in the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836 whereby the court may direct that the cost of meeting compensation for malicious injuries will be levied on the rates of a particular small locality such as a parish or townland.  This is undoubtedly a punitive provision that was designed to bring their civic responsibility home to the people of a particular area in cases where the court was convinced that some, at least, of them had been involved in or privy to communal activity leading to the malicious damage giving rise to the claim for compensation.  With the abolition of rates on domestic property, circumstances in this regard have changed completely and the retention of a provision in the law enabling a local levy to be imposed on the rated occupiers of non-domestic property such as shops and factories <Col N="1613" /> in a small locality would be clearly inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Compensation for property stolen in the course of a riot is provided for in England and in Northern Ireland.  There is no similar provision in Irish law at present.  Section 6 of the Bill is designed to cover such cases.  It provides for payment of compensation in respect of loss of property which is unlawfully taken from a building during the course of a riot in which other property is also maliciously damaged.  This provision is included in the Bill because a property owner in such circumstances is at the mercy of the wrongdoers and normally he cannot secure insurance cover to protect himself against loss or damage caused by persons riotously assembled. The provision extends to a riot on board a ship which is in a harbour or within one mile of shore.  It may be observed that section 5 provides for compensation for damage caused to property during a riot whereas section 6 provides for compensation for property that is stolen during a riot.</P>
    <P>Under the present law, an award of compensation cannot be paid until the local authority have included the amount in its estimates for the following year and the rate has been levied and collected. This means that &mdash; apart from any other delays &mdash; there can be a time-lag of almost two years between the occurrence of the damage and the actual payment of the award.  Section 11 of the Bill which provides for the payment on foot of a court award of compensation &lsquo;out of the funds&rsquo; of the local authority will have the effect of reducing the time-lag very considerably &mdash; by a year or more in many cases.</P>
    <P>In order to close a loophole in the Bill as initiated I introduced amendments in the Dáil which will prevent an applicant from obtaining compensation &ldquo;on the double&rdquo;.  These provisions are in section 12(3)(C) and 19.</P>
    <P>There are a few other proposed changes in the law that should be mentioned at this stage.  Three of these changes will have the effect of providing an entitlement to compensation for malicious damage in cases where such compensation <Col N="1614" /> is not payable under the present law.  First is a new provision in section 5 which classifies damage caused in the course of the committing of a crime as malicious damage for the purpose of the legislation.  An amendment introduced in the Dáil ensures that the crime involved must be one against the property damaged and not just any crime.  Damage caused for the purpose of committing a crime, which is covered in the present law, is also provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>The second change is provided for in section 2 where &ldquo;property&rdquo; is defined, for the purpose of this legislation, as including incorporeal hereditaments which are not covered by the present law on compensation for malicious damage. The effect of this new definition of property is that malicious damage to <i>inter alia</i> rights of fishing, shooting or herbage will qualify for compensation, as was recommended by the Interdepartmental Committee on Malicious Injuries.  Destruction of a fishery, for example, may cause more damage to be done to those who hold the fishing rights and whose living is threatened by the damage than to the landlord who, under the present law, is entitled to recover compensation for damage to the river bed.</P>
    <P>The third change, which is provided for in section 7, relates to compensation for damage that is caused by a person of unsound mind or by a child.  Under the present code compensation is excluded where damage is caused by a person of unsound mind or by a child under the age of seven years; the position in regard to chtildren between seven and 14 is doubtful, because many of the decisions relating to children of this age are apparently conflicting.  From the age of 14 years on, a person has full criminal responsibility. There is no justification for the exclusion from the scope of the Bill of damage caused by persons of unsound mind or by children, that is, those under 14 years of age.  Section 7 will, accordingly, allow persons whose property is damaged in this way to qualify for compensation.  In this regard, I should mention that personal injuries inflicted by children and by persons of unsound mind are covered by the non-statutory scheme of compensation <Col N="1615" /> for personal injuries criminally inflicted that was introduced by the Minister for Justice in 1974.</P>
    <P>Other proposed changes in the law will have the effect of reducing or excluding compensation in certain cases.  Section 12 of the Bill provides that compensation will not be payable in respect of damage to or loss of coins, currency notes, postal orders, money orders or stamps or in respect of damage to or loss of articles of personal ornament, including watches and jewellery if these articles are kept otherwise than as part of stock-in-trade. To prove or disprove the existence of such items can be difficult, if not impossible, and it can be difficult to prove or disprove exactly when and in what circumstances an item of personal ornament is damaged or lost.  There is, therefore, the danger of fraudulent claims being made in respect of these items.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also provides for the reduction or exclusion of compensation where the applicant did not take reasonable precautions to avoid the damage or loss or reasonable steps to minimise the extent of it or where he himself bears some responsibility for it.  A number of local authorities have requested the inclusion of a provision of this type.  The same section provides that compensation will not be payable in respect of damage to a structure which is erected in contravention of, or otherwise does not conform to the requirements of the Planning Acts. Apart from these instances there are, as I mentioned earlier, other provisions which will have the effect of limiting the financial liability of local authorities, namely, their recoupment from the Exchequer for any compensation they pay in excess of the produce of a rate of 20p in the £; the raising of the threshold figure for payment of compensation to £100; and the exclusion of compensation for the first £100 of damage.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of procedural changes of a minor nature, details of which are given in the Explanatory Memorandum.  The need for these changes has become apparent from experience over the years and Senators will, I trust, agree that they can more appropriately <Col N="1616" /> be dealt with during Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, however, there are a few points that should be brought to the attention of the House.  The provisions in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill which exclude compensation for any loss consequential on the actual damage or loss will make no change in the present law. In 1975 the Supreme Court disallowed a claim in respect of consequential loss.  In the case in question the actual damage amounted to £29,000 while the claim for consequential loss amounted to £220,000.  It can be seen that if the Bill were to provide for consequential loss the financial implications for public funds could be serious.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the Bill does not cover compensation for criminal injury to the person.  In 1974 a non-statutory scheme, financed from State funds was introduced.  Under that scheme payment of compensation may be made on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis in respect of personal injuries, fatal and non-fatal directly attributable to a crime of violence or to circumstances arising from the action of the victim in assisting, or attempting to assist in the prevention of a crime or in the saving of human life.  The scheme is administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal and has operated satisfactorily.  The Minister for Justice will however, be reviewing the scheme to see whether it is necessary to make any changes in it and also to see whether it should not be put on a statutory basis.  There is a provision in section 10(2) of the Bill which entitles a ratepayer to appear and be heard at the court hearing of an application for compensation in which his local authority is involved. Related provisions concerning a rate-payer's right to intervention in such proceedings occur in sections 15, 17 and 18.</P>
    <P>It was suggested during the debate on the Bill in the Dáil that, because many persons have the legal status of ratepayers although no longer actually paying rates and because the Exchequer contribution to local authorities is now so great, these rights should be given to a wider sector of the community, say taxpayers generally.  I do not see that there is any <Col N="1617" /> need to do this.  The Government's view is that, on balance, to provide for the continuance of the ratepayers' rights, as is proposed in the Bill, is the best course. Since what is involved is a right which is provided for in the present law, and even though I understand that, in the past, few ratepayers exercised this right, I think that, as a matter of principle, we should be slow to interfere with it while there still remains the possibility &mdash; though a diminishing one &mdash; that it could be usefully invoked.  It would be open to any member of the public who has information concerning an incident that gives rise to a claim for compensation to communicate with either party to the proceedings and it would be open to that party to call him as a witness.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly technical Bill and one on which speakers would have more to offer on Committee Stage than on Second Stage.  There are some points of importance that the Minister has proposed to change in the malicious injuries code and there are matters in the Bill of a specific nature upon which I would like to touch.</P>
      <P>The most significant aspect of the Minister's contribution was the absence of any acknowledgement of the frightening increase we have seen in recent years in the number of people who now apply to local authorities for compensation for malicious injuries to their property.  The last figures available are contained in the Garda Commissioner's Report in 1978. Regarding offences against property with violence, in 1975 there were 16,432 such cases and in 1978 there were 21,119 cases. With a rate of increase like that we can expect that, when the 1980 figures finally become available, we will see that frightening rate of increase continuing as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a simple fact of urban development in recent years, not limited to this country, that vandalism of this nature seems to go hand-in-hand with urban development. Clearly there are reasons for this and the Minister in his reply might give some indication as to what plans he has <Col N="1618" /> to reduce the demands for compensation for damage done to property.  I know he is concerned about it but I am a little surprised that he did not refer to this problem in his speech.  The Minister should tell us what plans he has to deal with the problem of vandalism among young people in the Dublin area and in other city areas throughout this country. It is a very serious problem.  I am sure there are reasons for it which could be tackled if they had been identified.  I know that many groups, particularly those who are concerned with town planning and development of housing estates and with the needs of young people within those housing estates, have offered ideas as to the cause of this vandalism. The Government must have considered some of the reports on this matter and I would like to know whether they have any plans to deal with it.  I am sure it is not their intention to let the problem continue to fester before tackling the root of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a consolidating measure, although there are some adjustments. The Minister is tinkering around with an old system that came to us in its present form 150 years ago.  Although I can sympathise with the Minister because of the limited resources he has and the pressure to introduce all sorts of reforming measures every couple of weeks, it is a pity that a more comprehensive look was not taken at this whole malicious injuries code.  Reference has been made in the Minister's speech to the arguments on both sides.  As Senators are aware, this was originally introduced as a system of insurance but also as a penal system to force members of the community, where damage was done, to pay for the damage done.  The landed gentry or the people of property were the beneficiaries of the system.  It is a good idea to have a system of compulsory communal insurance, but we should not try to adopt an old system to suit this purpose.</P>
    <P>I see no reason whatever why local authorities should have any liability in this area.  Dozens of cases have gone through the courts where local authorities have been fixed with liability for damage done to property in their area, even <Col N="1619" /> though it has been known to the court making the award that the miscreants who caused the malicious damage have come from outside the area of the local authority.  There is the famous case of a couple of Dublin lads who stole a CIE bus which got them as far as Drogheda, when they tried to drive it under a bridge which had the capacity to take only a single-decker bus.  Having removed the upper deck of the bus the lads were caught and the matter duly came before the Circuit Court.  Louth County Council had to suffer the cost of compensating CIE.</P>
    <P>If CIE choose to bring a crowd of people to a football match in Thurles and several plate-glass windows are broken in the town, there is no reason why the people of Thurles or North Tipperary should have to pay for the damage.  That is what this system envisages.  I regret that the Minister has not used this opportunity to change that.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been moves to take the financial pressure off local authorities because of some very big claims.  In order to achieve this a limit was introduced some years ago on the amount for which a local authority could be fixed with liability.  This now becomes a statutory rule.  What is the sense of it? If the local authority have no responsibility in the matter at all, in that it was not somebody from their jurisdiction who caused the trouble, then there is no logic in fixing them with the liability.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made the valid point that the local authority have on their administrative staff engineers who can go out and inspect the damage and make an assessment as to what the amount of the damage is.  They also have staff who can process claims.  It may be cheaper to use that local administration rather than introduce a special section within the Department of the Environment in Dublin. If the Minister wants to do that, then he should ask the local authorities to provide that service and pay the local authorities for their work on a consultancy basis.  That is the way to do it.  The Minister apparently doubts the loyalty of the local authorities around the country <Col N="1620" /> because he has a provision in the Bill that if a local authority are to fight a case they will pay all the costs, no matter how big those costs.  There are very important points of law that arise in these malicious injury cases.  I am glad to say there will not be as many in the future because of changes that have been brought about in this measure.  Those points of law can find their way through the courts right up to the Supreme Court.  It can cost local authorities tens of thousands of pounds in investigation and subsequently in the employment of legal counsel and in connection with witnesses.  It might have to go to several courts before the decision is ultimately made.</P>
    <P>The local authority would be responsible for all those costs.  That is where the inequity comes in, as far as the local authorities are concerned.  It is illogical and irrational that the local authorities should have such a liability.  That system should be changed and I regret that the Minister has not chosen to change it in this measure.  On Committee Stage we will bring forward amendments in this respect.  This measure has a theme running through it that is common to another Bill, the Courts Bill which we will be discussing in the not too distant future, and the greater jurisdiction in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I am not fussed one way or the other whether the District Court or Circuit Court deals with malicious injury applications but I think it is wrong to split the jurisdiction between two courts.  Where matters like this can be dealt with by one court, it does not matter what amount is involved, let it be dealt with by one court. This is a very particular procedure that is at present provided for in our Circuit Court rules.  No matter how large the original claim, it has always been brought before the Circuit Court; it has never been seen to be necessary to bring it before the High Court, for example. Even when the jurisdiction of the District Court was £250, if you wanted to apply for £80 compensation for damage for malicious injury, you applied to the Circuit Court.  The reason for that seemed to be very simple.  It meant there were some staff members in the Circuit Court <Col N="1621" /> office who understood the system, were familiar with the procedure and could process claims more easily.  Why impose that burden now on the staffs of two courts?  Why not leave it within the jurisdiction of one court, whether it be the District Court or the Circuit Court, and let matters continue on their way?  This is a more efficient use of resources and will make for more efficient use of our entire legal system.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on a most important step he has taken, that is, he has given the local authorities the right to settle these claims out of court. For years this crazy system involved local authorities in enormous costs.  Every case, no matter how obviously malicious the damage involved, had to go before the Circuit Court.  When we think of the cost of providing a Circuit Court judge, the cost of barristers' and solicitors' time, the cost of witnesses waiting in court and the delays these malicious injury applications for sums between £5 and £100, used to cause, we realise this was the most appalling abuse of our legal system. I want to compliment the Minister on taking this step and giving the local authorities the right to go out to assess the damage and, if the damage is malicious, enabling them to settle the claims and thereby avoid the necessity to go to court.  To that extent, this measure is very welcome.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which are more appropriate to Committee Stage. There is one of some importance &mdash; the Minister might like to respond to it in his reply &mdash; but I do not know how we are going to approach it on Committee Stage. There is a provision in this Bill that, where a claim is made in respect of property for which planning permission was not sought, the applicant would not be entitled to be compensated.  That provision is a little strict.  It would happen that someone for a technical reason might not have received planning permission.  I can imagine circumstances in which a property might undergo a change of user and a person might very well believe he did not have to apply for planning permission. Under our present planning laws a private individual is entitled to add a <Col N="1622" /> kitchen or scullery to the back of his house and, provided he is not in excess of a certain square footage, planning permission is not required.  But, say poor Seán Citizen extends his house by half a square foot beyond the entitled measure, vandals set fire to this building maliciously and the local authority engineer comes to investigate a malicious injuries claim, and he discovers the extension is half a foot larger than it should be, that planning permission was not sought, that therefore it was an unauthorised development and that the person is not entitled to compensation.  That type of case should not be excluded under this section. Although I am well aware that hard cases make bad law, I do not think that is a valid reply to the question I have raised.</P>
    <P>Our planning laws in many respects are complicated.  Many developments that take place are ordinary small developments. Thousands of instances of change of user of properties occur weekly in respect of which people do not seek planning permission because they genuinely believe they do not require it.  It is a little harsh when someone suffers a malicious damage and he is not entitled to compensation merely because of that.  If an application for planning permission had been made and lodged and, say, one of the conditions of planning permission had reduced the potential for fire hazards, or something like that, then there is a definite connection between the two.  There is every reason in the world why somebody who does not go through the proper procedures should suffer under this measure.  In a case where somebody is careless and erects a structure, and even when the damage caused is not exaggerated or exacerbated by the absence of planning permission or proper planning, that person should be penalised because he had not obtained planning permission. This Bill proposes as a general, absolute rule that that is wrong and I urge the Minister to consider some relaxation in this provision to give the judge who will deal with the case some discretion in the matter.</P>
    <P>There are other points but they are not of great importance.  I will wind up by <Col N="1623" /> mentioning a point I will be making on the Courts Bill.  In his reply to the Second Reading debate on the Courts Bill the Minister said he was waiting to see whether the District Court would get busier. If he multiplies by two-and-a-bit the work of any office, he can be assured that they are going to get busier.  The jurisdiction of the District Court is very limited at present.  It is now planned to give them the entire workload of the Circuit Court and, in this measure, to add to that workload not just a greater jurisdiction than it had before, but a completely new code. I can foresee enormous problems arising in the District Court.  If the Minister is not aware of that fact, let him get into his car, drive around the country and stop at any District Court clerk's office and ask him if his office has the capacity, the ability and the resources to take on a multiplied workload.  I think the Minister will get such an answer that he will come back and have a rethink of the provisions in some of these Bills that are being filtered through the House today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is because I am also a legal practitioner that many of the things I would like to say about the Bill are somewhat similar to what Senator Molony said.  I welcome this Bill in many ways because it will improve the system that operates at present. In particular, section 11, which allows for the payment of compensation out of the funds, will cut down on the inordinate delays which occurred up to now.  If the Bill did nothing else but this, it would still be taking a very big step forward.  I also feel that the right to settle out of court is a very important step forward. This is quite clear when one listens to the list of malicious injuries claims a judge has to go through &mdash; literally hundreds of claims which basically are settled claims and are simply processed through the courts because technically they have to be processed through the courts.  To take all these cases out of the courts will make an enormous difference and will greatly improve the system.  The sections dealing with compensation for damage to hereditaments, fisheries, and <Col N="1624" /> so on, is important because quite an amount of malicious damage has been done to fish farms, fisheries and so on which, perhaps, did not quite come within the present scheme.  Damage done by children, particularly children aged between seven and 14 years, is a very grey area.  One could find that for damage which was definitely malicious one could not be compensated because of the age of the person who committed the damage. Alas, we know only too well that in this urban vandalism, very often it is carried out by children between the ages of seven and 14.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer, like Senator Molony, to the provision in regard to the Planning Acts.  I join him in asking that there be some kind of establishment of a <i>mens rea</i> in this area.  Where a person has deliberately put up a structure in defiance of the Planning Acts and it is then damaged, one can understand the justification for the provision in the Bill because that person was deliberately acting in defiance of the law.  It could happen that it was an accidental infringement of which the person was unaware or that the property had, perhaps, passed to that person from somebody else although I know that now when actual title passes, the planning permission position is always cleared up.  Still, there are times when property is passed from hand to hand within a family without a proper voluntary assignment or voluntary conveyance being entered into.  The person in charge of the property when it was damaged might not, in fact, be the person who had defied the law about the planning permission.  Some form of discretion should be included so that the innocent are not penalised under this section.  That would be an improvement in the Bill.  It does not worry me very much where the origins of this legislation came from.  I recognise, of course, its historical origins but as long as it works properly today to compensate those who have unfortunately suffered from malicious injuries it does not matter what they are.  I agree that it continues to serve a very useful purpose as a communal insurance against this type of damage.  As such I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators Molony and McGuinness for their contributions on the Second Stage.  Senator Molony referred to the fact that I made no reference to the serious increase in malicious injury claims in recent years.  In fact, I did in my Second Stage speech.  I indicated that clearly there was an increase in the number of malicious injury awards in recent times. It is regrettable that it is as a direct result of the level of violence that this has happened. Senator Molony also required me to go into some detail regarding proposals to deal with the causes of crime or vandalism.  I do not propose to do that because I do not consider that has any relevance or bearing on the Bill.  The Senator mentioned also the removal of responsibilities from local authorities.  He said that central Government should pay local authorities.  The system which operates at present is a suitable, satisfactory method.  In one instance, as I stated, administrative and technical facilities are available in local authorities which can be readily and easily availed of.  From an investigative point of view there is also the facility in local authority areas of the proximity to the scene of the crime of the malicious injury.  There is a greater likelihood that the investigating officers and the technical staff involved would be more familiar with the countryside, the circumstances or facts which might have a bearing on the matter.  The right of settlement was raised by Senator McGuinness.  The question of early payment is also important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question about unauthorised buildings not coming within the scope of the proposed legislation was also raised. I appreciate the difficulty raised by Senators Molony and McGuinness in this regard.  I agree that there is a possibility, however faint, that one might have a circumstance or a remote situation where a building could come into the possession of somebody who would not be aware of or familiar with the fact that it was an unauthorised building.  On Committee Stage we will discuss that.  I will have a look at that in the meantime.  In that connection we should realise that where <Col N="1626" /> a building is an unauthorised building there is the right of the owner or occupier to apply for retention.  If retention is granted by the local authority or by An Bord Pleanála on appeal, that would rectify the position.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 2 there are four amendments which are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1) (b), page 3, line 24, <Col N="1627" /> to delete &ldquo;£15,000&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;£10,500&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The arguments here are fairly obvious. We discussed on Second Stage at some length some of the problems arising in relation to the capacity of the lower courts to deal with the extra work or the new work that is being given to them. The Minister made reference on several occasions in the course of his reply to the Second Reading to the views of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. Indeed he went so far as to accuse some of us of not having read the report.  I can assure him as far as I am concerned, and I am sure as far as all my colleagues on this side of the House are concerned, that we read the report but we did not conclude our reading at the end of page 15 of the report.  We went on and we studied the minority views expressed by some of the committee members.</P>
    <P>The proposal here in section 2, in so far as the Circuit Court is concerned, goes a good deal further than the proposals of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  The committee were concerned in their majority report that the levels of jurisdiction that existed in the Circuit Court had become quite unrealistic because of inflation.  I accept that and sympathise with it.  I agree with it. The minority view published in the report made some very important points in relation to these matters.  I do not think that I should go into them all now, but the basic point was made that sometimes, even though cases may involve in monetary terms relatively low sums of money, they can require detailed consideration of important points of law.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that we must look on the Circuit Court as having some limit. The majority view of the committee suggested a ceiling of £10,000 in the Circuit Court.  The minority view disagreed with that and said that it should be £5,000 in the Circuit Court.  You can make arguments in favour of both sides.  Though I sympathise with both points of view, I realise that inflation goes on and on and on in a never ending spiral and we need not only to bring it up to date but to allow <Col N="1628" /> for some inflation at least in the immediate and foreseeable future.  I would go along with the view that the Circuit Court jurisdiction should be increased to £10,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes that it should go to £15,000.  He acknowledges that this is away beyond the increase in inflation but makes the point that, in order to improve the accessibility of the courts to people, it is an appropriate measure at this time.  I disagree with that because I do not believe that any proper steps have been taken to examine the capacity of the Circuit Court&mdash;and, when we come to discuss it, the District Court&mdash;to take on these new jurisdictions.  The fact is that there are matters of considerable importance that may involve some funds between £10,000 and £15,000 that require the experience and the wisdom of judges of the High Court rather than judges of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, Senator FitzGerald made the point on Second Stage that there are many cases involving the sort of potential awards that require the attention of juries and that many people &mdash;Senator Cooney made this point also on Second Stage&mdash;would prefer to have the assessment of damages dealt with by 12 of their peers rather than by a judge sitting on his own.  There are arguments on both sides.  I accept that but I am not at all convinced by the arguments brought forward by the Minister for Justice in the Lower House or the Minister of State in this House as to why the increase should be 50 per cent more than suggested by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and 150 per cent more than proposed by the minority view in the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  In these circumstance I must urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended in their 20th Interim Report that the limit of the Circuit Court's jurisdiction in contract and tort be increased from £2,000 to £10,000.  At the time they made this recommendation the committee were unaware of the proposal elsewhere in this <Col N="1629" /> Bill to increase the maximum <i>solatium</i> figure&mdash;the amount awarded in fatal accidents to the deceaseds' relatives as compensation for mental distress&mdash;from its present limit of £1,000.  In view of the increase in the <i>solatium</i> limit it was decided, after consultation with the Chairman of the Courts Committee, to increase the general tort limit to £15,000. The equivalent today of the existing limit of £2,000 when it was set in 1971 is about £7,200.  The figure of £15,000 proposed in the section represents a real increase to more than twice the level fixed in 1971, whereas the Senator's figure would represent only one and a half times that level.  I am satisfied that, if the proposal is to have any significant impact on the degree of accessibility of the Circuit Court and at the same time make allowance for inflation for some years to come, then the higher rather than the lower figure is the right one.</P>
      <P>I have already described on Second Stage the sort of running-down action which I envisage would fall within the new jurisdiction limit of the Circuit Court.  There is a danger that, if the limit is pitched at any lower figure, the High Court will rapidly become clogged up yet again with cases of this relatively straightforward type.  To allow this to happen would be unfair on all litigants, and for that reason I must oppose these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to come in conflict with Senator Molony because I know that the expression of his views is genuine, but I am amazed that the Senator should attempt to retain the jurisdiction level of £10,500 as opposed to the proposal in the Bill to make it £15,000.  The Senator by advocating the lower limit is merely pushing the situation over to people in the other branch of his profession.  The Senator is creating job opportunity and a situation where the cost and the expense of litigation will be increased because of the lower limit.  People would be forced into the High Court.  I do not think that is what the Senator wants.  I do not genuinely believe that the Senator wants increased costs, but the amendment would bring that about.  Much of <Col N="1630" /> what I envisage, taking the £15,000 limit, would be dealt with in the Circuit Court. To reduce it to £10,500 would be favouring people in another branch of the Senator's profession.  I accept that there was a minority report which contained recommendations from two members in favour of the lower limit.  It would not be in the best interests of the very people for whom we are trying to provide lower cost legal facilities.  For that reason I would suggest that my grounds for opposing the amendment are justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am horrified to hear the reasons given by the Minister.  Let me assure him, first of all, that it is no consideration to me when I give my view in this House as to what the costs or the benefits to any branch of the legal profession would be.  I acknowledge that he has said that it is not my primary motivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to withdraw, after listening to the Senator, that it might now be his motivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that that matter is utterly incidental to the subject, and I have to deal with it now in view of what the Minister has said.  If one were to examine the structure of any legal practice in this country and add or subtract the few pounds of difference that might exist between a Circuit Court award of £11,000 and a High Court award of £11,000, you would be talking about buttons.  If the Minister does not accept that, he should consult a taxing master or somebody who is experienced in the matters of drawing up legal costs.  There may be additional costs in the overall bill because people have to travel up and down to Dublin but that does not benefit solicitors or barristers.  I object to the suggestion that it may motivate my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The views I have offered are those of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and I have asked the Minister to indicate his reasons for the change he is making.  The Minister has given only one reason, that the proposal is to increase the limitation of £1,000 for mental distress under the Civil Liabilty Act, 1961, to £7,500.  I have already welcomed <Col N="1631" /> that proposal.  That is no reason to change it in respect of every other case.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the figures are, but I am quite certain that of all the cases in tort and running down actions that come before the High Court, the number of fatal claims among them must be a very small minority.  I have no doubt about that.  To change the jurisdiction for that reason only is quite illogical and I ask the Minister to think again.</P>
    <P>The Minister's comments in relation to costs are also insignificant in relation to the main problem that we have to deal with here.  It is perfectly all right for the Minister to say that he wants to increase access to justice.  That is a phrase that has been abused in the Lower House and is going to be abused in this House.  Increasing the jurisdiction of our lower courts and doing nothing else will not improve access to justice, because it must diminish the quality of the justice you get.  I do not suggest for one moment that the judges of the lower courts would intentionally provide a lesser quality of justice than that in the High Court.  But we must recognise the fact that the Government, in making their decisions on whom they appoint to the Circuit Court and the High Court, will appoint to the High Court people of greater experience and greater knowledge of the law.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise that when we are dealing with serious cases &mdash; and cases involving sums of £10,000 and £15,000 are serious &mdash; they require more wisdom, more experience, and more knowledge of the law than would be required when we are talking about lower levels.  It is only in this context that I ask the Minister to consider again the observations of those who took the minority view on the Committee of Court Practice and Procedure.</P>
    <P>I am horrified, if I understood the Minister correctly, at his implication that the views of those people were motivated by the interests of their profession.  If the Minister believes that the views of the people of the minority group on the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure merely represented the selfish views of their profession, he should be consistent <Col N="1632" /> and seek their resignaton from the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. I know the people concerned.  One of them is now deceased but I have the honour to know many people on that committee.  They are people of great experience and judgment, who, most of all, would put the interest of our legal system before their own selfish interest. It is wrong of the Minister, in their absence, to suggest that the reasons they give for a minority or a majority view are selfishly motivated.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>I will be looking for far more positive and comprehensive answers from the Minister when we come to deal with the question of District Court level.  The Minister has not given any logical or rational reason for increasing the new jurisdiction limit as proposed by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure from £10,000 to £15,000.  I am obviously going to be beaten if this comes to a vote.  I am not going to push it that far.  But I am utterly dissatisfied with the reasons given by the Minister and I would ask him to tell me whether he has other reasons or whether the reasons he has given are the limit of the sense that he can put on his proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not put my name to this amendment, but to raise the jurisdiction limit of the Circuit Court so high is to diminish the role of the civil jury.  While Senator Ryan expressed on the last day a great many reasons why he felt civil juries should be done away with altogether, he also admitted that he was involved in the insurance business.  We all know that it is primarily the insurance businesses who wish to diminish the role of the civil jury.  From the point of view of the victim of an accident, this may not be satisfactory.  It may, of course, be true that the members of a particular jury are not experts in judging the right level of compensation; nevertheless you do have a mix of people who have ordinary experience of the cost of living.  A judge who has been serving for a long time may be out of touch with the levels of compensation that are given.  It is not unknown for a very low level of compensation to appear in court cases where a judge alone <Col N="1633" /> is sitting.  I am worried that the civil jury is being diminished here.  Considering the remarks that have been made about Senator Molony wanting to put money into the pockets of barristers, I suppose I shall also be accused of wanting to put money in my own pocket.  As I am only a junior, I will not be affected by the case being taken out of the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is taking too many opportunities to suggest that all lawyers argue only from self interest.

I will be interested to see whether Government spokesmen speak in this way in other areas of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of repeating myself.  I have given the Senator the reasons.  My reference to the committee made the point that three members held a view that it should be a lesser figure.  There was no suggestion implied that this was for any specific reason.  In the Lower House and here, it appears that I will have to be constantly defending that committee, having regard to the views of some of the Senator's colleagues in the Lower House and the suspicion I have about Senator Molony's contribution in relation to the section we are dealing with.  I refute and reject as misrepresentation the Senator's suggestion that I have tried to cast doubt on the three people involved or any members of that committee.  I have repeatedly described that committee as consisting of eminently qualified people and have done so in the teeth of opposition from the Senator's colleagues in the Lower House.  I regret it if the Senator is going to take that line in further discussion of the different sections of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has <Col N="1634" /> expressed himself now and if that is really what he means, I accept it completely.  I clearly understood him to suggest the contrary.  I will look at the record of the House afterwards and if I am wrong, I want to apologise to the Minister.  In the course of the Bill I will be criticising some of the views of the committee.  But there is a major difference between criticising their views and suggesting or implying that they expressed those views for selfish reasons.</P>
      <P>That is the point I want to raise at this stage.  I certainly have no desire to get involved in that sort of squabble.  I raised it simply because I understood the Minister to make the accusation but the Minister has clarified the point now.  I thank him for his clarification and I apologise to him if I have offended him in any way by suggesting that that was not what he intended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what investigations he has carried out in order to satisfy himself that the Circuit Court will have the capacity, both staff-wise and courtwise &mdash; I am talking about court accommodation, the back-up staff needed, the number of judges &mdash; to take on the workload that is being given to it? The only comments I have seen were those of the Minister for Justice in the Lower House in which he reckoned that things would be all right.  I think that reckoning in these circumstances is not good enough and that point was made very forcibly by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  I want to know whether consultations took place with the staff and the judges of the Circuit Court, and whether the Minister is satisfied that the staff of the Circuit Court, the county registrars, staff and the judges, have the capacity to take on this new jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on more <Col N="1635" /> than one occasion that if facilities, whether they are judicial or staffing, are required they will be made available.  As the Senator knows, there is a 12-month time-lag which will provide an opportunity to examine the situation as to the likely requirements.  If I take what the Senator said earlier in relation to an increase of two and a half times the workload in the District Court, the presumption there would be that much of the Circuit Court work would go to the District Court.  On that basis I think the Senator's fears for the capacity of the Circuit Court to deal adequately with the wordload are not realistic.  I have given repeated commitments that whatever is necessary, either by way of judicial posts or staffing arrangements for District and Circuit Courts will be done.  In relation to county registrars and such people and the system of listing cases, it should be mentioned that this is something the Bar Associations and county registrars might consider taking up.  It might be an opportunity for them to examine this with a view to working out a suitable arrangement which would make things easier for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a clue what will happen and the Minister has indicated he has not a clue as to what will happen either.  All the work of the Circuit Court will become the responsibility of the District Court.  The Circuit Court will have responsibility for cases between £2,500 and £15,000 plus matters of family law which we will be dealing with later. I do not believe for a second that a 12-month period will be sufficient to solve the problem of courtroom facilities.  The Minister has acknowledged, and I think everybody acknowledges, that the facilities we have in courtrooms around the country are disgracefully inadequate. There is no doubt about that.  I do not blame the existing Fianna Fáil Government for that problem.  It is something that has built up over the years.  The Minister knows the problem exists.  He acknowledges that, but he says he will wait until the Bill is passed, to see in 12 months whether a problem arises and <Col N="1636" /> within the 12 months he is going to solve the problem of decades.  I do not accept that he can do it.</P>
      <P>The Minister also made the point that the local authorities are responsible for courthouses.  The local authorities do not have the money to fill potholes at the moment and unless the Minister provides them with the finance to fix up courthouses they will not be fixed.  A 12-month period, after this Bill is passed, is completely and utterly inadequate and it is codswallop to suggest that all of that work can be postponed.  We should be considering those problems now because now is the time to consider them.  We should not impose increased jurisdiction on courts unless we are satisfied that the courts will have the accommodation and the capacity to deal with that increased workload.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister two questions and I ask them again.  First, has he had consultations with the staffs of the Circuit Court in relation to the proposals to increase or alter the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and, secondly, has he had consultations with the Judiciary of those courts?  I believe that both the staff and the judges of the Circuit Court are dissatisfied with their capacity to take on this new workload.  If the Minister has had consultations he will have to agree with me on that.  If the Minister has not had consultations, I ask him why not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am satisfied with what I have stated in the Lower House and here this afternoon, that I am prepared to provide what is necessary.  In the meantime, I am prepared to examine what we need immediately and monitor thereafter the situation with a view to making any urgent changes that might be required.  I think that within a 12-month period, having regard to the programme that is going on at the moment and having regard also to certain proposals which <Col N="1638" /> will be going to the Government shortly. Within the required period I will be able to ensure that facilities are there from both staffing and judicial points of view. The Senator's fears are not soundly and solidly based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not let this lie.  I am going to come back on it and demand some very definite replies from the Minister when we come to deal with District Court jurisdictions.  The Minister referred to the comprehensive statements he made&mdash;maybe he did not use the word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;&mdash;in the report he gave to this House and I believe he was referring to remarks he made today in his reply to the Second Reading debate when he referred to a couple of courthouse facilities that had been changed around the country.  He mentioned Waterford as being one of them. There is a history to the one in Waterford, and the Minister knows that it took a lot longer than a year and a lot more than a decision of a county council to change the situation there.  It took the judge of the Circuit Court to abandon the courthouse and flee from the city to another place before any action was taken in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, when he dealt with this Bill in the Lower House, said that urgent steps were being taken.  That was in November, six months ago.  I would like to know precisely what steps have been taken since then.  The Minister of State came into this House today and the last day the House met and expressed the difficulties that exist from the Department's point of view, that the maintenance of courthouses is a matter for local authorities.  It is a matter for local authorities because they have an obligation to look after courthouses, but it is up to the Minister to change that law if he wants to.  He has not chosen to do so.  Unless the Minister is prepared to say that cash grants are going to be made available now&mdash;not in 12 or six month's time&mdash;there is no prospect of those courts being altered in sufficient time to take on the workload if there is going to be a greater workload.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> I would like to ask the Minister one more question.  After several questions being asked of him, he says now that consultations did take place with the Judiciary.  What was the attitude of the Judiciary in relation to increasing the jurisdiction of the courts without first altering the courthouse accommodation and resources?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

      <P>I have no intention of revealing what is contained in the proposals until the time is right.  Furthermore, I want to state that discussions that have taken place with the Judiciary are of a confidential nature and I am not going to reveal or break confidentiality. The Senator is well aware of that and I am surprised that he should ask me.</P>

      <P>I will be repeating myself on a regular basis if I have to go back over every question the Senator puts to me and I have no intention of doing that either.  I have given him the reasons.  We are talking about something that comes up under another section of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Why increase the rateable valuation limit?  I thought the point made by Senator FitzGerald last week was a good one when he said that when dealing with lands or buildings a rateable valuation of £100 was the existing limit before the Circuit Court.  It is proposed to increase this to £200.  With the increase in property values which have far outstripped the increase in inflation every year, it would seem that land values must have multiplied many times faster than inflation over the period.  I wonder why it is necessary at all to increase the rateable valuation limit from £100 to £200.  We could be talking about a farm worth £600,000 to £800,000.  A few years ago it would not be unusual to see a farm that had a rateable valuation of less than £200 sold for something in excess of £.5 million.  It seems to be going a bit too far to bring matters like that before the Circuit Court.  If there are disputes over land worth that sort of money the forum of the Circuit Court, with every respect to the judges of that court, would not be adequate to deal with such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the intention is to increase the maximum jurisdiction in equity in the Circuit Court. This was a recommendation of the committee and I have nothing further to add except that I agree with it.  I have accepted the recommendation and it is an endeavour to give the maximum jurisdiction to the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we are not going to get too far in seeking amendments today, but the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure did not give any reason for their decision.  They said that they considered the matter carefully which I am sure they did, but in this respect I have a very solid criticism to make of that committee.  I think the question is begged by paragraph 13 of their 20th Interim Report.  They literally propose in a very arbitrary way the increase of the rateable valuation limit from £100 to £200 without ever making reference to <Col N="1641" /> the fact that land prices and property values have escalated and multiplied in value.  I have to ask the Minister whether he believes that the Circuit Court is the proper forum to deal with a dispute in relation to a property worth £.5 million. I question that with the most genuine motives that I could put before the House.  It is far too high a limit to have in the Circuit Court.  The ordinary increases in land and property values that have taken place have easily matched the levels of inflation that we have to compensate for when we are talking about running down actions, but in relation to property title or equity matters this is a mistake.  If the committee did not offer a reason I would like the Minister to offer a reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>While my name is not added to those who oppose this section, I would like to say a few words about it.  I apologise to the Minister of State for not being present for the whole of his Second Stage reply.  I am genuinely sorry about this.  Unfortunately the exhaust fell off my car.  If I had not gone to have it repaired I would be going about emitting illegal levels of noise and I feel sure the Minister of State would not like that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that it is expected that the rule-making body for the Circuit Court will be making changes in the rules so as to iron out the severe complications in the procedures for divorce <i>a mensa et <Col N="1642" /> thoro</i> but I felt it is worth while raising this point on Second Stage because the fact that one hopes that a rule-making body are going to make a change does not necessarily mean that they are going to make the change and it is very important to iron out the extra complex procedures.</P>
    <P>I am speaking for Senator Robinson, who is not here, as well as for myself in saying that probably the reason that she opposed the section was not a technical one like this but simply that we both feel that a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> in itself is a thoroughly unsatisfactory remedy to a broken-down marriage.  I would oppose this section basically on the grounds that what we should be doing is producing a real remedy for the breakdown of marriage in allowing for a law which would provide for dissolution of marriage rather than tinkering about with divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> which is basically a most unsatisfactory solution to the problem of a couple whose marriage has broken down.  This would be my reason for opposing this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to agree with what Senator McGuinness has said and I, too, oppose the section.  I honestly believe, and I accept of course, that the consultations the Minister has had with the Judiciary in respect of any matter on this Bill are confidential as long indeed as the Judiciary and himself wish to keep them confidential.  But I know, from discussions I had myself with members of the Judiciary, that there is some concern about this new jurisdiction being imposed on the Circuit Court.  Like Senator McGuinness, I agree that this is a most unsatisfactory remedy to marriage breakdown. It is something that is well known to be unsatisfactory to those people who have sought such a decree or those people who have simply not gone to the courts, realising that it was such an inappropriate remedy.  That is not, perhaps, what we are dealing with today.  But I do not think that it is at all appropriate that the question of judicial separation should come from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  It is a most serious matter.  It is an action which should be altered in very <Col N="1643" /> many ways.  But as it stands it is a most serious matter and I do not think that the Circuit Court has the capacity to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Let me say also something I have referred to very often in the course of this Bill so far, the very atmosphere, the almost cattle mart atmosphere of a Circuit Court sitting is no atmosphere in which any couple should have to have the judicial separation of their marriage considered. From that point to the points of law and the points that must concern a judge, I do not believe that the average judge in the Circuit Court has the experience or capacity to deal with this matter and I believe that those judges themselves would be the first to acknowledge that.  The vast majority of legal practitioners in this country, solicitors or barristers &mdash; the judges come from the Bar &mdash; are people who have not engaged in family law practice at all.  The vast majority of judges on our Circuit Court benches would, I am sure, readily admit&mdash;and it is a matter of fact anyway&mdash;that they have not engaged in family law practice while practising at the Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it is right that a matter as serious as a judicial separation and the breaking down of a marriage should be one to be dealt with by the Circuit Court. It is far too serious a subject.  I must say in all seriousness that the Minister is dealing with this question far too lightly in bringing it before the Circuit Court. When objections such as this were raised before by people they were pooh-poohed by the Minister.  It was said, certainly by the Minister's colleague in the Department of Justice, Deputy Collins, if not by the Minister of State himself, that people who said that the jurisdiction for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> should not be given to the Circuit Court were objecting to informalising the procedure.  It is a most serious matter.  It requires the dignity of the High Court; it requires the experience of High Court judges, and it requires, for the sake of the couple involved and the family, that it not be dealt with in any shipshod manner.  I do not say that the Circuit Court judge will deal with it in a slipshod manner but I am saying that the <Col N="1644" /> necessary resources, because it is taking place in some courthouse away from the Law Library, away from the centre of legal activity in Dublin, will not be available.</P>
    <P>I would say that the atmosphere of the courthouse itself is wrong.  The matter is altogether too serious to be given into the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  There is a recognition of the fact, for example, that the Circuit Court should not deal with matters involving sums in excess of £15,000 in civil law.  Is the Minister equating the two?  For example, if you have a £20,000 claim you will go to the High Court.  If you break your leg and you are not able to resume work for a while and your solicitor thinks you are going to get more than £15,000, he advises you to bring your action to the High Court because it is a serious matter.  However, somebody now who is seeking redress and who seeks an order of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> will bring the action to the Circuit Court.  The Minister will reply that it is there to facilitate those people; it is there to make it easier for them. There are other ways of making it easier for people, by providing the proper facilities in the proper places.  The Minister has made the point &mdash; and I agree with it fully &mdash; that there could perhaps be courts throughout the country, let us say, wherever there is a legal aid centre.  That could be done without any great difficulty, and it could be done immediately. I hope the Minister is not going to tell me that he is going to do all of this in the next 12 months as well, because I will not accept it.  This is a most serious matter and it is being dealt with far too lightly. I urge the Minister to accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Molony says about the lack of experience of judges of the Circuit Court or practitioners is probably true.  On the other hand, 10 or 15 years ago there were very few judges of the High Court with any experience of these matters.  There were very few practitioners in the High Court who had any experience in these matters. They just had to learn gradually by some of the judges getting experience in that <Col N="1645" /> area and some of the practitioners specialising or doing a good deal of work in that area.  They gradually built up experience. The same thing will happen gradually in the Circuit Court.  It is not an ideal situation, but they will gain experience and, in a relatively short time, they will have the necessary experience and expertise to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>It is not as though there is a choice in the ordinary sense of having or not having any of these cases in the Circuit Court. There is, in my view, no choice.  There has been such a volume of work of this kind in recent years that it just would not be possible to handle it all in the High Court.  It is necessary to extend it to the Circuit Court and, in some cases, to the District Court.  We should face up to that fact and rely on the fact that experience will be gained in a relatively short time. So I do not think there is any alternative but to do it in the way that is suggested by this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 5, in the absence of any mandate either clear or implied from the electorate to do away with the constitutional prohibition on the dissolution of marriage, we have to concern ourselves with judicial separation. The purpose of this section is to make that easier for people, particularly people in rural areas.  I have said on Second Stage, and I say again, that marriage is a relationship which either works or does not work.  The main problem for people is that they should be relieved of its burdens when it does not work in as quick and as efficient a manner as possible.</P>
      <P>Some of the main objections to this section have been the unsuitability of Circuit Court buildings.  The Minister has said, and Senator Molony has agreed with him, that there is in every Circuit Court area some building that is suitable and that can provide privacy for the hearing of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the competence of the judges, I am in the hands of the experts in the House.  Senator Cooney said something that rather worried me as a member of the general public.  He seemed to suggest that in these matters the views of High <Col N="1646" /> Court judges were limited; he seemed to imply that judges of the Circuit Court tried cases on the balance of prejudice and he was only happy about the ability of the district justices.  So, as a member of the general public and going on what he says, I think I would choose to have my case heard by a district justice.</P>
    <P>Also we have had criticism about the suitability of buildings from the General Council of the Bar.  I think Senator McGuinness quoted what they said. While commenting on this they said that reluctance by people to apply to the Circuit Court for relief is at least in part due to the reluctance of the parties to accept a local venue.  They go on to say that they are hardly unaware of the inadequacies of the courthouse accommodation.  I do not think that follows at all.  People in rural areas would very much rather go to a local venue than undergo the expense of a journey to Dublin to the High Court, where the mystique of the law has, to say the least of it, a very offputting effect.  I welcome this section. It will make matters very much easier for people who are caught up in a marriage breakdown situation.</P>

      <P>As reference has been made to this quotation from the Bar Council document might I say that this was the submission made by my branch of the profession to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which was referred to earlier by the Minister and which I had with me on the last day.  It is not just that people are aware of the inadequacies of Circuit Court buildings for these family law cases.  It certainly is generally felt that people are not necessarily desirous of having these cases heard locally because they feel that the local forum is not necessarily as private as having them heard a distance from home.  This is one of the matters which exercised the minds of the Bar Council and members of the Bar generally, not merely the actual inadequacy of the courthouses.  People would rather pay the money to go to Dublin and be sure that everybody does not know what their business is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of proceedings for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is accepted at present in the High Court as being a very complicated form.  For that reason, it has been held, and the committee have recommended, that the jurisdiction for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> be vested in the Circuit Court.  I understand that the committee have also recommended that the necessary statutory changes be made in order to enable applications in the Circuit Court for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> to be commenced by way of civil bill.  The rules provide that where proceedings under any statute are not specifically catered for, the proceedings can be commenced by civil bill in accordance with the rules.</P>
      <P>I agree totally with what Senator Ryan has said.  The argument that the judges of the Circuit Court are not capable of dealing with the area involved in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> on the basis that they have not had previous experience is unrealistic and a poor argument.  Senator Ryan is right when he states that, because these people have not had jurisdiction in the past, it is quite natural that they would lack certain experience because of non-involvement in the type of case.  I claim, as he does, that the High Court experienced the same lack in so far as the number of cases that came to the High Court some years ago were few and far between also.  I am satisfied that just to maintain the <i>status quo</i> for the sake of maintaining the <i>status quo</i> is not a justifiable reason for excluding this type of case from the Circuit Court.  I have stated elsewhere, and reiterate it here, that in the Circuit Court we are providing for a number of other family law matters.  There are a number of matters which are very likely to arise in connection with the hearing of cases for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> For that reason it is desirable and important that at least there be a &ldquo;package&rdquo;, if you like, in family law, that the access would be there.  I know that Senator Molony is nodding his head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Senator wants to lower the level of the debate by <Col N="1648" /> making remarks like that, it is regrettable. I am satisfied that what we are doing is in the best interests of the people who will find themselves in the tragic circumstances of having to seek judicial separations in the court.  The circumstances in which I can justify them going to that court and justify the provision in that court for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> are proper and correct based on the ground I have given.  I have been repeating some of the views given by Senator Ryan and agree with him totally in this regard.  I do not know why there should be an attempt to suggest that the Circuit Court judges are not capable, based simply on the argument that they never had any experience of the matter in the past.  In recent years it has been accepted that the numbers of cases in the High Court have not been nearly as great as they might have been, for factors and facts well known to Senator Molony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan has made a very excellent case for the establishment of a proper family court.  I have no doubt that there must be many supporters of the Government party at the moment who recognise the necessity for family courts, tribunals &mdash; call them what you like.  The Minister suggested in his reply to the Second Stage that those people who look for family courts were looking for a Utopia, which is impossible to attain.  It was not impossible to attain when Fianna Fáil published their 1977 Election Manifesto, but three years later, it is impossible to attain it and it is Utopian to think of the establishment of family courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally incorrect. I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to quibble with the Minister on what he said or did not say.  The record will show what he said.  He did refer to the Utopia sought by certain Members of the House when they looked to have family courts provided. This is a cheap way out.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  The Minister should have undertaken a proper study beforehand of the courthouse <Col N="1649" /> facilities around this country.  I am taking a shot in the dark when I say this, but from discussions I have had with members of the Judiciary, I know there is concern among members of the Judiciary in the Circuit Court as to their capacity and as to the wisdom of giving that court the jurisdiction to deal with matters of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i></P>
      <P>This is why I said it is cheap.  I referred on Second Stage to this move to pass all these cases to the Circuit Court.  The reasons given by Senator Ryan are a bit like the decision of the Minister for the Environment when he could not deal with the thousands of people who were lined up waiting to do a test to get a driving licence.  What was the way out of it &mdash; abolish the necessity for a test altogether. Everybody who is on their second provisional licence does not require a test, he or she can have a licence.  If you failed a test, you can have a licence.  That is the very same type of thinking that brings the Minister in today to suggest, as Senator Ryan has said, that we have so many cases of people seeking divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> decrees in the High Court that the High Court cannot deal with them, therefore you pass them on to the Circuit Court, bring them down a step.  That is not the answer.  This is a specific problem that requires a specific measure to deal with it and that is what the Minister should be doing.  If the Minister even told us that he was going to have a half-way house - and I understood him to say in his reply on Second Stage that it might be a good idea to have a special place in every circuit to deal with matters like that &mdash; I would go the whole way with him.  I would say that at least he was facing in the right direction.  At the moment he is going backwards and what is being done is wrong.  I accept that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure said &ldquo;Let us do this.&rdquo;  But I will remind the Minister, as we go through every section of this Bill, that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure made this comment on court accommodation in paragraph 24:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general Council of the Bar of <Col N="1650" /> Ireland in its submission strongly urged the desirability of providing proper courthouses before embarking on any increase in jurisdiction.  It is true that too many courthouses are in need of immediate and extensive repairs or replacement.  Justice cannot be adequately administered in unsuitable premises.  The Committee reiterates the comments and recommendations concerning courthouse accommodation which they made in paragraphs 160, 161, 162 and 163 of the Committee's Twelfth Interim Report (26th August 1970).  The Committee expresses the hope, if their recommendations in this, the 20th Interim Report, are implemented, that one result will be to hasten the necessary provision of suitable court accommodation.</P>
    <P>That is 11 years ago now.  I would remind the Minister that the Committee recommended that before we embarked on this measure the provision of courthouse facilities be carried out.  One thing the Minister has made quite clear is that he has no immediate plans.  He is going to wait to see what happens, and he has now an impossible period of 12 months in which to do it.  I think it is wrong and I will say what Senator McGuinness was accused over &mdash; this is justice on the cheap, certainly in relation to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should get it clear whether Senator Molony objects to law being cheap, because he says that is just a cheap way out and he said earlier that this is justice at a bargain price.  I think Senator Molony should state quite definitely whether he is against law being available at a cheaper price than it is that merely because it is cheap that it must necessarily be bad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill sets out to do three things in particular.  It sets out to ensure as far as possible that justice will be available to people at a cheaper price than it is at the moment, that it will be available quicker than it is at the moment and that there will be greater access, more convenient access for people who wish to have some <Col N="1651" /> matter adjudicated.  I think this Bill does all three things.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony seems to be adopting the attitude that, if it is going to be cheaper, it must necessarily be worse.  That does not follow.  I think that merely saying that because it is going to be cheap it must be bad is a completely wrong approach to this Bill.  I have no reason at all to believe that dealing with this kind of case in the Circuit Court is necessarily going to be any worse than in the High Court.  I believe that the average Circuit Court judge is just as able, just as competent as a High Court judge and, given a little bit of experience, will be just as effective. Obviously, it will take a little while.  That is inevitable.  That is something that cannot be got over, just as every High Court judge who is dealing with this at the moment had to deal with a case for the first time, second time and third time when he was doing it at first.  I see no reason at all why it should not be just as effective when done by the Circuit Court and why Circuit Court judges should not be just as effective in dealing with this kind of case.  The fact that it is going to be a bit cheaper is not a reason why it should be criticised.  I think it will enable these cases to be heard more quickly and I think it will be more convenient for the unfortunate people who have to bring these kinds of cases.</P>
    <P>The throw-away criticism that this is bargain basement law, a cheap way of doing it, is certainly not the proper way to approach this and I think Senator Molony should say now whether he believes that merely because it is cheap it must be bad.  That is a totally invalid way of approaching this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House for drawing my attention to something that certainly, if it appeared in black and white on the record of the House, could have left it open to people who wanted to attack me to interpret it in the way that he chose to interpret it.  I am quite sure that Senator Ryan, if he listened to what I said when I compared it with the abolition of the queue of people for driving licences, must realise that <Col N="1652" /> I did not mean cheap in the monetary sense; I meant that people were going to get a lesser quality article.  When he refers to the bargain price basement we all know what you get in the bargain price basement.  Sometimes you may get a good bargain, but when you go to the sales and you buy a shirt for £5 that would normally cost you £12 you know it is not the same article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity that Senator Ryan has given me to clarify this.  I want to make it quite clear that I believe that this measure is going to cheapen the quality of justice that is available to people who seek this remedy.  I want to make it quite clear that I am utterly in favour of delivery of legal services to everybody at the cheapest rate possible in monetary terms.  I have always advocated that.  I believe that there is a proper way of doing that and that is by subsidising it in the proper way, not by pushing it out of one jurisdiction and into a lower jurisdiction because it might save money.  It might save a few bob for the State and the State are the only people who will save a few bob in this respect.  Senator Ryan made it quite clear that he thought this was the right solution when he said that there are too many cases of this occurring in the High Court.  So, what do you do?  You push it into the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  I disagree with that.  I would just like to ask Senator Ryan whether he believes that there is one section for family courts because it is not what the published policy of the party was when he was Director of Elections in 1977.  I would like to ask him to tell me why no steps have been taken to establish family tribunals and I would like him to tell me in regard to the view that he has expressed, that this is the proper way to deal with this problem, whether he disagrees with the Minister for Justice who has said that this is an interim measure.  The Minister for Justice wants family law tribunals but Senator Ryan does not.  It seems that Senator Ryan regards this as the proper way to deal with the problem.  I do not. I believe in cheap justice where it is cheap in terms of monetary cost to people who are paying for it, but I do not believe in <Col N="1653" /> giving them a shirt with a torn collar at a cheaper price simply because it is available in the bargain basement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from what Senator Molony has said that he has even worsened the situation and confused it to my mind; he has shocked me.  He has taken up Senator Eoin Ryan on the matter of providing access to good law cheaply.  He has now taken up that cudgel, having been reminded of his omission. He now appears to want to rectify it for reasons that I think this House could suspect.  However, he goes on to state quite clearly that he has no objection to the law being cheap in the monetary sense but he has stated that the law, as provided in the Circuit Court, is cheap because of the fact that it is in that court in this case.  That, clearly, is denigration. It is a despicable comment about the judges of the Circuit Court to say that they are in this business of delivering or providing cheapened justice.</P>
      <P>I think that he has also, in the same long winded breath, stated that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which I defended on a regular basis in the Lower House against opposition from his colleagues &mdash; and I predicted that I would have to do it here in this House also against the same side although Senator Molony disagreed that any such defence would be necessary &mdash; was getting the Government off the hook.  He has suggested, by making the comparison in relation to the abolition of the driving test and the recommendation of the committee, that this committee of eminent men merely recommended this change from the High Court to the Circuit Court for purely political purposes to get the Government off the hook.  That is the implication and it is a direct and despicable accusation against the eminent highly-qualified men who serve on that committee.  That committee also stated that the facility afforded in the High Court was over-elaborate, out of date and should be provided in the Circuit Court.  Today the Senator has thrown dirty water on the judges of the Circuit Court by his accusation of them providing cheapened law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Earlier, while presuming to defend the committee by misquoting me and misrepresenting what I said in relation to the minority report, he accuses them now of being prepared to take a decision in the sensative, delicate and important area of judicial separation purely for the purpose of providing a political solution for the Government so that they would be got off the hook by transferring this jurisdiction from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  I will make no further comment. The arguments given by me and by Senator Eoin Ryan are clear.  They are justifiable and they are desirable in the situation, and the implication of what is proposed by the Senator on the grounds that he has used here today is nothing less than appalling and shocking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be concerned that Senator Molony's concept of cheap justice might be taken to mean that the litigant would receive an inferior service or a service that depends on the size of the fees that are paid to his legal representatives. If that is the meaning of Senator Molony's cheap justice, it is something that should be rejected by this House.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Senator also that long before the days of FLAC who do very good work, there was a tradition at the Bar &mdash; I cannot speak for his profession &mdash; that poor people would be represented where their case is needy, where they can show need.  They have been represented by members of the Bar without the expectation and without the hope of getting a penny payment for their services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems as if there is some support for the Senator on this side of the House.  If, when we go to the hustings I hear anybody talking about family law tribunals, I shall have the record of the House to deal with the subject.  I am surprised Senator Cassidy did not understand me when I made that point when replying to Senator Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Senator: that is exactly what this proposal is doing.  Certainly, members of the Bar had a tradition.  Solicitors, too had a tradition, and a very <Col N="1655" /> important tradition.  I might say further that my experience in this whole area came from my involvement in the free-legal-aid advice centres.  It was a long and bitter struggle for the miserable legal aid system we have now.  Most people who have any sort of social conscience and who are members of any branch of the legal profession have concerned themselves with this area.  It is good by way of a smart jibe to talk about cheap justice and all the rest.  I have made my position quite clear and I would ask Senator Cassidy to accept what I have said with the sincerity with which I offered that view. There is no question whatever of my being against justice just because it is cheaper in one court than it would be in another.  What I am talking about is the quality of the justice that is available. What I want is that cases which demand a certain jurisdiction because of the seriousness of the case should be given by this country the forum that has the dignity and the experience to offer a solution to the problem.  We are dealing with judicial separation which is a most serious matter and whatever resources we need to provide a solution to that problem ought to be provided.  It is a matter of peripheral interest as to where those resources are provided &mdash; whether they are provided in Dublin or in Cork.  I do not think any farmer would mind having to get somebody else to milk the cows so that he could go to Dublin to fight a case involveing his judicial separation from his wife. This is the seriousness of what we are talking about.  Many of the arguments that have been used to back up the proposals for this measure are inadequate and false in that respect.  Senator Ryan, in his contribution on this Stage of the Bill, made the case for family tribunals. I am sorry that the commitment that I thought Fianna Fáil had to that concept seems to have evaporated over the past four years.</P>

      <P>I want to go back to the matter of courthouse accommodation because I am not satisfied with the position. We are talking about the District Court here.  I want to get from the Minister details of the specific proposals he has.  There are a number of problems that arise in this regard.  First, the maintenance of District Courts is a matter for local authorities.  I want to ask the Minister specifically whether he would consider taking that responsibility away from local authorities altogether.  The local authorities do not have the resources to maintain District Courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The District Court basically is a service provided through the Department of Justice.  The court service is controlled by the Department of Justice. It is senseless to expect local authorities to deal with the maintenance and provision of courthouses around the country.  I have already said to the Minister that I do not blame him for the condition of our courthouses but I am going to blame him for putting a lot more work onto them.  It is wrong that he should do that without first taking the precaution of improving the facilities available.  I would ask him to consider taking over that responsibility from the local authorities direct to the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know why the Minister goes so far in agreeing with the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, but apparently disagrees with them in that they asked that before this measure be brought in the courthouses around the country be improved.  If they were improved I would not be standing up here discussing this matter, wasting my time, as I am going to get nowhere with it anyway.  I would like to put it on the record, because I can see a lot of mess occurring around this country, and I can <Col N="1657" /> speak from personal experience of the inadequacies of District Courts and I believe that there is not a solicitor who practices in courts in this country who will not speak of many courts that are inadequate both in their physical accommodation and in their capacity to take over this work.</P>
    <P>I also want to know, in relation to the District Court itself, why the Minister must wait over to see what is going to happen?  Whatever arguments might be made in relation to the Circuit Court there can be no doubt that the work of the District Court is going to be multiplied.  We are giving them an increased jurisdiction from a measly £250 up to £2,500.  That is a multiplication by ten of the work of the District Court.  We are giving them new jurisdiction in relation to matters of family law which is completely new.  We are proposing in the Malicious Injuries Bill to give them a new jurisdiction in respect of the malicious damages code.  The work of the District Court has been multiplied.  Of course, they will need more staff unless the workload is going to collapse.  It is impossible to foresee a situation in which the workload is going to collapse.  The District Court will have to do the work of the District Court and the Circuit Court. That is the position at the moment.  The Minister must be aware of that fact.  I want to know if he has had consultations with the District Court clerks and their associations, whether he has had consultations with the justices of the District Courts and whether he is satisfied that the District Courts are in a position to take over this load the day the Bill becomes law.  The fact is that their work is being multiplied by ten.  The decisions that have been made to introduce this legislation without first making provision to improve courthouse accommodation is cracked.</P>

I informed the House on Second Stage that there is a Bill before the Dáil &mdash; The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill, 1981 &mdash; which is a result of a general review of the barring order procedures which has been going on in my Department for some time.  I do not propose to go into detail at this stage on the contents of that Bill.  It is sufficient to say that it will provide additional protection for spouses and children affected by domestic violence.  It includes jurisdiction proposals of similar effect to those of subsection (a) of this section which are therefore unnecessary in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel that there is any need to take up time of the House or Minister in repeating what I said already on the Second Stage of the Bill in regard to my feelings about the transfer of the custody of children cases to the District Court.  There are a couple of things I would like to add to that.  I would like to refer to the excellent contribution made by Senator Mary Harney on the Second Stage debate when&mdash;although she said she hesitated to come in because everybody who had spoken before her had been professionally qualified and she was not&mdash;what she said made a great deal of sense, in that she said that she would like to see these matters brought before special family tribunals. She appeared to feel that what the Minister was doing in this Bill, in transferring the jurisdiction to the District Courts was the first step in this direction. Alas, it is not a first step in this direction. I only wish it was because, if I felt it was, there is no doubt that I would wholeheartedly support it.  The Minister of State may know&mdash;certainly his colleague, the Minister for Justice, knows &mdash; that I was not among the people who gave blanket opposition to the introduction of the civil legal aid scheme simply because it was not perfect to begin with.  I quite publicly expressed the feeling that it was better to make a start somewhere.  For all the inadequacies it may have, there is no doubt in my mind that the civil legal aid scheme has helped quite a number of people who otherwise would not have had recourse to legal remedies for their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in this case, if I really felt that what is being done is an effort to provide a suitable, cheap, accessible forum for family law cases, I would be the first to welcome it.  Unfortunately, while it may be cheap and in some ways may be accessible, I do not think it is a suitable forum, for all the reasons I put before the House on the Second Stage. I continue to feel that the forum of the ordinary District Court is in no way a suitable forum for hearing these kinds of cases.  Therefore I cannot but oppose the introduction of this entire section.  Incidentally, I must apologise to the Minister <Col N="1662" /> for having said the last time that this was not covered by section 33&mdash;I agree it is&mdash;that it is to be delayed for a year.  This was simply a slip of the eye and I owe the Minister an apology for having said that.</P>
    <P>I definitely feel that, even a year later &mdash;even with whatever improvements can be effected in the District Court system within a year&mdash;that cannot transform District Courts into being the right place to hear cases which involve a child's entire future or existence, cases which really need time for calm and careful consideration of them.  I am left in no doubt that I must continue to oppose this section, to oppose the whole idea of moving this jurisdiction into the District Court as at present formulated.</P>

The Minister has indicated that he has no intention of changing anything in it.  But it is very important that it goes on record that this, another very serious matter, is being put within the jurisdiction of a court that does not have the capacity or the resources to deal with it. I simply want to record my dissatisfaction with it.  I will not go further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the existing system in relation to an order for costs, the matter was totally within the discretion of the court concerned.  If somebody was awarded a sum less than the jurisdiction of the High Court, the High Court judge had the right to give a certificate allowing the Taxing Master to allow the costs of the High Court despite the fact that the case could have been brought in the Circuit Court.  Why is it proposed to change this and to remove the discretion from a judge where the amount of the award is between £2,500 and £7,500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing position is this.  Section 12 of the Courts Act, 1936, as amended, limits the cost which a successful claimant may recover in certain types of High Court action if the amount recovered is within the jurisdiction of the lower court to award.  He may recover full High Court costs only if the judge hearing the action certifies specially that it was reasonable, owing to the substantial and important nature of the action or to the importance of any question of law involved in it, that the action should have <Col N="1665" /> been commenced in the High Court.  In some types of action the judge does not have the discretion to issue a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it quite clear that, where the judge now has discretion to allow High Court costs in a case where perhaps the award of damages may have been only at Circuit Court level of damages, this discretion to grant the special certificate will be continued as at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The discretion will be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the award is less than £7,500, between £2,500 and £7,500, will the court have the right to award High Court costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The types of action and restrictions on costs are as follows: in tort and breach of promise of marriage, where the amount recovered is in the upper half of the Circuit Court's jurisdiction between £1,000 and £2,000, costs are calculated at the Circuit Court scale unless the judge issues a special certificate. Where the amount recovered is within the District Court jurisdiction or is in the lower half of the Circuit Court jurisdiction&mdash;£1,000 or less&mdash;costs are calculated on the Circuit Court scale, but the amount of the costs cannot exceed the amount of the decree: The judge may issue a special certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 12, line 18, after &ldquo;may,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on application being made to him,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this section stands at the moment, the <Col N="1667" /> court without application being made to it by either party may decide of its own volition to impose an obligation on one or other party to pay interest.  If both parties for some reason or another are agreed that neither of them is interested in pursuing the question of interest, the judge should not have any independent right to make a decision on the matter and the effect of the amendment would be to give the judge the right upon application being made to him to exercise the discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From a practical point of view I wonder whether a judge would ever make an order of that kind without an application.  If he felt that it was a case in which interest should be payable and if he felt that for some reason the counsel on behalf of the plaintiff was nodding or something of that kind, and he felt it was a suitable case, I imagine that the very least he would do is say that he was considering the payment of interest and would ask the parties if they had any views to offer on the question.  I cannot see him merely exercising his discretion and not allowing either party to make any submission on the matter.</P>
      <P>When I saw the amendment first I thought it was good but on reflection I feel that from a practical point of view a judge will never make that kind of an order without being asked to do so or certainly without asking both parties if they had any submissions to make on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is a feature of certain provisions that a power of discretion vested in a judge may be exercised by him only &ldquo;on application&rdquo; by one or both parties.  Indeed this Bill contains two such provisions: section 17 dealing with certificates exempting a plaintiff from the normal limitation on costs, and section 31 which deals with transfers of Circuit Court criminal trials from the Circuit Court in which they would normally be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between provisions of that type and the one at section 22 is that those provisions dealt with deviations from the norm, and it would not be <Col N="1668" /> appropriate for a judge to exercise the powers of discretion which those sections confer without such an application being made.</P>
    <P>If the words which the Senators propose were inserted, I would be concerned that there might be read into the section a requirement that cases must go before a judge before interest could be allowed, and that as a result sums offered in settlement would not and need not take account of this provision.  This would certainly be contrary to the intention of the provision; it could result in claims which might otherwise have been settled being pursued to the last, simply to obtain interest.</P>
    <P>If these words were inserted, it would presumably become standard practice for a plaintiff's legal advisers to make the application.  The requirement to apply would, however, act to penalise the plaintiff whose advisers overlooked making the application.</P>
    <P>On balance, it would be safer to leave these words out and let the section stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that if the parties agree a settlement the judge can subsequently decide to allow interest on the settlement figure without any application being made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that it would be implied that interest could not be obtained without application to a judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister said that one of the reasons he did not agree with the amendment was that the parties could agree settlement terms and that it would be open to the judge afterwards to provide that interest be payable on the sum of a settlement without application being made, and this was a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Sections 23 to 27, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 28.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 14, lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;commencement of this Act&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;15th day of October, 1980&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of the section 28, as it stands, prevents the application of the new limits of compensation for mental distress, that is £7,500, to causes of action which accrue before the Bill commences.  The justification for this is that in principle defendants should not be made liable for damages other than those appropriate at the time of the occurrence of the accident concerned. Giving further consideration to the matter in the light of the debate in the Dáil and in particular an amendment which Deputy Keating moved there, which would, in effect, have deleted subsection (3), I accept that strict adherence to the principle I have mentioned would mean <Col N="1671" /> that the limit now proposed should not have effect in proceedings coming before the courts for a number of years to come, possibly up to four.  A figure of £1,000 would remain in force in these cases. This, I am satisfied, would give rise to hardship and would be clearly out of line with the intention of the Oireachtas in the 1961 Act which set the limit originally. For that reason I now propose that the new limit should apply to all cases where the accident in question occurred on or after the date on which the Bill was presented, that is, 15 October 1980.  It is a fair and just compromise.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 18 February, 1981, takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on Aer Lingus, Teoranta and Aerlínte Éireann, Teoranta which was laid before the Seanad on 13 February 1981 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, Aer Lingus have been one of the successes in the State-sponsored area.  Their profit figures continue to be relatively good.  I say &ldquo;relatively&rdquo; because behind the current reasonable bottom line there are warning signs for <Col N="1672" /> the future.  First, is the dependence by Aer Lingus on their ancilliary activities to produce profits.  The operations for which the air transport side was originally set up have been losing money principally because of the immense losses they have been incurring on the North Atlantic route.  The unthinkable was touched on in the course of our discussions with Aer Lingus &mdash; the unthinkable being that Aer Lingus might consider having to remove the Irish flag from that route.  There comes a point when a decision has to be made between the size of the losses being incurred on a particular route and the necessity to continue to show the national flag on it for reasons of prestige.  That dilemma may have to be faced sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>In the committee we did not grasp that particular nettle, though we did isolate that it may have to be grasped.  Aer Lingus are not alone in suffering serious losses on that route.  Every carrier on the route is sustaining losses.  Those who are national flag carriers appear to be sustaining substantial losses and some have departed from it.  It has problems peculiar to itself.</P>
    <P>We were happy, however, that the management of Aer Lingus were very conscious of the need, if at all possible, to stay on that route and are striving might and main to effect economies to enable them to do so.  One economy that has political implications and which will have to be faced is the economy that could be achieved by having a single turn-around point in this country.  We were told in the course of evidence that at the moment it is costing £700,000 to maintain two stops in Ireland for our trans-Atlantic service, and that a saving of this magnitude &mdash; and it is a considerable sum &mdash; could be achieved if Aer Lingus could be allowed to have just one turn-around point in Ireland.  The preference for a single turn-around point would be for Shannon.  Most of the traffic commences in Shannon and the Dublin route is merely a feeder to Shannon. Undoubtedly, if it was to be set up as a single trans-Atlantic point, some inconvenience would be caused to travellers who have to make their way from the <Col N="1673" /> eastern part of the country to Shannon, but we would have to balance that inconvenience against the saving to the national airline, bearing in mind that the saving is substantial.  This will be a matter for political-cum-commercial decision in due course.  We have not recommended that as it would be outside the scope of the brief of the Joint Committee to make recommendations on that particular matter. We merely point out the saving that can be made and it is for our betters to make the decision.</P>
    <P>Some of the other problems lurking behind the present profitable position in Aer Lingus is the unsatisfactory nature of their capital structure.  Aer Lingus share this problem with every other State-sponsored company we reviewed. When we spoke to Aer Lingus they reckoned they needed an injection of £20 million by way of capital to restore their balance sheet to proportion to have a proper debt &mdash; equity ratio.  But the Exchequer is not in a position to provide this equity for Aer Lingus, no more than it is in a position to provide equity for all the other companies who need it so badly.  These companies will continue to rely on borrowing, and the interest on those borrowings will continue to distort their balance sheets and damage the commercial standing of the company; in turn, that damages the public perception of the success of the company and this can be damaging to the morale in the company which is important.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the next little warning sign behind Aer Lingus, that is, the present state of labour relations within that company.  There was a very good record up to the last couple of years, but the company have suffered from two particularly damaging strikes.  We were disturbed, on hearing evidence from some of the staff side, that they are unhappy with the level of industrial relations. There was very explicit criticism of management dealing with industrial relations problems.  I would be unhappy to think they might continue and, compounded with pressure on the company and damage to their morale, that these could have adverse effects in future by way of trade <Col N="1674" /> disputes causing serious damage to Aer Lingus.  Strikes in Aer Lingus do not just damage that company, they damage the whole economy because Aer Lingus have a high international profile and our reputation as a country with labour relations out of control gets another boost.  It also has an immediate adverse effect on the tourist industry.  I am particularly concerned also that this slightly worrying industrial relations scene could have any adverse effect on the ancillary activities, particularly the newest activity which was formally got under way during the week, that is, Airmotive on the Naas Road which is a very big investment.</P>
    <P>The management, when we spoke to them, were confident that so far as was commercially feasible their projections for the future were tightly done and that the possible difficult areas, loss of market and so on, were something they did not anticipate.  They saw a good future, a good market and a good product.  I hope the level of industrial relations will be such as to ensure that full advantage can be taken of that good product in that good market, because overhauling and repairing aircraft engines could be a very profitable ancillary activity which we would encourage because it is directly related to the nature of the company in question, an airline company.</P>
    <P>The other ancillary activities are, by and large, successful, particularly the activities in hotels in the United States. They have literally made an immense contribution to the Aer Lingus balance sheet and profits.  Without them Aer Lingus would be in a very serious financial position.  One would gather from looking at this scene that there is room for expansion. If the opportunities for expansion continue to be taken, we will be at a stage where the ancillary activities will become substantially more important and more valuable than the main activity itself.  The committee felt a little hesitant about giving a blessing to this and the Aer Lingus people share that hesitation.  To look at the matter in purely commercial terms, one should not have any hesitation but there was some sort of instinctive hesitation about a national airline whose <Col N="1675" /> flying activities were only a minor part of their activities.</P>
    <P>The possibility of expansion in the United States is there because of the nature of the market and because that company from within its own resources could provide the capital it needs.  That is an attractive proposition to a parent company that is short of capital and whose potential source of capital has an empty, or well nigh empty kitty.  It is important that the ancillary activities carried on by Aer Lingus, bearing in mind that it is a State-sponsored company owned by the Government on behalf of the people of Ireland, would be consonant with the national ethos and that those activities would recognise the fact that they are being pursued on behalf of a State-sponsored company.  Aer Lingus is very conscious of its position in that regard.  It has round towers and the like on its cabin wallpaper and has saints' names on its airplanes.  I have no doubt that that attitude would manifest itself in all the ancillary activities it would pursue. There are two activities, one in Foxhill's in England and a development in the Canary Islands, which could be disposed of.  It is the intention of Aer Lingus to dispose of them when suitable purchasers come.  Purchasers are scarce by reason of the fact that the recession is all over Europe.  These interests should be disposed of.  It would make many people happier to know that what was being done in those two places was no longer part of a national airline's ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>Another area in which there is a little worry on my part is in relation to productivity. An independent witness from the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdon, whose evidence was very valuable and much appreciated, was of the opinion that there was a 10 per cent to 20 per cent residual inefficiency in a national airline as against an independent Laker-type operation.  There were signs in calculations put to us, which can be read in the evidence that productivity in Aer Lingus was not as high as it might be.  For a company whose airline activities are in some financial difficulty <Col N="1676" /> it is important that the last drop of productivity would be achieved.  It was a bit disturbing to hear that there is this general acceptance that a State-sponsored or nationalised airline generally is 10 to 20 per cent less efficient than its private enterprise competitors.  That is something that could be removed.  It was identified in the report that the manning of the Aer Lingus traffic handling and overhaul section is too heavy by comparison with other airlines.  There would appear to be a recognition by Aer Lingus that there will have to be a reduction in the workforce, that it is over-manned.  That is something that tends to happen in State-sponsored bodies.  It is an economic phenomenon that tends to happen more easily in State-sponsored bodies.  Aer Lingus has suffered from that phenomenon but now that it has been identified it is a matter for the management to cure it.  By and large we were impressed by the concern of all in Aer Lingus, management and workers, for the reputation and standing of their company.  They are very conscious that they have a national duty to perform being in charge of and running a national airline.  This imposes certain responsibilities upon them, possibly more than would lie on a purely commercial operation.</P>
    <P>One other matter that arose in the course of our discussions &mdash; it is something that arises regularly in the media &mdash; is the level of fares on the European routes, with particular attention to the London-Dublin route.  We did not go so far in our report as to say that the fares on this route were too heavy.  The level of fare was justified to us but we suggested that it is a route that must be kept under very close supervision to see if economies of fares can be achieved.  It is a route on which there might be room for experiment to try to achieve a reduction in fares.  It was interesting that one of the independent airlines that gave evidence to us did admit that a national flag-carrying airline for an island country such as ours which must maintain its own independent airline must be entitled to possibly preferential treatment in the level of fares it might charge so that it could continue to exist.  The open skies policy <Col N="1677" /> recently introduced in the United States had effects which were not beneficial to some of the more remote parts of that country, the parts that could not generate a total economic flow of traffic.  To some extent the size of this island would put us in a similar position and our national flag-carrier has to be protected if we want to continue to have an independent airline of our own.  As an island country in this day and age we must continue and strive to achieve that.</P>

      <P>In seconding the motion I should like to make a number of points and then briefly develop them. Aer Lingus has a weak balance sheet and does have a case for a further capital injection by the State.  Productivity in Aer Lingus is not substantially out of line with other European airlines.  Ancillary activities form a key component of the company's overall operations and are proving very profitable.  Aer Lingus is an export industry with 70 per cent of its earnings coming from overseas.  On the topical and often controversial question of the level of airfares Aer Lingus fares appear very reasonable from the Joint Committee's findings by the general standard of European fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the capital structure of the company, as I have said, Aer Lingus has a weak balance sheet.  The equity debt ratio had fallen by 31 March 1980 to 32:68.  The financial position of the company weakens further its position in an industry which is characterised by intensive international competition.  Fuel costs have gone through the roof.  The recession is still with us and the company continues to make losses on the North Atlantic route.  The interest on the company's debt will likely reach the very high figure of approximately £8½ million in the year ended March 1981.  Clearly, the company have a case for a further equity injection by the State.  But, as Senator Cooney said, it must be remembered that the Irish economy as a whole is adversely affected by the international recession and Government finance is limited. Restraint will have to be exercised by the company on any future capital outlays, at <Col N="1678" /> least until the international recession has passed.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of productivity. Clearly, there is scope for improved productivity within Aer Lingus and the company recognise this.  The Joint Committee, however, found that the company's productivity is not substantially out of line with other European airlines.  The company is pressing ahead with improvements in this area and I am aware that a tremendous amount of managerial time is being invested in trying to improve productivity and, therefore, to reduce unit costs.</P>
    <P>A reduction of 500 in staff numbers is being sought, not by way of redundancy but on secondment of staff abroad on consultancy assignments and early retirements.  Aer Lingus recently concluded sound productivity agreements with pilots, hostesses and clerical staff.  I understand talks are going on with other categories with a view to reaching more productity agreements.  The company are pressing for more flexibility among employees and are increasingly applying computerisation, which should lead to further efficiency.</P>
    <P>Ancillary activities are essential as part of Aer Lingus operations to offset the cyclical swings that occur in the airline side of the business.  At the present time, for example, the airline side is in difficulty and the ancillaries are especially helpful in the current situation.  The company should be complimented on the shrewd and imaginative policies they have adopted in their ancillary activities. The results are there to be seen. Aviation-related activities have shown very good profits, and profits on hotels have shown a continuing upward swing, especially in the hotels located in the US. There are also satisfactory profits from financial and computer services.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are in the export business. Seventy per cent of their revenue comes from overseas.  The company earns very valuable foreign currency.  Because they are in the export industry, the company's costs are of key importance, especially labour costs, and this underlines the need for pay rates in this country to be brought <Col N="1679" /> in line with those in other countries, especially those in the OECD.</P>
    <P>My final point refers to the topical and often controversial question of air fares. To help the public to understand the fares charged by Aer Lingus, it is necessary to say that in the evidence we reviewed, the Joint Committee found that Aer Lingus fares seem to be very reasonable by comparison with the general standard applying in Europe.  However, the London-Dublin fare in particular, though making a valuable contribution to the company's profits and position as a whole, should be the subject of continuing experiments with lower fares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the discussion.  I compliment the Joint Committee on the report which is a readable document, comprehensive, giving a good deal of valuable information.  I have a special interest in the discussion coming from the mid-West, the region in which Shannon Airport is situated.  Certain implications in the report have direct connection with that area and I should like to comment on this briefly.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney implied that there is something special about a national airline. I agree that a national airline reflect their country and we are very proud of Aer Lingus in this country.  It is a special experience for an Irishman in a foreign airport to see among an array of aircraft one with a shamrock on its tail.  It gives one a feeling of pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus have made a reasonably satisfactory contribution and I give them credit for it.  However, there are areas in respect of which I might express opinions that are not entirely complimentary. They are few but I intend to deal with them.  I accept the Joint Committee's view that the financial performance of Aer Lingus is reasonably satisfactory within Ireland, the UK, in Europe and in the ancillary activities they are engaged in.  On the other hand, their financial performance on the North Atlantic run is anything but satisfactory.  Though the Joint Committee have made such a comment, to my mind they have been easy <Col N="1680" /> on Aer Lingus on this issue and on the steps Aer Lingus might be taking or have taken to anticipate developments on that run.</P>
    <P>I share the committee's view that the capital structure of Aer Lingus is unsatisfactory. The report before us pointed out that the equity-debt balance is in the ratio of 35-65, and Senator Hillery said the position has deteriorated since then. Therefore, I support fully the committee's contention that the viability of the airline, if they are to generate from their business the financial resources to enable them to develop, must do something in relation to the ratio of equity and debt. I support the committee that that must be brought into line, to a 50-50 basis, if the airline are to make satisfactory progress. In the case of a semi-State body it means that the Government must take the necessary measures to make this 50-50 ratio possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the North Atlantic run, I have already offered criticism of Aer Lingus.  Once the US Government went for an open skies policy on the North Atlantic run and once the Laker Skytrain came into operation on that route, Aer Lingus and others were confronted with two new radically competitive elements. Unfortunately, Aer Lingus were slow to anticipate such a situation.  They were slow to react to the challenge.  They were too concerned with being loyal to the principles of IATA and the fare structure of that organisation.  On many occasions I have seen Aer Lingus Jumbos flying into Shannon not half empty but sometimes three-quarters empty.  It is economic madness to fly such planes across the Atlantic half empty if it is possible to fill the empty seats by offering attractive fares.  Aerlinte have been slow to measure up to the competition posed by other airlines in this respect.</P>
    <P>I will move away from Shannon when I have given one example.  Last November a friend of mine, a businessman in the west of Ireland, who needed to be in New York on a particular weekend contacted Aer Lingus to book a seat.  The cheapest seat cost £462.  He contacted Trans-America who offered him a similar service at £245 and eventually North <Col N="1681" /> West Orient provided a seat for £165. Therefore, when the committee talk about the necessity for the airline to be conscious of the economics, surely the figures I have quoted have no valid excuse.  I am wondering how serious Aer Lingus are about being competitive in the market.</P>
    <P>The services to Montreal and other points in North America have been discontinued. When Aer Lingus discontinued the services to those points, it would have made economic sense for them to have attempted to tie up with an American airline operating within the United States, like Eastern or Delta, which could perhaps have generated business from deep within North America.  I have looked carefully through the report but there is no indication that that possibility is under consideration.</P>
    <P>To be localised or parochial, there are a number of references in the report to Aer Lingus and Aerlinte and the necessity to have a dual stop in this country. There are seven different steps outlined which Aer Lingus are taking to improve the situation on the North Atlantic, but then we come to the following paragraph&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>One aspect of North Atlantic costs which is a specific disadvantage for Aer Lingus is the compulsory double-stop in Ireland.  Aer Lingus indicated that a saving in the order of £700,000 a year might be possible with a single stop only at the Irish end, although Shannon would continue to be used to a large extent since about 60 per cent of the trans-Atlantic traffic originates there.</P>
    <P>There is a further reference in the report in relation to reflecting an attitude by Aer Lingus towards Shannon which I do not accept.  I am not totally happy that the figure of 60 per cent of the traffic generated at Shannon is correct.  Figures from reputable organisations indicate that the percentage is much closer to 70 per cent than it is to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Shannon was developed as the principal trans-Atlantic airport in this country. Its operation revitalised the mid-west of <Col N="1682" /> Ireland.  Its continued prosperity is vital. People might say that is a social argument. There is an economic argument clearly in the fact that up to 70 per cent of Aer Lingus North Atlantic traffic begins and ends at Shannon airport.  If the dual stop is causing a problem, financial or otherise, for Aer Lingus, the sensible thing to do is to turn the jumbos around at Shannon and put in a feeder service of small planes.  I am not totally happy that that proposal would ever find much grace with Aer Lingus because, unfortunately, and I regret to say this, I believe as do a number of others that there is a policy within Aer Lingus to undermine or devalue the importance of Shannon airport in Irish aviation circles. The turnabout service operated very successfully during a recent strike within Aer Lingus.  The capacity of the airport to serve the North Atlantic route effectively and well it has been proved beyond question.</P>
    <P>The catering services at Shannon have not been given the measure of support by Aer Lingus that they deserve.  The catering services there are renowned all over the world.  They have proved themselves to be well capable of providing the measure of service required there.</P>
    <P>There are two proposals which are of vital importance to the future of Shannon airport.  One is the proposal for customs pre-clearance facilities there for the USA.  The second one is the possibility of a Dan-Air operation through Shannon to London.  Both these proposals appear to have been obstructed for some reason or other.  I hope that Aer Lingus and other responsible bodies recognise the importance of these, play their part and make their contribution in ensuring that whatever objections or difficulties are there will be removed.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects of the committee's report which I want to comment on.  Before I move on to the first one, I want to refer to the deserved compliment paid by the committee to the consultants who assisted them in their work.  I do not want my following remarks to be interpreted in any way as reflecting either on the personal integrity or the professional expertise of the people concerned.  I <Col N="1683" /> believe that the objective of the committee in its approach to this report and its approach to the examination of Aer Lingus was one of ensuring independence and total objectivity.  But how do you measure total objectivity if, for example, one or other of the consultants may be from companies or firms who have got commercial ties or directorships and may have an involvement with the airline?</P>
    <P>The committee did a reasonably thorough job in assessing the efficiency of Aer Lingus relative to other European airlines.  Within the base they set for themselves, they did a successful job.  I have a certain reservation that they created too narrow a base in which to make an objective assessment of the effectiveness of the efficiency of Aer Lingus.  They mentioned Finn Air and the Austrain National Airline.  Both of these are national airlines of two countries that have a high cost economic structure. Because of that, it was inevitable that Aer Lingus would emerge well against these two national airlines.  I am doubtful if selecting the national airline of Portugal was an effective comparison.  Here you are making a comparison with a national airline of a country that in recent times has not been renowned for either economic or political stability.  Then there was the comparison with British Caledonian. I believe that if the committee had decided to move outside national airlines to get a comparison with Aer Lingus they should have selected more than one example to do that.  I would have felt that more realistic comparisons of efficiency, cost and so on would have been got if the comparisons were made in relation to perhaps ten to 12 airlines rather than the four.</P>
    <P>The other point relates to the promotion of Irish tourism and the part that Aer Lingus is playing there.  The committee noted that a substantial sum of £13½ million was being spent by Aer Lingus in the promotion of tourism and they came to the conclusion that the co-ordination between Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte in this field had improved and was satisfactory.  I would have felt that perhaps the observations of other organisations, <Col N="1684" /> and in particular the observations of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, on that particular aspect would have been of considerable interest to the committee.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I feel the committee did an excellent job.  They gave us a report that is readable, helpful and informative.  They gave the Seanad the opportunity to discuss it and I sincerely hope that the committee, as promised in their report, will get the opportunity to return to this subject and to a deeper and more thorough examination of the Aer Lingus situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity in this House to discuss Aer Lingus and to debate the report of the Joint Committee and I thank all concerned for their work on the Joint Committee.  It must be quite clear to all in this House that there is nothing more difficult to carry out or more dangerous to handle than to initiate a new order of things which I propose to do this evening.</P>
      <P>I propose to the Minister that we turn about the North Atlantic Aer Lingus planes at Shannon.  I understand, quoting Mr. Kennedy on page 10 of the Minutes of Evidence, we would save ourselves £700,000 a year.  During the strike last year Dublin Airport was closed and Aer Lingus were then turning about their planes at Shannon Airport.  It worked very successfully but I did not see any figures anywhere on what was saved by stopping at Shannon and not coming on to Dublin.  It disturbed me to even see that Mr. Kennedy had the exact figure of what would be saved if over-flying of Shannon took place.  It is important to remember that 70 per cent of passengers land at Shannon and take off from Shannon. I am not being local: I am talking about the west of Ireland and also the rest of Ireland.  I think this House should understand that 70 per cent of traffic is a very large percentage.  This is not said often enough but I wish to put it on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading the committee's report on Aer Lingus I notice that in giving evidence the Aer Lingus management said they would save the £700,000 if they were <Col N="1685" /> allowed to over-fly Shannon.  It was on the books a long time ago and it is on the books again, it seems.  By this I presume they mean that they would fly the full load of passengers to Dublin Airport, at least 70 per cent of whom wanted to get off at Shannon in the first place and they would then dump them to get down to Kerry, Clare, Galway and Mayo.  I maintain that if the Aer Lingus jumbo fleet were turned around at Shannon there would be a saving in fuel and all other costs.  I know that there are problems and I am quite sure I would not like to be looking for a ticket tomorrow on an Aer Lingus plane to go anywhere after making this speech.</P>
    <P>I understand bookings at Shannon are up 28 per cent even at this early stage. Of course we now have Trans-America Airlines and their tickets I understand are $50 cheaper than Aer Lingus.  Some famous man once said: &ldquo;Thou shall go so far but no further&rdquo;.  I wonder should we say this to Aer Lingus today or are we too late in saying it?  Two or three weeks ago in this House we had a debate on the Sugar Company and Senators around me said that the Sugar Company were doing fine while they stayed making sugar but when they got involved with vegetables they started to lose.  Could we be doing the same thing with Aer Lingus?  I am not quite sure about the auxiliary activites such as hotels and so on.  I will come back to that again in a few moments.  Are we making the same mistake again with another State-sponsored body by letting them go outside their areas?  My concern here is that Aer Lingus may need money in the future for re-equipping their old planes and getting new planes off the ground but perhaps a small nation cannot afford to keep pumping money into such a venture.  However, Aer Lingus have not been refused money for planes.  As an elected Member of this House I do not think that the people would approve of giving money to Aer Lingus for anything other than buying planes.</P>
    <P>I am going to ask a few questions about their new acquisitions that we hear so much talk about.  Just take a look at their new travel office assets&mdash;Sunbound, Blue Skies, Air Tour, Enterprise, St. Stephen's <Col N="1686" /> Green and Michael Walsh.  Did Aer Lingus take over one of the above-mentioned recently, with a debt of £800,000?  What did the latest company that Aer Lingus took over cost the taxpayer? Are the individual accounts of each of the mentioned subsidiary companies available for inspection by this House or by a Member of it if we require same?  My worry here is whether Aer Lingus are going into the retail travel trade side, having already been in the wholesale side of the travel world.  We should remember that the Carna and St. Stephen's Green companies were both retail firms.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in this when I look at the ratio of Aer Lingus staff working at each airport with over 5,000 in Dublin, only 300 in Shannon, only 150 in Cork and ten in Belfast.  I am very unhappy about the availability of Aer Lingus services out of Shannon to Europe.  People in the west want to get out of the west sometimes.  We may not be able to afford it as much as people in the east, but some want to, and there are only a few links at the moment. Is it correct that 1,000 people have been taken on in all fields of Aer Lingus in the past two years?  How many of those jobs were given to Cork?  How many of those jobs were given to Belfast?  How many of those jobs were given to Shannon?  How many of those jobs came to Dublin?</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Aer Lingus are concentrating all their European services out of Dublin to the detriment of Cork, Shannon and Belfast.  When the case was being made for an evening flight to Shannon, market research revealed that in the first winter of that year when eventually we brow beat Aer Lingus into giving us the flight, we had 18 to 23 persons and they were paying passengers, not staff.  I am a bit concerned here again, because we have market research again looking into a case we are now making for Shannon-Europe.  Will they come up with the same results?</P>
    <P>One of my most important points here this evening is that 70 per cent opt to get off at Shannon Airport.  We were pleased to read, arising out of the Minister for Transport's visit to Shannon, that the <Col N="1687" /> Government had allocated substantial capital funds to improve the runways and the general facilities at Shannon.  However, to improve the level of traffic through the airport, Shannon management, Aer Rianta, have a plan to have an American customs-free clearance established there.  I know the Minister has to examine all aspects of arrangements for and against this proposal.  The Minister of State is from the west of Ireland like myself, and now that I have stood up and been counted I would like him to do likewise.  To tell him about the refuelling and how terrible our fuel costs are, a plane left Frankfurt on 23 March, flew direct to Shannon empty, did not take on any fuel at Shannon Airport but took on 289 passengers to fly them to Boston.  That is fact.  Did the Minister hear what I said?</P>

      <P>He does believe me.  I am not being local, but I had better not come to Dublin for votes.  I am stating this because I am not talking about Ennis, Shannon or Limerick.  I am talking about Donegal to Kerry, taking in Mayo and Roscommon.  Just take the price of one ticket.  A return ticket from Shannon to Dublin at the moment is £27.50.  I am concerned about the drop in domestic traffic and I wonder if the price that I have just quoted is the reason.  The fall in domestic traffic from Dublin to Shannon and back again in 1979-1980 was 23,948 people.  That is a lot of passengers from Shannon to Dublin and back.  Having said all that, I know the past history of Fianna Fáil Governments.  I know who put Shannon there.  I know who forecast it would not survive, and I am sorry Senator Howard has to listen to me saying it. He heard me saying it before.  Former Ministers in the Lower House said we would have the rabbits running around it.  We will not have the rabbits running around it, because the people will have the good sense again to put another Fianna Fáil Government back in harness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> I understand that repairs are to be carried out on a runway during June, July and August of this year.  That is top season. It has been explained that this is the only time because of surface topping and so on.  Is there any chance that the Minister and his senior officials will take a look at runway 14.23 as well, and we may have less over-flying, and pilots will not have the excuse to over-fly.  I suppose people in high places cannot grant themselves the honour of passing the buck.  I believe that I am here today because I never passed the buck and whether I will walk home or fly home or be at home for good when all this is over, I do not know.  I decided today that when this motion was coming into this House I was going to pin my colours to the mast, and I have done so.

      <P>At the outset I would like to thank the Joint Committee for the time, effort and work which went into the preparation of this comprehensive report on the national airline.  From reading the report it is apparent that the committee approached the subject with a critical and impartial mind.  The report highlights many of the adverse operational and economic factors at present facing the airline in what can only be described as an acutely competitive industry.  It contains constructive proposals as to the various possible ways of surmounting these problems and improving the financial position of Aer Lingus-Aerlinte. I welcome the report and the present opportunity to discuss its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth in the size, complexity and diversity of Aer Lingus operations is such that the company nowadays ranks among the largest of our State-sponsored bodies and represents one of the top 100 companies in the country in terms of employment, <Col N="1689" /> capital employed and annual turnover. The operations of the company embrace two major continents, Europe and North America, and involve vital interests of an economic, social and strategic nature.  The committee were wise in the circumstances to address their inquiry to those matters which were judged to be of major significance.  Likewise, in this contribution, I propose to address myself to a number of significant points affecting the company's operations.</P>
    <P>The world air transport industry has absorbed a number of major changes over the past two decades.  The 1960's saw the widespread introduction of new jet aircraft, a growth in international travel, especially tourism-oriented, and a general buoyancy in airline fortunes. The 1970's on the other hand saw the emergence of a number of major shocks which bore heavily on the airlines.  These included the first fuel crisis of 1973/'74, the subsequent worldwide recession, the second fuel crisis of 1979 and the ensuing downturn in global economic activity which is still with us.  The escalation in the cost of fuel which followed each fuel crisis has been especially severe on the airlines and has, in fact, completely altered the costs structure of airlines.  I give one example to illustrate this; fuel now constitutes about half of direct aircraft operating costs; four or five years ago it accounted for about one-third.  It will be clear from this &mdash; and the joint committee's report acknowledges the fact &mdash; that fuel has now become a dominant factor in airline operations.  Other factors which began to affect the airlines in the 1970's included a dramatic liberalisation of US aviation policy and an increasingly vocal consumer demand for lower fares.  The effect of all these factors has been to catch the majority of major airlines in a pincers between rising costs and diluted revenue.  Many of the factors I have cited are still affecting the airlines and it is fair to say that the airline industry as a whole is at present in a state of transition.  In the case of Aer Lingus the effects of the Northern Ireland troubles on traffic and tourism were additional inhibiting factors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> In recent years, the primary activity of Aer Lingus &mdash; air transportation operations &mdash; taken in isolation, has been operating at a loss.  This is attributable, in the main, to the losses being sustained on the North Atlantic which have more than negatived the operating surplus on the European network.  Other carriers flying the North Atlantic have also recorded massive losses.</P>
    <P>The committee's report deals with this matter and highlights the main reasons for the slump.  The dramatic hike in fuel prices &mdash; a ten-fold increase since 1973 &mdash; is, of course, a primary element.  The effects of the world economic recession have also bitten hard and have caused a significant drop in international air travel.  Side by side with those two developments, the North Atlantic scene has had to contend in recent years with a &ldquo;deregulation&rdquo; policy which has been pursued with great vigour by the US Government. This policy, framed initially for domestic application within the US, and which had as its main thrust a concept of uncontrolled competition, spread quickly to international operations on the North Atlantic.  The opening up of markets to new carriers led to a situation of intense competition with capacity being provided far in excess of requirements.  The fact that the move coincided with a severe slump in the world economy added to the problem.  Airlines chasing fewer passengers resorted to price cutting, and while none of us as consumers will say no to such a move, the consequences for the financial fortunes of the airline industry were very serious indeed.  The aviation industry worldwide experienced its worst ever financial results in 1980 and the prospects for the present year are no more encouraging.</P>
    <P>Our North Atlantic operations traditionally suffer from a number of drawbacks which are peculiar to us and make the task of providing viable North Atlantic services difficult at the best of times. The committee acknowledge the existence of these peculiarities which can be summarised as follows.  First, a substantially higher proportion of Aer Lingus traffic traditionally has been carried at lower promotional fares than for the <Col N="1691" /> industry as a whole.  There is a relatively low volume of business traffic and short stay traffic to and from Ireland.  Most of the traffic is tourist, including a large proportion of ethnic traffic, and is particularly sensitive to price.  Second, Aer Lingus has the added costs of a double stop on each service at Dublin and Shannon. This makes it a more expensive operation than a London-New York service even when allowance is made for the fact that Aer Lingus receive a rebate on certain landing charges.</P>
    <P>Third, traffic on US-Ireland routes is exceptionally seasonal, with for instance August traffic being some seven times the level of February traffic.  Finally, Aer Lingus suffers from higher unit costs due to the small scale of its operation and its resultant inability to exploit economies of scale that are available to larger airlines.</P>
    <P>When taken in conjunction with the problems which are afflicting the airline industry generally, the picture that emerges is a far from happy one.  The problems posed are serious and development of a strategy that will see us through these difficult times will require great effort on the part of all concerned, including the Government, the board and management of the airline and, not least, the work force.  In that regard, I think it is pertinent to draw particular attention to paragraph 126 of the committee's report which dealt with the losses incurred as a result of strikes in 1978 and again last year and to share the view of the committee that such developments cannot help in maintaining marginal services and must prejudice employment in the long term.  I know that, faced with their present problems, Aer Lingus are engaged in detailed negotiations with the trade unions on many fronts and I would urge that both management and workers would look on the difficulties as a challenge to be met and overcome on a team basis.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I was very pleased to note that just last week Aer Lingus and the trade unions concluded productivity agreements with three of their main staff categories &mdash; clerical staff, pilots and <Col N="1692" /> cabin crews &mdash; and that the airline hopes to conclude similar deals with tradesmen and other operative gardes.  Cutting unit costs is essential if Aer Lingus is to compete in the present-day airline environment and, on that score, I very much welcome the progress being made on the productivity front.  Aer Lingus have a mandate to provide a reasonable, efficient and economical public air transport service, both domestic and international, to meet the needs of industry, commerce, tourism and the Irish community generally. The possible termination of Aer Lingus North Atlantic services is a question which obviously has arisen from time to time but the potential disadvantages of this course have in the past outweighed the attractions.  Termination of the North Atlantic operations would not eliminate the losses at present arising, at least in the short term.  The North Atlantic services carry substantial overheads, a large proportion of which would transfer to the European operation on the closure of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the transatlantic operation cannot be judged in purely financial terms as it has much wider connotations, both nationally and internationally.  In the national context Shannon, as it is today, owes its existence to the North Atlantic operation.  Termination of an Atlantic service under the Irish flag could be calamitous for the airport.  The Atlantic operation has been a major factor in attracting a variety of business and industry to the area.  It has ensured that a substantial number of US tourists commence their holidays at Shannon.  For this reason withdrawal by Aer Lingus from the route would have serious repercussions for tourism which would become dependent on foreign carriers who could not be relied upon to promote the Irish market vigorously or provide the type of all-year-round services required, particularly if the present unfavourable airline economic trends continue.  There is the possibility that US carriers might be tempted to serve Ireland through the UK and by-pass Shannon altogether.  Termination of transatlantic services would also result in considerable unemployment not only directly at the airport and at representative <Col N="1693" /> offices in the US but also indirectly through the loss of tourism and its associated benefits.  Withdrawal from the North Atlantic would also be damaging to business and industrial development. The decision last year by Aer Lingus, accepted by the Government only with the greatest reluctance, provoked widespread adverse reaction.  In all these circumstances what I have said gives some indication of what termination of the transatlantic service could mean and I must say that the committee, in their report, have demonstrated a keen appreciation of the position.</P>
    <P>Suggestions which the Joint Committee have made, aimed at alleviating certain burdens, such as the double-stop requirements at Dublin and Shannon will be carefully examined.  At the same time let me hasten to add that, as the Minister for Transport has made known on many occasions and most recently in a speech made in Shannon on 16 March last, there is no question but that Shannon will continue as Ireland's only transatlantic gateway.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have suggested the abandonment of Dublin and the operation of a turnaround service at Shannon with a feeder connection to Dublin.  The advantages which are seen in basing the airline's Atlantic fleet and operation at Shannon are not there in reality.  Such a course would involve serious difficulties.  These would include the technical problem of a split maintenance and operational base and the operation of a feeder service between Shannon and Dublin, requiring the acquisition of additional shorthaul aircraft and supporting equipment.  Apart from this, Dublin is the nation's capital, the major centre of population and it would be unrealistic to contemplate the city not having a throughplane service to the United States via Shannon.  Indeed, contrary to the often quoted view, the Aer Lingus transatlantic service relies heavily on both Dublin and Shannon for its traffic base and elimination of one or other stopping point would not be in the best interests of Aer Lingus at this time.</P>
    <P>The Committee considered and, understandably, did not favour the <Col N="1694" /> notion that the North Atlantic services should be subsidised by the State.  Much of the success achieved by Aer Lingus down the years has been due to the fact that the company is seen as one operating on the basis of commercial criteria. Whatever formula emerges to deal with the present day problems must carry no suggestion of direct subvention of what are the airline's normal commercial activities. A move in that direction would, in my view, be inconsistent with the strong commercial motivation which has always been evident in the management and work force and been a major asset to the airline in overcoming difficulties in the past.  In the difficult times that still lie ahead, I believe that we need to sustain and strengthen, and not weaken, the strong commercial edge which has given Aer Lingus a high reputation in the competitive air transport industry.</P>
    <P>The trend towards de-regulation and liberalisation has, so far, been concentrated on the North Atlantic, but there are developments which suggest that the European arena is likely to experience similar changes in the years ahead.  Fare levels in the European area have recently come under increasing pressure, especially from consumer interests.  In addition, as the report of the Joint Committee points out, the EEC have recently begun to direct their attention to the air transport field and have published a memorandum which advocates an evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary, approach to the many complex issues involved.  In addition to this, a number of European carriers, including Sabena, SAS and Swissair, have introduced or resumed scheduled services to and from Ireland and there is the prospect of other European carriers entering the scene.  All of these factors suggest a growing level of competition for Aer Lingus in Europe in the years ahead.  Any increased competition on European routes from other European carriers may be expected to affect Aer Lingus but, of course, there should also be benefits to the consumer in terms of extra services, better frequencies, new routes and a greater variety in air fares.</P>
    <P>The role of the national carrier in the <Col N="1695" /> development of tourism is obviously a major consideration and was one of the major issues addressed in the committee's report.  In recent years, when our tourist trade was suffering gravely from the effects of the troubles in the North of Ireland as well as the difficulties arising abroad, our national carriers, in both the air and shipping spheres, made a major contribution through their continued intensive promotion of the Irish market. The commercial interests of the carriers largely coincide with the national objective of developing the tourist industry and it is natural, therefore, that the airlines and other carriers should be very much alive to the needs of tourism.  At the same time, they must take account of their profit and loss account and balance sheet and cannot be expected to incur excessive losses in the continued carriage of passengers at uneconomic rates.  The expansion of tourism requires a developing access transport network accompanied by investment in fleet capacity; such investment &mdash; so essential for tourism &mdash; can be sustained only on the basis of carriers operating on a sound financial basis.</P>
    <P>In their report, the committee voiced some concern at the particular danger of Aer Lingus, because of their financial resources, taking on too much of the role of national promotion, which is properly the job of Bord Fáilte.  The committee did not view this as appropriate, particularly at a time when Aer Lingus's overall profitability is low, and suggested that Aer Lingus should concentrate their promotional efforts to serve their basic business of selling seats.  Viewed from an Aer Lingus perspective, there are certainly attractions in this point of view and this whole question will have to be gone into in great detail, as part of the Government's consideration of the overall position in relation to the airline's North Atlantic operations.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a very satisfactory degree of collaboration and co-ordination between Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus and this collaboration has been valuable to both parties.  Various special promotions undertaken in collaboration <Col N="1696" /> between the two bodies have made a valuable contribution to our tourism in recent years and have been of advantage to Aer Lingus, also.</P>
    <P>Ancillary activities now play a very significant role in the overall operation and financing of the airline.  With Government approval, the airline substantially increased its involvement in ancillary activities in the early seventies for the purpose of generating profits to offset the frequent cyclical troughs and financial fluctuations in its primary activity, that of air transportation.  The successful strategy of investing in, and acquiring, ancillary businesses has been vindicated by the results achieved to date.  In recent months, Aer Lingus have been reviewing the role, contribution and future development of their ancillary activities.  At present, some 75 per cent of all profits in the ancillaries sector accrue from three specific areas, aircraft contract maintenance and overhaul, hotel and leisure operations and aircraft brokerage. A decline in profitability in any one of these areas would seriously affect the airline and, to ensure against this, Aer Lingus are considering what they may need to do in order to broaden the ancillary activities base.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the ancillary activities side, it is only appropriate that I should make mention of the Airmotive project which Aer Lingus have successfully launched.  The Airmotive project located at Baldonnel entails the rebuilding and overhaul of commercial jet engines, and involves a total investment of some £25 million.  At full capacity Airmotive will provide 650 new jobs.  Already some 150 people are employed.  This is a project with tremendous possibilities and I know that all in the House will join with me in wishing Aer Lingus and Airmotive well with the venture.</P>
    <P>The committee's report identifies two main issues which the committee felt needed to be singled out for consideration. Those are, first, the question of Aer Lingus's capital structure, and in particular the debt-equity ratio that is appropriate; second, the question of what should be the proper balance between the main business and the ancillary activities <Col N="1697" /> in terms of financial commitment.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have recently completed an in-depth appraisal of their current and projected performance of their air transportation activities, the role, contribution and future development of the ancillary activities and their future investment plans and requirements.  That appraisal has confirmed, among other things, the serious imbalance in the debt-equity ratio and the increased importance of the ancillary activities.  My Department will be evaluating the results of that review and the Minister will be presenting concrete proposals to the Government designed to provide a sound basis for the growth and development of all the company's activities and operations during the 1980s.  The report on Aer Lingus by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored bodies and the many points made during this debate will provide a useful input into my Department's evaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not be very long because many of the points that I was going to make have been pretty well covered but I want to make my contribution to this debate.  I want to welcome two new developments which have come about since this report was drawn up.  One is the fact that worker participation is now a fact in Aer Lingus which must improve industrial relations there or, putting it at its most negative, cannot possibly do any harm.  The other is the matter to which the Minister referred already, the setting up of Airmotive Ireland whose very inception surely is a tribute to the success of Aer Lingus's ancillary activities.  The very fact that it is being set up at all is an attempt to provide for an area of Aer Lingus growth which has been exceptionally successful.  Much has been said about the trans-Atlantic aspect of the company's business and indeed Senator Howard and Senator Honan gave us food for thought.  I am very glad to take what I believe is the Minister's promise that the unthinkable is not being thought about, that there can be no question at this stage of shutting down the company's trans-Atlantic services. To do so, would be disastrous for Shannon.  It would be disastrous for our international role, so to speak, for our relations with our ethnic community in America and we must hang in there and perhaps hope for an upturn.  But even if <Col N="1701" /> there is not an upturn it seems to me that it is a very grave decision for Government ultimately to take regardless of whether we continue on the north Atlantic.  The other airlines, after all, have no real interest in this country.  Like all multinationals they will pull out when it suits them. Other airlines have pulled out in the past and these will pull out, too, when it suits them.  By the way, we might remind ourselves that Trans-America is not purely a private airline, that it has military connections, Pentagon backing and a federal subsidy.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Joint Committee report stresses the national interest which has to be taken into consideration as well as purely commercial considerations. In short, the national airline would demean itself and would demean us really by giving up their obligation to conduct an all-year round service to America while tourist traffic would be very adversely affected.  It is impossible to quantify Aer Lingus's contribution to the American-based tourist market but it must be very considerable.  The ethnic market is there also.  Irish-Americans probably have many faults to our way of thinking but they are generous and they have an affection for this country and they are prepared to fly the shamrock if given any encouragement at all.</P>
      <P>There is another interest as well, as any of us who has ever watched Aer Lingus operating in Kennedy Airport will know, that is that they carry the interest of other airlines also.  Therefore, the chopping down of the north Atlantic operations would mean a pulling in, a contraction of Aer Lingus's international interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the talk about productivity, a word that I have great difficulty in understanding.  I take it to mean that there are suspicions that the airline is overmanned or perhaps over &ldquo;womanned&rdquo;, but what we should remember are factors like safety, first of all, which has not been so far referred to here tonight.  Aer Lingus have a remarkably impressive reputation as a safe airline. That surely has to do with manning levels at every stage.  The week before last the air stewardesses of a particular <Col N="1702" /> American line were at Boston Airport asking for signatures to a petition of their own&mdash;that they wanted to avoid a contemplated reduction of staff.  The point they were making to interested people who chatted to them was that air hostesses are not there simply for the contemplation of their pulchritude, that they are not there simply to hand out drinks but that they are there in a very important security and safety role as well in case of any emergency.  The number of cabin staff is proportionately related to the safety of the operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn from the problems of the north Atlantic to dwell for a moment on the impressive achievements of the national airline in other areas.  I mean geographical areas and other areas of operation.  The report made only a brief reference, by way of appendix, to the airline's operations and connections with the Third World.  We should remind ourselves here of the impressive achievements of Aer Lingus in this area in their training programmes here in Ireland.  The number of technical apprentices at present being trained is remarkably high: 160 technical apprentices are being trained in a three-year programme.  Their simulator programme operates on a 24-hour day basis.  There is extensive training of pilots from Third World countries and, most lucrative of all, is their contracts for maintenance and overhaul.  These are, for the most part, commercial operations. Aer Lingus are not in this kind of business in the Middle East and Africa just to aid the Third World.  They are there to make money.  But the implications go far beyond the purely commercial. The airline does not do a song and dance about their operations but it is a remarkable fact that Aer Lingus have more work in Africa than any other European airline, though it must be one of the smallest European airlines.</P>
    <P>On a recent sales tour Boeing took along Aer Lingus representatives with them in Africa as a kind of guarantor of the good faith of Boeing.  That says volumes for the standing of Aer Lingus in various African States.  I am informed that heads of various States in Africa take a personal interest in airlines and that <Col N="1703" /> they talk to each other about airlines.  It is not <i>folie de grandeur</i> on our part to imagine that we are well-got, so to speak, in that respect in many African States. Some of these fledgling airlines in developing countries have had bad experiences with their ex-colonial masters.  Here Aer Lingus can score again.  Aer Lingus make a point of not trying to muscle in or of outstaying their welcome.  They can read the situation very well.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about costs and the need to be viable and commercial we must remember there are all kinds of intangible possibilities, that in Africa, for example, the kind of pilots and apprentices who are being trained may be very important people in their countries in, say, ten years' time.  They know we are meeting their needs and the potential for the future there in terms of growth development is enormous.  Without being irrelevant, it is important to note that one of the reasons for Aer Lingus doing so well in Africa is that we are acceptable to these African States because of our particular role in the world, which, I might say, has recently been at risk.</P>
    <P>When we discuss reports such as these, I am all for being realistic and for talking in hard-nose terms about facts and figures and the need for commercial viability.  But occasion calls sometimes for patting ourselves on the back, or at least patting one of our most successful semi-State companies on the back.  Whatever their present difficulties it is gratifying to reflect that they are one of our success stories, that they are very much part of what Ireland is or should be about in the larger world community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Once more I welcome the fact that the joint committee have had an opportunity to look at an important matter like this.  The semi-State bodies in the last few years, particularly since inflation has become such a problem to business in all of its areas, have come under particular pressure because the working capital requirements in order to remain standing, are inflating every year at the inflation rate.  This has put tremendous pressure on all of the semi-State <Col N="1704" /> bodies and Aer Lingus are no exception. As the Minister told us, in relation to the figures for fuel, costs have gone from a third to a half.  That puts enormous pressure on the cost structure of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>People have said many good things about Aer Lingus and I would like to have elaborated on those but we are short on time.  One of the points I would like to make is that down through the years Aer Lingus have made a tremendous contribution to training in Ireland and to the development of management techniques. They have always been to the forefront in areas like work study, quality control, safety, and use of computers.  In fact Aer Lingus was one of the first to introduce a fully integrated computer scheduling and booking system which is worldwide. That know-how is sold to other airlines. They have always been to the forefront; they are a leading company and we are proud of them.  Also when they adopted a diversification policy&mdash;which was very creative and led to their taking some major steps that some people looked on somewhat suspiciously and perhaps cynically&mdash;they were ensuring their own survival. As the Minister has said, they have been encouraged by the Government to do that.  Clearly they will be encouraged to continue to do so.</P>
      <P>When we come to one of the issues raised in the debate&mdash;that raised in a strong way by Senator Honan&mdash;I find myself in a peculiar position and, because of that, it enables me to be objective.  I spent a good deal of my time in Shannon. I was there when a certain famous member of the Opposition was talking about the rabbits running across the runways of Shannon.  I lived to see the day when one would see hardly a rabbit within sight of the place for noise and activity, not alone aircraft but industrial activity.  I spent a number of years working in Shannon in one of the main industries, which is now 21 years old.  Therefore I feel I have a feeling for Shannon and can talk a bit about it.  Also, I live on the north side of Dublin amongst a lot of people who work in Aer Lingus, who depend on their viability and continuing expansion in the Dublin area.  Therefore I feel qualified to speak on both counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> I am glad to hear from the Minister that there is no question of closing down Aer Lingus's interests in the North Atlantic route.  It is an advantage to Ireland in many ways.  We have 75 per cent of the traffic and this must have spin-off effects that are difficult to quantify.  A cost-benefit analysis might be able to show that what appears to be a loss in money terms might, in general benefit terms, be a gain.</P>
    <P>The question of terminating at Shannon is another matter.  I have gone to the bother of looking into some of the facts on this.  Taking an objective view of it&mdash;and not just a view of someone living on the north side of Dublin, worried about constituents and the employees of Aer Lingus&mdash;it seems to be a rather wasteful alternative.  The duplication of equipment, the new capital investment that would be required to provide the maintenance needed, the fact that unit costs on the trans-Atlantic route would go up by 20 per cent if this happened, the fact that extra short-haul aircraft would have to be taken on, because the major demand for them would come at the peak of the season, would involve the airline in extra capital costs which would not be sensible at this point in time, or indeed perhaps at any point in time.  Aer Lingus flying through Shannon to Dublin gives Dublin as the capital, an advantage over other airlines.  It gives Aer Lingus an advantage over other airlines.  It is a competitive offering which puts Aer Lingus ahead of other airlines and enables them to take whatever is available out of the route.  As the Minister said the route is carrying some of the overheads at present. To take it away would mean that whatever contribution emanated from the route would disappear and that would not be a good thing.  I am glad the Government are going to stick with the North Atlantic, that Aer Lingus are going to fly into Shannon, but I am also glad that they are going to fly through Shannon to Dublin.</P>
    <P>As far as the debt&mdash;equity ratio is concerned I would not be too worried.  When one looks at the Japanese situation one can see that they have learned how to expand and gain greater market shares in <Col N="1706" /> various areas while operating very high debt-equity ratios.  As Senator Whitaker knows, I am somewhat liberal when it comes to thinking about debt-equity ratios anyway.  As far as selling seats is concerned&mdash;and concentrating on selling seats and not Ireland&mdash;I do not know what the committee were at when they made that recommendation because marketing is about selling the smile on the Aer Lingus hostess's face as much as it is about selling the seat.  I would not like to see them concentrating on selling the seats only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of brevity I am going to drop various laudatory and critical remarks and get straight to the soft, vulnerable areas in what I might call ireverently the under-belly of the Joint Committee.  I mentioned one of these soft spots when speaking on the Irish Sugar Company, that was, the risk of accepting too easily the social service or, I might add, the national prestige excuse for subsidising losses indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I want now to concentrate on spoiling the unanimity with which the recommendation about improving the equity-debt ratio in both companies, but particularly now Aer Lingus, has been accepted. Whatever other reasons may be advanced for increasing the State's equity holding in Aer Lingus it is not valid to argue that this should be done in order to conform to private commercial norms. That has been the committee's approach. The committee, however, make no attempt to establish that private commercial norms are relevant or appropriate in the case of a State enterprise.  With respect, I do not see any valid parallel. The committee's arguments in paragraph 29 of this report are not well founded.  I would deny the cloak of respectability to an operation which I believe must be looked upon strictly as a form of longterm subsidisation from public funds of a State enterprise.  Underlying the committee's recommendation is a mistaken belief that interest payments are a form of robbery from which State enterprises ought to be rescued or protected by throwing the interest burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> Why do I say that there is not a valid parallel with private commercial norms? Essentially because the share capital in private companies must be adequately remunerated over time, having regard to the rate of inflation, or its market value will sink and the prospect of raising any fresh capital in this way will vanish.  I ask: can any such prospect of adequate remuneration of share capital be held out in the case of Aer Lingus or <i>a fortiori,</i> in the case of the Irish Sugar Company?</P>
    <P>Major private companies in these islands, as the committee have pointed out, maintain roughly a 50:50 ratio of equity to borrowings.  But they do so principally because of the conventional expectation of lenders the proprietors of an enterprise should themselves have a substantial stake in it which would show their faith in the venture and also provide free asset cover as security for any loans.  This is not so necessary in the case of State enterprises where the security of the State is there to reassure potential lenders and enable borrowing to take place on reasonable terms.  I may say that private companies would themselves like to have as low a ratio of equity to debt as market opinion would tolerate.  Senator Mulcahy has mentioned the Japanese example.  They would take this attitude because it is generally cheaper to raise money by borrowing at a fixed rate with interest allowed as an expense for tax purposes rather than by an issue of shares.  If shares are to be used to raise new capital they must have a high market rating and they will have this only if they carry dividends above the inflation rate, dividends which do not exhaust all the profit but leave enough to be put to reserves against future losses as well as for renewal and extension of plant and equipment.  It is quite definitely not as a means of providing cost-free capital that equity is maintained at a fairly high ratio in private companies.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said enough to differentiate private and public enterprises in this matter of equity-debt ratio, and to pursuade the Joint Committee to reconsider an approach which I consider both suspect <Col N="1708" /> and very dangerous.  The real test in my view of whether an enterprise, public or private, is a worthwhile viable entity from the community standpoint is: do they clear their running cost and give an adequate return whether in the form of interest or dividends, on the capital employed in them?</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  I want to speak on behalf of the 30 per cent who want to fly direct to Dublin.  I am absolutely in favour of maintaining Shannon Airport.  I do not want to be misrepresented but, as a reasonably regular traveller on the trans-Atlantic route, I think it is appalling to have to land at Shannon Airport at 6 a.m. particularly in the dullness of the Irish winter and wait to travel on to Dublin if one wants to get to Europe.  There should be compromise thinking on this and there should be a triangular route outwards by Shannon where you have all the glamour of duty-free shopping, on to New York and back overnight.  We would get far more passengers if the route were through Dublin to Shannon and en route we gave them a very hearty Irish breakfast.  If this was marketed we would get many more extra passengers.</P>
      <P>I would also hope that in future the new timetables marking changes in winter or summer time could be made available before the changes take place.  I have nothing but praise and admiration for the administration of Aer Lingus over a great number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the mover of the motion, Senator Cooney, and the seconder, Senator Hillery, I wish to conclude the debate formally.  I want to thank all the Senators who participated in the debate and to express our gratitude to the Minister of State for his contribution. The debate on this motion showed <Col N="1709" /> awareness of and pride in the strength of Aer Lingus.  It also showed genuine concern for the difficulties which face our national airline.  From that point of view it has been an extremely valuable debate.</P>
      <P>The time is approaching fairly rapidly when we will have to reconsider the existing philosophy towards the operation of our semi-State companies in general.  The present model served us very well in the sixties and seventies but I do not think that we should necessarily adhere rigidly to it throughout the eighties and nineties. One has to be flexible.  I have a personal philosophy about State companies.  I do not believe the State should tie the hands of the board of Aer Lingus.  The State should give Aer Lingus and all our State companies full commercial freedom.  In this regard I differ from the committee. They took a rather cautious approach to Aer Lingus and their diversification plans and counselled care in delving into ancillary activities.  The essence of the philosophy of not tying the hands of the board of Aer Lingus or any State company is that we charge them with providing a proper service for the Irish people.  Having done that, we should not try to do it for them.  Give them responsibility.  Give them adequate resources and time.  If they are not successful replace the people who have not achieved success.  That approach is more and more needed in our State companies.  Give them a job to do and if they do not do it, find somebody who will do it.  Public accountability does not suffer by this approach.  On the contrary, public accountability would be enhanced by this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total investment by this State in our national airline since 1936 amounts to almost £44 million.  It should be put on record that Aer Lingus have not received any subsidy from the State since 1950. They received no operating subsidy.  The sum of £44 million is a relatively small investment in what has become a very large business.  The Irish community have received excellent value in terms of tourism promotion, foreign earnings and job creation.  The net worth of Aer Lingus today is reckoned at over £100 million. That is a considerable Irish asset considering that they have not received a subsidy <Col N="1710" /> since 1950.  Achieving that asset base is a fair performance.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus offer good value for money on most of their routes.  As other speakers have said there is room for more competitive fares between Ireland and Britain.  It has also been said that the cost inflation of airlines is enormous.  We have to stitch this into the record time and time again.  Eight years ago in 1973 the fuel bill of our national airline was £3 million.  The corresponding figure today is £50 million.  It has gone from £3 million to £50 million in eight years and also wage inflation has been catching up on the airline.  For a company involved mainly in exports &mdash; whether or not they are invisible exports &mdash; this trend is particularly serious.  Given that, they are doing quite a good job.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister took this opportunity to put an end to a lot of this nonsense talked about abandoning the North Atlantic route.  In the report it is stated that at a later evidence session Aer Lingus also said that the losses are now such that the correct commercial decision could conceivably be to look at the possibility of pulling out of the North Atlantic route.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has taken this opportunity to put that to bed once and for all.  It would be utter and total madness to consider that approach, and it is not just a simple economic one. We have to have that North Atlantic route and we have to pay for it but we should pay for it by giving Aer Lingus the total commercial freedom they require, which would enable them to earn the revenue in other areas to look after that necessary loss on the North Atlantic route.  We should not concentrate our efforts on talking about cutting out the North Atlantic route: even the talk of cutting out the North Atlantic route could seriously affect Aer Lingus's image abroad.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their comments. Aer Lingus is not just an airline.  Its existence is a constant international symbol of the new Ireland and it is a source of pride to all of us here and to our friends abroad. While we charge Aer Lingus with paying <Col N="1711" /> their way, we should help them to improve their equity base.  There have been a number of demands from speakers today for the Government to give Aer Lingus more money so that they can improve their equity base.  I would prefer to see a partnership approach to the building up of that equity.  Aer Lingus themselves can build up that equity by profitable ancillary operations.  We should not put a rein on the type of activities they get into as long as they are in the national interest and are profitable. In that regard the State might match Aer Lingus £ for £ on increasing the equity base.  On that basis we would get a partnership building of the equity base.</P>
    <P>It was a very good idea to have this discussion today.  It was extremely valuable. As I said at the beginning Aer Lingus is not just another commercial enterprise; in recent years it has come to be more a symbol of our national maturity.</P>

    <Title>Report of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the First Report of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House and the Government Chief Whip for affording time to debate this motion so soon after the report was presented to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly important, in that the Select Committee have not reported for ten years.  I will refer to the background and to the importance of this committee. Much of our legislation nowadays comes by way of statutory instruments which are made under legislation passed by the Oireachtas and the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments of this House was set up in the early days of the State to oversee the form and content and the method of presentation of statutory instruments, and it has brought order where formerly chaos reigned.  The fact that the statutory instruments are now presented in a uniform manner and obey <Col N="1712" /> certain conventions is mainly due to the work of the Select Committee.  There is no corresponding committee in the other House, and so the importance of the work of this committee is underlined.  If one looks at the operations of previous committees one should pay tribute to two former distinguished chairmen, the late George O'Brien and W. A. W. Sheldon, who, by their efforts, established the precedents under which the Select Committee now operate.</P>
    <P>The fact that there has not been a report for ten years is due to two things in the main, first, the lack of staffing for the committee's work and, second it must be acknowledged a certain lack of drive by Members of this House.  A great deal of work is required to service the committee as the Members of the House will see from the report.  Over 300 statutory instruments were considered during the period of the operation of this committee so far.  Each one takes a great deal of effort, time and expertise.  On behalf of the committee, I pay tribute to the staff member who carried out most of the work for her expertise and attention to the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>The report that was presented to each Member of the House does not contain in full the appendices which deal with the correspondence between the Select Committee and the instrument-making bodies. When the committee feel that, for some reason or other, the attention of Seanad Éireann should be drawn to an instrument, before they do so they enter into correspondence with the instrument-making body, Department or other authority.  The correspondence can often be long and detailed and the practice of the committee is to ask the instrument-making body for an explanation of the apparent deviation from procedure. The full report plus appendices comes to over 100 pages.  So we felt that, perhaps, we would spare every Member of the House the appendices.  They are available should anyone wish to consult them.</P>
    <P>During the period in which the committee operated, 333 statutory instruments were examined of which 297 did not call for comment.  The grounds on <Col N="1713" /> which the instruments can be examined are set out in page 1 of the report under the heading Resolutions Reference and no instruments are being brought to the attention of the House under the first three grounds.  Under ground No. 4 that there was a delay in laying the instrument after it was made, twenty-one statutory instruments are brought to the attention of the House.  I would like to quote from the report of the previous committee which considered this defect.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made and, if a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by either House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the regulations have been laid before it, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rsquo;. Where this provision applies, a member of Seanad Éireann may put down a motion for annulment, only after the instrument has been laid, although the instrument will have been in force from the date of making.  It follows that the element of control retained by the Oireachtas depends, for its effectiveness, on the laying of instruments within the shortest possible period after making.</P>
    <P>To state the extreme case, it is possible to have an instrument made, under which irrevocable action may be taken, before the Oireachtas will have had an opportunity of considering the instrument.</P>
    <P>Previous Select Committees have taken the view that a period of seven days between the making and the laying of an instrument is excessive and they have directed the attention of the Seanad to any instrument which has shown a gap of more than seven days between the making and laying of the instrument.  There are 21 instruments which fell into this category.</P>
    <P>On ground (v) &ldquo;That for any special reason its form or purport calls for elucidation&rdquo;, five instruments are brought to the attention of the House, due to the <Col N="1714" /> fact that there is not an explanatory memorandum, which does not form a legal part of the instrument but which, particularly in the case of complex and technical instruments, sets forth in laymen's terms what the instrument actually means.  The omission of these explanatory notes was due to oversights by the Department or the instrument-making authority concerned.  On a previous occasion the Select Committee recommended, and the Minister for Finance issued the recommendation to all instrument-making bodies, that such an explanatory note should be added at the end of each instrument. Five instruments failed to have an explanatory note and we direct the attention of the House to this.</P>
    <P>For another reason, the attestation of the schedules which appear in connection with certain instruments, five instruments are to be noted.  In these instruments the schedules appear below the signature of the Minister involved in giving his attestation. While the schedules are legal parts of the instrument, previous Select Committees have taken the view that the Minister's signature should appear underneath the schedule and in no case above the schedule concerned.  Five such instruments are brought to the attention of the House.  In the case of one instrument where the attestation signature of a consenting Minister, in this case the Minister for Finance, is required, it was felt that the Minister's signature should appear on the instrument as well as the signature of the Minister by whose Department the instrument was issued.  This does not invalidate the legality of the instrument but it has been felt by previous Select Committees that it would be best that all the signatures of all the Ministers involved should appear on the instruments.</P>
    <P>In the case of three instruments the committee feel that there should have been more direct citation of statutory authority.  The instruments are made under certain Acts of the Oireachtas and the Select Committee feel that the actual citation of the specific Acts under which the instruments are made should be given in every instrument.</P>
    <P>Previous Select Committees have taken <Col N="1715" /> the view that blanket phrases of citations should always be avoided.  The phrase which has caught our eye is &ldquo;any and every power in this behalf enabling&rdquo;.  We take the view of previous Select Comtees that such phrases should be avoided and specific citations to specific Acts of the Oireachtas should be accurately given in every single instrument.  The three instruments involved were made by the Incorporated Law Society in one case and the Circuit Court Rules Committee in two cases.  The Incorporated Law Society have agreed with our recommendation that they discontinue the use of such blanket phrases.  Regrettably the Circuit Court Rules Committee have not yet agreed with the committee's recommendation. They point out that this phrase has been used previously and they do not see why it should not be used again.  The committee do not take this view and do not believe that bad practice should necessarily be followed and they intend to pursue the matter with the Circuit Court Rules Committee.  They wish to draw the attention of the House to three statutory instruments under this heading.</P>
    <P>Finally, on ground (vi) the Select Committee consider that one particular instrument should be drawn to the attention of the House on the grounds of defective drafting.  One might say that it is politically sensitive because it is Statutory Instrument No. 16 of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960, (Section 31) Order, 1980 under which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can direct that spokesmen of certain organisations be restrained from broadcasting on RTE. The section which in the opinion of the Select Committee rendered the Statutory Instrument meaningless is as follows:</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Eireann is hereby directed to refrain from broadcasting any matter which is an interview or report of an interview, with a spokesman or with spokesmen for any other or more of the following organisations, namely,...</P>
    <P>The offending word is &ldquo;other&rdquo;.  Of course the legality of the instrument derives not from the copy which is laid before the <Col N="1716" /> House.  It derives from the actual instrument which is in the possession of the instrument-making body and the committee directed me as chairman to inspect the original.  The original was found to be correct.  The phrase is, of course, &ldquo;any one or more&rdquo; and that was the phrase in the original.  The instrument itself was correct but the committee direct the attention of the Seanad to this particular instrument on the grounds that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs failed in their duty to lay an accurate copy before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  It is important that committees set up by Parliament should submit reports to Parliament and have them debated there. The usefulness of such committees has been seen in the reports of committees like the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and the very interesting and useful debates we have had on these reports.</P>
      <P>This committee in three years dealt with 333 statutory instruments.  Twenty-one instruments were found to infringe the fourth resolution of the committee's reference, that is, there appears to have been unjustifiable delay either in laying the statutory instruments before Seanad Éireann or in publication.  On inquiry, the processing of these documents appeared to have caused delays and the committee considered that the instructions regarding the processing of statutory instruments should be drawn to the attention of all staff members of government Departments or anyone else likely to be involved in the processing of these instruments.  The system should not grind to a halt because the civil servant in charge of processing statutory instruments in any Department is absent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which concerned the committee was the absence of an explanatory memorandum in five statutory instruments.  The correct attestation of schedules of certain statutory instruments was a matter to which the committee felt obliged to draw to the attention of certain Government Departments, as was the citation of the statutory authority under which the instrument was made in certain cases.  In this regard the committee <Col N="1717" /> deplored the use of such phrases, for example &ldquo;as each and every power in this behalf enabling&rdquo; as being vague, unsuitable and far beyond the terms of reference under which statutory instruments are drawn up.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House in particular to the second resolution of reference of the committee&mdash;that the special attention of Seanad Éirann should be drawn to a statutory instrument on the following grounds: that it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the statute under which it is made.  It must be the concern of the House that the thrust and meaning of the statutes passed in the House by the elected representatives should not be changed by the civil service.  We are governed by the democratic process, by laws which are drafted, debated, amended and finally passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is undesirable, therefore, that we should be governed by ministerial order or that a Minister should, in making a ministerial order, exercise powers in excess of those conferred by statute.  The committee must be held to have a watch-dog function, to hold a watching brief, on behalf of the Members of the House to ensure that the meaning of the laws passed lose nothing, and gain nothing, by the subsequent passage of statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the secretary of the committee for the work she has done in the three years since the committee were set up.  The work required to process the operations of the committee is enormous.  I believe that the Select Committee in the House of Commons have the services of two senior counsel and a regular staff.  If we are to do our job properly we would need a very much expanded staff.  I would also like to compliment Senator West under whose able-chairmanship the committee functioned for the last three years.</P>

    <P>Instruments&mdash;be they the instruments <Col N="1718" /> peculiar to trade or profession, be they surgical instruments or any other sort of instruments&mdash;are very important.  No matter how good a tradesman or a craftsman is, no matter what his skills, or how intelligent he is, unless his instruments are correct the results will be unsatisfatory. There must be an edge and a precision in all these tools and we must have an edge and a precision in our statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>Details are available in the documents provided in the House of little things that were incorrect, badly phrased, or messed up through inaccuracies in typing or reprinting, which could have led to very difficult situations under certain circumstances. Thankfully that did not happen. As a committee we took every precaution to see that everything was as it should be, and it is a source of pride to all that of the 333 statutory instruments we inspected, only 10 per cent were found to be defective in some way, and some only very slightly defective.  I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the chairman, Senator West, every member of the committee and the staff who worked, guided and helped us.  They deserve the very highest commendation.  I hope we will continue the good work we have begun.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At first glance this is not terribly exciting subject matter, but after consideration I see it is extremely important.  I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the Select Committee and particularly to refer to the detective work in clarifying the garbled phrase in the notorious section 31.  I would like to make two brief comments.  First, is there something significant in the fact that the Department of Social Welfare seem to be a particularly serious offender in being responsible for delays?  Second, the tone <Col N="1719" /> of the letter from the registrar of the Dublin Circuit Court strikes me as what used to be called in days of trial of heretics definitely <i>contumax.</i> Is that also the impression of the committee?  Has the registrar cocked a snook at the committee? What is the secret?</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the chairman and members of the committee for their very valuable and thorough report.  I was on this committee many years age when Senator George O'Brien was the chairman.  Over a number of years we managed to persuade the various Departments to be more careful in issuing statutory instruments.  It did take some years, but gradually we persuaded them to depart from their slipshod ways and in the end our efforts were so successful that we became more of less redundant and for a number of years the committee did not meet regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report shows that some of those bad habits have been reasserting themselves. It shows that a number of Departments have been issuing statutory instruments which are not in compliance with the terms of reference drawn up by the committee.  I am sure that, having regard to the work of the committee for the past two or three years, the Departments once again will be watching very carefully to ensure that their statutory instruments <Col N="1720" /> are in compliance with the Acts under which they are made.  I am very glad the committee have been meeting again and going through these statutory instruments. Their report is a very valuable one, and all the Members of the House appreciate the hard work that has gone into it.</P>

I would also like to reply to the two queries raised by Senator Murphy.  We noted that the Department of Social Welfare seemed to have a defective system for presenting the instruments and we pointed this out in correspondence.  We hope that defect will now be remedied. The committee were not happy with the correspondence with the Circuit Court Rules Committee and we intend to continue that correspondence and, hopefully, persuade them to view the use of blanket phrases of citation in the same way as we do.</P>
