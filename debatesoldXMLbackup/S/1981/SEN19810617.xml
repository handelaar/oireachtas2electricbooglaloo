      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not looked at the Principal Act where, I have no doubt, I would find the answer to this question.  Are illegitimate children included in the children referred to in this Bill?.  Perhaps the Minister would prefer to answer that question before I put my second question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless they are adopted they are not within the sections which deal with intimidation of children as against wives.  That is in the Principal Act, I think, but I am subject to correction. This point could be dealt with at a later stage in the Bill under another section if the Minister chose to do it that way.</P>
      <P>The section says: &ldquo;...provided that he is under the age of eighteen years...&rdquo; Does that mean he has not attained the age of 18 years?  Is this a different concept? It is a different language.  Assuming the age of majority is 21 years, you attain your majority, I think, on the beginning of the last day of your 20th year.  I do not know which is intended here.  Should the boy or girl have celebrated his or her 18th birthday or is it the day before?  Which is the intention in the Bill?  I am not here to make points to embarrass the Minister. It is perfectly within the Minister's competence to deal with this on another section when there will be other points to be made if he prefers to deal with it that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the question, the provision in the 1976 Act allows for the grant of a barring order, on the application of one spouse to a marriage, ordering the other spouse to leave the family home in the interests of the safety or welfare of the applicant spouse and children.  Under the present Bill, this will continue to be the basis on which barring orders and protection orders will be granted.  It does not purport to give protection where there is only a single parent, widow or widower, or to children living with cohabiting couples or where the children of a married couple are being ill-treated by the parents and there is no violence between the parents themselves.  The Bill deals with the situation where both spouse and children are put at risk by domestic violence.  In many cases only the exclusion of the offending spouse will ensure their safety or welfare.</P>
      <P>The reason the Bill is limited in this way is that the barring order provision is specially designed to deal with the situation arising out of the marital relationship between spouses.  Marriage gives rise to the right of consortium which involves the mutual duty on the part of both spouses to live together as husband and wife.  This duty can be abrogated by court order only, unless both parties agree, that is, in a separation agreement, to live apart.  A barring order is a means whereby a court can order one spouse to leave the family home, notwithstanding the duty to cohabit, where it considers that this is necessary because of the threat that spouse represents to the safety or welfare of the other spouse or child.  For this reason, its extension to children would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The protection of children as such is given by criminal law.  The Children Act, 1908, makes special provision to deal with cases of cruelty to children.  In addition, there are the provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, for assault.  The Children Act, 1908, Part II, deals with special offences against children and young persons.  &ldquo;Child&rdquo; means any person under 15 years of age under section 31 of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" /> On the second part of the question, any child or young person who has attained 18 years of age is deemed to be excluded for the purposes of the Bill.  The maximum age of 18 years, apart from the exception for children over that age who are suffering from physical or mental disability, has been chosen in anticipation of general provision being made in the near future for lowering the age of majority to 18 as recommended by the Law Reform Commission in their working paper in 1977 and expected to be confirmed in their final report on this subject, due shortly.  The 1976 Act covered children up to 16 years, the school leaving age and the age of cesser of parental maintenance under the social welfare code, plus those in full-time education up to 21 years and those over 21 years suffering from disability.  It will be noted that this Bill raises the age in some cases as compared with the 1976 Act, that is, from 16 to 18 years for children not in full-time education, and reduces it for others, that is, from 21 to 18 years for children in full-time education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain if the Minister is entirely correct in what he has just said.  While it is true that this code deals only with a marriage relationship, if I understand what this Bill is saying, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to section 2 (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>A barring order may, if the Court finds fit, prohibit the respondent spouse from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear, the applicant spouse or any child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the whole matter of our treatment of the cohabiting couple with children and the single parent situation may not be appropriate to be dealt with in a Bill of this kind, although it urgently needs our attention.  I merely say with regard to this code, that it seems to be wrong not to give the relief which is provided in the code for a barring order, where the person who is being molested or put in fear &mdash; a matter on <Col N="2167" /> which the court is informed by a spouse &mdash; is an illegitimate child of either the applicant or the respondent.  This whole code must be transformed but, to deal with this Bill as it is, where the illegitimate child is living with a married couple, which is as far as this Bill proposes to go, if that illegitimate child is put in fear and the court is satisfied it is put in fear by the actions of the respondent and the court wants to make a barring order, under this Bill, if it is enacted, the court cannot make a barring order if the only complaints is that an illegitimate child is being put in fear.</P>
    <P>If a husband marries a woman who has an illegitimate child and, for one reason or another, does not adopt it, and the mother of the child satisfied the court that a barring order is needed because of the way her husband is treating her child, who is illegitimate and not a child within the terms of this Bill, the court cannot give the relief of the barring order in that case.  The Bill ought to, and I cannot conceive of an objection if we take the broad step that was taken in 1976 &mdash; which was a major innovation, not in Irish law but generally in law and perhaps deriving from the special situation with regard to marriage in this land &mdash; we should certainly go on to give the protection of that code to the mother of an illegitimate child who may be living in that home which is being subjected to violence and molesting by the husband. It may be the reverse situation, but the more likely one is that the mother will have had some affair as a result of which there is an illegitimate child and maybe the circumstances under our law do not permit legitimation because at the time of conception the mother could not have made a lawful marriage because she was already married.  It was a product of an adulterous union or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>It should be permissible for a court to make a barring order in such a case.  I do not think there is anything very radical in that.  I would argue for a different, more extensive code in regard to all these situations. I am merely saying that there should be protection extended in this case <Col N="2168" /> on the application of the spouse, where the court is satisfied, in the language of section 2 (2), that there is a threat to use violence against, molest or put in fear the applicant spouse or any child, and the child is defined so as to exclude the illegitimate child, if I understand the definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to deal with spouses in the context of marriage as we understand it constitutionaly and as is provided for in section 2 (1) (a).  It is important to note that a barring order may direct the other spouse &mdash; in this Bill called the &ldquo;respondent spouse&rdquo;&mdash; if residing at a place where the applicant spouse or the child resides, to leave that place.  The word &ldquo;reside&rdquo; is very important. In section 1 the interpretation states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;child&rdquo; means any child of either the applicant spouse or the respondent spouse or of both of them or adopted by either or both of them under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, or in relation to whom either or both of them is in or are <i>in loco parentis</i>, provided that he is under the age of eighteen years...</P>
      <P>In that situation an illegitimate child is covered or provided for in this Bill because it deals with spouses and if the parent of an illegitimate child happened to be a spouse for the purpose of the measure then that child is afforded the same protection.  In a situation where an illegitimate child existed and you had two people cohabiting the Bill does not provide or afford any protection in that regard.  In the illustration I have given the Bill will provide and afford protection for illegitimate children.</P>

        <i>In loco parentis</i>, very good.  I accept that.  I understood the <Col N="2169" /> Minister to say at the very beginning that the illegitimate child would not get protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>An illegitimate child in circumstances where you have cohabitation existing would not be protected because the Bill we are dealing with specifically refers to spouses.  Spouses can be understood only in the context of lawful marriage, not common law marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to try to amend this Bill to take in these situations.  I understand the difficulties the Minister may be facing.  I accept, therefore, that this Bill purports only to deal with a marriage situation where there is a spouse.  I accept that.  I would like to see it more clearly expressed than I find it to be in leaving an illegitimate child dependent upon the establishment of the fact of <i>in loco parentis.</i> The illegitimate child in question might be on a visit home to its mother, or something of that kind, and <i>in loco parentis</i> might not be involved.  Perhaps under some other law another spouse was <i>in loco parentis</i> to this child, and maybe this very visit is the cause of the fury and the violence and there may not be a factual situation which I understand is the basis of <i>in loco parentis.</i>  If the child is an illegitimate child of either of the parents and there is a marriage relationship justifying the applicant looking for a barring order against the respondent, the applicant should be entitled to get that barring order if the threat of molesting, violence or fear is directed at an illegitimate child, perhaps coming to their family home, maybe on a visit, maybe not <i>in loco parentis</i> relationship to either of the spouses. It is not as if I suggested that this should be amended to include any child under the age of 18 years.  I am not proposing such.  I am proposing that the protection should be available and should be within the power of the court clearly to give, without requiring proof of the situation of <i>in loco parentis</i>, if there is an illegitimate child being threatened and if his mother &mdash; we are talking about his mother in 99 per cent of the cases &mdash; looks to the courts for assistance and wants to bar her husband from the home <Col N="2170" /> because that home of theirs has a resident &mdash; maybe for a short time, maybe during holidays from school, maybe in all sorts of human circumstances.  Because that resident has not stamped legitimacy on him or her, the court cannot give the barring order under this section as drafted unless, as I understand the Minister intends, the court be enabled to do if it is an <i>in loco parentis</i> situation.  To make the matter absolutely clear, the child here should as in many taxing statutes, be included as being an illegitimate child who, in a marriage situation &mdash; which is all that one is dealing with at this time &mdash; is the object of the violence or molesting, or the subject of the threat.  If it deems fit to do so, having heard all the facts and being satisfied about the violence, and being satisfied that the child is there over a period of time which makes the barring order relevant, the court has the power to do so, Obviously, the court need not do so if the child is going away on a Tuesday or something of that kind, but the situation may be otherwise.  The child may be sick in bed, or there may be all sorts of circumstances which may make the child stay in the house for some length.  It does not compel the court to make such an order.  It merely entitles the court, in justice, to do so if it is satisfied in justice that it should do so. The whole code is intended &mdash; and has a very fruitful effect &mdash; to give the courts power, which they had not previously got, to intervene in these situations.  I have not put down an amendment on this &mdash; like the Minister, I have been doing other things &mdash; but this amendment might be made to the section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving that as an illustration of the need for a proper definition in this section of what &ldquo;child&rdquo; means, because it does not depend merely on the effect of section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am satisfied that the purpose of this Bill is to <Col N="2171" /> strengthen the 1976 Act.  I am also satisfied that it would go far beyond the 1976 Act in that connection.  If the child comes visiting to a particular home for a temporary stay, I hold that that spouse is temporarily <i>in loco parentis.</i>  I also believe that the existing criminal law 1908 Children's Act and, in a sense, the Offences against the Persons' Act, 1861, provide the additional and adequate protections for an illegitimate child in the context of that child being in a home where there did not exist two spouses.  This Act is proposing to strengthen the 1976 Act in relation to spouses and marriage as we understand it.</P>
      <P>If there are any further areas in connection with greater protection for children, it might be more appropriate that that type of legislation would be looked at in the light of the Task Force report and legislation that, I expect, will be introduced in the Dáil some time later. For that reason, this Bill is adequate and goes for enough to cover any likely risk to an illegitimate child.  If it so required, I am sure that future legislation in a separate Bill would care for any inadequacies and in that connection I will take note of the points the Seanator has made for further examination in the context of any future legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very much to be able to say that I am satisfied with what the Minister has just said, but I cannot.  <i>In loco parentis</i> is a serious matter of proof, much more serious than the existence of the illegitimate child in the house.  The fact of illegitimacy can be questioned.  The Minister cannot overestimate the degree of resentment socially about treatment of illegitimate children.  A decision has been made to exclude them in a Bill of this kind, which is an amending code.  There is no proposal by me to extend this legislation beyond the marriage situation.  I accept that as being the ambit of our debate, but in a marriage situation where we have an illegitimate child situation, I ask only that the court be given the power to make a barring order where the subject of the threat is an illegitimate child.</P>

      <P>With respect, the definition of child does not include &ldquo;illegitimate child&rdquo; and the only illegitimate child who could be protected, or be the ground for a judicial order of this kind, would be one who, for other reasons, could be established as being in <i>loco parentis</i> to either of the parents.  That may be far too narrow a definition of a marriage situation for the illegitimate child who may be involved.  I do not know whether the Minister would take note of the importance of this code.  We should not hark back to the Children's Act in this regard.  This barring procedure has almost had the effect &mdash; subject to correction which anyone may be able to administer to me &mdash; of stopping the procedures of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i>  The judicial separation, as they call it in Britain, the bed and board separation that we talk about, is almost over.  We are talking about the kind of intervention by courts which is most frequent.  I am not aware of any illegitimate child who has been disqualified, because of illegitimacy, from the benefits of this code.  I merely note that the Bill and the code do not give protection to an illegitimate child, or to the mother of an illegitimate child who may be in the family home.  I am not saying that the court should in all such cases make a family order, although they make a fair number every year.  This is therefore a very real, social situation and I ask that the statute, which depends upon a marriage situation, does not go beyond that, and that the child who may be the ground for a barring order may be illegitimate as well as legitimate.  I am not satisfied with what the Minister has said with regard to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the appropriate section for me to deal with this point.  The Minister may remember that after the Second Reading I gave an indication of my intention to propose certain amendments.  One of the amendments related to a specific provision for the withdrawal of implied consent, which is there in the case of a marriage relationship and which effectively and historically has prevented prosecutions for rape within marriage.  The Minister may have noted that I did not circulate the amendment and I would like to say why.  My reason for not circulating it or indeed any amendment until we had a discussion on this section was that, on consideration of the law that seems to be applicable on this subject, I thought my proposed amendment was inchoate, that is, not realised in action.  What I proposed was that, if there was a conviction for an offence under the barring order code, thereafter there would be no implied consent and a prosecution for rape could lie against a husband who had committed an offence against the barring order.  My reason for not pursuing that amendment was that I came to the conclusion that, instead of extending the scope for prosecution for marital rape, it could have conceivably narrowed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House will bear with me I will say what I think is the law with regard to this matter and why I think an amendment of the kind I was proposing would have narrowed it.  I ask the House to believe that, even if I do not cite all the <Col N="2174" /> authorities as if this was a judicial chamber, I have read them.</P>
    <P>By her marriage a wife is taken to consent to sexual intercourse with her husband, while ordinary matrimonial relations subsist between them.  Because of that consent the crime of rape &mdash; a crime involving intercourse without consent &mdash; cannot occur during the subsistence of that relationship.  The relationship to which I refer is not the status of husband and wife as such; it is the ordinary matrimonial relationship which subsists between them.  As is known to everybody, that consent does not permit forced intercourse which would give rise to a prosecution for violence, cruelty or something of that kind.  The consent implied by marriage, it would appear, can be revoked, and some events clearly do amount to revocation.  For example, it has been held in Britain, where they were considering an order in language similar to the language used in this country, that in judicial separations the petitioner be divorced and separated from bed, board and mutual cohabitation with the respondent.  That is the language of the order I am looking at which was made in this country in 1976.  Similar language led to a decision in Britain that where such an order is made there is a revocation of the consent and that, while the status of husband and wife may subsist in the view of our law, the ordinary matrimonial relationship between the parties has ended and the implied consent is revoked.</P>
    <P>In observations, not direct findings, in two British cases it appears that there will be a revocation of that consent if there is a separation agreement, provided the separation agreement contains a suitable clause amounting to revocation of the consent; and prosecution for rape, it would appear under our law, can lie even if there is a marriage subsisting at the moment.  The test is therefore one of fact &mdash; whether there is implied consent that the marriage relationship has or has not been revoked.</P>
    <P>My view on consideration of the matter, though it has not been decided on, is that if a barring order is made it will amount to a revocation of the consent <Col N="2175" /> and that prosecution for the crime of rape will lie.  I do not understand any authority to exist for that but it is the logical development of the present judicial findings. I fear that to express it in statutory language by way of statutory amendment might narrow the breadth of the development which might otherwise be expected judicially to arise.  Therefore, an amendment of the kind I had in mind to extend protection to a wife and to extend against a husband the liability for prosecution for rape would be effected in a direction I did not wish.</P>
    <P>The question of marital status is less important than the fact of the consent.  It is clearly ended where there is a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i>  It would seem to be ended where there is a separation agreement with appropriate clause.  It is, therefore, a question of whether the consent, which is implied from the status, is in fact revoked.  What the Legislature has been doing is trying to remedy real matrimonial difficulties while feeling unable to amend the law as far as it concerns status. It is appropriate on this section that I should express myself on some problems which could be detached from the question of status but have been left attached and therefore unresolved.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention something for the Minister's further consideration between now and Report Stage.  Take the Succession Act code.  The right of a spouse to succeed under the Succession Act can only be judged to be avoided after the death of one of the spouses where a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> has been given during life or there has been an express waiver.  It would seem to me, because of the effectiveness of this code and the recession of the operation of the matrimonial code in our High Court, the ordinary separation code, because we are not getting divorces <i>a mensa et thoro</i> which would prevent the succession under the Succession Act, that we ought to attach to the consequences of a barring order at the discretion of the court the right of succession which an erring or violent spouse has at the moment.  It seems extraordinary that someone should be barred from the family home <Col N="2176" /> and be entitled in the administration of the estate to claim the family home under the Succession Act.  That is the present position.  It is wrong and should be corrected. All that is required is to allow the court, as it knowingly does when it grants a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> and as the Succession Act provides, to make an order under this code barring a spouse for Succession Act purposes.  The discretion to make that order should follow logically from the existence of the barring order procedure in the context of the relative disappearance of the divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> code where the Succession Act right disappeared.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about cases where there is such rational arrangement between the parties that there is a mutual waiver of rights which, of course, is what is sensibly looked for in these situations. I am contemplating the case where a waiver cannot be got, where the relationship has led the court to say this person's conduct is such that he should be barred from that home.  The court should have the right to make another order going no further than under the divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> code in terms of Succession Act consequences.  The court should have the right to do so but not have it follow as a necessary consequence.  I merely ask that the court be given the authority to do it without the court being obliged to do it. That is for the Minister's consideration between now and next Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to subsections (4) and (5) of section 2 which are an extremely significant part of the Bill.  Subsection (4) extends the barring order to a possible 12 months after the date of its making.  Subsection (5) states that on or before the expiration of the barring order a further barring order may be made with effect from the expiration of the first-mentioned barring order. Twelve months in a marriage is a very long time and, more significantly, 12 months in the life of a child aged one, two or three years is an eternity.  We should pause when talking about extending this Act to 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in Bills of this nature because Bills which deal <Col N="2177" /> with areas of marital breakdown are by their nature very delicate.  We are taking this very big step of making it possible for a violent spouse to be excluded for a considerable length of time, to be kept out of the marriage home and there are sanctions behind that which are tougher than they used to be.  We are also making provision that the order can be extended so we might be talking about longer than 12 months.  The extension to 12 months was the result of representations of a great many people who felt that the previous period was not sufficient and it obviously was not sufficient.  I pause on this section because the Bill is entitled the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill, and, therefore, we must think of this section in the context of the family.  I have had representations from groups, including the AIM group, who are very seriously worried that we should take this step of extending a barring order to 12 months or longer without any other indications in this Bill or anywhere else that that extension to 12 months will be accompanied by some new procedures to try to get that marriage together again.</P>
    <P>If we use this sledgehammer of the law forceably to keep somebody away there is a grave danger that the marriage will be finished after 12 months or longer. Whatever about a relationship with a spouse after a year, certainly a relationship with any small child after a period like that is almost irretrievable.  We have always had the very strong view that one does not separate parents and children at that tender age.  We are now passing a Bill which will separate a parent from children for a very long time.  We must not do this without bending our minds to how we can try to put together again a marriage which is in severe danger of foundering completely.  We are all aware that we have not a very satisfactory means of dealing with marriages which are foundering completely.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from the AIM group which strongly recommends the appointment of a family liaison officer, a member of the Garda Síochána, who would be available to liase with the families and advise other members of the Garda when <Col N="2178" /> problems arise with regard to breaches of barring orders.  They make this suggestion constructively, for rehabilitative purposes, because they feel that simply to enforce a barring order and leave it at that is a sweeping and inadequate method of dealing with family violence, which occasions family breakdowns.  Will the Minister give an indication of what thinking is going on in his Department about the implications of such a large separation as a result of the new extension of the barring order?</P>

      <P>Before we leave section 2, I would like to refer to what Senator FitzGerald said.  I do not know whether it is in order to comment upon an amendment which has not, in fact, been moved, but I agree with what the Senator said.  I am glad that the Senator did not move his amendment because I agree with him that the effect would have been limiting. I have never felt that it was necessary to make statutory provision for so-called marital rape.  In rape, the onus of proof is on the woman to prove that the act was both unlawful and that it took place without her consent.  Whether she is married or whether she is unmarried the obligation of that proof is upon her.  The key words, therefore, in the definition section of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, are &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; and &ldquo;consent&rdquo;.  We must not take &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; to mean outside of matrimony and not otherwise.  Senator FitzGerald gave us a list of situations in which intercourse between married people can be taken to be unlawful.  It seems to follow logically, therefore, that where a barring order has been granted, a barring order which is in effect a request to the court from one spouse that cohabitation may cease, the spouse who applies for the barring order also withdraws consent to sexual intercourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely approve of this section.  I sympathise with Senator Hussey's concern about the retrieval of a marriage or about the rehabilitation of a marriage that has broken down.  That does not come within the province of law. That seems to be in the province of either religious instruction, social targets, moral uplift or some other area of philanthropic <Col N="2179" /> concern.  A barring order is something which is granted by a court when one spouse can prove to that court's satisfaction that the other spouse is a danger, a nuisance or a threat to the family home and the peace thereof, to herself, it is likely to be a woman, and to the children. It is a crude instrument, the kind of instrument which we would prefer was not necessary, but it is necessary.  It is granted by the courts only when the proof is fairly solid.  Therefore, I totally approve the extension of the barring order.  In a house where, for instance, there are children and the husband is violent he will have to be barred in the interests of the children.  If the mother and the children cannot rest secure for a period of 12 months at least knowing that they will not be violated, that the home will not be violated and that their persons will not be threatened, what hope for tranquility is there for such children?  It is very often the case that children and wives live in almost daily terror of violent husbands who take extraordinary actions, from breaking into the place, to following them around the streets, to picketing them openly, and pillorying them in all kinds of ways.  I totally agree with this section.  I like the sense that this barring order can be renewed yearly.</P>
      <P>The retrieval of a marriage is a different matter.  The last time we discussed this Bill I drew attention to Lord Devlin and the famous case where he was talking about the two African tribesmen who had an agrument about the land.  At the end of it the magistrate said to the convicted party; &ldquo;I can punish you, I can force you to make restitution but I cannot make you an upright man&rdquo;.  The law cannot make one an upright man.  All the law can do is provide the instruments which will protect one or punish one, or allow restitution to be made to one.  The retrieval of a marriage is not something that a Bill like this can concern itself with at all.  It needs other agencies, natural and supernatural, to achieve that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with the amendment that Senator FitzGerald did not move, other than to state <Col N="2180" /> that most of his contribution referred to matters dealt with in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act.  One aspect that may not have been dealt with on that occasion was the problem of a barring order and the likelihood of a spouse returning to the residence or the place where the other spouse resided, in the first instance being in breach of that barring order, very likely, and then, secondly, proceeding to have intercourse with his wife.  In that situation it would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Because he is an officer provided for by law with a separate function, I do not intend to make any comment on what his decision might be in that connection.  We have not any precedents in this or the other types of situation the Senator mentioned.  For that reason it is difficult for me to anticipate or presume what might be the outcome.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Senator Hussey has said&mdash;and I will take Senators Martin's and Cassidy's remarks in the same context &mdash; Senator Martin was perfectly correct in his understanding and interpretation of what this section is about.  I do not want to appear to Senator Hussey to be in any way ignoring or disregarding her concern but I must say to the Senator that in view of the vibes I had been receiving from her in the past she would seem to have done a somersault here today. Barring orders are being extended in this Bill because it was found that the 1976 legislation &mdash; brought in by a different Minister and a different Government &mdash; was good legislation but needed strengthening. For that reason, having monitored, examined, consulted and listened for many hours to quite a considerable number of groups of women, apart from AIM, apart from the Council for the Status of Women, the ICA or such bodies comprising a considerable membership, they all indicated total satisfaction with the new provisions for the extension of barring order periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Barring orders should only be considered as temporary measures, I realise that it is a very serious decision for a court to have to take.  It is a very serious decision for a court to have to take in relation to treatment of a child or young person, <Col N="2181" /> or removing him or her from the family for one reason or another.  This is a very sensitive area.  It is the court involving itself in an interference or intrusion into marriage.  The consequences must be taken into consideration.  What is in the best interests of the child, the parents and all that constitutes the family must be understood and an evaluation and assessment by the court must be carried out.  Nevertheless, where a barring order is made &mdash; the application is made not necessarily after the first threat, or the first use of violence; at least it has been conveyed to me as an application that usually comes after considerable periods, oftentimes too long &mdash; often it is made for the purposes of indicating a very serious warning to the other spouse while at the same time providing protection in the short term.  Hopefully it will assist in bringing about an understanding or reconciliation and allowing perhaps for other interests to endeavour to examine the root of the problem in the absence of one of the spouses.</P>
    <P>To consider then that the court is likely on all occasions to respond with the 12 months maximum period in the District Court would be unrealistic because the court will assess what is in the best interests of the family.  The number of occasions that the maximum would apply might be very few.  I can only speculate on that area and I do not like to do so in the House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Senator Hussey had good reason for not referring to section 11 because we were not dealing with that section.  I know the Senator was conscious of all the sections in the Bill.  But the fact that we are discussing this aspect makes it important that section 11 be referred to in the same context.  That section provides that either spouse may apply for the discharge of the barring order or a protection order to the court that made the order and thereupon the court shall discharge the order if it is satisfied that the safety or welfare of the spouse or child, in respect of whose protection the order was made, does not require that that order should continue in force.  That is a provision which is caring in so far as it allows for either spouse to make application to the <Col N="2182" /> court again to discharge the order if circumstances change.  Of course, circumstances would be presumed to have changed for the better only if such a discharge were to be granted or given.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the court, in giving that discharge, when it states that it must be satisfied that the safety or welfare of the spouse or child is not at further risk or is not at risk at that time, will not necessarily just accept that a change has occurred because one of the spouses says so.  Presumably, that spouse could be intimidated or threatened into making such an application.  There are very peculiar and different circumstances that might force that person into altering or changing her or his mind.  For that reason the court again is clearly interested in establishing that the purpose for which a barring order is made is to ensure that protection is provided to the spouse, or child, or children who are at risk.  Equally in discharging under section 11, the court is anxious also to be satisfied that that discharge is being made only on the basis that the court is satisfied again that there is no longer any reason to provide that type of protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  For some reason that escapes me the Minister seems to be a little sensitive when it comes to discussions with me in these areas.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I wholeheartedly welcomed and congratulated the Minister on the Bill.  I have done no kind of somersault at all.  I repeated a few minutes ago that I saw the need for extending the barring orders to 12 months as a result of the experience of people dealing with these unfortunate cases.  I intervened simply because we have a certain amount of family law going through these Houses and because we must implement these important provisions and consider their implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a very simple question on this section as a result of representations made to me.  For example, with the precedent set by the appointment of a youth officer in the Garda, I asked whether the Minister had any knowledge of any new appointments to be made in the <Col N="2183" /> Garda to help them to deal with the whole area of family violence and barring orders.  That was a perfectly simple question. There is no need for Senator Martin or anybody else to point out to me that what I am talking about is not practical. We are asking for something to be brought into this legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 2, subsections (4) and (5), has the Minister any plan or have his Department any plan concerning a new section of the Garda to deal with family violence?  We are bringing in new legal provisions regarding family violence which have considerable implications.  It might be worthwhile mentioning, as I said on Second Stage, that District Justice Delap, for example, said it was necessary for him to go as far as, when the barring order was given against a violent spouse, usually a man, requiring the man to turn up at the Garda station on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights a quarter of an hour before closing time to make sure that, if the man was in a state where he might be irresponsible enough to try to beat down the door, the Garda would know about it.  My questions on this section relate purely and simply to the implications of a very long barring order for a marriage with children.  Has the Minister any wider information to give us perhaps on back-up for the Garda in dealing with family violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In case I seem to be overreacting to Senator Hussey, it may be because of the time of the year.  With regard to the point raised by the Senator in connection with the provision of the family liaison officer, I accept that it is a very valid and useful point.  The Garda community relation's section at the moment keep in close contact.  I am informed by various women's organisations and groups involved in this area that this is very useful.  I agree that this is much different from what the Senator is envisaging, because she was talking about something that would keep them in close contact with the family or the individual within the family or both parties, both spouses, and observe in the case of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2184" /> I feel that because of the very delicate, complex and sensitive area we are dealing with such a provision would have to be very thoroughly and carefully considered. One must consider that the involvement of the Garda in this area even at present can have serious complications unless the situation is handled very carefully and delicately.  However, I am prepared to request that the point made by the Senator will be examined.  I am not so sure of what the Senator requires in relation to requiring the spouse, presumably the male spouse, to turn up at the local Garda station 15 minutes before the public houses close.  However, is Senator Hussey proposing to interfere with the freedom of the individual and to prevent a person from moving freely and doing lawful things when he has not been convicted of any criminal offence?  The court has not imposed any restrictions on his liberty except in so far as a barring order has been made which prevents him from returning to his residence or the residence of the other spouse, child or children. I do not think that such a proposal can be considered in realistic terms.  If I were to be totally illogical, I might say that the Senator might wish to see it extended to freedom of speech so far as the person barred is concerned.</P>

      <P>I must make this point clear in case I get a reputation for being something that I am not, I would like to make it quite clear that what I was referring to was a speech made by Justice Séan Delap on 22 February in Liberty Hall on the subject of domestic violence where he said that he made a rule &ldquo;that drunken or violent husbands must sign on in the Garda station on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights a quarter of an hour before closing time because so much family violence occurred as a result of drink.&rdquo; He and several other people apparently found that this very simple mechanism was in fact preventing a lot of suffering.  He thought it was a very good idea.  I am not suggesting that we put anything like that into law.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from something which I wrote down at that meeting in Liberty Hall, so it is my own précis of what he said.  I certainly would not believe in interfering with the freedom of the individual and put that into law.  However, I must say that to talk about being afraid to interfere with people's freedom is a little bit naive of us, because after all what we are doing here all the time is interfering with people's freedom for the common good.  We are here to interfere with our own and everybody else's freedom in order that society will be properly regulated.  If we could find some way of interfering with people's freedom so as to help marriages in distress, I would be very glad of that interference.  Having made that point, I welcome very much the Minister's serious consideration of the necessity for looking into a new method of giving the Garda some extra structure for dealing with families affected by violence, in particular families affected by barring orders, given that the Garda are there on the ground in the neighbourhood and are aware, perhaps more than anybody else, of what is going on.  I welcome the Minister's opinion of what I said.  I am glad to see his consideration.</P>

I hope to deal with that on the amendment which I propose to the next section.

That has implications which can be dealt with on another section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, line 37, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; where it secondly occurs to insert &ldquo;at the time of the oral communication or within any reasonable time thereafter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I got the amendment sheet with the amendments on it I was very disappointed not to see anything with an asterisk on the sheet, which would have led me to believe that amateur efforts had been professionally polished and ears had been opened and maybe some point made had been taken and would be dealt with.</P>
      <P>In section 3 there is a provision that a protection order may be made and that it would expire with the making of a barring order, notwithstanding that the summons for a barring order had not been served.  If the protection order is breached, it gives rise to a criminal offence under section 6.  It also gives rise, under section 7, to a power in the member of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant.  There is provision for copies of protection orders to be given to the Garda through the courts and to be sent to the applicant spouse or the respondent spouse, to the person who would be affected.  It is also provided that even if there is non-compliance with the requirement to give copies of the orders to the spouse or the Garda, the order is still valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 (2) provides that oral communication to the husband by the wife of the fact that a protection order has been made, together with a copy of the order, shall be taken to be sufficient notification of the making of the order.  You have the husband on valium or some other drug. He may be still be on the blinder which gave rise to all the trouble, he may be partially deaf and he may be so angry that he cannot hear what his wife is saying to him and he wakes up a couple of days later, or whatever period of time it may be, and finds a wretched piece of legal paper lying around the place addressed to him.  This, if it is to work at all, will have to be some kind of printed document <Col N="2187" /> on which some character in the court will put a stamp and he will be expected to remember what his wife, who seemed to be as unreasonable as ever, had said to him on the day she was telling him about the order she had got from the court that day or the day before.  He, however, will be regarded under this section as having been duly notified of the fact that he is the subject of an order under which, if he breaks it, or if a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that he has broken it, he can be arrested without warrant and he can be guilty of an offence under section 6.</P>
    <P>In regard to this I would ask that a legal order and the oral communication should either come together or within a reasonable time thereafter.  There are no time periods set out in the amendment. All we can do here is to ask the authorities to make rules of court appropriate for the expeditious hearing of an application. That is as far as the legislature can go in regard in that matter.  I have not studied the institution whereby these rules are made.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be highly undesirable that the law should be weighted so much against such a respondent.  It brings to mind the famous words of Judge Adams: &ldquo;You leave this court with no other stain on your character than that you have been found not guilty by a Limerick jury.&rdquo;  There is no other stain on this man's character than that he was arrested.  I do not think that consequence should follow: there should be more formality involved in it.  I know the protection order is that he must not use violence or molest.  That order is made on the basis of what the woman had said about him to the judge.  It may be that when all is over he could prove that she was every bit as bad as himself.  Courts take a view on the facts.  It is different from interim injunction proceedings.  I note the Minister has abstained from providing for an interlocutory injunction.  I would recommend the amendment or something like it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator <Col N="2188" /> FitzGerald on this point.  It seems to me that the spirit of this Bill meets what was seen as a flagrant defect in our legal and police procedures.  The purpose of this Bill is to protect the defenceless.  In most cases it is to protect the woman and the children.  It is a matter of public scandal that even after the passing of the previous Bill violent spouses were able to play ducks and drakes with the police and with the law.  The delays which operated between the granting of a barring order and its execution, the extraordinary ambiguities that existed and which allowed violent husbands to ignore or to circumnavigate the intentions of the court and the law, are quite notorious.  I happen to know such cases personally but any of the women's movements will give you an archive on such cases of horrendous proportions.  We are talking about people who live in fear and trembling of a violent person.</P>
      <P>In the case that Senator FitzGerald brought to our attention, in the first place a barring or a protection order has already been issued.  That is the first point.  Therefore, a court has already judged such a person and I do not think it does that without sufficient cause.  I am not a lawyer, but suppose a man is &ldquo;on the blind&rdquo; as he calls it &mdash; it is not a very suitable phrase I think you would agree; &ldquo;on the jar&rdquo; would be the phrase, or &ldquo;on a blind&rdquo;&mdash; but suppose he is blind drunk and suppose he is deaf, the terms of the Bill are quite clear; it says &ldquo;an oral communication together with production of a copy of the order.&rdquo;  So, the man would have to be both deaf and blind to be unable to receive the message involved here, an oral and written communication.</P>

Of course I have not objected to the proposed provision for the protection order.  There is no objection by me to it.  Indeed I welcome the proposed development of the protection order provision.  The person whom I wish to protect with my amendment is the person who may be unjustly treated by virtue of the procedures proposed with regard to the protection order.  I am not concerned with the particular form of my amendment.  I am concerned to know that a man is properly informed of a court order the breaching of which may lead to loss of reputation, possibly criminal conviction and possibly arrest without warrant. We, the Legislature, ought to be concerned to see that in all situations persons are protected from such consequences until they are proved guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Martin said, if I understand what he said, that a barring order in this case will have been already made.  If I understand the section, a barring order need not necessarily have been made; an application for a barring order will have been made &mdash; a different matter.  We are talking, therefore, about a case where, on the basis of the facts offered by one side, the court may properly and wisely make a protection order.  I am merely suggesting that we ought to be very careful to see, as the Minister is proposing in section 4 to do &mdash; but I think defectively &mdash; that the fact of the protection order is duly and properly notified and in such a way to the person against whom the complaint is being made that he knows he is now subject to the attention of a court with regard to what he does.  That is all I am concerned about.  I cannot divide, with a splendid sweep of the imagination, <Col N="2190" /> the race of mankind into those who deserve protection and those who do not deserve protection.  Our laws are concerned to protect everyone from one offence or another or should be so.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A barring order or a protection order&rdquo;&mdash; I know perfectly well what &ldquo;or&rdquo; means; that is not the point &mdash;&ldquo;shall take effect on notification of its making,&rdquo;&mdash; which I take to mean, of its having been made &mdash;&ldquo;being given to the respondent spouse&rdquo;.

      <P>I am not going to let the Senator get away with this.  The Senator said that a barring order will have been made.  He said that earlier, where a protection order has been made.  That is not correct.  I am talking about the notification of a protection order which may be made under section 3 without a summons having been served on the person and without a barring order having been first made.  The Senator cannot have that position as he originally stated it.  It is incorrect and he should correct himself or accept correction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 4 is to require that instead of ordinary service of the barring order or protection order all that is needed is that a copy be produced to the respondent spouse at the time of the oral communication of the fact that the order was made, or otherwise in such circumstances that the oral communication and the production of the copy can reasonably be linked in the respondent spouse's mind so as to effect a single transaction.  I am advised, and I am satisfied that the words &ldquo;together with&rdquo; effectively achieve that intention. In any event, if the copy of the order is not produced at the oral communication of the fact that it has been made, the later production of the copy can be accompanied by a fresh communication of the fact that it was made.  When the wife or somebody on her behalf says to the husband &ldquo;Here is the copy of the barring order&rdquo;, this will amount to telling him again that the order was made.  There will be some measure of flexibility because the courts will, of course, give a reasonable interpretation to the section, bearing in mind the interest of the applicant spouse &mdash; the weaker party &mdash; on the one hand and, on the other, the interest of the offending spouse, who is entitled to have proper notice of the order before he can be adversely affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand the Senator's amendment, it seems to me, is open to the objection that it would allow too long a period to elapse between the oral communication and the production of the order.  In other words it does not adequately convey the idea that production of the document should be linked with the communication.  From the respondent spouse's point of view it would, in my <Col N="2192" /> view, introduce an uncertainty which would be most undesirable having regard to that spouse's possible criminal liability under section 6.  From the applicant spouse's point of view it would also be undesirable in that it would tend to invite disputes as to whether any delay in producing the copy was or was not reasonable.</P>
    <P>From a practical point of view I do not see the point as being of any great importance since, as I have already mentioned, the problem can in any event be got over by simply using such words as &ldquo;Here is the barring order&rdquo; when producing the copy.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the barring order applications must be made before a protection order is granted, and this is granted, of course, for the purposes of providing an interim protection.  Section 3 &mdash; I have to refer to it in the context of the amendment to section 7 &mdash; states&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) If between the making of the application for a barring order and its determination, the Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of the applicant spouse or of any child so requires, the Court can make an order....</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the court must be of the opinion and I am sure the court must be satisfied about this opinion.  I hold the view that the urgency with which this type of protection might be required would be such that if one had a seriously violent husband or spouse it would be a very serious risk once he discovered his wife had made an application for a barring order.  It might provoke a greater violence towards her and put at more serious risk herself and her children than she was likely to encounter before the application for a barring order was made.  This is something that has often occurred in the past.  I know that from personal experiences. Heretofore, we had no legal mechanism whereby we would rush in and say, &ldquo;Right, you cannot do this, that or the other, or if you do you commit offences&rdquo;. Consequently, we have created new offences. It is an enlightened method of doing the thing.  I know that Senator FitzGerald <Col N="2193" /> is not criticising the section that provides the protection order.  His concern, it appears to me, is about the fact that somebody might be arrested without having got adequate notice.  The fact that the court must be satisfied and its opinion must be such before the protection order is granted is important.  The protection order is only obtainable after the barring order application has been made, which surely the spouse would be aware of.  All reasonable and normal attempts must be made to ensure that communication is given to him even if he happens to arrive at his home that night which he has a right to do in the absence of a barring order having been made which would be decided upon at a later date.  He can still go back to his place of residence but he is prevented from using violence or threats.  That is different from the barring order which prevents him going back to his place of residence.</P>
    <P>In many other situations today people convicted in court might not necessarily be aware of the conviction because they were not in attendance or, if they were, there were not in a position to comprehend, or for other reasons which the Senator has referred to but that does not necessarily preclude a member of the Garda Síochána from having the power of arrest under many other statutes.  Simply because the person about whom the garda has suspicions and he proceeds to arrest him, does not necessarily mean that that arrest, based on reasonable suspicion, applicable in the case of the Garda, is not justifiable because the person did not know he had been convicted. Here the power of arrest is being provided. The Garda, I am quite satisfied, would not proceed to arrest the individual against whom the protection order was made unless at the time of arrest he indicated what section of a statute he was making the arrest under.  Should this Bill become law he is making the arrest under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, as it will be.</P>
    <P>At that point the person is informed of the fact that a protection order has been obtained.  I cannot see the question of being arrested without knowledge being <Col N="2194" /> communicated either orally or in writing, or both, arising.  I cannot see a situation in which that can arise.  Even if it were to arise in a particular situation I doubt if any member of the Garda would proceed to make an arrest.  I cannot expect that they would, or should, without notifying the persons involved the basis under which the arrests were being made.  We cannot overlook the great risk a wife and children may be in.  Section 4 provides that a barring order or protection order shall take effect on notification of its making being given to the respondent spouse. It also provides that communication to the respondent spouse by or on behalf of the applicant spouse of the fact that a barring order or a protection order has been made, together with a production of a copy of the order, shall, without prejudice to the sufficiency of any other form of notification, be taken to be sufficient notification.  Clearly in that it is provided that where it is possible to achieve the greatest or maximum type of notification that is fine but where it is not the seriousness of what might occur if that person was to get from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;B&rdquo; and confront his wife or children, then the risk that might be inherent in that person making contact might be so great as to justify, as I feel, his arrest.</P>

      <P>To help me understand the matter as a non-lawyer, I should like to ask the Minister how soon in practice after the making of a protection order is a copy of it available to the applicant spouse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 is no breach.  Non-compliance with the notification under section 5 does not affect the validity of the order.  Therefore, under the Bill as proposed, if I understand it, notification is deemed to be given to the person who had not been heard by the court on the matter even though he was not in court; he had not the summons served on him and all he had was some mumble from his wife.  The language of <Col N="2195" /> the section is &ldquo;Oral communication to the respondent spouse by or on behalf of the applicant spouse of the fact that a barring order or a protection order has been made, together with production of a copy of the order...&rdquo;  At this stage, before he has been heard, he is being exposed to his actions being so construed as being a breach of the order even though all he has heard about it is that his wife has said to him or somebody on behalf of his wife has said to him that this order is being served on him, and he is subject to arrest.  Let us all have faith in everyone but people make mistakes and the Minister, judging from the language of his Second Stage speech, has his own hesitancies about this because he told us that he did not provide for the making of an <i>ex parte</i> order.  That is correct and this is in the important matter of a case where there has been no barring order yet made.  No court has heard him on the subject.  He has not been served nor has he come to court.  A protection order has been asked for, after an application for a barring order has been made. But that is all that has happened at this stage from his point of view.  There is a dispensation from a necessity to see that he is properly served by somebody.  I would be quite satisfied if it was by anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Senator FitzGerald's point.  After all, the protection order is concerned about somebody being judged in his absence.  Let us be clear about that.  This is a most necessary thing.  This is a law that we have been crying out for because of the number of people who avoid summonses and because of the various ploys and strategies to which the spouses have gone, not turning up in court, drawing things out, refusing summonses.  This legislation is to help people.  After all, what does a protection order say?  It says that the respondent shall not use or threaten to use violence against or put in fear the applicant, spouse or child.  That is not too much to demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law already demands that one does not use or threaten to use violence against <Col N="2196" /> or put in fear the applicant spouse or child.  This is only giving a certain amount of emphasis to something that is already demanded by ordinary common decency and by the law of the land as it stands.  A protection order does not stop a man who does not turn up in court from going into the family home.  It merely demands that he behave like a civilised human being. It just gives a little extra force to that until the case can be heard.  That can be a crucial time because very often the threat of a barring order before the summons is served can come at a very strategic moment.  This is something that actually provides a temporary screen for somebody threatened with violence.  I see Senator FitzGerald's point but I do not think there is any call seriously to punish or criminalise somebody who makes a genuine mistake.  The danger of that is very small.  <i>De minimis non curat lex</i> is an old saying and in this particular case it is probably appropriate.</P>

      <P>This is unusual legislation and I am sure the Minister is aware of and welcomes the fact that we are taking it so carefully through this House because in many respects it is an extraordinary Bill which needs great consideration. My question is on subsection (3) of section 4.  I simply do not understand what it means.  It says that if the respondent spouse is present at the sitting of the court at which the barring order or protection order is made that spouse shall be taken for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section to have been notified of its making.  Why is it necessary to put that in at all?  What circumstances does the Minister envisage of the person being <Col N="2197" /> present in the court and not knowing that this order has been made?  I would be very glad to have that explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of other references to methods of communication, oral communication, written communication, communication by the wife as one individual, by a member of the Garda Síochána.  It would be reasonable to expect that somebody who is actually sitting in the court where this order has been made ensuring that that person, the respondent spouse, would not proceed to break the law and could be deemed to have been notified once he had heard the court's decision on the matter.  It is another form of communication that is deemed to be adequate notification for the purposes of him knowing subsequently the position and certainly in a situation where he is liable to arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it because this discharges anybody from having to actually hand him anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That still applies. But that does not preclude a person from being arrested.  It is required that apart from any oral communication he would also be communicated with by service of a notice of the order or a copy of the order.  The fact that he did not receive a copy of the order does not prevent him from arrest.  Senator FitzGerald was concerned about the fact that somebody might be liable to arrest without being properly notified.  I genuinely accept his concern for the individual in this situation. Section 4(1) takes effect immediately on the respondent spouse being notified.  We have spoken about oral communication, and notice or a copy of the order being given in writing.  Here we are speaking about the person being in court and hearing the decision of the court in person.  That is deemed to be another type of notification that is considered adequate but it does not preclude him from being notified by other people in accordance with what is prescribed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2198" />
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not preclude him from being notified but he is notified and he does not have to be notified in any other way and he is liable if he breaks the barring order.  The barring order, I direct the Minister's attention to section 2, does not necessarily involve him engaging in violence.  But subsection (1) provides for an order called the barring order which directs the respondent spouse if residing at a place where the applicant spouse is residing to leave that place and where the respondent spouse is not residing in that place, prohibits that spouse from entering that place until further order.</P>
      <P>He may be the mildest of men &mdash; cracked, perhaps &mdash; but there is no necessity for him to exercise violence.  But if he is sitting in court he will be deemed to understand the strange mysteries of the law as we understand each other, and you know how well that is, and suffer all the consequences of that kind of understanding, be in breach of a barring order which is telling him he is not to go home this evening, what he thought was his home, and he will be committing a criminal offence and be liable to arrest if he does.  I do not think that simply to say there are other ways of telling him is sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But the prosecution is entitled to rely on that mode of notification and on no other mode.  The court can find him duly notified if he is found to be sitting in court though he may not have a clue as to what it is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite as alarmed as Senator FitzGerald.  I realise that this is difficult and unusual legislation dealing with very difficult areas.  Given the fact that it is dealing with very difficult areas, we have unusual provisions in the Bill.  I did not want to start anything by asking that simple question on subsection (3) but I seem to have done something and I will have to continue it now because I am becoming more puzzled.  Perhaps the Minister could put my mind at rest here. <Col N="2199" /> This kind of provision in subsection (3) about a person's presence being taking as sufficient proof of his knowledge of the taking out of an order against him, is that usual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section he is deemed to have been notified of the making of the order, and not being legally qualified I do not think that it would be proper or appropriate for me to hazard guesses about what the provisions are in other legislation.  Senator FitzGerald might wish to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, while we are considering this subsection it would be very helpful to us if people like myself who are not lawyers could have some indication if provisions like subsection (3) are found in other legislation.  Subsection (1) starts off this part of the Bill and then we go on to talk about, as the Minister pointed out earlier on, different ways of assuming that the respondent spouse is aware of this order being taken against him.  I find it unusual that we have to have subsection (3) at all.  It seems to me that subsection (3) is saying: if he is there, nobody need go up to him and tell him that this has happened, and that there is an assumption that he has understood it. I have only been in a courtroom a few times in my life and I did not understand a word of what was going on.  I do not expect people that are in this sort of traumatic situation to understand it either.  They might very well understand even less than I would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Senator that there is no known statutory provision like this to the knowledge of my advisers. In connection with the point she raised, I think that for a respondent to claim that he did not hear what went on in court, would not be a justifiable defence if he was subsequently found to be in breach of the order.  Because he is in court, whether he is asleep or awake or in any other condition referred to by Senator FitzGerald earlier, he is held to have been notified of the decision of the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be totally out of turn in this.  Is there any danger therefore of any of section 4, particularly subsection (3) being found to be in breach of a person's constitutional rights?  This raises questions.  I am sure the Minister understands that I am very anxious indeed that we should have laws to protect people who are the victims of domestic violence, but I am just beginning now to be a bit worried, without knowing a great deal of the implications of this, that if section 4 and various subsections of it were found to be in contravention of people's constitutional rights, we could be making a bad situation worse for the victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>At this point, having raised that question I, of course, must assume that the Minister, when this Bill was being drafted, was well aware of the implications of it.  I am sure the Minister will be able to give me a reassuring answer and to say that everybody is satisfied that this will not be in breach of people's constitutional rights.  But it does seem to raise questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On subsection (1) on Second Stage of this Bill, which was adjourned in dramatic circumstances, I cannot recall very clearly that discussion, <Col N="2201" /> but if it was not mentioned it should have been, that domestic violence is not confined unfortunately to a small group of people and neither is it confined to the less well-off or to the better-off in society. It is a sad feature of human nature in every area of society.  It is more apparent among the less well-off who perhaps have fewer safety nets; for example, when a woman finds herself having to leave her home perhaps a better off woman has more safety nets and that is why we do not hear quite so much about it.  A person who contravenes a barring or protection order shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both.  Given the value of money today there are a great many people for whom £200 may seem not very much but there are many other people for whom £200 is a very considerable amount.  I am wondering about the maximum being £200. How was it arrived at and why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration was given to the question of increased penalties but it was felt that the existing penalties of up to £200 or imprisonment for six months, with the possibility of both being imposed in appropriate circumstances, was an adequate deterrent having regard to the fact that a breach of the barring order or protection order is a summary offence. Furthermore, in the case of a breach of the barring order there may not have been any violence involved.  If there is serious bodily harm or a more serious charge there may be trial on indictment. That would be the correct course if the facts warranted it.  What we are speaking about is a penalty of two forms, either separate or combined.  In appropriate circumstances they can be used where there is a breach of a barring order.  If the breach of a barring order was associated or linked with assault or grievous bodily harm occurring, the ordinary criminal law can be availed of to proceed and the penalty is there, in some instances up to life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  We are all against imprisonment as a family law penalty because imprisonment has all sorts <Col N="2202" /> of ramifications plus the problem of the financial loss to the family.  What is to be avoided at all costs is that a man &mdash; and we are mostly talking about men &mdash; would be put in prison and would lose his job and, therefore, the wife would find herself not only struggling with the terrible problem of domestic violence but also with very little money coming into the household.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some people whose money would not stop coming in if they had to pay more than £200.  That is the whole point of the discussion.  What I am objecting to is the upper limit of £200 which for some people could be a small amount.  I feel it is not high enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take the opportunity to agree with the Senator on the point made earlier that in the case of certain categories of people because of their social background or their financial resources or whatever there are more protections there for them, to use the Senator's words.  They can afford to get away from it all.  They have facilities other people, regrettably, have not got. For that reason, I presume that the major number of barring orders will not be sought by this section of people.  The great majority of barring orders will be sought by people who, for one reason or another, are deprived and underprivileged and for that reason the law must step in to afford them protection.  I feel that the £200 in that situation might be adequate.  As I said, it is a summary offence. The number of times that people will be actually imprisoned will be few or nil because I appreciate that it can create further difficulties.  Even though the maximum is set out I would hope it will not always be used.  Indeed, most people who are barred by the court from returning to their homes for any particular period will also recognise and realise that this is the end of the line for them, that if they proceed to break that barring order there are serious consequences, as the <Col N="2203" /> fine and penalty state in this section.  If they proceed beyond breaking the barring order and engage in acts of violence the consequences are even more serious &mdash; £200 or £100, depending on the individual. If a maintenance order was in operation at the time and a severe penalty was imposed it would certainly affect the ability to pay the fine and to make the necessary finances available as required under a maintenance order.  The imposition of fines and penalties generally is a matter for the court.  The court invariably takes into consideration a number of factors in order to arrive at what it considers is the penalty that should be imposed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 and section 5(1) of the Bill make special provision to ensure that a spouse against whom a barring order or protection order is made is aware of the order at the earliest possible date.  This special provision takes two forms: (1) oral communication to that spouse by or on behalf of the applicant spouse of the fact that a barring order or protection order has been made, together with production <Col N="2204" /> of a copy of the order will be taken to be sufficient notification under section 4(2); (2) the court will send to both spouses and to the local Garda station copies of the order under section 5.</P>
    <P>I may add that it is also proposed that instructions will be issued to the Garda to ensure that they will not make any arrest for breach of an order without first making sure that the offending spouse has been duly notified of the making of the order.  The amendment will be opposed as unnecessary on the basis of what I have said.</P>

      <P>I do not think the kind of provisions we are proposing to enact in this Bill ought to affect what happened before enactment. The deeds that now have the consequences they have should simply have the consequences that the people who committed them earn from them.  They are not deemed to understand, whatever their situation in life, the pieces of paper passing through the Oireachtas.  They are deemed in this strange provision of the law to know the law.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment.  As a preliminary point, I presume that the acts referred to in this amendment are constituting offences under section 6, although this is not clear. The purpose of the Senator's amendment is to ensure that the offences under section 6, and perhaps the increased penalties under section 8, should not apply in relation to events that occurred before the commencement date.  There is no need for such a provision and it is never included in legislation of this kind.  It is the general law that legislation creating an offence applies only to things done in the future.  In any event, section 6, which creates offences of contravening a barring order or a protection order, and related offences, clearly applies only to <Col N="2206" /> things done after the Bill comes into operation.  The same applies to section 8 as regards offences committed on bail.</P>
      <P>The Senator has referred to Article 15 (5) of the Constitution which provides that the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission. As I have already indicated there is nothing in the Bill that infringes that constitutional bar.  The offences provided for in the Bill are those set out in section 6. These may be committed by a respondent spouse who <i>(a)</i> contravenes a barring order, including contravention of a provision in the order prohibiting the respondent spouse from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the applicant spouse or any dependent child; <i>(b)</i> contravenes a protection order and <i>(c)</i> while a barring order is in force refuses to permit the applicant spouse or dependent child to enter and remain in the place to which the order relates or does any act for the purpose of preventing that spouse or child from doing so.  The offences at (b) and (c) can only arise as the Bill becomes law, as the protection order is only now being introduced and the offences at (c) in relation to barring orders are also new.</P>
      <P>As regards (a), since 1976 there have been the offences of breach of a barring order or while a barring order is in force, molesting or putting in fear the applicant spouse or dependent child &mdash; under section 22(3) of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Pursuant to section 17 (2) when the Bill comes into operation it will apply to barring orders made under the 1976 Act which are in force at that date, as if they were barring orders made under the new legislation.  Only acts done after the coming into operation of the Bill can constitute an offence under section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is different in relation to the grounds on which a barring order or a protection order can be made by a court.  Such an order is intended to protect the safety or welfare of an applicant spouse or a child in the future, but the reasons for granting it will necessarily relate to conduct in the past.  Accordingly, after the Bill comes into operation <Col N="2207" /> there will clearly be cases where barring orders and protection orders to regulate future conduct will be made on the basis of misconduct of the respondent spouse prior to that date.  It is unthinkable that a wife who has been the victim of serious violence from her husband for some time before the coming into operation of the Bill should be required to endure further violence after the commencement date to qualify for the order under the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, contravention of a barring order made under the 1976 Act and committed prior to the commencement date of the Bill would fall to be prosecuted under the 1976 Act and only contraventions of barring orders, either those made under the 1976 Act and rebaptised under section 17(2) of the Bill, or those made under the newly enacted Bill, and protection orders committed after the commencement date would be prosecuted under the new legislation.</P>

What we are talking about here were crimes at the time.  The Constitution, as distinct from the law, would not be breached by extending the punishment for something that was a crime already. The Constitution says that one cannot treat something as a crime in the past if it was not a crime.  We are talking about something that was already a crime.  I am asking a question about the <Col N="2208" /> punishment for the crime.  Does the Bill propose to extend punishment for what was already a crime?  If it does that &mdash; I do not think it ought to do that &mdash; I would like the Minister to simplify it.  I will be able to read what the Minister says and take it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to and indeed I welcome the section, which is one of the main sections of the Bill and a piece of antiquity that we may well properly get deleted from our legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems an extraordinary thing after all these years that a mere two-and-a-half lines could undo so much damage and that these same two-and-a-half lines could change something which we were told for so long by so many people could not be done.  It was said it was too delicate, too difficult, too dangerous, that marriage would be threatened and that our whole legal system would be thrown into upheaval if we changed this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2211" /> This Bill says in one short section that after the passing of this Act no action shall lie for criminal conversation, for inducing a spouse to leave or remain apart from the other spouse or for harbouring a spouse.  We were told there would be no problem about a simple deletion of this provision from our legal code but then objections were raised and the Law Reform Commission proceeded to examine it.  They recommended something to which many people objected. There were misunderstandings about the intentions of the Government.</P>
    <P>I cannot let section 1 pass without saying that it has implications for so many of our other legal provisions.  It took us so long to pass the simple two-and-a-half lines because men did not understand the feeling caused in women by that legal provision.  They did not understand how it felt to know that you could have a price put on you.  As more and more women became aware that this actually existed in our legal code, they became outraged by it.  The outrage reached a height &mdash; certainly in my case &mdash; when, a few years ago, a particular case was emblazoned all over the papers, the upshot being that the price put on that woman was £1,000 less than a racehorse which was sold the same week.  Men did not seem to realise what that kind of code meant to women. There is enormous regret that this change took so long.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the passing of this Bill has been much easier than was expected, causing no trauma.  The fear of an ensuing increase in adultery seems to have been laid at rest.  I have always felt that if a marriage needed a crude instrument like the criminal conversation provision, that marriage had very severe problems in every area.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House any longer but feel that it is extremely important, for the sake of women, to welcome section 1 and to hope that we will now set about attacking other insulting or anachronistic provisions in our legal system and eventually set up a decent legal code.</P>

      <Col N="2212" /> SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Alexis Fitzgerald Mr. Alexis Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The breach of promise action is to go, by virtue of this section.  I said on Second Reading that I thought that was right and am still of that mind.  I said, also, on Second Reading that the breach of promise action should not go in respect of promises made before the passing of this Bill, and which would be enforceable actions at the moment and before the passing of this Bill.  The law as it stands, which it is now proposed to change, gives people who are now subject to that law rights to procure damages &mdash; indeed, if I understand the law correctly, exemplary damages, compensation for loss of face, for being jilted, for what used to be known universally and may still be known in parts of Ireland as the loss of chance to the jilted girl.  At present, in Ireland, there almost certainly are people who have rights which they may be thinking about pursuing by way of action, or whose affairs and relationships with the other party may be such that they are totally relying on the other party, and the breach may take place after the enactment of this Bill of the promise made before, and accepted before, this Bill was enacted.  We should not change the law so that these rights are taken away from people who now have them.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable social background to this.  Our society, undoubtedly, has been changing, in line with general western European conditions but there is much of old Ireland still remaining unchanged.  Girls still feel that they can rely on the man who has made promises to them.  They have given up careers. They have made choices about their life-style which they would not have made had they not thought that they had a right to trust the other person and a right to be compensated if their trust was misplaced, if the primary, growing suspicion was replaced by the certainty that this man was not as they had thought him to be.  These people should not have these rights taken from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2213" /> I know the provisions about taking proceedings. The Civil Liability Act, 1961 sets a three-year period for taking this kind of action.  The limitation period applies and that right, which has a correlative obligation on the person who made the promise, lies over the affairs of that other person during the period of limitation and should remain over the affairs of the other person.</P>
    <P>I expressed doubt on Second Reading and am not going to be satisfied with an assurance that I am wrong.  It is a matter of view.  I expressed doubt as to whether it is constitutional &mdash; and I have not here been heard referring too much to the Constitution &mdash; to take away a personal right of action existing for centuries under our law, which has a value, without providing any alternative to that right. The Law Reform Commission do not weigh very heavily with me, I regret to say.  They did, however, recommend that, in making this change, we ought not to take away the existing right, and that, while the law should be changed, such rights of action as there were at the moment should remain.</P>
    <P>That leaves two points I made on Second Reading.  I will have a number of other points to make on other sections. It may be helpful if I make a general point about a curious paradox in the Bill resulting from the proposed abolition of the breach of promise action.  By abolishing the breach of promise action and introducing a series of sections &mdash; sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 &mdash; we are paradoxically saying of the breach of promise action in section 2: &ldquo;He promised to marry you.  You have as much reason to complain as if he promised to bring you to a dance and did not turn up, or he asked you to dinner and you had to pay for it yourself.&rdquo;  We are treating these promises as if they were domestic grievances, of a kind no one ever intends to enforce in law, whose character and nature are that they have no legal effect, because they were never intended to have legal effect.</P>
    <P>Yet in this Bill we are introducing a series of changes of law with regard to the conduct of the parties towards each <Col N="2214" /> other and in relation to other parties.  For example, while we are abolishing the right of action for breach of promise, we are treating them as if they were married persons in another section.  I think it is right to abolish the breach of promise law.  We are going to give more effect than that promise has at the moment in its consequences for the further legal relations of these two people and the legal relations of their friends, their parents, brothers, sisters or whoever has the swag.  It is a paradox.  Maybe it is a paradox we cannot escape, but I think the language of the other sections may take more account of what we are doing in section 2.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred to have seen a simple Bill with the abolition of that breach of promise action at the same time as we abolished the criminal conversation action.  I am not going to deal with them in this section but there are many other sections to deal with the consequences of engagement.  The most important consequence of engagement is the removal of the right to be compensated for the suffering caused by the breach of promise, but the whole structure of other things is erected on the existence of engagements between couples and the knowledge of other parties of the existence of the engagements.  Under section 2 we say engagements to marry are not enforceable in law.  Then we say it is equivalent to not turning up for dinner and, notwithstanding all that, the jugs, the silver, the furniture, the arrangements about the mortgage, and so on, will be treated very seriously, and on an entirely different basis from the basis on which they would be treated if there was not an engagement, which at the moment would give rise to an action for breach of promise.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister very strongly to accept the Law Commission's report to preserve such rights as there are at the moment while changing the law for the future.  It is not good thinking to say that the limitation period will mean these actions will take place during the next few years because if we let them survive this Act and only preserve such actions that have already commenced, we are going to have a spurt of litigation in this <Col N="2215" /> area.  I do not know about that.  The reasoning is bad.  If we want to change the limitation period with regard to this then let us do that, let us shorten that period, but I do not see why our citizens should be expected to know that if they consult the fastest solicitor in town and get their action out they are going to be £10,000, £20,000 or £30,000 better off than the poor decent slob who had a poor decent slob as a solicitor but did not get his action launched because his solicitor was too busy to read Bills going through the Seanad in the middle of a general election.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister enlighten me on subsection (1) which states that &ldquo;An agreement between two persons... shall not under the law of the State have effect as a contract...&rdquo;? A normal engagement is an agreement but it is not set out in legal terms; it is merely an understanding between people. The subsection says &ldquo;no action shall be brought in the State for breach of such an agreement, whatever the law applicable to the agreement&rdquo;.  Does this mean that in the unusual circumstances of a legal agreement being drawn up between two people and signed as between solicitors, such a legal agreement would not have effect in law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already informed the House that the Government have given very serious consideration to the specific point raised by Senator FitzGerald, and decided that once the basic decision to abolish the action for breach of promise was taken this should apply to all agreements to marry, including those made before the Bill becomes law.  In that connection, I want to tell Senator Brugha that this section abolishes an action for breach of an agreement to marry.  Senator FitzGerald seemed to suggest on Second Stage that another and better way of dealing with agreements to marry entered into before the Bill becomes law would be to reduce the period of limitation, at present six years, within which an action for breach of promise might be brought after the termination of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> I believe that this would not solve the problem which the Government sought to deal with when they decided that the abolition of the action should apply to all agreements, whether entered into before or after the passing of the Act.  There could still be long engagements and no matter how short the period of limitation, actions could take place years after the Act is passed.  This the Government consider to be a most unsatisfactory situation. The reason for the abolition of the action was that such actions have in recent times become very rare, mainly because of the change in social views.  In particular the risk that a girl whose engagement has been broken will thereafter be shunned by potential marriage partners has lessened greatly in recent years.  Also if either party to an engagement is convinced that he or she ought not to marry the other, it is highly doubtful if public policy is served by letting the threat of action push him into a potentially unstable marriage or penalising him or her in damages if he or she breaks the engagement.</P>
    <P>It has also been said that to equate responsibility for the termination of the engagement with fault is the wrong way to look at the situation, because in one way the engagement period has been successful if the engagement is broken since one of the parties has utilised this time to find out if the marriage could be proceeded with.  It is a very essential ingredient of engagements of whatever duration that the two people involved should use that time to advantage.  We have heard much in the House today and in the Dáil about some of the difficulties that subsequently arise in marriages, and proper examination by individuals who are having a courtship or have an agreement to marry provides them with an opportunity to assess all of the essential ingredients for that marriage.  It is not correct to state that because the action for breach of an agreement to marry is being abolished in section 2, we should not then proceed to recognise the agreement for the purposes of settling any question in relation to property or gifts that may have come into existence in consequence of the agreement.  We are <Col N="2217" /> abolishing an action by one party against another.  It is important that we have legislative provision for the settlement of any questions in relation to property that has come into existence or has been given by one party to another or by a third party.  It is the first time that this has happened and it has been welcomed by many.  I do not think that regardless of the successful general election that we have had, there is going to be any rush to solicitors' offices for the purposes of instituting proceedings or actions on the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald on the one hand says he is delighted that this is abolished, and on the other hand he seems to favour the continuation or preservation of old legal traditions when society, and young people in particular, no longer wish to avail of that type of remedy for the purposes of being compensated.  The modern view is that people who can discover during the period of engagement that they would not be suited to each other in marriage are very fortunate.  It is the greatest compensation they could get.  No monetary compensation could properly compensate them for a bad marriage.  I am satisfied that if they have the opportunity many young intelligent and talented people can use the period valuably and if they can discover during that period that they are unsuited for each other in a subsequent marriage arrangement, it is the greatest compensation they can achieve as a result of courtship.  We cannot afford to overlook that or fail to recognise that this should be the fundamental importance of the pre-marriage relationship.  To put a monetary price on it would be in conflict with the spirit of the Bill which has abolished the monetary price in the case of criminal conversation by the abolition of that action.  I am satisfied that the reasons for the abolition of the action as decided by the Government are proper and correct and meet the requirements of modern society and intelligent thinking about the purposes of engagements and what they should be about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we have gone through the process of abolishing the right to damages in passing section 2, we are now attaching changed consequences to that very agreement because, if I understand the existing law, there is no principle of law to the effect that if you make a present to either of the engaged persons the property is presumed to be given to both engaged persons as joint owners.  I am aware of the differences of enactments between our two communities, but the most recent edition of Halsbury's Law states that there is no particular principle of law applicable to wedding presents so as to make them joint gifts to both spouses. Where there is evidence of intention on the part of the donor a wedding present may be found to have been given to one spouse or to the other or to both, but where intention is not clear, the inference may be drawn that gifts originating from the husband's family and friends were intended for the husband and that gifts originating from the wife's family and friends were intended for the wife and that the nature of the gift may supply <Col N="2219" /> evidence of the donor's intention.  That is a great deal more sensible than what we are proposing to do.  We are not merely abolishing, with great mass enthusiasm, the right to take action for breach of promise but we are going to change in a fundamental way the law relative to wedding presents.</P>

      <P>At the moment I am trying to make a point with regard to this.  I wonder should we be changing this law in such a frightful hurry.  The whip is not out on our backs to do this thing.  It is because of the way in which the Seanad is constituted that we are here at all &mdash; 47 out of 60 of us &mdash; and God knows what powers are in our hands if we took time off together to find out what we could do.  The law relating to breach of promise to marry contains the recommendations with regard to this matter, not a frightfully impressive document produced by the Law Reform Commission, Working Paper No. 4, 1978.  Here we are, three years later, in a frightful hurry doing what they are telling us except for the preservation of the right, to which we have given an enormous amount of executive attention, to decide that that recommendation should not be followed.  They tell us all about Canada and God knows where.  But if we get down to what they say about what we ought to do, we will find that they are looking very closely at the British Law Commission's report.  I cannot see why we should be in a mad rush, in June 1981, to do a lot of the things that the Law Reform Commission told us was their view on this.  My strongest recommendation to this House on this section and on all the other sections is that we should give ourselves time to consider whether we will do the various things proposed, because we are going to do rather fundamental things.  In the next section we refer to an engagement ring.  In talking about our younger people and modern arrangements, God knows where the engagement ring stands now.  I do not know what the most recent sociological <Col N="2220" /> report says on the subject of the engagement ring, but we are changing the law in regard to it in the next section as if it was an enormously important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 3 we are talking about any property given as a wedding gift &mdash; the control of some public companies, vast tracts of uncollected or undominated land, silver, cheques endorsed, bills of exchange and rights to collect any property. There is no exclusion.  At the moment there will be daddies who will give their daughters property when they are getting married and the law is that it is their daughters who are getting it, not their daughters and their husbands.  Now it is proposed that there should be a presumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary that it is given to both spouses.  What happens when a person dies and there are presumptions which cannot be rebutted?  There is a presumption that daddy's property is now given to the two of them.  It is also presumed that is should be returned if the marriage for whatever reason does not take place. That is another and a separate presumption. When is the marriage to take place? What are they to do about it in the meantime? What if they wanted to raise money to build what Mr. de Valera used to call the dowerhouse?  If they are going off to get money to build a dowerhouse before they cohabit &mdash; and we have all sorts of other possibilities if they have already cohabited &mdash; how are they going to get money if there is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that it is to be returned at the request of the donor or his personal representative?  He is gone at this stage and may be in no position to give any evidence to the contrary if the marriage for whatever reason does not take place.  There can be all sorts of reasons.  This goes to the heart of an argument about fault.  You can think of all sorts of reasons.  One does not have to know too many modern characters or ancient characters or any kind of characters to know that there are people who turn out not to be what one first thought they were.  This is to be irrelevant, apparently. If it is to be returned at the request of the donor what does one do?  If one <Col N="2221" /> has a gift of the transfer of shares and the transfer is registered, and the transferee is the owner.  If one makes a gift of a lot of stock and there is a symbolic deliverance of the stocks, what is the position about that?  Should we not make distinctions between immovable property, chattels, commercial pieces of paper, all of which may get transferred into other things?  I wonder has all this been thought out.  All I know is that the Law Reform Commission did not bother to tell us anything about it.  They did not seem to direct their minds in this paper to the problems.  <i>Nemo dat quod non habet</i> was a thing I was taught when I was a child. It means that if one does not have something one cannot give it.  If one buys a bullock at a fair one is all right because even if the seller did not own the bullock one gets a good title to it.  But if one buys silver from somebody and he does not own it, one does not own it either even if one has paid for it.  What is the position if a man declares even orally &mdash; this may not apply to land &mdash; that he owns something for another person?  That is the end of it unless he has explicitly made it subject to the wedding taking place.  If the marriage for whatever reason does not take place surely &ldquo;within a reasonable time&rdquo; or something should be put in. Surely we should have different and more precise rules.  The fact that they may have done the thing in the UK would be different because they cleaned up their law of property 56 years before we started doing it.  We are moving into all sorts of areas here without evidence before me that the consequences of these steps have been considered by the different people. I think I have said enough on that one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Views have generally been expressed regarding what intention should be presumed from the action &mdash; here I am quoting from the commission report &mdash; of the third person donor.  One approach is to consider that the party who is a relation or a friend of the donor is the intended sole beneficiary. The other approach is to consider that both parties are intended to benefit jointly.  It is recommended that there should be a presumption of intention to benefit the parties jointly.  There frequently are difficulties in deciding which party is the friend of the donor.  It is often the case that the donor is a friend of both, although he or she has known one longer than the other.  It seems artificial in such cases to require the court to infer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that one party only was the intended donee. However, where there is solid evidence of the intention that the gift should be the property of one spouse only, effect should be given to that intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section has relevance both for the situation where the engagement has been <Col N="2223" /> terminated and for a situation where a marriage takes place.  A dispute could arise after marriage as to the ownership of, say, a particular valuable wedding gift.  The section will help to settle that dispute.  The point has been made that the donee would have a lot of difficulty, or somebody would have a lot of difficulty in deciding whether it was intended for one person or the other or both jointly.  If, say, a particular garment were given to one of the two people involved, it could not be presumed, for instance, that a male overcoat was intended for the woman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could be more delicate, if you like, and consider such items as would be used for the adornment of the female, we will put it that way, that would be evidence of the fact that the person for whom the gift was intended was the woman in the partnership.  I am also satisfied that the donor can always make it clear himself as to whom he wishes to give the donation, and specify it in many ways.  I am quite satisfied that he can specify also when giving it &mdash; and this point has been raised by the Senator &mdash; that it is being given on the basis that the marriage will occur.  I would not like to suggest that if a gift is given it should necessarily mean that a marriage should occur for the purposes purely of acquiring the right of ownership to the gift.  But I hold the view that the donor can always, if he so wishes, prescribe a time limit within which the marriage should occur so as to ensure that, in the case of valuable property, it will not lie indefinitely in the hands of the two people who might think fit to enjoy or use it for their own personal gain and never get married. That is something about which the individual donor can make the necessary arrangements, if he so wishes.  In the absence of his doing that, and with no evidence to the contrary, the presumption is of course that it is the property of both.  In the transfer of property &mdash; be it houses, land; I do not know whether I should mention oil wells, &mdash; if somebody wants to donate property of this nature, <Col N="2224" /> again there are the normal standard procedures of which the Senator is well aware under which the individual or both parties can be the nominated recipients. There are procedures and practices well established in our law for the purpose of identifying who gets what.</P>
      <P>I do not think that all of the fears that the Senator seems to express will upset a whole tradition and create enormous problems.  I say that because the vast majority of the members of society are normal.  It is only in the abnormal situation that you will have disputes.  It is important that this provision be here, in so far as it is a new provision for joint ownership, but it does not in any way interfere with all the other possibilities that both the parties to the agreement and the donor can avail of if they want to decide who gets what.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that it is not possible to dismiss lightly points I made with regard to this.  We are making a fundamental change of law.  The law has emerged through a long series of judicial precedents which have been reflecting judicial consideration of a whole variety of different human circumstances and conditions and as a result of which, as the law stands at present, there is no principle making wedding presents joint gifts.  Where no intention is clear the inference may be drawn that gifts originating from the husband's family and friends are intended for the husband and gifts originating from the wife's family and friends are intended for the wife. Of course, there are problems and these have to be worked out in the event of difficulty.  But we are changing an important principle and I am not convinced that any of us, here or in the other House, has given sufficient consideration to the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, I hope not irrelevantly, I think it illustrates the obsolescent nature of our procedures that we should be engaging in what we are doing on this day.  Quite honestly I think it is a very clear pointer to the need for a change in our procedures.  These sorts of Bills should get empanelled by people with responsibility, people with access to the appropriate <Col N="2225" /> expertise, people whose expertise would be able to challenge the expertise available to the Minister.  And from the resulting debate, perhaps inevitably, a result will emerge from my ranting on to the Minister here.  I would have thought it was perfectly obvious to everyone present. Also on this question of the marriage, it is perfectly open at present to specify a gift as being given subject to the condition precedent that there is a marriage. It is possible to provide for that. But if it is not made a condition precedent &mdash; if, for example, it is a father-daughter situation &mdash; there is a presumption that the father is advancing the daughter.  It is not the daughter and her fiance, which is what we are proposing.  It is a wedding gift from the father to his daughter.  Are we proposing to change that?  People apparently must go to elaborate lengths to make matters expressed that may be offensive to the proposed marriage partner. People do not like saying: &ldquo;I am giving it to my daughter and I do not want you to have anything to do with it&rdquo;.  The present position is that it would be a gift to the daughter in which the new husband would not have an interest.  Under this arrangements will have to be set up to make it clear in the future that he knew it was so.  Human beings know these things without being told.  I do not see why human relationships should become strained by a necessity to express things that flow naturally from the existing law relative to this matter.</P>

      <P>We are now going to make the engagement ring a returnable deposit placed on the woman. Is that not the new law the Minister wants to have on the subject?  The man wants his deposit back.  He is not bound by the agreement to marry.  We have already made that clear to all characters in the neighbourhood in section 2.  The man has now got a hold of her attentions by giving her an engagement ring.  He has placed a deposit on her.  Now we have decided the form is not as good as we thought it was.  If the man wants his deposit back he is entitled to get it.  He is not entitled to get it back at the moment under the ancient common law which we must apparently regard was wrong in everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, under this new law, irrespective of the reason why the marriage is not taking place, it is presumed &mdash; you can imagine the nature of the engagement taking place between this pair &mdash; that <Col N="2227" /> when the gift is given it is subject to a condition: &ldquo;I want you to understand, Margaret, that it should be returned to me or my personal representative if the marriage between us does not take place, that is to say, other than if I should die.&rdquo; It is to be presumed it is subject to that condition and we are including a marriage ring.  What happens if it does not take place owing to the fact that the lady concerned cannot stand the sight of the fellow any more, has found him to be a fraud or has reason to think he is incapable of full responsibilities in marriage and so on?  We have torn up the agreement, the promises between them.  They are just as unimportant as keeping breakfast engagements or luncheon engagements.

What happens if there is seduction and illegitimate and non-legitimiseable children resulting from it?  Is this to be the law with regard to the gifts of property?  I need to be convinced on these matters.  I suggest the Seanad needs to be convinced on them. The Oireachtas should give more thought to them.

There are all sorts of reasons why that is undesirable, and the Minister has made the most significant point with regard to why it is undersirable that that action should be left, and that is, that it may tend to lead people into marriages that ought not take place.</P>
      <P>At present if there are presents made, particularly the engagement ring, a girl can keep the engagement ring and she can have the great satisfaction of putting her heel on it in front of him or throwing it into the river Barrow or wherever they happen to be, and owning it and not being subject to make any return or repayment of deposit to him.

If land is transferred, and so on, it should go back to the man or the woman, as the case may be, instead of being made subject to this urbane type of law which comes from Birmingham or wherever the hell it comes from.  It must be thought about in Dublin, Cork, Galway. This ought to be thought about in Dublin, and that is what I am arguing for. I know Governments are very busy and <Col N="2229" /> they cannot be thinking out the implications of all these things.

      <P>I have a non-legal kind of mind but I regard the section and indeed the whole Bill as being very progressive. I agree with Senator Eoin Ryan that section 4 flows from section 2.  When a couple become engaged and he gives her an expensive engagement ring, that is part of their love, but when love grows cold for some reason, then surely the engagement ring should become not a sign of promise but simply a piece of property which he may require again, assuming he is thinking of venturing a second time.  Perhaps he would not be so callous as to give the second one the same engagement ring.  It is a gift but when the arrangement is terminated, it is no longer a pledge of love but a piece of property which I suggest should revert to the donor.  I suspect that beneath Senator FitzGerald's grim forensic exterior there beats a sentimental heart which wants the girl to keep the ring.</P>

      <P>Under the present law, if the marriage does not take place for any reason other than the death of the donor, it will be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the gift was given on condition that it be returned on request.  If the marriage does not take place because of the donor's death, it will be presumed that the gift was made unconditionally.</P>
      <P>Under the present law a gift in contemplation of marriage given by one party to the agreement to the other is conditional on the marriage taking place &mdash; and thus returnable if the marriage does not take place &mdash; but it cannot be recovered by the donor if he or she is in breach of the promise to marry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, it is an implied condition where the woman unjustifiably breaks off the engagement or where the engagement is terminated by mutual consent that she return all presents of significant <Col N="2230" /> value including the engagement ring &mdash; unless they were given unconditionally. Where the man unjustifiably breaks off the engagement or where the engagement is terminated by mutual consent he must return such presents and he may not lawfully demand the return of the ring. The section removes any consideration of fault from the determination of whether such gifts are returnable, and is similar to the equivalent English provision in relation to such gifts with the exception of the engagement ring.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, whose recommendation in this matter we are following, considered the English position. The solution adopted in England in regard to engagement rings was a compromise one arising out of the desire to ensure that a jilted woman should be free to do as she wished with the ring.  Accordingly, the English legislation introduced a general presumption that the gift of an engagement ring would be an absolute gift.  There are two sustainable views.  I think Senator FitzGerald's view is that in relation to engagement rings the existing law should remain unchanged &mdash; that is if the man breaks off the engagement the woman should be free to do what she likes with the ring.  On the other hand, the general policy adopted by the Law Reform Commission in their approach to the questions relating to property arising out of breach of promise of marriage was to remove as far as possible any consideration of fault from the determination of such questions.  Their recommendations in relation to engagement rings follows this general approach.  It should also be said that this particular proposal was published in the Law Reform Commission's Working Paper No.4 and as far as we are aware it received no adverse criticism. Also, one English family law commentator, (Bromley) expressed the view that one would have expected the presumption in the English Act to have been the other way, that is, that the engagement ring should be presumed to be returnable as being in the nature of a pledge.</P>
    <P>I believe, as Senator Ryan has said, that the provision in section 2 is proper and necessary.  Therefore, I do not accept <Col N="2231" /> the argument made by Senator FitzGerald in relation to sections 3 and 4, which simply provide for the settlement of property in cases where marriage does not take place or where death occurs.</P>

      <P>Apparently any little operation enables Senator Murphy to stop thinking.  He is delighted if he can get some word like &ldquo;feminist&rdquo;.  He can retreat behind any such word as &ldquo;sexist&rdquo; or &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; and give it as an excuse from further thought.  He is nearly as bad as Senator Martin who regards it as some defect on the human race if he tries to read a section in order to dismiss it.  It is our job to read sections of Bills before us and we do not need all this talk about lawyers and legal talk.  What the blazes should we be doing here on this Bill but engaging in legal talk?  We had those references to my sentimental heart and my forensic exterior.  I am not allowed to practise in the courts, it is not my business to do so, as Senator Ryan knows perfectly well.</P>
      <P>Did Senator Murphy ever stop to think that merely because 13 years after an English law commission made a report our people ten years later make a similar report?  Three years after that they tell us that we are not doing what they recommended. Has the Senator read Working paper No. 4?  It is a pity if he did not because he would then know that this Bill will have considerable effects on many aspects of people's affairs.  It is not good enough for Senator Murphy to produce his judgment on such matters as his interpretation of feminism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it logically follows that because there are good reasons for abolishing the breach of promise action there are equally good reasons why all questions of fault should effect the questions of property between the parties or between third parties and the two of <Col N="2232" /> them.  There are reasons which make it undesirable to maintain a breach of promise action if the effect of it is to lead some pair into a marriage which should never have taken place.  If property is passed then the court ought to be allowed to take any view they think is right and damned if it is going to be a sexist view because sex does not enter into this matter, any more relevantly than it enters into Senator Murphy's intervention.  It does not enter into it any more relevantly than Senator Murphy's interventions here and the pending Seanad election.  The fact is that questions of justice are properly applied by judges who are concerned with justice whether they are male judges or female judges.  Look at what the British have done with their whole marriage code and their whole institution of marriage. Are we to go trotting after them in all directions?  I do not think so.  It is undesirable that consideration should be withdrawn from the question of the fault of the parties concerned and the fact that the marriage does not take place.  That factor of justice and misrepresentation and behaviour should remain as a relevant factor and should be the dominating factor in the determination of what is going to happen to all of this.  I have said enough on that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is the consideration of the gift on marriage and if that consideration fails then there is no longer any reason why the property should remain the property of the other person? I think Senator FitzGerald is emphasising this engagement ring which is probably not the principal concern of this section at all: it is property much more valuable and much more tangible property than an engagement ring.  Merely because the engagement ring has a romantic aspect, perhaps it seems unfair and ungallant for the person to ask for the engagement ring back; but certainly in regard to all other kinds of property it seems to me quite right that the property should be taken back if the consideration has failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The consideration of the marriage may have failed but a lot of other considerations may have <Col N="2233" /> passed.  What if there is a child, for example, resulting from a seduction not of an entirely modern character which has given rise to the responsibility of a child? Are we then going to be told that we will look at some other law that will deal with that, a law that will get around to making it right in five years' time?  Let all these matters be taken into account.  I referred to the bigamist situation: these things have happened; these things do happen and all these things are human realities. The law should be left as it stands with regard to that.  If the position is as simple as the Senator suggests why are we going on in the next section to treat their transactions as if the pair of them are married? Section 5 opens with words with which section 5, subsection (1), subsection (2), section 6 and section 7 open but notably the other sections do not open, that is, &ldquo;where an agreement to marry is terminated&rdquo;. Incidentally what happens in relation to any of these things if the parties are killed at the same time?  There is mention here of the death of a donor. What happens if they are both killed in a crash together or in an accident?  Where are the presumptions at that stage?  Are we going to presume that one of them died before the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no coherent logic to this whole Bill in my view, a male feminist's view, if you like.  Where an agreement to marry is terminated, having said the lady cannot sue the fellow for breach of promise she suddenly finds herself in the position because of the rules of law relating to the rights of spouses, that this matter is a notional spouse under section 5 in relation to property in which either or both of them have a beneficial interest while the agreement is in force.  As Senator Ryan knows extremely well, the words &ldquo;have a beneficial interest&rdquo; themselves raise questions for lawyers.  What are we talking about?  Where does the whole question of trusts and limited interest and other people's interests stand, settlements on the pair to be married and the prospective issue of that marriage and so on?  Have they rights?  If there is not a marriage, have the illegitimate children any rights?  Is that a male feminist view, Senator Murphy, to be concerned about <Col N="2234" /> illegitimate children?  Or is that excessively rhetorical of me to be referring to it?  It is relevant at any rate because there will be nothing but illegitimate children out of this proposal.  If there are children they will be illegitimate because we are talking about an agreement to marry that is terminated.  We are talking about the rights of these two people and we are not contemplating the possibility that there may be other people involved at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have a new thing again hopping in on the UK report which generates the Irish report which generates an Irish Bill which deviates somewhat from the original UK report which is followed by, in part, a UK Act.  We have a side note here for the first time &ldquo;Application to the court in the case of a substantial benefit to a party&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;broken engagement&rdquo; suddenly appears in the side note.  A broken engagement does not matter if you break it under section 2 because we have provided to that effect under section 2.  But it matters a lot if it is broken under section 3, because you get your money back, and under section 4 you get your engagement ring back irrespective of who did what to whom.  We have here something which I think needs definition.  Under section 3 we are talking about two persons who have agreed to marry one another and what happens to any properties given as wedding gifts to either or both of them. Various things happen under that and that property, where the agreement to <Col N="2235" /> marry is terminated under section 5, is dealt with as if the two of them were married and questions are determined as between husband and wife.  The presumption is not as it is at the moment in favour of what is given by the husband's relatives and friends being for the husband and likewise in the case of the wife under section 5.  In section 6 there is something called &ldquo;a benefit of a substantial nature not being a gift to which section 3 applies&rdquo;.  What is that?  Section 3 applies to what are described as being gifts to engaged couples by other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must in some way be distinguishing between wedding gifts &mdash; why we do not say it I do not know &mdash; to which section 3 applies and some things that are not wedding gifts under section 6 and where, notwithstanding that the matter given is not a wedding gift, there has been an agreement to marry which is terminated and the party to the agreement received a benefit of a substantial nature from the applicant in consequence of the agreement. What is a &ldquo;benefit of a substantial nature&rdquo;?  Is that not a property too or is it saying: &ldquo;I am going to make him managing director of the local shoe factory or I am sending him on a holiday to Hawaii&rdquo;?  I take it we are talking about something other than wedding gifts.  Let us say so rather than something not being a gift to which section 3 applies.  I notice the words used are &ldquo;in consequence of the agreement&rdquo;.  What if the benefit we are talking about is not in consequence of the agreement at all but was to provoke the agreement?  Did you ever hear of that kind of lark from the dame who actually wanted to bring about a marriage, who did some expenditure to procure the agreement, and gestures were made and transfers were effected and promises are pursued to some degree?  However, none of that, even if it results in substantial things, is going to be the subject of section 6 because the only matter that the courts are going to look at, no matter how substantial it is, in section 6 is something that is in consequence of the agreement. Presumably, therefore, it must follow in time the agreement and presumably, therefore, it cannot precede <Col N="2236" /> the agreement to marry.  Life is very strange and I imagine there are people listening to me who are aware of maybe substantial enough benefits that have preceded agreements to marry.</P>
    <P>These are not to be the subject of the court even though they were not wedding gifts, I welcome section 6.  It should apply to the whole thing, including section 3.  It should be in connection with the agreement, in furtherance, in subsequent, consequence or whatever.  It should take in all the links about the agreement notwithstanding that the agreement is not a contract.  All these sections really should have a subsection saying &ldquo;that notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2),&rdquo;. As a matter of elegant art I would have divided it up and made that section 2, something independent to be ignored for the rest of what follows.  That is my feeling about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the making of orders by the court where one party to an agreement to marry has received the substantial benefit, other than a wedding gift, which is provided for in section 3.  That substantial benefit can mean the provision of finances for decorating or carrying out improvements to a home or for payment for a holiday provided for either of the parties before the engagement broke up.  The Law Reform Commission first proposed a provision of this nature in their Working Paper, No. 4 1978: The Law Relating to Breach of Promise of Marriage.  The basis of the proposal was that where it appeared that either party to an agreement to marry that had been terminated had been unjustly enriched by the other party or had been substantially or unjustly enriched by a third party, the court should be empowered to make such order for restitution or compensation as appeared to be just in all the circumstances. The Working Paper also proposed that the court was not to have regard to the question of the responsibility of either party for the termination of the engagement except where there had been violence, fraud or deceit by one of the parties but this latter proposal was dropped by the Commission in its First Report on <Col N="2237" /> Family Law &mdash; 1981, so that less stress would be laid on the parties' conduct in respect of the termination of the engagement.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald has also stated that we have copied British law in relation to this section.  We have not.  This section is new and there is nothing in British law that bears any resemblance to it.  We did not consider any aspects of British law in connection with the preparation of this provision.</P>

      <P>The House has been dealing with great skill, if I may say so, with this piece of legislation.  My colleague, Senator FitzGerald, has been highlighting many points which are too complicated for me.  In connection with this section I should like to ask the Minister to explain the situation regarding a young engaged couple who plan to marry &mdash; bearing in mind that the earning power of women nowadays is on a par with that of men, equal pay for equal work &mdash; and, as is common practice, while they are engaged, embark on providing and building a home for themselves.  It is not unknown to hear of long engagements here.  I should like the Minister to give the House an indication of what the situation is and if this section can be helpful where a young man and young woman spend a considerable amount of time, energy and, indeed, finance providing themselves with a home.  My experience in rural Ireland is that a young fellow will get a plot of ground, maybe he gets it from a friend or, indeed, a relation and he goes through the Land Registry registering it in his name.  Then he proceeds to build.  Very often the woman's salary will make a considerable contribution to the provision and the building of that home.  Houses at present cost a lot of money and in the event of that house being completed before a marriage, or in this case before the engagement becomes a broken engagement, has the partner who is not registered owner of the site <Col N="2238" /> any comeback or any guarantee of recovering her input at least.  If the matter carries on for any considerable time, with the rapid rate of inflation over the last couple of years, or if there is a time lag or a long engagement, then the value will greatly appreciate.  This could cause a lot of bother and I wonder if section 6 is sufficient to give the court power to make an equitable distribution and an equitable divide of the value of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Senator has said it appears that he is referring to section 5 rather than section 6.  Section 6, the section we are on, deals with third parties while section 5 deals with engaged couples and the property of engaged couples. Property of engaged couples, where the engagement is terminated, is to be dealt with in the same way as the property of married couples.  The rules of law that apply to the property of married couples will apply to the settlement of any disputes or otherwise that may arise between formerly engaged couples.</P>

      <P>At the risk of drawing Senator FitzGerald's withering fire, I am reminded of a remark of an American Civil War general, &ldquo;Elevate them guns a little lower&rdquo;.  In section 6 the court has to adjudicate on the matter of considerable property.  If there are children &mdash; the point which Senator FitzGerald brought up &mdash; if there are issue of the engagement, would the court not be adjudicating on that matter as well? Would the court not be taking into consideration the existence of the children and their right?  The point which Senator FitzGerald brought up under section 4 seems to be absolutely distinct from the section which follow.  Section 4 deals with the simple case of an engaged couple who are no longer engaged, whereas section 6 presupposes perhaps a long standing arrangement which may have all kinds of extensions and which the court would adjudicate on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I do not think that is correct.  There is no provision there for illegitimate children of any union.  It would be highly desirable. I do not understand this point about substantial nature.  I welcome section 6 and the Minister may be cheered to know that I welcome the next section too.  I think that in ignoring the question of responsibility we are going too far, in our Irish circumstances, when we are abolishing the breach of promise action, in going ahead to ignore the question of fault in relation to the termination of the engagement save in so far as it may arise by analogy of the application of the Married Women's Status Act.  But under the Married Women's Status Act the children will be legitimate children with all the rights of such.  Earlier today we passed a Bill which ignored the position of an illegitimate child, the earlier of these two family law Bills; we do not have any mention of children in this entire Bill.  We are assuming that such matters do not arise when we are solemnly engaged in enacting laws here.  I do not see provision for it and I would like to think there is.  That is another reason for not rushing this Bill through.</P>

The idea is to prevent, though we abstain from using the words for some reason or other, unjust enrichment.  Why do we not use them?  It is simply because there has been a great deal of judicial commentary on it.  It is a phrase that we could possibly understand from judicial findings what it meant.

There is one right, that is that the financé can get back his engagement ring.  He has not got that right at the moment and we are conferring that right on him anyhow.  The donor can have three years to get it back apparently and if it is not in dust at the foot of the woman, the women of Ireland are not what I think they ought to be.

      <P>The language is very inadequate because there are rights which are expressed in this Bill which exist already and there are rights conferred by this Bill which do not exist.  If we are going to limit the period for action in respect of language such as that, we should know what we are doing expressly and we should say if it is every right enforceable and expressed in this whole code whether it exists or not at the moment.  We should say so because at the moment there are rights to bring actions under contracts. The period for bringing actions under contracts is a different period.  If we are going to change that period, let us know what we are doing.  But we are saying in section 2 that the agreement is not a contract.  If we are going to say that all the rights that are spelled out in sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, even though we use different language in sections 3 and 4 from what is used in 5, 6 and 7, are to have different periods of limitation for bringing actions these are very important matters. Men may wake up in a sweat to discover suddenly that they have not served their proceedings in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are periods set out for bringing proceedings.  Let us, for God's sake, be clear about it.  Do not ask me to say what is in the statute of limitations at the moment because I could not remember it.  But there are periods set out for bringing proceedings.  If this is a different period, as I think it is&mdash;and let us not be trapped about the breach of promise; there are other contractual rights which flow from existing law and periods of limitation for enforcing these contracts &mdash;and if we are changing the period of <Col N="2242" /> limitations, let us do so in a clear way. Let us take the statute of limitations out now and look at it and see what we are varying.  Perhaps the Minister's advisers know all about that.  It they do they should tell us all about it and we should have an opportunity of thinking about what it means before we agree to it, and that will not be today.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald is arguing that there is a distinction between the termination of an agreement to marry and the fact that a situation arises where the marriage for whatever reason does not take place.  I think that is a distinction of words but one of the circumstances in which the termination of an agreement takes place is when it is impossible for the agreement to take place.  That gets back to meaning &ldquo;if for any reason the marriage does not take place&rdquo;.  That is not a very valid distinction.  It seems to me that the rights conferred by this Act &mdash; the provision in section 9 &mdash; are provided for in sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and even though they are worded differently they are all in fact a termination of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To take Senator Ryan up on section 3, that section simply introduces a new presumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary with regard to property given as a wedding gift being subject to the conditions that it be returned at the request of the donor. That is not the creation of a right.  It is a presumption of construction.  If we are going to change the law in regard to the limitation period let us be clear about it. On the question of the termination of the agreement, this reminds me of my listening a long time ago to Mr. Justice Gavin Duffy construing a will when he said, &ldquo;It seems to me that the draftsman took out a precedent in Butterworth and then took out another precedent from Key and Elsinson and put the two together and produced as a result this botched job&rdquo;. because we have language here which does not reconcile in some sections with the language in others.  What I am saying is that nobody should be left in any doubt <Col N="2243" /> about what the periods are for taking action.  Here there is considerable doubt because the language used is &ldquo;a right conferred by this Act&rdquo;.  I do not know what &ldquo;a right conferred by this Act&rdquo; is unless it is spelled out as being sections 3,4,5,6,7 or whatever you want to say. It is a separate issue to ask the question why the periods of limitation should be different in relation to these situations because it might be arguable that they should be longer rather than shorter.  I should like to know why they should be different from the ordinary.  I just want to know.  Human intelligence has been brought to bear on the matter.  All I am clear about and absolutely clear is that section 9 is unclear.</P>

      <P>Section 9 applies to the various provisions of the Act and I have no doubt that any of the alleged doubts or ambiguities of different language used will not create any problems.  All the information available to me and the reports from the Law Reform Commission and so on have convinced me that what is proposed in section 9 is adequate.  On the question as to why the periods should be reduced to three years in this Bill, I think it is correct that matters related to the settlement of disputes or the settling of property matters in relation to engaged couples should be dealt with as soon as possible after the termination of the agreement to marry.  Otherwise you could have a situation emerging where the people involved, and particularly the parties to a termination, might find difficulty in entering into new relationships. The termination might have resulted from a relationship that had begun.  It is also important for both of them that they would not be in any way affected or be in any way restricted in pursuing whatever other interest they had.  For that reason I think that it is in the best interests of the parties involved that the limitation period for taking proceedings should be reduced to theee years.  I might add that this is also the view of the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to agree to that for the simple reason that my office has been inundated with inquiries on a regular basis and on some occasions on a daily basis regarding the coming into operation of this legislation and section 10 in particular.  There are many young couples who are at present being put to enormous expense by having to obtain valid consents through the High Court.  I have had contact from their solicitors and from some couples themselves and I do not think that what I consider to be a vast improvement &mdash; good sensible legislation that is remedying difficulties &mdash; should have to be put back for another week.  My only regret is that we could not have dealt with it on the last occasion here.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the proposal to put through legislation about which very considered views have been expressed without the Seanad considering the Report of the Committee on the different sections of the Bill.  Therefore I cannot agree to have Report Stage immediately following Committee Stage, because it would mean the Seanad had not considered the Committee Stage debate on the Family Law Bill.  There is no way in which it can be pretended that the Seanad has considered the Committee Stage debate, as it is its duty to consider when we are making changes of considerable importance in the law.  In so far as these are considerable improvements it is important that they be properly considered if we are to avoid causing subsequent injustice to the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot agree to the Report Stage being taken now.  There is no reason why we should end the proceedings of this House on a division.  It would be much better and a good symbol for the future if we did not divide.  I am being serious; there is nothing trivial in what I have contributed.  I think that the matters that have been raised here ought to be considered. It may well be that every word of the Bill should go through as it is provided that the criticism that has been expressed has been considered and provided it is evident to everybody concerned that it is worth while devoting our time to this matter.  I do not want to end what may be the last debate in the Seanad with a division and I do not want to put the Government in a position of putting a closure on the debate.  I do not want to appear to be obstructive.  I am in no way looking for a division on this, but there will have to be a division if the Government press the matter.  I would hope that <Col N="2246" /> there would be an agreement to take this at a time which is up to the Minister and the Leader of the House to decide, but not for less than a week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that what has been said here, by me at any rate, and anyone else who has contributed, will be considered as serious contrubutions to what I think ought to be the law relative to very important matters.  I have the feeling that this is not being considered, that it has been futile for me to have said anything, to direct my intelligence to this.  This is a very unhappy note for me on which to end this session of the Seanad.  As I have said honestly to the House, I may be wrong in everything I have said, but I do not think so.  I think I have made quite a number of points of substance.  All I would like is to be sure that they have been examined, without any sense that they should not receive as much examination at this time of the year as they would have received six months ago and they would have received such examination six months ago.  I know from previous experience of this Minister and his Department, and other Ministers and their Departments, that what one says here is considered and it is worth while putting forward suggestions.  We are all perfectly well aware that there is a Seanad election and there are other things happening but I cannot be responsible for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <P>As I understand it, Report Stage is of use where amendments have been made on Committee Stage, where amendments have been discussed which are not in the view of some Members of the House or the Minister entirely appropriate and where it is clear that some kind of amendment might be useful.  Report Stage gives an opportunity to discuss amendments or to discuss a better form of amendment but it only arises where this kind of situation has <Col N="2247" /> taken place.  There were not amendments to this Bill.  There were not any suggested amendments and, consequently, although this may not be the only reason why a delay for a debate on Report Stage would be appropriate, it seems to be the principal one.  I do not want to be difficult and I certainly agree with Senator FitzGerald in that I hope we would not have a vote on this.  It seems to me that this is not the kind of situation in which it would be reasonable to insist on a delay, an interval during which time consideration could be given to the Committee Stage debate and a further debate to take place on Report Stage.  In my view in all the circumstances it is not reasonable to ask for an adjournment of a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Many times in this House I have decided as a matter of deliberate policy and out of fairness to the Ministers in charge of legislation not to table amendments on Committee Stage hoping that in making points on Committee Stage I would be able to win the Minister's interest in the points I was making and that the Minister would put down amendments on Report Stage.  I made my judgment then on how I was doing with the Minister in the debate, as to whether or not I put down amendments on Report Stage.  If the Minister cares to have the exercise done for him, he will find there have been many Bills where I put down amendments on Report Stage when I had put none down on Committee Stage.  It would be my intention to put down amendments on Report Stage of this Bill and I will do so.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Leader of the House.  It is quite obvious that Senator FitzGerald has put an amount of work into this technical Bill.  It is a very important Bill and I compliment the Minister on bringing in this legislation.  I think it is certainly very necessary now.  Senator FitzGerald who has handled the Bill has put much study and effort into it, and I believe it is only reasonable to give him a reasonable opportunity to consider the arguments and the views the Minister put forward.  It is unreasonable of the House <Col N="2248" /> to expect him to be able to table amendments on Report Stage in the space of half an hour or an hour.  I would ask for an adjournment of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a final comment.  As Senator Ryan has stated, there does not appear to me either to be any justification for not taking Report Stage this evening.  I have already made known to the House and to Senator FitzGerald that there is great demand for the early enactment of this legislation and it is vital to the interests of many young people.  I think it would be wrong of me, in view of the national interest, and the interests of the particular people involved, to agree to Senator FitzGerald's suggestion, particularly when I am aware that solicitors in many instances have been waiting patiently for this legislation, I feel I have no option in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>An extra week is quite a considerable length of time if a person has been waiting for a number of weeks and months.  I appreciate the in-depth and valuable comments made on the Bill by Senator FitzGerald but while he expressed definite views he did not at any time seriously conflict with any of the principles in the Bill.  For that reason I feel I must take the view that we take Report Stage this evening and, hopefully, have no division.  I appeal to the Senator to respect my plea in this matter.</P>
