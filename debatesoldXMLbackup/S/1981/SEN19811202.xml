      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to take motion No. 9.  It has been discussed on a number of occasions.  The Leader told the House that there was some legal difficulty, that legal proceedings were being taken.  I have made inquiries from the INTO and no legal proceedings have been issued.  In the circumstances, it does not seem to me that there is any good reason why this motion should not be debated by the House. Obviously it cannot be taken today but I would press the Leader of the House to allow that motion to be taken next week.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with what Senator E. Ryan has said. While it may seen churlish, as a motion which I seconded is being taken today, nevertheless I feel that the matters covered by motions Nos. 9 and No. 10 &mdash; No. 10 appears in my name and in that of Senator Honan &mdash; are matters of very great urgency.  I also made inquiries about the legal position and no writ has been issued.  Therefore I do not see that there is any legal stop on the Seanad from discussing this.  I would ask that it be taken as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House has there been any progress made on her undertaking to see what could be done about a motion on the Government's commitment to the abolition of poverty?  It is some weeks now since I raised that matter.  Do I take it that the failure to take the motion that I and Senator McGuinness put down on homeless people &mdash; which was put down before the motion on neutrality &mdash; is an indication of a derogation of the Government's commitment on poverty, indicated possibly by certain remarks of a member of her parliamentary party about dogs, cats and winos in Cork city?  Am I to take it, therefore, that poverty, which affects 25 per cent of our population, is no longer a priority of the Government? Why has this motion not been taken?</P>

      <P>I would like to make quite clear &mdash; and I am sure the Seanad is aware &mdash; the commitment on this side of the House to progressing with Private Members' motions as frequently as is possible under the terms of the motion laid before the House.  On the matter raised by the Leader of Fianna Fáil and by Senators McGuinness, Honan and Harte, the question arose last week about these motions also.  I expressed the view of the Government which was not that there were legal difficulties but that the motions deal so much with the actions of &mdash; particularly motion No. 9 &mdash; and mentions an organisation which has not actually instituted legal proceedings but has threatened legal proceedings and has not withdrawn that threat.  That situation which obtained last week has not <Col N="1057" /> changed.  We are today taking a Private Members' motion and I hope we will take other Private Members' motions as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>On the question of motions Nos. 9 and 10 &mdash; now that it has been pointed out to the House that legal proceedings have not been instituted &mdash; perhaps it would have been more advisable, in order that this debate take place, that legal proceedings had not been threatened in the first place.</P>
      <P>As regards the motion mentioned by Senator Brendan Ryan, obviously it must take its place in the order of Private Members' motions and therefore must join the queue for Private Members' time in this House.  I would suggest that perhaps the Whips and the representatives of the groups would discuss that.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to make three changes in insurance law which are of an urgent and highly desirable nature.  Firstly, the Bill proposes an amendment to the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, under which the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited were established, in order, mainly, to allow Irish Life to enter the non-life insurance market in Ireland through a subsidiary company.  Secondly, the Bill proposes to amend further section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1953, so as to increase the aggregrate of the Minister's liability under export credit insurance policies from £100 million to £300 million.  This change is necessary to keep the figure in line with the increasing value and volume of our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> The final amendment affects the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978, and is by way of confirmation that banks licensed in the State can guarantee loans issued by institutions such as the European Investment Bank for industrial development projects in this State.  I will now deal briefly with each of these three aspects in turn.</P>
    <P>Irish Life Assurance Company Limited were brought into being by the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938 which provided for the taking over of the business of several existing insurance companies which had run into financial difficulties. The 1938 Act enabled a rescue operation to be mounted to protect the interests of the policyholders, and the companies involved were amalgamated.  The Minister for Finance contributed £1 million towards meeting the deficiencies in the funds of the participating companies.  The 1938 Act provided that the business of these companies would be transferred to a specially constituted company referred to in the 1938 Act as the terminating company, which would, on a suitable occasion, transfer the business to a company known as the permanent company. The transfer to the permanent company was effected in 1947 and the permanent company is now known as Irish Life Assurance Company Limited.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that this rescue operation has come to be one of the most successful operations mounted by the State.  Irish Life have gone from strength to strength since their inception and they are now our largest insurance company with assets in 1980 of over £700 million. These assets have provided valuable investment funds for the industrial and commercial sector of the economy and they are also an important source of Government funding via the gilts market. Senators will be aware that while the Minister for Finance owns some 90 per cent of the shares of Irish Life, the company are in practice run on a strictly commercial and independent basis.  Freedom of action is essential in an area such as life assurance where the company are competing with other insurers who enjoy this freedom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> As might be expected, the liberalisation of insurance within the Community has the effect of increasing competition for insurers at home and providing new opportunities in other member states. The non-life market was opened up substantially by the implementation here in 1976 of the EEC Non-Life Directive and the life market will be similarly affected when the life directive comes into effect shortly.  In face of this situation, Irish Life have sought to diversify their business and extend their activities, for example, into foreign markets.</P>
    <P>For some time past the company have recognised the desirability of being able to engage in the non-life insurance market. Under Irish insurance law it is not possible for the same company to transact both life and non-life insurance.  Indeed, this separation of life and non-life activities has been established as the norm in the First EEC Life Assurance Directive for companies seeking insurance authorisations in the Community in future. Nevertheless, it is possible, both under Irish law and the EEC directive, for a company who are authorised, for example, to transact life insurance, to engage in non-life insurance, and vice-versa, via a subsidiary company, and there are several examples of such companies already in the Irish market.  However, Irish Life are specifically restricted under the 1938 Act, and their memorandum of association, to the carrying on of life assurance business only, and cannot even by way of subsidiary company engage in non-life business.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the first section of the Bill is to remove this restriction and allow Irish Life to establish or acquire such a non-life subsidiary.  The Bill will, therefore, do no more than place Irish Life on an equal footing with their main competitors in the Irish insurance market and provide them with a broader base from which they can better exploit such opportunities as may arise in the future and diversify into areas of underwriting activity from which hitherto they have been excluded.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the company <Col N="1060" /> have made a successful offer for a majority holding in the share capital of Church and General Insurance Company Ltd., a long established Irish non-life insurance company.  This offer was, of course, conditional on the enactment of legislation enabling Irish Life to make the necessary changes in their memorandum and was also subject to a decision by me not to make an order under section 9 of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  A proposal, accordingly, has been made to me under the Mergers Act and, having examined it in accordance with the usual procedures in these cases, I have decided not to make such an order and to allow the take-over to proceed.</P>
    <P>Irish Life in association with Church and General will, in future, be in a position to offer a complete insurance service to their customers and it is their intention to compete through their subsidiary in the market for all classes of non-life insurance, including fire, motor and other liability classes.  Section 1 of the Bill is intended to facilitate the company in pursuing this course.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides in section 1 for two further slight amendments to the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938.  The first will enable certain purely technical changes to be made in the memorandum of association of Irish Life, to bring the description of life assurance contained therein into line with the EEC Life Assurance Directive which will be implemented shortly in this country.  The second will allow Irish Life to delete certain spent provisions from their memorandum. It is necessary to effect these minor changes by way of legislation for the same reason which applies in the case of the first amendment, that is that the 1938 Act lays down in specific terms the content of certain of the main provisions of the memorandum and articles of the company and the Act must, therefore, be amended to enable the changes to be made.  These latter two amendments are of a technical nature and do not make any real change in the company's position.</P>
    <P>Turning to export credit insurance, Senators will be aware that section 2 of <Col N="1061" /> the Insurance Act, 1953 enables the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism to give guarantees with respect to the insurance of risks in connection with exports.  Under the Act, the aggregate amount of the liability at any time for principal moneys in respect of export guarantees was set at £2 million.  As our exports have grown over the years this figure has been successively amended, reaching the present limit of £100 million in the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978.  At 31 December 1980 the actual aggregate amount of the liability under the scheme was £68.1 million but the expectation is that the £100 million limit will be exceeded in the very near future. Hence the opportunity is being taken in this Bill to increase the present limit to £300 million.  Though the size of the increase is very large, it is tailored to keep pace with the expanding value of our exports and to obviate the need for further upward adjustment of the limit for three to four years.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that export credit insurance is of considerable value to our exporters enabling the various political and commercial risks involved in exporting to be shared and spread.  The insurance policy also serves as a gilt-edged security to banks when the exporter wishes to raise working capital, as is amply demonstrated by the recently introduced export credit finance scheme for goods sold on short-term credit.  That scheme is proving to be very attractive to exporters and in itself will encourage greater use of export credit insurance.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House will agree that, given the importance of what is at stake, that is, the maintenance of a vital export support, the increase now proposed in the aggregate liability with regard to export guarantees can be accepted as both a necessary and timely step.  I am confident that this proposal will have the support of the House.</P>
    <P>The final provision in this Bill is by way of confirming that licensed banks in this country can guarantee loans made by institutions such as the European Investment Bank to industrial development projects in this country.  The Insurance <Col N="1062" /> (Amendment) Act, 1978 allowed licensed banks to undertake certain types of guarantee and suretyship business specified in the Act which were previously regarded as insurance business. Certain doubts have arisen as to whether, within the exact and very specific terminology used in the 1978 Act, licensed banks are allowed to guarantee these loans from the EIB.  In order to put this matter beyond any doubt it has been decided to amend the 1978 Act in the manner set out in section 3 of the Bill. The European Investment Bank requires guarantees from banks in the recipient country and confirming this facility in this Bill merely follows the intention enshrined in the 1978 Act to allow banks to give such guarantees.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators know that it has been the intention for some time to amend and update Irish insurance legislation in general.  This exercise is well advanced and I would hope to introduce the necessary amending legislation fairly soon.  For this reason, the present measure has been limited to the few specific items for which there is an immediate need and which could not await the finalisation of the major Bill now being processed.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and I am hopeful that Senators will be agreeable to enabling the Bill to be passed speedily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to welcome warmly the Minister to the House and to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  As a former university colleague of mine, may I also express the hope that he will, sooner rather than later, find the opportunity to return to his university career?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Life, unquestionably, is one of the success stories among our State-sponsored bodies.  In that context I would like to link Irish Shipping which only this morning made the headlines as another success story.  From the Minister's introductory <Col N="1063" /> remarks it is clear that from modest and uncertain beginnings Irish Life have now reached the stage of a thriving, multi-million pound organisation.  Their activities, by statute, have been confined to life assurance only.  The specific purpose of this Bill is to allow the company to acquire 60 per cent of the share capital in Church and General, who themselves are a profitable company. Obviously Irish Life have been flying on one wing only since they could engage in life assurance solely to date.  This Bill broadens their authority to engage in general insurance.  It is a healthy step forward that a substantial and successful Irish company will now be permitted to engage in serious competition with foreign companies in both life and general insurance.</P>
    <P>In summary, we welcome the Bill but we feel that section 1 &mdash; since it broadens the scope of Irish Life's activities very considerably &mdash; could and should be more usefully teased out on Committee Stage.  I hope that the necessary interval between Stages will be made available to tease out section 1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Hillery, I welcome the provisions of the Bill which, as the Minister outlined in his introductory remarks, basically accommodates the purchase of 60 per cent of the shareholding in the Church and General Insurance Company Ltd. by the Irish Life Assurance Company Ltd.  As the bargaining progressed for this shareholding, and as Church and General had decided to go into the market-place with their <Col N="1064" /> operation as such, it was with an enormous sense of relief that we all learned that the successful bidders ultimately were the Irish Life Assurance Company Ltd.  It is very appropriate that an assurance company with such a long history and with such a marvellous record should have been successful.  As Senator Hillery has already stated, it has been one of the success stories in this country and, in view of the fact that the Government have a 90 per cent holding in the company, one of which we should be justly proud.  Its history, as the Minister has stated, goes back to 1938 when the Minister for Finance decided to underwrite £1 million in order to bail out companies which had got into a considerable financial dilemma.  It was a fortunate intervention.</P>
      <P>The Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, therefore, which emerged from that situation, enshrined the charter of Irish Life.  The Irish Life Assurance Company have gone from strength to strength. They have grown enormously to their present stage when, in fact, their assets actually exceed £700 million where they employ 1,200 people and when they invest 90 per cent of their assets in this country in equity capital, in the funding of industrial and commercial firms, in Government gilts and in industrial and commercial properties.  Not alone that, but they have gone outside the scope of the national territory and have diversified into the UK market and have set up numerous branches there.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, in view of the anticipated competition from EEC insurers as a result of the 1976 directive, there is an obvious need for Irish Life to strengthen their base, to expand and to diversify.  As a result of this merger I am delighted to note that they will be diversifying into the areas of motor insurance, fire insurance, accident insurance, property insurance and so on.  I think everybody will welcome their intervention in the area of motor insurance which is the subject of a very contentious, continuing debate.  Hopefully more competitive premiums will result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taking over of the Church and General Insurance Co. Ltd. will give them <Col N="1065" /> the required additional scope.  As the Minister has said, the 1938 charter of Irish Life has to be amended.  Their merger with Church and General fulfils the need for an expansive role affording greater scope.  Church and General are a very successful operation, even though non-life areas account for 4 per cent only of their market.  They are in direct competition with something in the region of 30 other companies.  They have been enormously successful, their business has grown steadily, their premiums having doubled in 1980 alone.</P>
    <P>This Bill advocates the introduction of the technical changes necessary in the charter in order to enable Irish Life, by the taking over of Church and General, to diversify into those multi-areas of insurance.  Like the previous speaker, I welcome sections 2 and 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make the observation, previously made by the Minister and by Senators Hillery and Higgins, that the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited have played an enormous role in Irish life generally.  We all accept that.  We know that they performed a worthwhile rescue operation in the thirties.  Their role to date has been excellent.  They continued as an industrial branch insurance company and made a very important contribution by taking on the small death policies which enabled many of our poor people to be buried. Recently they widened out considerably indeed in the ordinary branch insurance. Certainly they are stealing the cream of Irish business in the assurance field generally. They have much competition to meet and will have competition in the future.  The Irish Life record is excellent. They should be complimented and nobody in this House could have a bad word to say about them.  In 1980 they had assets of over £700 million.  Church and General, on the other hand, have been a conservative rather small company who did not want growth for some reason. The concentrated their activities on the insurance of the clergy and various convents and schools.  That had been their type of business but recently they expanded and competed very well with <Col N="1066" /> all of the other insurance companies. Indeed, their household insurance policy is reckoned to be one of the best on the market.  They were excellent in the liability field, in employers' liability and in public liability which for some reason of which many people will be aware, has gone somewhat sour.  Therefore, they have curtailed their activities in the liability field.  They also transact motor insurance on a small scale, preferring to accept the parish priest, the reverend mother, the solid, gilt-edged risk which, hopefully, will not produce a claim.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we have now a marriage of Irish Life and Church and General, a marriage of church and State.  Many of the insuring public will see this as the miracle for which they had hoped.  We know the state of insurance in Ireland, the plight of the young driver trying to get insurance, the huge premium he must pay.  Often he pays more for his insurance premium than he paid for his car.  We know how difficult it is for the disabled driver to have his car insured.  We know that in industry in the liability field, in heavy employers' liability and heavy public liability there are huge premiums and great difficulty is encountered in getting the risk placed at all.</P>
      <P>Is this the answer to all our prayers?  Is this what the insuring public have been waiting for for years?  Here we have an Irish company, a State company in which the Minister owns 90 per cent of the shares, with assets of £700 million, now entering the general branch field.  We are entitled to ask if all the problems of insurance are over.  Will this new subsidiary of Irish Life now get involved and take the young driver?  Will they take the heavy public liability risks?  Will they compete openly and fairly and take as much of the market as is offered to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins said he was glad that Irish Life rather than some other body took over the shares of Church and General. That is a fair comment which he is entitled to make.  I know that that was a reference to PMPA.  Certainly people can criticise the PMPA.  People may say that they have branched far away from what they were set up to do.  But in fairness to <Col N="1067" /> them we have to say that they are accepting the risks.  A 19-year-old driver or a person who may have had a small claim in the past can go to PMPA and they will give him a quotation, and that cannot be said of the other insurance companies, certainly not to the same extent.  So I am asking the question: is this State-owned company, with assets of £700 million, the answer to all the ills?  I hope it is.</P>
    <P>I wish also to make the point that of late Church and General did extend their field and advertised on television saying in regard to their range of risks that one should see one's insurance broker.  But their business has been built up over the years &mdash; and I am not criticising them &mdash; through their own arrangements with the reverend mother and the parish priest and so on.  But of late they have approached the insurance broker.  When they wanted to build up their income, they went into the commercial insurance field.  I hope we will now see a massive extension of this, that the insurance broker, as far as Church and General and Irish Life are concerned, will deal with legitimate insurance intermediaries only. That would be of importance and something that I and most people dealing in insurance would welcome.  I hope that as a result of this alteration Church and General will get involved in all classes of non-life assurance including bonds which were mentioned in regard to the tour operators Bill.  Bonding is an area which was mentioned freely last week in this House.  Hopefully for tour operators, and for all of the other areas of insurance, Church and General will open their doors and will operate in a very open way for the insuring public.  I hope that this Bill will be seen as important to the insuring public because I believe that the State has a clear responsibility to that section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  I have followed with great satisfaction the progress of Irish Life since its inception.  Indeed, I recall that the 1938 legislation and the Banking Commission Report represented the deep water into which I was plunged as <Col N="1068" /> a young man entering the Department of Finance in 1938.  However, enough of nostalgia.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything about the merger of Church and General with Irish Life because I had a part in it indirectly. But I was interested to hear Senator Fallon refer to it as a marriage of church and State.  I cannot refrain from expressing some doubt as to whether the offspring will be as miraculous as Senator Fallon was praying for a moment ago.</P>
      <P>My intervention is really to seek further explanation from the Minister as to why there was a principle up to now &mdash; and still is in the EEC &mdash; of separating life and non-life business.  He said in his opening statement that up to now &mdash; and of course that is the reason for section 1 of this Bill &mdash; Irish insurance law prevented a company from undertaking both categories of business.  He also said that this separation has been established as the norm in the first EEC life assurance directive.  There must be a good reason for this.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what the basic reason is.  I suspect it has something to do with trying to prevent possible losses on non-life business from damaging the life funds and therefore the capacity of a life insurance company to honour the terms of its life policies. If that is the case, then perhaps he would tell us whether in fact operating through a subsidiary enables the life company to separate itself sufficiently from any such contamination of losses in the subsidiary company.  Very often, as the Minister knows, parent companies have to guarantee the viability of subsidiaries and I wonder if that will be precluded in relation to insurance companies.  If that question were answered perhaps it might help to solve some of Senator Hillery's difficulties about section 1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few things I would like to say.  I welcome the Bill.  I wonder if a bonding system for insurance brokers could be established because it seems that it is not until something happens that one finds out whether one is insured or not.  One of the major problems that one has, whether it be in the life insurance field or the general <Col N="1069" /> insurance field, is that one takes advice from somebody.  Whether one takes it directly from an insurance company or from a broker the unfortunate point about it is that one pays one's money and one takes one's chance but one does not know until the fire or the death occurs whether one is under-insured or overinsured.</P>
      <P>It is a common occurrence for a robbery to take place in a household and for the person claiming from the insurance company to find that because of inflation he is totally under-insured and cannot recover the value of the goods stolen. The same can happen in the case of a fire.  Unfortunately, most people are in the hands of the insurance broker.  Is there any intention of bringing in a bonding system for insurance brokers?</P>
      <P>Life insurance is the biggest quagmire that anybody can get involved in.  Again, there is hardly a person in Ireland who does not have somebody knocking on his door at least once a month selling life insurance of some description and each of them seems to have an advantage.  But it is impossible for a layman to find out where the advantage lies because figures can be produced by life insurance companies that are true for a particular age group or a particular period of time. There is no way that a layman can go through the quagmire of life insurance.</P>
      <P>On the question of the increase on the export credit insurance from £100 million to £300 million I wonder is this figure enough since we are in competition with exporters from EMS countries and also from Britain.  A company based both in England and Ireland has an advantage over the company which is only based in Ireland.  If it has an export credit in England of £10,000 sterling it has a distinct advantage over the company based in Ireland with only £10,000 of export credit in punts.  Is there any way that an arrangement could be made in the EEC to allow for standardisation of export creditable allowances because when it comes to exports, our exporters are at a distinct disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> international companies? With those comments, in general I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to address myself briefly to the Bill and to welcome the Minister to this Chamber this afternoon. I also welcome this Bill.  I would like to associate myself with the compliments that have been paid to Irish Life. The foresight displayed within the Department of Finance in coming to the rescue of the various companies that were in difficulty around 1938 has been one of the more enlightened aspects of public life here which led to a very fruitful merger at that time.  It is a very successful aspect of the Irish insurance market, with consequent benefits of investment in industry and so on here.  It is pleasing to be able for a change to pay this type of compliment in this era of considerable gloom.</P>
      <P>This take-over of the Church and General Insurance Company, this merger of church and State, as it was called by other Senators, would appear to have connotations for the Attorney General, in his present review of the Constitution, perhaps recommending to the Government that there should be a re-introduction of that Article of the Constitution which recognises the special place of the Churches in this country.  So, we are starting an interesting debate when we talk about this merger.  Of course, apart from that, it is obviously very sensible and I approve of it absolutely.</P>
      <P>The take-over in question need not have any connotations in so far as mergers or monopolies in those areas in which the Minister has discretion to play a role in another sense are concerned.  I understand that the Church and General Insurance Company have only about 4 per cent of the non-life market here.  Taking into account that Irish Life are not in that area to start with, this amalgamation simply leads to the amalgamated company having only 4 per cent of the non-life market in a part of the service sector in which they are competing with about 30 other companies.  So there is no question of it being undesirable in the context of the undesirable side of monopolies or mergers or what might happen in that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me move on from this issue of Irish Life, and the necessary amending of legislation <Col N="1071" /> to get over that problem, to the two other sections which are contained within this Bill and to which limited reference has been made.  The section in regard to export credit insurance is obviously necessary.  The fact that the Insurance Act, 1953, enabled the Minister to give guarantees with respect to insurance risks in connection with exports at a level of about £2 million is an indication of the extent of exports then, whereas the present actual level is running at about £70 million.  Under present legislation £100 million is the limit and it is expected that that will be exceeded very soon.  The very necessity to increase this limit from £100 million to £300 million is an indication of the continuing underlying strength of exports here.  This section is welcome for these reasons.</P>
    <P>To a degree, the critics of our membership of the Community tend to overlook the intangible benefits which have come to us through our membership of the EEC.  There is a tendency to look at the tangible money and the extent to which countries are net beneficiaries or otherwise in so far as the Community is concerned.  There is a tendency in some circles to measure Ireland's benefits in the hard terms of the number of pounds we get in a given 12 months.  We tend to forget the intangibles.  This export credit Bill, for example, points to the incredible intangible there is in having duty free access to a market of 200 million through Europe.  It is not illustrated in terms of what we get in pounds from the EEC each year, but the underlying investment inherent in this and the attractiveness of this country as a location for industry to the Americans and the Japanese and others in continental Europe is of huge and incalculable benefit to this country and is illustrated by the dimensions of exports from this country in this particular section.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer very briefly to the third section, the European Investment Bank, and the legal anomaly that has made this section of the Bill necessary.  I am particularly glad that it is contained within this Bill because it gives me an <Col N="1072" /> opportunity as a legislator to speak very briefly about the European Investment Bank.  Again, it is in this same area of exports and export credits and again it is one of these intangible benefits from European Economic Community membership which I do not think is sufficiently appreciated here.  Our banking system has, of course, been under pressure in an under-developed country in which there have been massive demands for capital investment in infrastructure, in agriculture, in industry, in the service sector, in the medical and social fields and these constraints have led to certain difficulties. Since we joined the EEC these constraints have been reduced tremendously because membership of the Community and the access of this country to funds within the European Investment Bank have led to this enormous injection of capital funds into this country in very acceptable circumstances and has led to major developments.  The dimensions are significant.  We are talking about capital investment by the European Investment Bank here since we joined the Community running to about £240 million which I understand is proportionately higher than that in any other member state.  It is a very considerable complement.  We are talking about long-term funds over ten or 12 years and of 15 years in the case of loans to Bord na Móna for turf development, coming in at interest rates from about 10 to 13 per cent which are extremely favourable interest rates for long-term investment, building up the infrastructure, the energy sector, the agricultural and industrial sectors of this country.  Part of that package, of which I am personally aware, is the very significant extent of loans of about £90 million to the Industrial Credit Company since 1978.</P>
    <P>For these reasons if there is this legal anomaly in so far as the guaranteeing of loans from the European Investment Bank is concerned, I am particularly pleased to assist the Minister in getting over it to ensure the continuing development of this country through this very welcome source of funds for which we are indebted to the European Investment Bank.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this Bill. As mentioned earlier, Irish Life are certainly a success story in a field where many other companies have been anything but successful.  This company were set up in a very difficult period in the history of the State, under fairly difficult conditions, to take over from small groups who had problems.  The Church and General were selective in their business, interested only in fairly safe bets.  It is important that a subsidiary like that is setting up at the present time.  Since our entry into the EEC some very large insurance and assurance companies have entered the market here and therefore it is important for us to have a strong home-based subsidiary to counter them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that it is intended to amend and update our insurance legislation. It is important to do this.  The question of the very high rates quoted to young drivers for insurance was mentioned. In many cases it is tantamount to refusing them insurance.  I hope that if this subsidiary is fully developed it will enter into such areas of insurance because in an area such as motor insurance for which rates are still increasing substantially year by year it is very important to inject a measure of competitiveness in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The increase in limits was referred to. It was certainly interesting when it was increased to £100 million.  It may seem excessive to increase that limit up to £300 million, but it is to be welcomed.  I hope that the progress that those two companies have made to date will continue.</P>

      <P>I have no strong objection to that.  I did not anticipate that it would be sought.  I will have to see what the position is in regard to availability.  It may in fact turn out to be more than a week. However, I do not think we can object to a request for an interval.</P>
      <P>Both Senator Hillery and Senator Higgins referred to the success of the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited. One of the important dimensions of their new operation in their acquisition of the controlling interest in the Church and General company is that Church and General have a very strong Continent-based element.  Twenty per cent of that company is owned by the L'Assurance Genérale in France which is a very powerful and well connected group there. The view of the Irish Life company is that this contact will give them a foothold on the Continent and enable them to do that which continental companies are seeking to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the implications of the European Economic Community always was &mdash; it is only now beginning to bite &mdash; the free movement of services as well as the free movement of goods, and Irish insurance companies are now facing much stiffer competition on their own soil from foreign-based companies than was formerly the case.  I have been inquiring as to whether they cannot retaliate because there is no use in wringing our hands and whingeing about competition on our doorstep being intensified.  The whole purpose of the Common Market is to give us the very same opportunity to get out and put our foot in the doorsteps of the householders of western Europe.  I have had not entirely happy replies in regard to the degree which Irish companies are doing that.  I think some of them, because it is a territory which literally, geographically and linguistically is unfamiliar to them, in which management techniques and so on would require to be learned from the ground up, have not been as adventurous as some of the foreign companies have been in establishing a foothold here.  I hope that will change because, needless to say, premium income earned by an Irish company abroad is just the very same from the <Col N="1075" /> point of view of promoting national wealth as the export of manufactured goods.  We can perceive here an area in which what appears to be a chronic trade gap, in the strict sense of the word, can be closed with help.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon made an interesting speech.  He appeared to be willing to wound but afraid to strike, or perhaps it was the other way round.  He did not put into words what I suspect is in the back of his mind.  I would like to drag out from under the table and place on the table what I think is the subject in his mind and to say a few frank words about it.  He adverted to the fact that Church and General are in motor business, even if still only in a small way, and that Church and General since they are now moving into the control of two removes of the State should accept a certain responsibility to the people in as much as the people are their owners.  I hope I am not doing the Senator an injustice in paraphrasing his ideas in this way.  If I am I will certainly yield to him if he would like to correct me.  I think he meant &mdash; and I hope he did not literally mean this &mdash; that the Church and General end of this insurance complex, simply because they were incapable, if only at two removes, of being described as a State body, should now regard themselves as under some obligation to provide a social service in the field of insurance by taking on risks which ordinary commercial companies would not take on.  I am not the Minister who owns the 90 per cent of the shares in Irish Life and I am not in a position to give orders even though I am responsible for insurance, but I would not expect to see the subsidiary of Irish Life run on any criteria except the same commercial criteria which have brought Irish Life to such a measure of success, as every Senator here has acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Though I fully acknowledge, understand and sympathise with the difficulties of young drivers, what is not understood about motor insurance is the nature of the thing.  The nature of motor insurance is that it relieves you of the civil liability which otherwise rests squarely on your shoulders and rests on your shoulders to <Col N="1076" /> the last penny in your pocket, to the extent that your house and everything else can be taken from you to satisfy a liability which you may have incurred by your carelessness if you cause a severe injury or damage of that scale.  People do not realise &mdash; perhaps young people least of all and it is very understandable if they do not &mdash; that when they take a vehicle on the road they are doing something which if they are careful will not cause any harm to anybody but which if it does cause serious injury will involve them in a gigantic degree of civil liability running into, depending on the injury, hundreds of thousands of pounds.  The effect of motor insurance is to free them of that liability.  It will not free them of criminal liability, naturally, if there was a criminal element in their driving.  It will free them of civil liability and there is no use obscuring the fact that that is an enormously valuable amenity.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator Fallon did not speak in any way in a polemical tone and I do not mean to reply to him in that tone.  He is an expert on the subject and it is quite obvious that he knows, and is in the way of knowing, far more about it than most Members of the House.  It is a service which is so valuable that it is just not reasonable to speak about it as though the cost of it should be something which one should not feel.  Having said that I repeat that I have every sympathy with the situation of the driver against whom insurance companies for commercial reasons, because actuarially or statistically they belong to a high risk category in the company's experience, find it difficult to get themselves insured.  What is the alternative?  The alternative is either to provide in some shape or form a subsidised insurance for them which means that their insurance premiums will be carried by their neighbours, or else to keep them off the roads altogether. There is no third option that I can see. You simply cannot direct the company, whether it is partly State-owned or not, to accept risks at a level which it knows are going to be loss-making, because if that is borne out by events, it means that those losses are going to be carried by the <Col N="1077" /> other policy holders.  This is not the first time I have expressed that opinion.</P>
    <P>I had never heard Senator Fallon speak before.  I was very interested in his speech and I hope that we may meet again to discuss the matter.  I was going to suggest to him, because his views on this subject are so interesting and so well-informed, that he might offer to meet the newly formed committee on motor insurance premiums which I set up ten days ago.  I am not sure exactly what their pattern of work is.  Very shortly they will begin to invite representations and to get the best possible advice and views. I am certain that Senator Fallon's experience and opinions would be of interest and value to them.</P>
    <P>It is possible that what I have been saying is, in some degree, misguided and I am perfectly willing to accept correction from the committee, or an individual who knows more about it than I do.  I really hope that Senator Fallon and anybody else who can contribute to an improvement in the situation without breaching the commercial considerations under which companies must be allowed to operate, and without burdening us with a further financial millstone which would be subject to all kinds of political pressure, will come forward and give the benefit of their advice to the committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker asked why there was a principle, as I said in opening, that the same company could not carry on both life and non-life business.  This principle appeared to have become the norm in the European dimension.  I must admit that I could not see the reason either and I asked the gentlemen in my Department if they could explain the reason to me. Senator Whitaker, with his experience and his flair for these matters of course, by instinct put his finger on the reason, which is the correct reason.  The separation of life from non-life business in individual companies is actually enshrined not in the 1938 but in an even earlier Act, that of 1936.  The reason is that the policyholders on the life side will not be in any danger, or have any reason to suspect any danger of having their funds raided so to speak, to pay for unsuspected <Col N="1078" /> or unforeseen high losses arising in regard to risks on the non-life side.  I also asked, when being briefed about this, if it would not be possible to guard against this in some simpler way than not allowing the company concerned to get into the field at all.  The impression from the advice I received was that it might be possible all right and that in some countries, in fact, the same company is allowed to do both kinds of business but that two funds are maintained.  I have no strong feelings about it.  I had the very same puzzlement which Senator Whitaker expressed but it does not really arise as a snag at the moment because all we are doing here is in effect to remove the barrier so far as it concerns the acquisition by this largely State-owned company of a subsidiary engaged in non-life business.</P>
    <P>I ought not to have left the question of disabled drivers and insurance brokers. Since arriving in office I have, in fact, made representations to the standing committee of the joint committee which the insurance companies operate and asked them to delete, wherever possible, the kind of loadings which they applied formerly to disabled drivers and I have succeeded.  It was very largely with the help and encouragement of the Department that we have succeeded in getting the companies to agree to remove these loadings against disabled drivers who have a clear no-claims record, provided that their disability is not of a progressive nature.  That, unhappily, is not always the case.  Unfortunately, many disabilities are progressive.  The fact that an individual is fit to be accepted, in this sense of a physical risk, in one year unhappily does not necessarily mean that he or she will be the same kind of risk five years hence.  What I have just told the House is not to be taken as meaning that all loading against accident-free disabled drivers is gone.  That is not the case. If the disability is a progressive one, unfortunately, the companies understandably cannot offer that facility.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance brokers was raised by Senator Lanigan who asked whether there was any intention of requiring them to be bonded.  My understanding <Col N="1079" /> is that a huge majority of insurance brokers are absolutely reputable. At the same time, I did advert in my opening speech to a larger insurance Bill which is in course of preparation as fast as the resources of my Department can get it ready.  They are doing many other things simultaneously.  In the context of this larger Bill, I certainly will be looking at the question of taking powers in the field of insurance intermediaries.  I certainly will not do that, I can assure Senator Fallon and any other interested Senators, without consultation with the interests involved.  I have no intention of setting up any apparatus of unnecessary, superfluous, or merely busybody control. It is an area however in which we will be thinking about some form of control, not necessarily that which Senator Lanigan was advocating, but some sort of control.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanuton mentioned the legal anomaly which we are removing in regard to the involvement of Irish banks in guaranteeing loans from the European Investment Bank.  It would be simplest if I explained the nature of that anomaly when I come to deal with that part of the section on Committee Stage.  Senator Leonard mentioned the motor insurance business of the Church and General Insurance Company.  It is true that it is a small part of the total motor business of the State but in the last two years I understand their motor business has roughly doubled in volume.  That, of course, is attributable in part to the regrettable rise in the cost of insurance premiums and also to an absolute rise in the volume of the business which they have been doing. I hope that I have dealt, more or less, with the main points which took the form of questions raised by Members of the House and that they will agree a Second Reading for this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  This is my first opportunity to welcome him in this session. The events arising from his time in Opposition and as a Minister of Government will show that we can expect very serious legislation on his part.  I look forward to coming in here and contributing to it.</P>
      <P>When the Consumer Protection Bill was dealt with in this House it received an all round welcome.  Very little objection to it was voiced in the course of the contributions.  The position is that we have the same welcome for this Bill up to this point.  There was a slight difference in the contributions but, by and large, they were appreciative of the fact that consumers must be protected and in agreement on the ways in which they can be protected.  The distinction that I would draw is that the unanimous welcome in the case of the Consumer Protection Bill was based on the belief that such protection was a total and absolute necessity. People were continually being promised, in return for cash, certain things which in many cases did not exist and, if they did exist, the quantity or quality was, in fact, suspect.  Consequently, a great deal of discussion and consideration was necessary on the question of consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The denial of consumers' rights must be taken very seriously, indeed.  I make no apologies for what I am about to say. If people had not been cheated and if the responsibilities of the relevant organisations <Col N="1081" /> had been exercised with more stringent application and more diligence, I doubt if this Bill would need to be before the House today.  It is a bad thing to be cheated, particularly out of something for which people have scraped, planned and looked forward to in advance.  People looked forward to a holiday, placed their faith in glossy brochures, believing that the retail outlets they were dealing with were financially secure, and they were bitterly disappointed.</P>
    <P>Many may say that &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; is too strong a word to use.  What else is it?  If a company know that their finances are in a bad state, that their credibility abroad is not the best, and take money from people, promising them a service which cannot be delivered, how else could you describe it?  It must be described as cheating.  It is a problem enough that hard-earned money is taken from people by stealth, but even worse when it is unlikely that reimbursement will be ever a reality.  I make no apologies for the strong words.  In the case of Bray Travel there was no innocence at all.  Let us not put any cap or cloak on it.  The evidence is there that the Bray Travel agents were negligent and must have known the state of their finances.  Yet they took money from people, promising them a service that did not or could not exist, because of the state of their finances and their creditability which they knew in advance would come to a halt at some stage.</P>
    <P>People can have redress through the Consumer Protection Association or the Director of Consumer Affairs but it is somewhat disturbing that people in this case cannot, in fact, be reimbursed. There may be some constitutional problem in regard to reimbursing people retrospectively. I look forward to what the Minister will say in this respect.</P>
    <P>If we were to put the thing in reverse, where a client who had suffered a loss decided to break into the premises of the people he considered had cheated him out of his money, to try to offset his losses by getting property of some value from their premises, and in the process was caught, he would be charged and probably <Col N="1082" /> convicted.  I am not getting into an argument about the seventh Commandment, or whether it would be cheating or stealing, but if people know that you have been saving money, and they know that their credibility and their finances are vanishing and that, inevitably, somebody will suffer, it is the same as stealing.  As far as I am concerned, they have cheated another citizen.  Whether you can go so far as to say that they have stolen from another citizen is another matter.  The question posed is, when does cheating become stealing?</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to make it clear that I am not laying blame on the tour trade as a whole.  Many tour operators and retail outlets have exceptionally good records, provide a very good service and have a direct concern.  However, the ITAA and the Tour Operators' Council did not take sufficient measures to monitor the actions of the members affiliated to them, or part of their structure, or with whom they were functioning and the whole trade has been slighted by the behaviour of a few of them.  If it was opportune for them to take the necessary precautions and they did not do so, then the charge of irresponsibility must be laid at the door of those two organisations.</P>
    <P>Successive Government Ministers have urged travel agents and tour operators to build up a higher level of self-sufficiency in their own interests and in the interests of the public whom they serve.  Had they heeded and implemented the advice given by the previous and present Ministers for Transport, the collapse of Bray Travel in 1980 and many other setbacks would not have happened.</P>
    <P>I say this as somebody who works on side structures and who has to accept responsibility when things go wrong at various levels.  The people in the business of tour operating are not fools.  They are highly intelligent people who are operating a business to make a profit.  In the course of that operation they must have known, suspected or had some indication that many high risks were being taken by some chance operations.  It was in their midst and they did not take the appropriate action: consequently in this respect they have been irresponsible.  I noted in <Col N="1083" /> the papers recently that some efforts have been made to try to protect people for the coming season because the legislation will not yet be there to protect them.  I am delighted to see that.  Even though it came late, better late than never.  If chance operators had been investigated more effectively, the slight on the trade could have been avoided.  The protection of clients must be to the forefront.  It is the tour operators' job to make them secure. They did not do so in the past.  It is a pity that the legislation had to come because it was their responsibility.  If a trade union takes to the street in an unofficial strike people scream about irresponsibility. However, if somebody deliberately induces people into a false situation then that is not condemned.  I make no apologies for condemning that kind of action as irresponsible and hope that a lesson will be learned for the future.</P>
    <P>There will be other problems and it is up to those two organisations to watch them from here on and not throw them back on to the Legislature when they get into serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Second Reading speech indicates that he is going as far as is possible.  It is regrettable that the thing happened and I am not looking forward to another situation like that.  It must be put on the record and people must clearly understand that, whoever else wants to accept excuses from an organisation or from a set-up for allowing this type of thing to happen, they will not get any sympathy from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Consumer protection is something which needs regular review, when dealing with the whole question of a sophisticated market place.  It is even more necessary when no real sophistication exists, because therein lies a great deal of inefficiency. In the Bray Travel case, we had the lovely, glossy brochures set out in a seductive way.  It is a great temptation to ordinary people who have to save up, week by week, for a holiday and induces many of them to buy compulsively.  They are struggling, in many cases, to get hold of money so that they can avail of the service which will give them some form of relaxation after a strenuous year.  Possibly <Col N="1084" /> they could afford a holiday only every three years.  It is very serious to set out in a deliberate way to produce designs, glossy brochures, a very attractive background and claim to have a service that does not in fact exist.  We will have to consider, on the next occasion, where travel agents and tour operators fit into the question of consumer protection.  The least we owe the unfortunate people involved in this situation are proper ethical standards.  Of a society which claims to be just and honest, and which claims that fair competition is the solution to all our problems the least we can demand is proper ethical standards.  On behalf of the people for whom I speak, the ordinary working-class people, I am demanding that the ITAA, the tour operators and so on see to it that in future their operations will be run in a much more efficient manner in the interests of the people whom they claim to represent.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill and I wonder if at this stage it is needed quite as much as we are led to believe because of things that happened. Certain sections of IATA and the Travel Agents Association have themselves done things in a very businesslike fashion.  The wrong impression may be given to the House and I should like to clear it up.

There is quite a screening now&mdash;that may not have been so in past years&mdash;of an agent's financial base by a properly trained staff in the office of IATA.  I seldom disagree with my colleagues on the other side of the House but Senator Harte is not quite <Col N="1085" /> up-to-date in regard to the association members, but there ends our disagreement. They all accept that licensing must come and they are quite happy about it.</P>
    <P>There may be a feeling that bonding may not now be required in the retail or the travel agency side because since the summer of 1981 they have collected £80,000, and by January 1982, I understand, they will have an account of up to £120,000 in a fund to bond or to cover any type of small disaster which might occur.</P>
    <P>A point I should like the Minister to clear up for me is whether the tour operator can put the cost of the bonding on to his charges.  The travel agent cannot because of keen competition.  I understand that the tour operator is bonded already with the agreement and acceptance of the Department, something I was not aware of and something to which I do not think anybody has made reference in this House.  The Minister might explain that point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also tell us the extent of the cost we are talking about in bonding the large tour operators and the small travel agents.  I get the impression that we seem to legislate all the time in this small nation of ours for the big man. I should like the Minister to know that there are still small men who are very important but who, because of the cost of bonding, may have to opt out.  I hope the Minister took my earlier remarks in good grace because I think we are good friends here, I think this House is magnificent and I do not intend to move to other places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very full debate on this Bill.  There are, however a number of specific points we can deal with on Committee Stage.  I join with other Senators in their welcome for the Bill.  The measures which are incorporated are long overdue and the Bill's introduction should not have awaited the collapse of various companies with the attendant hardship for those involved, the very bad publicity which the collapses caused, and the bad publicity which attached to sections of the travel industry which are impeccable and blameless. <Col N="1086" /> That publicity, by association, implicated the very many well-run and solvent operators in the business of the holiday industry. It is a pity it took all of those calamities to make the Bill necessary.</P>
      <P>From conversations I have had with people in the tourism industry, the travel business, I know that this Bill is welcome, even though there are certain areas where changes might be made.  In one sense it is a pity that the State once again has to enter into this area of regulation. I may be saying this from a slightly philosophical or ideological point of view, but we have reached a point when we should be examining carefully all areas of the economy to find areas where, perhaps, we could cut the amount of State involvement, perhaps to find areas where the State might withdraw and areas which could best be left to self-regulation or private enterprise.  However, in this case it is necessary for the State to become involved and regulation is patently needed.  If the State had not moved in to take this action I believe we would be leaving one large section of consumers in an extremely vulnerable position, and it is largely as consumer legislation that I see this Bill.</P>
      <P>The broad philosophy of the Bill gets the priorities right.  The emphasis on consumer protection is extremely welcome. Our consumers are probably the worst protected in any European country.  This, in part, is our own fault, our natural politeness, our deference, our timidity, the fact that we do not complain when we get bad service: we do not complain enough in restaurants; we do not complain when we get shoddy service in shops or elsewhere when we are paying for services.  We do not complain on occasions when public service, whatever form it takes, is not up to the required standards. We do not have the strong sense of consumer awareness which exists in other countries.  It may be growing here but it could grow a lot more quickly.  The public stands in need of some form of adequate consumer protection legislation and I hope it will be a priority of this Government to see that consumer protection is given where it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will take steps <Col N="1087" /> to see that the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will be strengthened. At present the powers given to the director leave him a toothless watchdog.  I am not referring to the director personally; he is extremely competent and hardworking and a personal friend of mine.  He is not a toothless watchdog: he is trying very hard, but the powers given to that office are far from adequate and I hope we will see a strengthening of this in the lifetime of this administration.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the contents of the Bill that there has been very full consultation with the travel trade.  The trade members to whom I have spoken appreciate the way in which the Minister and his officials have gone about this process of consultation. The Minister, with his usual courtesy, has listened to all points of view expressed and I know that he will continue to listen to the proposals for change which will follow on Committee Stage. Broadly, the legislation is appropriate to the needs of the present time.</P>
    <P>Coming as it does in a time of grave crisis for the travel and tourist industry I feel the introduction of the Bill should help to focus our minds on some of the ills in this, one of our major industries. The Second Stage debate is not the time to do that, but it is clear that this country is no longer the attractive proposition it once was for the foreign tourist.  After the very heavy direct progress of the sixties when Bord Fáilte's advertising, among others created an awareness of Ireland as a quality product on the tourist market, when the advertising matched the product which was being offered here, in recent times there has been a falling off in enthusiasm, the momentum, to a large extent, has been lost in this trade.  The reason is very obvious.  There is the increasing expense of getting here, our prices are a major factor, especially now, and it is relevant to this Bill, when holidays are offered in Florida, the US, where prices were lower, where the cost of getting there is not great, that it will be very difficult for people in the industry here to compete.  There are factors like bad service, the occasional rip-off merchants in the business.  For these and <Col N="1088" /> many other reasons, the travel and tourism business is facing the most serious crisis in the 30 or 40 years since it became a major industry.  Therefore it is appropriate that this Bill is coming at this stage to help to restore confidence in the industry. I hope for a great improvement in the marketing of Ireland abroad, for perhaps more care in finding out what tourist target we are trying to attract.  These are separate matters for another debate.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas in the Bill where I find myself in agreement with my old friend, Senator Hillery, and my new friend, Senator Honan.  I refer especially to section 6, the section dealing with bonding of operators.  There may well be a case for different types of bonding, and I shall come back to it on Committee Stage.  I agree with Senator Honan that more care must be taken to ensure that the small bona fide operator is not discriminated against by virtue of legislation which caters largely for the major operators. I am sure this will be discussed further on Committee Stage.  This is a good Bill, I look forward to Committee Stage when we can perhaps reach perfection on this measure.</P>
    <P>Overall, this Bill will meet the criteria which the Minister says it will.  The licensing and bonding elements certainly will impose rigour and discipline where they are needed.  Obviously no legislation can prevent all future failures, but these bonding and licensing sections will do a lot to prevent future failures.  The vetting arrangements for new members are very welcome.  I would stress, as everybody else has, that the overwhelming majority of those engaged in the travel and tourist trade are bona fide established companies, trading honestly.  In the present circumstances it is possible for a fly-by-night operator to set up business without the public knowing the shakiness of the operation, with consequences which can be very painful for the unsuspecting and unprotected consumer.  The vetting arrangements should ensure that high standards will be imposed and maintained, and the bonding arrangements will ensure there will be adequate capital reserves for those operating in the business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> Broadly, they are the main outlines and philosophy of the Bill.  The general thrust of the Bill is to be welcomed.  It has come at an appropriate time.  It is a pity that so many people had to suffer to make this type of legislation a priority. Nevertheless, even with those qualifying remarks, it is very worthwhile legislation and I hope it will be given a speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators who have spoken in the general welcome which has been given to the Bill.  There is no doubt that members of the travelling public should be protected or indemnified against any losses they might incur because of the failure of tour operators or travel agents to meet what the Bill describes as their financial or contractual obligations.  At the same time, we must distinguish between the large tour operator and the ordinary retail travel agent.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill propose that it will be illegal for a person to carry on business as a tour operator or travel agent without a licence.  If, however, there is to be a fee for such a licence it would be unrealistic to expect that a travel agent operating a small business in a country town should be expected to pay the same licence fee as a tour operator with a turnover possibly of millions of pounds.  I would also question whether the necessity for bonding should arise in the case of retail travel agents who are members of the Irish Travel Agents Association, as has been pointed out by Senator Honan.  These people have established their own fund of more than £80,000 to idemnify the public against any losses they might incur as a result of the default or financial failure of any member of the Retail Council of the Irish Travel Agents Association.  If this fund was increased and maintained at such a level as might be determined by the Minister from time to time, the interests of the travelling public would be protected adequately and the need for bonding in the case of this section of the trade would be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Bill is an enabling one and that <Col N="1090" /> the application of its provisions to retailers is a matter to be discussed and decided in due course.  I agree with him also that the question of new entrants to the trade, or retailers who are not members of the Irish Travel Agents Association, is a matter which needs to be considered carefully. As the Minister said, there is no ban on entry to the trade at present and there are no criteria or qualifications which new entrants have to meet.  However, I would not wish to see conditions governing entry into the travel business becoming so restrictive that the trade, in effect, will become a closed shop.  I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that this will not be allowed to happen. In general, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill, which is overdue.  As Senator Manning has said, it contains a thurst which must be welcomed having regard to all the tribulations of the travel business, particularly over the last 12 months, including the Bray Travel episode and others which may not have got so much publicity.  I am a little disturbed &mdash; and it is probably due to lack of understanding of some of the clauses &mdash; to note the substantial emphasis running through the Bill on overseas travel.  I appreciate fully that this is an area where we must have special regulations, precautions and so on because, as Senator Harte said, people who struggle over the years to collect a couple of hundred quid and then invest it in a holiday overseas need more protection than the person who might be taking a holiday at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be borne in mind &mdash; and I may have missed this point somewhere in the proposed legislation &mdash; that we have a substantial number of people enjoying holidays here in Ireland who would want to continue that, and indeed there are many of us who would wish to promote more and more holidays at home.  There are those who save for that type of holiday and who are subject to the same type of restrictions on their incomes as the person travelling out of the country would be.  If they were stranded in Donegal, Kerry or somewhere else, equally they might have difficulty in getting <Col N="1091" /> home, particularly if they had a couple of children and they were not able to meet any additional costs arising from the failure of a travel agent or a tour operator to look after them properly.  I should like the Minister to make some comment on that point.  Is there any way in which the individual taking a holiday here in Ireland can have equal protection against the failure or weakness of a travel agent or a tour operator to discharge his responsibility to that person or to that family?</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the licence and the conditions which will obtain.  I appreciate that it is very difficult initially, especially with new legislation, to dot all the i's and cross all the t's and that the consultations which were referred to by the Minister will be necessary with those involved before he can clear his own mind as to the general level of conditions he will outline before licences can be granted.  I would hate to see any discriminatory developments.  It is important that in the issuing of licences the licence would have regard to the area of activity of the individual concerned, the tour operator or the travel agent and that it would also contain some provision that if the tour operator or travel agent wished to branch into a broader area of activity the licence issued would not automatically cover that additional work or responsibility unless the Minister was satisfied in advance that that agent had the adequate means to take care of the additional responsibilities he or she might undertake during a particular year.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure from the proposed legislation whether the licences would be issued on an annual basis or on some other basis.  This might be determined by the size of the operation or by some other factors which we do not have in mind at this time.  When the Minister or his Department officials will be consulting with those who have knowledge of the industry I hope that an organisation like Bord Fáilte will be to the force in these consultations because they have special expert knowledge in this field and it would be very useful to consult with them as well as with practitioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> I will deal briefly with the appeals machinery through which the Minister may decide to revoke a licence for various reasons.  I notice that there is a right of appeal, and rightly so.  An individual may appeal to the High Court if he does not like the Minister's decision, and the High Court decision is final unless, on a point of law, when the Supreme Court could be utilised.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is excluded from the appeals area.  I can understand the reasons for that.  I hope that we will not get into a situation where there can be some type of overlapping or some messing between section 10 and section 8.  It will be very important to ensure that not alone will this legislation, when it comes into being, be seen to be fair but that we can be satisfied it will be as fair as it possibly can be at any time.  I may be reading this incorrectly, but section 10 states that &ldquo;Where, owing to the failure...&rdquo; and so on, an agent cannot do what he should do.  The word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; has a literal interpretation, a dictionary interpretation.  I can understand inability to mean you do not have the money.  You might not have the staff or the facility but I am wondering if there is a time factor which will determine how one interprets or defines &ldquo;failure.&rdquo; I am not saying that in a carping way but, knowing that there are cowboys in this business as in every other business, there may well be holes that they could find for themselves to get lost in until we get around to dealing with the problem, and in the interim many unfortunate innocent people not alone would have lost their holidays but may well have lost their hard earned savings.  I make these points in the hope of clarification on Committee Stage &mdash; that would be a more appropriate time to discuss them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their welcome for this Bill and their contributions to the debate.  I regret that I was not here to open the debate: I had a commitment abroad last week.  I have had the advantage of reading the record and listening to the debate so far today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill presented a certain amount of difficulty in its preparation.  The problem <Col N="1093" /> to be dealt with is a fairly new problem, but the way to deal with it turned out to be slightly more complex than one would have anticipated at first sight.  The first difficulty to be resolved was balancing the need to protect the consumer without at the same time imposing undue and contra-commercial restrictions on the trade.  I should like to think that the package we have constructed has been built carefully to achieve that end &mdash; to protect the consumer without imposing any undue restrictions on the trade.</P>
    <P>Many Senators made the point that they were generally alert to this dilemma that had to be resolved, and were appreciative of it and approved the methods set out in the Bill for resolving the problem. Many Senators made the point that they would be worried that the Bill might be unduly onerous where agents are concerned. I think it is a common case with everybody that the provisions as far as tour operators are concerned are desirable and urgently needed.  They wondered if the provisions so far as the agents are concerned are really necessary and altogether fair, if a blanket provision covering the entire business would be alotgether fair, bearing in mind the vast differences in the size of business conducted by agents in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I gave this point much consideration in advance of the Bill and came to the conclusion that we would not succeed in achieving our fundamental objective to protect the travelling public unless we include agents.  Because the Bill is essentially an enabling measure to be implemented by way of regulation, there will be power in the drafting of the regulations and room at that stage to make provisions for the particular difficulties of the travel agent.  I take Senator Manning's point that legislation by regulation is not altogether desirable but in this instance it would not be possible to have the details that will be in the regulations spelt out in the Bill.  Regulations give a certain amount of flexibility.  They will provide for changes to be notified to the House in due course.  They give more flexibility than if it was a question of amending legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> We have been careful at all times to consult with the Irish Travel Agents Association which represent the great majority of the people in the travel trade, both operators and agents.  I would like to place on record the assistance which the association have given to me and my officials in preparing this legislation.  I would like also to put on record their enthusiasm &mdash; it is hardly too strong a word &mdash; for the measure because the vast majority of the people in that trade are conducting the business properly.  They are people of integrity and are operating according to high commercial standards. They are as embarrassed as the rest of the population by the failures because those failures reflect discredit on the entire trade.  They are anxious to see an end to hardships arising from failures. The resulting contumely then adversely affects them and their image with the public.  They have been enthusiastic for this legislation, even realising that it will impose restrictions on them.  I had to devise a Bill that would have teeth but would not be draconian.  That principle has been accepted by the trade and I have had full co-operation in the drafting of it.</P>
    <P>Agents had to be included because if one excluded agents anybody could enter the travel trade, hire the necessary premises, design and print the necessary attractive brochures and start up in business. That is where many of the causes of the present difficulties lie.  There had to be a restriction on entry to the trade, and that restriction was applied to the retail side as represented by the agents, and the restriction will be imposed by virtue of the licensing arrangements.</P>
    <P>If the protection were to apply to the operators only, there would be the real danger that members of the public, knowing this, would by-pass the agents. If they were not included in the Bill, there would be a risk and they would deal with the operators.  This, of course, would be to the detriment of the agents.  It is in the agents' long-term interest that they should be included.  We will ensure in the regulations that measures to be applied to them will not interfere with their commercial viability or make it impossible for them to trade profitably.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Senator Hillery wondered if there could be different sorts of licences for the differing sorts of risk.  I do not think that would be feasible.  It could lead to bureaucratic complexity and a lot of extra paper work.  There will just have to be the one type of licence for both the operator and the agent.  The licence will ensure that proper persons &mdash; proper in the sense of their experience, their standing and their financial background &mdash; will come into the trade.  The actual protection thereafter will be the existence of the bond and the fund.  At that stage there may be some differences which would take account of the differing roles and the differing sizes of businesses being carried on by the various people in the trade. The size of the bond which will be sought eventually and, indeed, the nature of the bond, will be teased out.  Senators will notice the way a bond is defined in section 13 provides for a lot of flexibility when the regulations come to be drafted.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the criteria for entering into the trade, one prime requirement will be the financial standing and the financial organisation of the person seeking the licence.  That person will have sufficient capital to fund his operation and his financial procedures and his accounting methods will be adequate to stand up to the strain of running the business efficiently.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator Whitaker who raised the analogy with the banks.  The Central Bank, if I take his point correctly, had a certain discretion when the licensing was introduced originally to give people time to come up to the scratch mark set by the banks.  That is a point well taken and obviously it will be taken into account when the financial structure of a particular company has been submitted with an application for a licence with the last &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed and the last &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted, financially speaking.  If I am satisfied that they will be crossed and dotted in due course and that there is no danger in the interim, then there is no reason why a licence would not be granted to such a person.  As I say, a good financial base and a proper accounting system will be prime criteria before licences <Col N="1096" /> are issued.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery also expressed concern about the cost of administering the fund and though the cost should be limited to the interest-earning capacity of the fund I share his concern that we should not let any bureaucratic monster of great expense grow here.  Obviously we would not want to put a burden on the travel industry of having to pay a huge cost for administering the new system.  It will be one of my objectives to keep the procedures as simple as possible, subject to the constraints of making them effective.</P>
    <P>During the debate doubts were expressed by Senators about the availability of bonds and the desirability of ensuring that bonds could be procured at competitive rates.  I will preface my remarks on this topic by again drawing Senators' attention to the definition of a bond.  It need not necessarily be a bond in the traditional insurance company sense.  In most instances that is the form of bond that will be provided, but there is no particular requirement in the Bill to have it in that form.  As long as it meets the requirements of section 3, that is adequate.  In so far as most people will seek the traditional type of bond from a financial institution, more than likely an insurance company, my Department have been having consultations with the insurance industry and with the main banking groups about bonding.  At this stage I can say that I am confident that bonds along the lines required by the Bill will be available from Irish sources.  I do not think there is any danger that lack of competition in the field of providing bonds will lead to a sort of closed shop situation where unduly high premiums will be demanded.  In any event, under the EEC we would not be confined to having to accept bonds from Irish financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely raised the question of an operator using customers' money for other purposes and said there should be inspection powers to deal with this.  I agree, and there are powers of inspection. They are given in section 11 where, if necessary, auditors can be sent in to get a speedy statement of affairs.  In the case of any operator where suspicious circumstances <Col N="1097" /> were coming to light and where customers were having cause for worry and those worries were conveyed to me, there is that power of inspection.</P>
    <P>One matter which very understandably concerned many Senators was the position of the victims of the Bray Travel collapse.  Naturally I am very alive to the expectations of those people that this measure might have provided compensation for them, but it was not possible to make the compensation fund retrospective in its application.  The fund is to provide for cases which will arise in the future and, of course, the fund will be provided by the customer.  Payments into the fund are being made by the customer on the understanding that they will provide for future collapses, should those undesirable events take place.  My opinion, and I am so advised, is that it would be contrary to that understanding and to the implied trust which that understanding brings with it, that the fund should be applied retrospectively.  Indeed there might very well be constitutional problems if any attempt were made to apply the fund retrospectively, or if I were to seek to have some discretionary power to apply it retrospectively.</P>
    <P>They are the reasons why no specific provision is made in the Bill for those unfortunate victims of that collapse.  I am sympathetic to them.  The position is however, that their interests are now being attended to by the proceedings going through the courts, involving the winding up of the affairs of the company concerned and associated companies. When those proceedings are terminated one would expect, having regard to various offers made by one of the principals involved, that there will be funds to compensate the victims of the collapse.  It is only right that, following the collapse of a private commercial enterprise, compensation for private people should come from the normal sources.  It would be only when those sources were shown to be inadequate that one might consider in a case of suitable hardship that the State might possibly intervene.  I do not have to spell out to Senators the door that would be opened if interventions were to be made in this <Col N="1098" /> particular case.  I appreciate that there are certain circumstances about this case which perhaps take it out of the ordinary run of the mill.  I assure the victims of that debacle that they have not been forgotten. That there is no provision for them in this Bill is due to the nature of the protection being provided and to the fact that the court proceedings have not yet concluded.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the proposed protection fund will be collected from tour operators only, but that the resources of the fund can be applied both to the victims of an operator's collapse or an agent's collapse.  Some Senators have queried the rationale behind this.  In effect, the fund constitutes a levy on operators because the levy will be passed to the individual customer.  If it were to be paid both by the agent and the operator a double levy would be passed on to the customer.  As in effect the customer will be paying it, it is only necessary to make it collectable through one source, and the source is the operator through whom all travellers proceed.  Again, if it were to be paid on the double, the effect which I mentioned earlier would be to drive people to avoid the retailer and go direct to the operator.  That would be to the commercial benefit of the agent.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker was worried about the investment methods proposed for the fund.  Obviously in an inflationary period one would share his worries.  It is something we can consider to see whether we should take powers to provide for more flexible methods of investment.  I doubt that we will get a perfect answer.  This does not answer the point entirely, but we will reach a stage where the fund will stop growing.  It will reach a certain level and, if our experience here is similar to that of the UK this will happen pretty soon because the licensing and entry requirements into the trade will ensure that incompetent people will no longer practise this business.  If they are eliminated, the danger of collapse is thereby eliminated and, consequently, there will be no demands on the fund.  If there are no demands on it, it should grow quickly into a substantial amount of money and then it can be left untouched.  I agree <Col N="1099" /> that, even then, it is important to make sure it is invested so that its value will not be eroded by inflation.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness raised a number of points including the position of transport carriers, the circumstances in which the consumer might claim under the Bill, and the provision to refuse a licence on fitness grounds under section 6(3) (b).  It is not intended that carriers should be licensed under the measure.  The definitions indicate that more is involved in tour operating than just carriage.  Most of the carriers, of course, are national flag carriers, or State trading companies, and there is little or no risk to the consumer. In practical terms it would be difficult, if not impossible, to impose the licensing and bonding requirements on carriers.  It would have international implications because people coming here with air services do so on foot of bilateral air services agreements.  Likewise our carriers going into other States do so under the same type of agreement.  I could see great difficulty if one were to try to include carriers as such.  One would have to assess the risk of a carrier going out of business and thereby causing loss to holidaymakers.  In that situation many different circumstances would arise.  If we had our protection fund I do not see any reason why it would not be available to meet the burden which would fall on the operator who would have been prejudiced by the collapse of that carrier, and his customers would have been prejudiced also.  If any carrier has a tour operating subsidiary, as happens in the case of Aer Lingus, that subsidiary will obviously have to comply with the licensing and bonding requirements.  Of course, the definition would exclude any danger of an operator trying to present himself as a carrier and thereby avoid the provisions of the Bill.  The definitions are constructed to ensure that.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers said that the whole purpose of the Bill seems to be to protect people who are going abroad on their holidays, and very properly raised the desirability of encouraging people to spend their holidays at home.  The number of Irish people spending their holidays <Col N="1100" /> abroad now represents a significant invisible export.  Everything possible should be done to encourage as many people as possible to stay at home.  I spoke to the Irish Travel Agent's Association last weekend on the occasion of their annual meeting in Limerick and I made the point that because of their widespread network of retail outlets and staff the travel trade can assist Bord Fáilte significantly by encouraging people to take holidays at home.  I have no doubt that the trade, which has shown itself to be entirely responsible in its approach, will listen to that plea and will co-operate with the board in the campaign they are planning.</P>
    <P>Senator Carroll was worried that the Bill does not apply to holidays at home, that essentially it deals only with collapses which occur in the case of foreign holidays.  Of course, the reality is that there is a significant difference between being stranded in Miami and being stranded in Donegal, although from what one hears at the moment it might be difficult to get out of Donegal.  I do not think a bonding system would cure that at the moment having regard to the current difficulties in the Lough Swilly service. Very few package holidays are sold on the home market.  The only one I can think of offhand is sold by CIE.  We can trust CIE.  For that reason, home holidays are excluded essentially from the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Senator McGuinness about the need to define the circumstances in which the consumer would be entitled to claim under this Bill. The Senator's point could be covered by including a definition of the term &ldquo;inability or failure&rdquo;.  Senator Carroll referred to this as well on section 2.  We are looking at that in consultation with the Attorney General's office and we will go into it in more detail on Committee Stage.  Senator McGuinness also raised the question of refusing licences.  For example, on fitness grounds there will be, to some extent, an element of subjective judgment in some cases.  Obviously one will have to be very careful to have full regard to the principles of natural justice before anybody will be refused on those <Col N="1101" /> grounds.  There is this safeguard of an appeal to the courts, so there would be a second look at such a case.  The requirements of natural justice would be complied with by virtue of that procedure.</P>
    <P>Some Senators regretted the delay that will ensue between the passing of the Bill and the bringing into force of the regulations. I must say I share their concern. I and my officials are working as diligently as possible to ensure that the interval will be as short as possible.  The time scale given by Senator Harte was realistic almost to the point of being pessimistic. It is often better to be realistic and pessimistic rather than be unreal.  Hopefully, having set an outer limit, the Bill will be implemented before that.</P>
    <P>Senator Carroll asked whether the licences will be annual.  They will be annual licences.  Bord Fáilte have been consulted because, of course, their knowledge of the trade is very widespread and they can give useful advice to the Department in this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked if the tour operator could put the cost of the bond on the customer while the travel agent cannot. I do not think the cost of the bond will be put specifically on the customer.  It will be part of the overheads of the operator. The protection fund levy, I imagine, will go specifically onto the customer because it will be a levy per head of persons travelling.  The premium for the bond will be a single lump sum figure.  It will be part of the overheads of the business. Indirectly it will be reflected in the cost of the holiday.  It will not be a separate item in the bill the customer will get.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised a question &mdash; I was not quite clear on this &mdash; on the Department's role with regard to operators who have themselves bonded.  I am aware that out of their own sense of responsibility some operators have bonding and protective arrangements on an entirely voluntary basis and they should be commended for that.  The Department have no role with regard to whether or not anybody operating as a travel agent at the moment has any bond or has any protective devises set up.  There is a misunderstanding on the part of some members of the public who think the Department <Col N="1102" /> have a role to play at the moment. The Department have absolutely no right to require anybody operating in the travel trade at present to have a bond or to set up any financial protection for their customers. Nor have the Department any right to interfere, inhibit, or stop anybody from setting up in business as a travel agent or as a tour operator. Because the Department have absolutely no such powers this Bill is being enacted. I should like to make this clear because I know that this misunderstanding exists from correspondence and messages we have got following collapses from members of the public asking why we allowed this to happen, and why were these people allowed to put up their plates so to speak.  People were not aware that we could not stop them.  They have the commercial freedom to do so as the law now stands.  Senator Mullooly expressed apprehension about the small agents, and I have covered that position.</P>
    <P>As I say, the unfortunate events of the past 12 months have brought the travel trade much more into the public limelight. Notwithstanding the misapprehension on the part of some members of the public about the Department's powers, I think the majority of the public are aware that the trade is uncontrolled at present, and there is very clearly a widespread public demand for this Bill.  I have no doubt that, when this Bill is passed and implemented, the arrangements for the protection of the Irish traveller will be equal to, if not superior to, those pertaining in any neighbouring or other European jurisdiction.  The very existence of these protective measures will give a boost to the trade, and will ensure that a higher quality of service will be given.  I have to say that in the knowledge that much of the service given will result in foreign holidays.  I have no doubt that the trade will heed the appeal which I make once again that, in this year particularly, pending the implementation of the regulations holidays should be taken at home.  I am grateful to Senators for their welcome for the Bill.</P>

      <P>Item No. 3 on the agenda is a motion in the names of Senator Murphy and Senator McGuinness and calls on the Government to declare unequivocally that Ireland will not join a military pact.  Before I ask Senator Murphy to open the debate, I should like to draw the attention of Members, especially new Members of the House, to the speaking time governing this debate.  It is the first Private Members' motion we have had this session.  The proposer of the motion is entitled to 30 minutes and each other Senator to not more than 15 minutes.  The proposer may also nominate another Senator who has not already spoken to reply to the debate, or he may do so himself.  I hope that is clear.  I now call Senator Murphy to propose the motion.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House and the Whips for making the time available for this motion.  I am gratified that the first Private Members' motion should be one standing in my name and that of Senator <Col N="1104" /> McGuinness.  I might point out that the motion was lifted by me straight from the old Order Paper, and the fact that it can be brought before the new House indicates the perennial topicality and urgency of the motion.  There are those who would say we would do better to spend our Private Members' time in debating perhaps more mundane and more immediate and domestic matters.  I could sympathise with Senator B. Ryan who, on the Order of Business today, was very anxious that his own particular interests should be looked after in the motion he has down on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>The world prospect at the moment makes a motion of this kind as compelling and as immediate and as important as any bread and butter issue.  This is not some exotic or rarified option which we can take or leave.  This concerns our very existence.  Given our traditions in relation to neutrality, and given what we try to do in the world, and the commitments we have, then we also have an obligation to scrutinise this matter at frequent intervals. Indeed, vigilance and public scrutiny are the price of our neutrality.</P>
      <P>Constituents of mine, far from telling me that a topic like neutrality is a very abstract subject, have urged me to raise the matter when I can and where I can. People with young families, though they may not raise it as a subject of everyday conversation, are obviously in a state of intermittent terror about the prospects of world conflict and indeed the possibility of nuclear annihilation.  So it is important that the House should give this matter some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we say that the tradition of neutrality in this country is an important one&mdash;and I do not want to be seen as making out an exaggerated case for its historic importance&mdash;there are two extremes into which we can fall here.  One is making a claim that we have something like a Swiss tradition in these matters and that we were always geared towards neutrality and non-alignment in our history.  The other extreme is those who being ashamed of our neutrality and wanting to commit us to a military alliance, tell us that our <Col N="1105" /> neutrality is simply a matter of expediency, always has been, and that it has little or no principle basis.  I think the objective historian would plot a course somewhere between these.  It cannot be denied that the term and concept of neutrality have occurred from early in the century at least and figure in and out, so to speak, of the policies and events of the so-called revolutionary period.  Roger Casement, for example, envisaged what he called a neutralised independent State under international guarantees.  During the Treaty negotiations Eamon de Valera brought up the possibility of having a future independent Ireland status as a neutral independent State under-written in whatever agreement might be reached. It could be said that the whole anti-conscription campaign which was so central, if you like, to the Sinn Féin resurgence in 1917-1918 was a great neutrality campaign as well.  Professor Patrick Keating, who is acknowledged to be the leading authority on the history of our foreign policy, has said and I quote from his book <i>A Place among the Nations:</i></P>
    <P>The popular basis of neutrality was enshrined in 1918.</P>
    <P>So there is a respectable body of evidence to suggest that what we are talking about today is firmly rooted in the history of the State.  Of course it had a pragmatic basis as well.  It was not all that principled. Much of it was simply an anti-English tactic, and anti-English strategy.  In the years after independence both Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil were concerned to establish Irish neutrality and independence in various international fora.  It was again, less an exercise in abstract principles than a strategy to demonstrate Ireland's advance towards full constitutional sovereignty.</P>
    <P>The Second World War neutrality grew out of all of this.  There are those today, at home, who would heavily criticise our abstention from World War II. People in this Oireachtas indeed, from time to time have said that they regret and deplore Ireland's neutrality which they see as essentially isolationist and selfish.  There is something to be said for that point of view but it fails to put the <Col N="1106" /> matter in historical context.  All I am going to say here is that Ireland's wartime neutrality, which was the very bedrock of subsequent developments, was the only sensible strategy for this State to adopt in 1939.  Whatever critics may say in retrospect it is highly interesting that the two leading authorities on our neutrality in World War II both applaud indeed the national stance and claim it was the only feasible one.  For the record I refer to Joseph T. Carroll &ldquo;Ireland in the war years&rdquo; and to Thomas Ryle Dwyer &ldquo;Irish neutrality in the USA&rdquo; and author also of the biography of Eamon de Valera. Dwyer is no starry-eyed admirer of the chief but he concludes a quite critical assessment by saying:</P>
    <P>In view of his courageous stance... de Valera and his Government had absolutely nothing to be ashamed about in remaining neutral during the Second World War.  And his successful struggle to keep Ireland out of that conflict in the face of IRA treachery, Allied pressure and Axis provocation was a magnificent achievement which provided the most conclusive demonstration of the country's political independence.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Senators, with respect, please take note; this is your policy above all others.</P>
    <P>We were still however, a long way from active and principled, if you like, independence in world affairs.  Our refusal to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in 1949 again was for fairly selfish, introspective and not very noble reasons. We refused to join the North Atlantic Treaty as long as Britain kept our country divided&mdash;I use the phrasing of the time. It was in the late fifties and early sixties, however, that we took a step forward, building on the previous and rather mundane approach to international affairs, that we began to build an imaginative foreign policy of which our military neutrality was a centrepiece.  Despite the great developments since then and the whole complex interaction of the European Economic Community and world affairs generally, I am convinced that the principles underlying our neutrality in <Col N="1107" /> what I might call the period of its golden age&mdash;the late fifties and early sixties&mdash;are still valid today, that is to say that a country with our history has a duty and a role to perform in respect of the world generally, a small part perhaps.  We have a tendency to Skibbereen Eagle-ise ourselves from time to time.  We should guard against that tendency.  A limited contribution it has always been but an important one nonetheless.  I cannot see that things have changed since the late fifties and early sixties.  We are still the only country in western Europe which has not had a murky imperial past and I may say in some respects, and with respect to our partners, a murky imperial present.  We are the first country in western Europe or indeed in the world at large to have emancipated ourselves, if you like, from colonial rule in the twentieth century and thereby established a particular pattern and model.  We are, at the same time, a country which cherishes the common values of western civilisation.</P>
    <P>Being all these things, it seemed to the formulators of foreign policy in the early sixties, and it seems to me today, that we had a particular role to perform in the United Nations and in the matter of peacekeeping, for example, but which could not be performed credibly if we had been a member of a military alliance and which cannot in my view continue to be performed credibly today if we were to join a military alliance.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make any speech on this matter without paying genuine tribute to and being extremely proud of our peacekeeping role.  Enough has been said about that elsewhere.  All I can say is that it pleases me particularly because it is a welcome historical paradox if you like, that Paddy whose image worldwide was that of the fighter should now be seen in international eyes as the peacekeeper.  I thought it worthwhile to sketch the historical perspective, as it were, because after all how can a policy like this be based on anything else except really with reference to the past?</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to a few considerations more pertinent to the present day. <Col N="1108" /> The first one is: why is a policy of non-involvement in a military pact vital to our interests?  I will answer that by saying, first of all, the motives of self-perservation, self-interest are not to be discounted in so far as that is possible in a future war.  We all sweepingly dismiss the possibility of escaping unharmed or with little injury from the next conflict.  It may well be that a future conflict could be a limited one and to the extent that we can save our country from the consequences of international war then we are bound to do so.  Self-interest and self-preservation are no less valid criteria for action than they were for Eamon de Valera in 1939.  The second point I would like to draw your attention to when I ask the question &mdash; why is the policy vital to our interests &mdash; is that maybe we should examine certain terms which are used instinctively, automatically as if everyone agreed on their meaning.  What I mean by this is that the people who argue for our participation in a military pact say: ah, you know we should do it in the interests of western European defence. The word defence is used constantly and daily.  It is one of these words the meaning of which we think we know.  In other words we assume that western Europe is under constant military threat from the Soviet Union.  We should ask ourselves whether that is really true.  I am not sure it is true, that is the farthest I would go. I know, of course, that the very existence of the Soviet Union is based on ideological expansion.  But is there that evidence or is it just a kind of self-induced brainwashing over the decades that the Soviet Union poses a constant military threat to western Europe?</P>
    <P>If there were no nuclear weapons defending western Europe, is the Soviet Union really poised to make a military take-over west of Berlin?  It seems to me that there is very little evidence in the decade since the end of World War II that we can thus view the intentions of the Soviet Union.  The point is that anyone who has been in the Soviet Union will have noticed the enormous emphasis on peace, the constant reminders to their citizens of the horrors of war and the calamitous losses which they themselves <Col N="1109" /> suffered in World War II.  I know that since classical times it is said: if you desire peace, prepare war &mdash;<i>si vis pacem, para bellum</i>&mdash; but it seems very unlikely that you can prepare a citizenry for war by constantly preaching peace.  Therefore I suggest that one of the reasons we should be very critical about the idea that we are needed for defence is that defence may not be what it is traditionally cracked up to be at all.</P>
    <P>However the main reason we should stay out of a military pact is that the prospect of a nuclear war is a horrific and immoral one; that is the very least we can say about it.  In the jargon that tries to bring the semblance of sanity to all these madmen one phrase keeps recurring, which is &ldquo;mutual assured destruction,&rdquo; and it is very appropriate that the initials spell &ldquo;mad&rdquo;.  In a condition where the super powers have the capacity to destroy the world several times over, surely it is a moral imperative on us, with our particular history, to do what we can to stop that and certainly to refuse to have anything to do with its possible perpetration.  Talking about &ldquo;mutual assured destruction,&rdquo; again, it is rather like that term &ldquo;defence,&rdquo; we have been reading papers and absorbing television programmes for so long which automatically assume that the rulers of the world have got things right; that we regard President Reagan, Mrs. Thatcher and even Comrade Brezhnev as all, somehow, talking sensibly and reasonably. And we regard the hundreds of thousands marching in Bonn and Amsterdam and Paris as insane.  Of course the truth is the other way around.  It is only the constant repetition of the media which has blinded us to that fact.</P>
    <P>If we stay out of a military pact, at least we are giving a sane witness in a militarily insane world, in a western Europe which is a bristling arsenal already.  To make the minutest contribution to armaments of any kind would be to renege on our whole position in the world since we became an independent State.</P>
    <P>As a member of the United Nations Security Council we have a particular world responsibility.  We cannot deplore, <Col N="1110" /> with any logical consistency, the link between armaments and poverty in the Third World, as we have been doing &mdash; and that link is strongly emphasised in the Brandt Report &mdash; we cannot say: &ldquo;oh are not the Iranians and the Iraqis very foolish given their poverty problems to be arming themselves?&rdquo; How can we do that and, at the same time, seriously consider joining a military alliance?</P>
    <P>Deputy Richie Ryan made a remarkable speech in Dáil Éireann in May 1979 in a foreign affairs debate &mdash; Official Report, volume 314, No. 12 of 31 May, 1979, column 1943 in which he pointed out among other things that if we departed from our military neutrality it would, so to speak, damage our credibility in the Third World, it would damage our credibility even with respect to the real visionary concept of Europe being an alliance of all the countries of Europe, not just a limited portion thereof.  Our military neutrality is one of the few factors which prevents the EEC from being seen exclusively as a capitalist and military force in the outside world.  As I have said already our peacekeeping capacity would be seriously damaged if we joined a military pact.  There is all that other world where our people function abroad &mdash; missionaries, teachers, voluntary workers, semi-State experts from bodies like the ESB, the activities of Aer Lingus in Africa: it is not an exaggeration to say that the goodwill towards them is largely conditioned by all these countries' perception of Ireland's place in the world, which is that of a non-military, neutral nation.</P>
    <P>Hard-headed businessmen in Aer Lingus will tell you that one of the reasons they have such a remarkably good image in African countries, when it comes to training, leasing and so on, is because of our existing foreign policy of which neutrality is a central piece.  This is no rarified option that we are talking about today. It relates directly to our wellbeing in the rest of the world.  So, we are threatened at the moment &mdash;as we were when I first put down the motion &mdash; but the threat has intensified to our military neutrality.  It comes, of course, from international tension, from the people in the White House <Col N="1111" /> and the Pentagon.  Looking at President Reagan holding a press conference sometimes would make you think you were looking at a Peter Sellers' movie.  All the semblances of sanity are there but it is all absolutely lunatic.  May I say that the same applies, of course, to Comrade Brezhnev and his colleagues in the Kremlin?</P>
    <P>I spoke perhaps a year ago by invitation to a meeting of the Ireland/USSR Society when the topic was Ireland's neutrality.  I was, of course, expected roundly to denounce President Carter &mdash; as he then was &mdash; but to speak favourable things about the peace-loving intentions of the great Soviet people.  There was universal displeasure in the front row of that audience, let me tell the House, when I said that the rockets trundling through Red Square on May Day were as much of a threat to my existence and that of mankind as were the Cruise, the Pershings and all the rest.  In other words, if we are to be serious about our neutrality and if it is to continue, then we must make sure it cuts both ways.  There must be no, if you like, fifth column sheltering behind our neutrality.  Our military neutrality has never been, and will never be, a pro-Soviet facade any more than it should be an anti-American facade.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the threat comes from international tension.  It comes from EEC developments, as the Minister well knows, and the small print of this was gone into in the Dáil not so long ago in the debate which was connected with his own appointment and which hinged around the question, as far as I can see, as to whether it was Senator Dooge or Deputy Lenihan who was betraying our neutrality.  deputy Brian Lenihan has discovered a belated and highly admirable fervour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I take the point.  Nevertheless the small print of the EEC threat has been amply aired in the other House.  To summarise, it has come from the fact that I suppose we were always a sore thumb in the EEC since our entry in 1973.  Undoubtedly by the very nature of the Community there is pressure that we should conform, so to speak.  But it has come to a head under the international pressure generally, under the understandable anxiety of western European powers to solidify the line-up and to close the gaps.  It is not for me to pass judgment on whether the Fianna Fáil Government sold the pass at Venlo or whether Senator Dooge sold the pass in London a few months ago. But they are all in agreement that the threat to our continued military neutrality is growing from the direction of the EEC.  A third direction which is putting pressure on traditional policy is, of course, Anglo-Irish relations.  We still do not know what was said at the first Anglo-Irish Summit.  We have had the publication of proceedings quite recently with a significant omission of security. We may be reassured to the extent that nothing has been published which would put our neutrality in hazard but, on the other hand, who knows what went on behind closed doors in that respect?  It has been said or suggested from the first Haughey-Thatcher meeting that there might be a trade-off, a united Ireland for an abdication of our neutrality, to put it very crudely, that Mrs. Thatcher might well demand, in return for a favourable settlement of the Northern Ireland question &mdash; favourable from our point of view &mdash; that we should take <Col N="1113" /> care, so to speak, of British security, that we might make concessions in respect of British concern about our security; that she would find herself reluctant to abandon the western island without being assured that Britain's strategic interests would be taken care of.  That is a problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which has troubled Britain since the 16th century. In my view there is no need for us to join a military pact in order to reassure Britain. If this island, even united, stayed permanently neutral &mdash; as Casement wished back in 1912-1914 &mdash; then Britain would have nothing to fear from a perpetually neutral Ireland.</P>
      <P>Instead of contemplating joining any pact, I think that we should use our influence in the EEC to moderate our partners' bellicose intentions, particularly to moderate the nuclear involvement of France and the United Kingdom, and the involvement of West Germany in nuclear technology.  We talk a lot about our youth and how many of them are under 25 and so on.  This is one area where they might be genuinely upset because their essential future is endangered.  They may have taken some consolation from the last election campaign in which I think for the first time all three parties included in their platform, maybe as a minor item, a commitment to neutrality.  That commitment is still very much in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister a fundamental question: Is our military neutrality fundamentally incompatible with membership of the EEC &mdash; I mean at any time &mdash; because we have been told in succession by Seán Lemass, Dr. Hillery and Michael O'Kennedy that tomorrow morning if any of our partners were attacked we would go to their aid.  Is that true?  If so then that makes a nonsense of our neutrality.  And what does being attacked mean?  Suppose there is a kind of German nationalist flare-up at the Bavarian border; do we go to the aid of West Germany in that case?  I am glad to have had the opportunity to open this <Col N="1114" /> debate and I thank you, a Cathaoirleach, for your forbearance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I second this motion.  Indeed, it gives me great pleasure, as it did Senator Murphy, to partake in this first Private Member's debate in the Seanad since the election.  I agree with him that although some of the other matters put down as Private Members' motions are very important, on a more mundane level perhaps this is one which could be a threat to our very life as a nation and, therefore, is of extreme importance.</P>
      <P>Theoretically, I suppose, in the proper meaning of the term the Irish policy of neutrality can only be said to date from 1922 when we became an independent State.  Indeed, on a practical level it could really date only from 1938 when the British bases were withdrawn and we were given the opportunity to be a neutral State, which happened just in time for the Second World War.  Nevertheless, as Senator Murphy has said, there is a long historical background to this idea.</P>
      <P>He has covered this area extremely well and I do not intend to repeat what he has said.  But we should see that throughout the centuries and leading up to 1922 there were perhaps three aspects of Ireland's international relations: one was her missionary activities &mdash; I shall refer to both the missionary activities and the activities of our development work later; the second was the revolutionary use of England's enemies as a threat to England &mdash; this is something we can now disregard in the sense that it was something that nearly disappeared with independence. Perhaps it is being used in a bad sense now in the activities of some of the groups in the United States.  The third is what I think is the real ancestor to our present feelings about neutrality, a general nationalist unwillingness to become involved in imperial wars.  This kind of unwillingness is what our policy of neutrality is largely based on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, I should like to emphasise one particular figure in history, and that is Wolfe Tone.  I emphasise him in <Col N="1115" /> particular because he has been called upon by our present Taoiseach in his constitutional crusade as being more or less the patron saint of our Republic and I feel that we should look at what he had to say.  In 1790 he wrote a pamphlet on the danger of Ireland becoming involved in a war between Britain and Spain.  It was entitled &ldquo;An Inquiry: How far Ireland is bound as of right to embark in the impending contest on the side of Great Britain&rdquo;.  He pointed out that the question with us was not who is wrong and who is right; that ours are discussions of a very different nature, to foster and cherish a growing trade, to cultivate and civilise a yet unpolished people, to obliterate the impression of ancient religious feuds, to watch with incessant and anxious care the cradle of an infant Constitution; that these were our duties and were indispensible.  I suggest that these duties are still with us and we still have not fulfilled them.  Wolfe Tone further pointed out that we should spurn the idea of moving in humble satellite around any power however great.  Again I would submit that this is still true.  This thread of opposition to involvement in imperial wars has gone all through our history, as Senator Murphy has pointed out, in the nationalist attitude to the Boer War, in the Sinn Féin attitude to World War I where the anti-conscription campaign was based on a feeling that we should not be involved in this sort of imperialist war. Again there is our neutrality in World War II and our attitude to the joining of NATO, which was outlined so well in the various <i>aides memoire</i> which were published to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time, which were exchanged between the then Minister for External Affairs and the then United States envoy.</P>
    <P>Our policy of neutrality has not been just a matter of ideology or a matter of mere Government policy but has a genuine basis in a real people's tradition and a popular feeling.  This is brought out by the fact that our constituents &mdash; mine as well as Professor Murphy's &mdash; talk to us about these matters, that when public meetings are held on this matter they get a very good audience and a very good <Col N="1116" /> response, that there was a universal pride in this country in our role in the United Nations as a neutral and unaligned power during the fifties and sixties and that there is a general unease about the present position, the possibility that EEC membership and membership of what is called European defence are brought together. At the moment, particularly, there have been repeated rumours of a possible commitment to membership of NATO or to being a kind of side-kick of NATO as it were, not perhaps having to be a member but being a semi-independent member as was done by, say, France.  This is brought up again and again.  We recently had an interview in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> by General Sir John Hackett, former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, who pointed out that he felt that Ireland was now very important to NATO; that both Russia and America might well have nuclear missiles pointed at Shannon; that we should be involved in the whole defence arena.  Asked if he thought the Americans would use nuclear weapons on Shannon in certain circumstanes, the General said they are not going to use bows and arrows.  Of course they would use nuclear missiles if they have them targeted.  Again, European Commission's Vice-President Christopher Tugendhat is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in October as stating that Irish neutrality was under pressure and that there was a necessity for membership of NATO or at least association with NATO.</P>
    <P>We have had various statements and lectures by people who are described as foreign affairs experts or persons who have places of authority in the EEC. Some of these are more explicit, some less explicit.  But they all leave the feeling that the policy of neutrality is being progressively and quietly abandoned.  This is all the more dangerous because there is nothing explicit about it.  There is no clear statement put to either House of the Oireachtas about what is being done.  We have the position in both the major parties at any rate that we have a certain feeling that some members of the successive Governments wish to get rid of neutrality and yet we have backbench Members <Col N="1117" /> of considerable importance, such as Senator Ruairi Brugha, as he was then, and Deputy Richie Ryan who has also been mentioned in the other House in the Fine Gael Party, who have set their faces against any loss of neutrality.  But we are given this vague and woolly impression that we are committed to what is described as a democratic and Christian western way of life and that therefore we must throw our lot in politically and militarily with the West.</P>
    <P>As Senator Murphy said, we too readily assume that these things mean what they say.  What do we mean by a democratic and Christian way of life?  If we talk in terms of democracy it seems to me that to do away with our neutral policy is to fly in the face of the democratic wishes of our own people, If we talk in terms of Christianity there is very little that I can imagine that is more thoroughly non-Christian than a nuclear arms race which threatens to exterminate the entire population of the world, or very nearly. These present nuclear dangers are very real.</P>
    <P>On Sunday last we had a graphic demonstration in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of the strategic weapons and long-range weapons the two sides have, the United States, the West and Warsaw Pact.  These horrifying figures showed, for instance, that there are 9,000 warheads belonging to the West and 1,398 intercontinental ballistic missiles belonging to the Warsaw Pact and various other figures, all of which showed that these powers could destroy the world many times over with the arsenals they have already.  Is it really Christian and moral that we should join this?</P>
    <P>Now we see a growing anti-nuclear protest in Europe, huge marches taking place in Amsterdam and other centres, political parties and political movements growing in an anti-nuclear effort.  I suggest that we have not seen this here precisely because we have a policy of neutrality and precisely because we are not involved.  If we were to go in for this, remember the kind of opposition there was even to ordinary nuclear power being used by the ESB.  We can be quite sure that there would be much more protest <Col N="1118" /> against military nuclear involvement. Indeed these protests might very well dwarf any protests held about the recent H-block issue.  If we take it on we will see the democratic objections of our citizens and see them fast and strong.</P>
    <P>On the moral aspect of this in world power blocks, can we really say that one side is all right and the other all wrong? I would suggest it is totally untrue that we are committing ourselves to the morally right side in the West.  Of course, the Soviet Union is frequently wrong in its actions; of course it is wrong in what it did in Afghanistan and we should oppose that and oppose it strongly.  But what our own people have found in El Salvador backed up by the United States is equally wrong.  Our foreign policy has had a tradition of being independent and being able to take the stance that both these kinds of actions were wrong, whereas, if we involve ourselves in a military alliance with one side we completely muffle our own protests at these kinds of wrong.</P>
    <P>Briefly, to conclude, I would turn again to our engagement with the Third World which was dealt with in our debate on the Brandt Report and in various other places as well.  Here we have had the tradition of Irish missionary activity and the new activity of development and of business.  I have had the experience of working in Zambia in Africa where my husband was employed by the United Nations and I could see the influence of Irish business activity, and it is undoubtedly true that Irishmen were employed in these situations precisely because we were thought to be neutral and unaligned. It was noticeable that in engineering activity it was Irish and Yugoslavs who were employed throughout those African countries for just these very reasons; they were not attached to imperialists of either side.</P>
    <P>It is also true that it is the returned missionaries and the returned development workers who would most strongly reject the idea that the NATO and United States side is necessarily the moral side, the Christian side, the democratic side, in this world conflict.  We get papers.  I am sure other Senators like myself this morning got a paper called <Col N="1119" /><i>One World</i> from Trocaire and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace which again draws attention to the situation in El Salvador and which shows the commitment of Irish people abroad to real justice and peace in the various nonaligned countries.</P>
    <P>We look in Europe itself not just to neutralists like Sweden and Switzerland who have had a long tradition of neutrality and who are rich countries and can perhaps sustain their own foreign policies more readily than we can.  The poorer countries like Yugoslavia and Finland, who are in a much more difficult position than Sweden and Switzerland, are also under a great deal of pressure by a large world power and yet will go to endless lengths to try to hold on to their own neutrality.  I would suggest, a Chathaoirleach, that we had extremely good reason to maintain an attitude of positive neutrality over past years and we have still better reason to retain it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. G. Hussey Mrs. G. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. G. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before saying anything on the motion I would like to welcome the Minister on his first time sitting in a ministerial chair in this House.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome him to the House in that capacity.  I would also like to congratulate the proposer and seconder of this motion for giving the Seanad the opportunity for a debate which is of such obvious importance to us all.</P>
      <P>This debate, while it specifically mentions a military pact, is very much about neutrality on the world stage of the present nuclear tension.  Furthermore, it has been given an added impetus or importance by the question of a possible development of European political co-operation into something quite different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned &mdash; and it is important to note in passing &mdash; that there is a question mark over how far the former Minister for Foreign Affairs might have gone in loosening up the neutrality position of this country at Venlo in Holland on may 9 and 10.  I expect that will be cleared up today.  It is also necessary to comment on a shift in our thinking about neutrality which has already been mentioned by Senator Murphy.  It was, <Col N="1120" /> historically, just a pragmatic expression of the independence of this country.  It has shifted ground considerably now and to most people the discussion of Irish neutrality has expanded to mean a highly principled stand on world affairs.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate this Minister on the Brockett Hall meeting which was reported on at the London meeting of EEC Ministers on October 13.  It seems to me that that defined the proper scope of European political co-operation as excluding defence matters.  A point that we must dwell on and that I intend to touch on a little bit later is the effect of our stand on neutrality and defence on any possible or probable area of negotiation with Britain over the future of the North.  This aspect, while it stands at some distance from our position about defence as an EEC member, is nevertheless very bound up with that.</P>
    <P>But it is necessary to remind ourselves that we had a referendum on our entry to the EEC in 1972 and that 80 per cent of the people who voted yes in that referendum were voting specifically for economic alliance, social links, cultural links; they were certainly not thinking of voting for anything else.  Therefore in any departure from the original concept which the people were voting for, the people would have to be consulted once more and, to put it quite plainly, I am talking about a referendum.  My own view is that in present circumstances such a referendum would be overwhelmingly against any military extension of EEC co-operation.  I believe the people would make it quite clear that that is not what they were voting for in 1972.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other voices and opposite arguments and they are sometimes very powerful and very worrying. We have to consider whether the implications of our neutral position outside NATO are a block towards progress with Britain on the Northern question.  I would like to quote something from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of November 21 in a very thought provoking article by Bruce Arnold entitled &ldquo;Fitting Ireland into Defence of the West&rdquo;.  He said in that article, and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Britain has a lively and real interest in her own, and in Europe's, western defences.  And sprawling across the lines of those western defences is the large, under-populated, underfinanced, under-industrialised, divided and unstable island of Ireland.  Until that island, in peace and by agreement, can be turned into a stable, secure and united ally, Britain is going to remain in the North.</P>
    <P>I found that an extremely interesting statement.  But having given it a lot of thought I find that I must totally disagree with it.  I believe that in regard to Ireland's neutral position or our staying outside NATO, they are not the block to further understanding or progress in the Northern Ireland question.  That block is unfortunately the gulf which is deep and so far totally unbridged unfortunately between the people of the majority tradition in the North and ourselves and between the two communities in the North.  They are the blocks to progress in that area.</P>
    <P>Still touching on that question of the Irish dimension <i>vis-a-vis</i> Britain I believe that if the time ever comes&mdash;and like most Irish people I hope it will come soon and in peace&mdash;when there is a new and possibly confederal Ireland, a natural by-product of that development would be an all-Ireland military pact protecting the interests of all the Irish people together.  Indeed, a very small but significant gesture towards that reality was made when Mr. de Valera sent the Irish fire services north of the Border to help in Belfast during the Second World War.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, ancient and historic links with Britain, happy or unhappy as they may have been from time to time.  We have extremely strong sentimental and racial links with the United States and, of course, we have the more recent strong economic links with Europe.  I would like to endorse the remarks of other Senators who mentioned our very important links to the Third World.  Those links are very worthy of being institutionalised themselves in an unaligned framework.  Our relationship with the Third World should not be <Col N="1122" /> threatened by any movement towards unnecessary military alliance with the Western European block.  Membership of the EEC, therefore, should not mean that we become an appendage, because that is all we would be, of some nuclear powered alliance in Europe.</P>
    <P>Our status at the United Nations may be fairly small, but I believe it is very significant.  If that status is respected, it should not be eroded or even threatened with erosion by any suspicion cast on our stance on neutrality and military alliances. It is important that we, as politicians, should articulate the views of the great majority of those we represent, and I represent the same constituents in this House as Senator Murphy and come under the same pressures from a great many of them.  The great majority of the people we represent would refuse to countenance any effort to coerce Ireland into any military pact or any alliance.  I believe that this Minister and this Government will protect the interests of the Irish people and in doing so enable us to be heard clearly in the major public debates that are going on all over the world about the proliferation of nuclear weaponry and the incursion of such weaponry into Western Europe.  In doing so I want to say that I see no virtue whatsoever in joining in what appears to be a currently fashionable anti-Americanism which has crept into so many speeches and declarations of otherwise extremely balanced and worthy advocates of neutrality and nuclear disarmament. This was and remains a noteworthy feature of the enormous European demonstrations across Europe about Western European neutrality or the placing of nuclear weapons in Europe.</P>
    <P>However, if we are preserving our neutrality against any onslaught, there is a price that we must pay and it is a high one.  We have to work extremely hard to improve international understanding and improve international movements towards peace.  Active and positive neutrality is a difficult path to follow but it is one that Ireland is suited to and must follow.  I support this motion very strongly and I look forward very much to <Col N="1123" /> the Minister clarifying the Government's position on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to congratulate the Minister on being appointed to his position and also to congratulate the Minister on being elected from this House to that high office, even though we might have something to say to him and some questions to ask him.</P>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil welcome this motion put down by Senators Murphy and McGuinness.  I am heartened by the comments to date in the debate because, as we know, the question of Ireland's neutrality has been bandied about in recent months.  I suspect that this was done to draw attention away from the economy and involved in a topic which most Irishmen hold dearly; the crusade about the Constitution can be looked upon in the same light.  This is nothing but a subtle manipulation by this Government of our ideals to push into the background the handling of our economy and the breaking of election promises by the present patchwork Government.  This manoeuvre will not work.  Fianna Fáil will continue to question them on all aspects of their patchwork policies.</P>
      <P>Certain points in relation to our country's neutrality have been raised and they cannot go unanswered.  In addition the present Foreign Minister has attempted to misrepresent Fianna Fáil's philosophy and proven policy towards neutrality. This also cannot go unanswered.  He has deliberately attempted to confuse the issues.  I hope this is not meant to be a smokescreen to cover up more decisive plans that the Government may have for a future date.  Let us clarify the situation and unweave the smokescreen of words and misleading statements about facets of foreign policy which the Government, for reasons best known to themselves, have created.  I believe we all suspect the reasons and shudder at the consequences if we are correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset let me say that the term neutrality has been bandied about and been used in the wrong context on many occasions.  Like most people, when I hear talk of neutrality, I immediately conjure up pictures of the epic and historic stand <Col N="1124" /> of Eamon de Valera when in the face of untold pressures he relentlessly and successfully prevented Ireland from any strategic or military involvement during World War II.  This is the essence of neutrality.  That is staying neutral and having no military or strategic involvement whatsoever with one warring faction or the other.  This has been commented on already by previous speakers, and without this definition things can get confused.</P>
    <P>The present Government are using this confusion of terms to deliberately maintain such a situation.  The terms on neutrality seem to get confused with the pursuance of an independent foreign policy. Sometimes the terms are inter-changed and used in the same context while on other occasions the opposite extreme arises when they are said to be a contradiction of each other.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy in relation to neutrality and foreign policy is straightforward and clearly defined.  First, the maintenance of neutrality in no way prevents Ireland from having a foreign policy in relation to world matters and in relation to other countries.  Under successive Fianna Fáil Governments Ireland has always preserved an independent foreign policy.  One aspect of this policy has been neutrality, that is, neutrality on a nonmilitary involvement of our nation with other nations or alignments.  This is the policy that Fianna Fáil has always been committed to, and which put Ireland to the forefront in the United Nations peacekeeping operations all over the world.  Other nations recognise that no matter what their military alignment is, we are neutral and thus one of the very few nations that can be trusted to carry out such delicate peace keeping and monitoring functions without bias towards any side.  The distinction once again is that neutrality is not foreign policy; neither is neutrality a lack of foreign policy.  The answer is simply that neutrality is one aspect of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The important point is that having a neutral policy in regard to our country's military involvement does not imply that we should also be neutral politically or <Col N="1125" /> economically.  On the contrary, this neutrality lends credibility to the pursuance of our independent foreign policy. Ireland's political foreign policy in the EEC, at the UN and elsewhere is listened to and is influential because we have no military axe to grind.  Our political policy does not reflect a bias, or alliance, or allegiance to one side or the other.  Thus we must be one of the few nations who can claim, and hopefully maintain, a balanced objective, independent, political foreign policy.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, we can condemn Russia's involvement in Afghanistan and, on the other, America's involvement in El Salvador.  We can be proud of this achievement down through the years.  We are one of the few respected watchdogs of world peace because we can, at all times, speak up for and side with the righteous, at all times, point out the injustices and at all times look for justice for all peoples and nations of the world.  This has always been, and shall remain, the foreign policy of Fianna Fáil. We will not go into the innuendoes of the present Government.  We will not let them confuse the clear cut issues.  We will not let them destroy, by their present divisive and seemingly bungling statements, our nation's ideals.  We will not be coerced or subtly manoeuvred into any alliance which might prove economically beneficial which would mean the sacrificing of our dearly held and fought for principles and ideals of freedom and peace, not only for our own nation but for all nations.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil welcome this motion.  We see it as one in response to the consensus of opinion which Deputy Brian Lenihan has been voicing over recent weeks concerning the weakness being displayed by the Government on this matter.  Only this afternoon, in the course of wide-ranging speech on Community affairs, our party leader made a number of important points on this subject which are directly relevant to this debate.  I would like to put on the record of this House our objection to the way in which the development of the EEC is becoming increasingly unbalanced, contrary to our best interests. Our Ministers and diplomats have <Col N="1126" /> no mandate to concede our neutrality, to which the vast majority of our population, and our young people in particular, are keenly attached.  What is being sought is the reversal of the entire timetable of European integration, the abandoning of the goal of full economic union and the putting of political co-operation and defence in their place.  This is not the basis on which we entered the Community and it represents a serious reversal of thinking and an approach entirely detrimental to our interests.  It must be recognised that our standing in the world will be greatly changed if we are perceived to have become <i>de facto</i> members of the Atlantic Alliance, and increasingly indentified with NATO decisions such as the Sinai Force.</P>
    <P>Our ability to contribute to the UN will be prejudged thereby and also our dealings with the Arab, African and Latin American countries.  It is high time that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated clearly and publicly what is afoot.  We want to know from them if they agree with us that we should not be committed to a military engagement by stealth and that we do not approve of military decisions taken in the Community's name.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made any public statement today on the subject or the Genscher Plan which would involve regular meetings of EEC defence Ministers.  How can our partners take seriously Ireland's neutrality if we fail to defend it publicly and vigorously? I wholeheartedly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take the opportunity, on this first occasion when the Minister is present in his official capacity in the House, to congratulate him on two things in particular in relation to recent foreign policy developments.  One was the support which he gave at the United Nations to the Franco-Mexican declaration on El Salvador.  All of us concerned with the problem in El Salvador appreciated that deeply.  I would like to congratulate him too as political head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, on the statement yesterday of Ambassador Dorr in relation to Southern Africa.  I think <Col N="1127" /> both these things have been significant and they do indicate a strengthening of independence within our foreign policy which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>On the question of neutrality, I must say I am not quite as clear as some previous speakers that there has been a deep-seated commitment to neutrality within the country since the foundation of the State.  Certainly there have been high points when neutrality seemed to have penetrated our political consciousness to the point where policy derived directly from it, notably, as has been said, in the late 50s and perhaps during the period of the Second World War.  I must say however that, particularly in the last 15 years or so I have the sense that our commitment to neutrality is heavily laden with pragmatism and does not spring from any deep conviction.  I think particularly of statements made by Heads of Government over that period that a European common defence policy is not necessarily to be ruled out in the event of European political union.  I think also of the statement made by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, that in some sense Irish neutrality was tradable in the context of a settlement of the Northern problem.  These two positions, it seems to me, do not derive from any deep-seated conviction about neutrality but rather suggest that our neutrality is based on pragmatism and is ultimately negotiable.  In this connection, I must say too that many of us have become increasingly concerned &mdash; and I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on this&mdash;with the implications of the process of European political co-operation.  For this reason our party, on several occasions in recent years, have adopted policy statements in relation to Irish neutrality in an attempt to draw public attention to the dangers involved in this process.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote very briefly from one of these documents not simply because it is a Labour Party document, but because I think the principles which it outlines should underpin our approach to the notion of Ireland as a neutral State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At their 1980 Annual Conference, <Col N="1128" /> the Labour Party adopted a resolution, proposed by our Administrative Council, which said, in summary:</P>
    <P>Conference reaffirms Labour's traditional stance on the issue of neutrality and resolves (1) that we are committed to a neutral role for Ireland, not alone in the sense of refusal to join any military block, but in terms of an active political philosophy; (2)  neutrality must be a fundamental and positive principle of Irish national and international policy; (3)  the pragmatic basis of Irish neutrality should be strengthened by a firm acceptance of a nonaligned position in world politics; (4) national policy within the European Community should ensure that the process of political co-operation does not compromise a neutral Irish position on such matters as armaments, relations with the Third World, and dealing with South Africa; (5)  active neutrality should imply a total commitment to peace, detente and disarmament, together with a programme of involvement in world affairs in which policy is determined independently in accordance with national needs and on the merits of the individual case.</P>
    <P>I will just identify two aspects of the principles which should underpin our foreign policy.  First, we must remain totally opposed to the idea of involvement with any military pact.  Secondly, neutrality should not be seen as the adoption of a passive role in world affairs.  Rather, a commitment to neutrality is a commitment to an active role in the world.  It is a commitment to an independent position based on conviction and in which each individual policy issue is judged on its merits.</P>
    <P>Were we to see our neutrality in this way&mdash;that is not just as non-involvement in military pacts but as a positive political philosophy of intervention in world affairs in pursuit of justice and peace from a position of independence without commitment to any power bloc&mdash;then I think we could play a very significant role indeed, together with Finland and Sweden and the other Nordic countries and with the non-aligned movement itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> That is a vision of Irish foreign policy which we should seek to implement.  The two matters I mentioned at the very beginning of my comments are an indication, perhaps, of movement in that direction and as such are to be welcomed. However the development of this approach to foreign policy, based on active participation in the world from a position of neutrality, is obviously going to be difficult in the period ahead.  This is so, firstly, because of the growing cold war reality in which the world finds itself now.  This is summed up in the following quotation from a report of the Socialist International on the question of disarmament, published in the 1981 edition of &ldquo;Socialist Affairs&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The arms race has gained a new dangerous momentum.  Disarmament efforts have gradually stagnated over the last few years.  Readiness to resort to force or the threat of force has dramatically increased and this has led to disastrous and dangerous local conflicts. In great-power relations mutual mistrust and accusations have become prevalent while the policy of detente has come to a halt.  The growth of commercial exchanges and economic cooperation has ceased, and inequalities between and within rich and poor countries have been further accentuated. Today, at the beginning of a new decade, the danger of the escalation of a nuclear confrontation is greater than it has ever been since the Caribbean crisis in 1962.</P>
    <P>In this situation, clearly there will be increasing pressure on us to take sides. We must resist that with all the means at our disposal.  The best role for us, the one which is closest to our convictions and which pragmatically is the best one as well, is one of active neutrality.</P>
    <P>The second obstacle to the development of this approach to foreign policy seems to lie in recent trends in the development of the process of political co-operation in the European Community. Like other speakers, I, too, am concerned about the Genscher-Columbo proposals on two grounds.  First, because they are an attempt to divert the Community from the need to come to grips <Col N="1130" /> with the economic and social crisis which pervades Europe.  This is now reasonably self-evident and we must not allow that to happen.  We joined the European Community on certain conditions.  We were given certain commitments on economic and social development in Europe. Progress has been lamentably poor and certain elements within the European Community establishment are now trying to divert us from those and to set us off on a different course.</P>
    <P>The second cause of concern about the Genscher-Columbo proposals is that deep inside them &mdash; certainly at the beginning and I believe still &mdash; is a commitment to a common defence pact for Europe.  Over recent weeks or months the word defence has been changed to security.  I am not clear, however, what the difference between defence and security is.  I suspect there is no difference.  I certainly welcome the serious attempts made by the present Minister to undo the damage done by the previous Government in leading us down that path.  I trust that he will disengage us entirely from this process.  I recognise that this will be difficult and will take time, but it must be done.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, a legitimate role for us in the area of political co-operation with the European Member States in areas relating to foreign policy.  For example, I personally would have no objection in principle &mdash; nor indeed would the party to which I belong &mdash; if the process of co-operation in foreign policy was concerned with aiding the implementation of the Helsinki or the Madrid Agreements or if it was to do with policies to aid Third World development. If it was to do with generally acting with other countries in the European Community on foreign policy issues in a manner not in contravention of our neutrality, then I would have no objection. For example, in relation to Southern Africa, I would see no difficulty in co-operating with the other member states in pursuit of the policy outlined by Ambassador Dorr yesterday.  I do not, however, think that many of the more powerful states in the European Community would wish to have any meaningful <Col N="1131" /> policy in opposition to apartheid in South Africa, because they are financially heavily committed in the area.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, certain issues in the foreign policy area on which we could co-operate with other member states in the European Community.  But we must not, however, accede to the notion of a European defence policy.  That would be not only to deny our past policy, pragmatic though much of it was but to cut off the prospect of re-asserting or regaining our independent role in the world.</P>

That is the only meaningful role for us to play and it seems to me that we should move towards it, as we seemed to be doing at one point in the late fifties. Unfortunately, that progress was rolled back subsequently.</P>

This is not out of any disrespect for any Members of the House and their great achievements, but purely because so many congratulations have been bandied about this evening that I could not think of any new ones before I got up to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two good reasons for neutrality which emerged from this debate. One is the very practical reason of self-preservation, that it is the best way to protect ourselves in a nuclear or war situation. The second is a much more theoretical reason &mdash; that there is a very attractive purity about the idea of neutrality. It is a very appealing idea to a small nation.  I wonder, however, if we really are a neutral State.  Senator O'Mahony has very eloquently mentioned the fact that, as a Member of the <Col N="1132" /> United Nations, we take a stand which is very anti-South Africa and, in fact, we do.  If we were a truly neutral State we would be outside the United Nations.  We are a member of the United Nations peacekeeping force and that, in itself, is a military pact, whether you like it or not.  We are taking a stand on a political position which the United Nations have taken and we are, therefore, members of a military pact in that sense.</P>
    <P>This debate really boils down to where we stand between the East and the West in the East-West conflict.  Far be it from me to accuse Senator Murphy of having been naive in his speech, but when he said, having been in Russia, that he had seen a constant emphasis on peace, that was slightly innocent.  He went on then to talk about the massive arms build-up and the rockets going through Red Square on May Day?  Why on earth are those rockets going through Red Square on May Day?  Are we not talking about the same country which ruthlessly invaded Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia?</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy went on to say that he was doubtful whether those arms in Eastern Europe, which outnumber the arms in Western Europe I think by four to one, are there as an aggressive force against the West.  That is naive.  There is no doubt that those arms in Eastern Europe are there as an aggressive force against the West.  It would be absurd to suggest that if the West disarmed, or evacuated its nuclear arms from Western Europe, it would not appeal to Russia to move in.  The Soviet is committed to the spread of international Communism. Whether it is a good or a bad thing is not the point of this debate.  It is committed to that and to world conquest for Communism as its ultimate purpose.  It is absurd to say that they are not an aggressive force, in the light of their recent actions in Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan and of their enormous arms build-up in Eastern Europe which far outnumbers anything the West can produce there.</P>
    <P>The cynics would say that we are a very small country and that possibly we do not need a foreign policy at all, that it is unnecessary for a country as insignificant as ours on the world stage to have a <Col N="1133" /> foreign policy simply because nobody is going to take any notice of it.  That is not true, but there is a great danger that if we take the neutral position, a position of non-commitment on issues between East and West, people will say that we have no foreign policy at all.</P>
    <P>This afternoon, I tried to trace Ireland's foreign policy since the beginning of the State and it was very difficult to find any consistent trend in it.  There is a sort of pragmatic neutrality with a significant voice and an emphasis on the United Nations.  Even in the United Nations, which was a more significant body about 12 years ago than it is now, could the Minister tell us &mdash; although it possibly is a secret ballot &mdash; whether, in the vote for Secretary-General, we recently took our neutrality to the extent, as reported in many newspapers, that we voted for both candidates consistently?</P>

      <P>When we talk about a military pact, there are only four candidates with whom we can make a real military pact.  There are the Soviet Union, NATO, the UK and Europe.  The reality, although we are not members of NATO, is that we are a capitalist country.  We are probably a moderately non-anti-communist country.  All our sentiments and all our history intertwine us with the US, with Great Britain and with Europe by trade, by idealogy and by tradition.  It is no coincidence that a Russian Embassy was allowed here only recently and only on very strict terms by the last Coalition Government, so let us rule out the Soviets. We are not going to become part of the Warsaw Pact.  There is the possibility with NATO and a possibility of a military pact with the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic idea of the EEC was not the creation of a trade pact between the countries: it was that it should become a political and a defence union.  Most enthusiasts for the EEC &mdash; those who believe in the idealogy and the basic thinking behind the EEC &mdash; seek total unity of the EEC.  That would of course mean ultimately a defence pact, and very <Col N="1134" /> many eminent leading Europeans at the moment believe that a European defence pact is really the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the EEC, not a trade pact and not the EMS.  It is no coincidence &mdash; and points to our almost unalterable connection with Britain in terms of trade &mdash; that we did not enter the EEC until Britain entered it.</P>
    <P>The issue in this debate will remain unresolved.  There is a grave danger that if we remain neutral and if a war situation arises that we will become a battleground, that we will be invaded by someone, being helpless against invasion in a situation like that, and that another country will try to protect us.  That is not what we want.  In some ways it might be much better for us to join a major situation whereby an attack on us would be an attack on America.  The only justification for no military pact, in summary, is that we should remain in the lucky situation in which we have been for many years now &mdash; under the umbrella of NATO, because of our obvious western sympathies and because of our geographical position, but not having to make such a commitment.  We are in a lucky situation, we have the best of both worlds and long may it last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Professor Dooge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate to set out the Government's policy in regard to non-membership in military alliances and to hear the views of the Seanad on this topic.  At the outset, I assure the proposer of the motion that it is not the intention of the Government to join any military pact. Successive Irish Governments have taken the view that non-membership of military alliances is in Ireland's interest, and that view is shared entirely by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government in the programme published before they took office stated clearly that they, and I am quoting directly, &ldquo;will preserve Ireland's neutrality outside all military alliance&rdquo;.  Our Constitution affirms Ireland's sovereign right to determine its relations with other nations and our dedication to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among the nations.  I think it is no harm to quote <Col N="1135" /> here the words in which our fundamental law states the position.  Article 1 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government, to determine its relations with other nations, and to develop its life, political, economic and cultural, in accordance with its own genius and traditions.</P>
    <P>In more detail and more specifically, Article 29 states:</P>
    <P>Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have taken the view that these provisions of the Constitution can best be realised by remaining outside military alliances and by making our contribution to peace and friendly co-operation among the nations by political action.  We make these efforts, sometimes unilaterally, sometimes in co-operation with our partners in the European Community and sometimes in the multilateral activities of the United Nations, including its peace keeping operations. All of these efforts are consistent with fulfilment of the goals for Irish foreign policy set out in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Of course, we cannot pursue our foreign relations as if we were immune from the tensions affecting neighbouring states in our region and in the world at large.  As Senator Murphy when introducing this debate pointed out, these tensions are increasing.  We cannot be indifferent to world problems which affect all countries.  We share with a number of other countries a basic commitment to democratic values, concepts of human rights and an appreciation of freedom of thought, belief and expression.  Our membership of the European Community reflects this common heritage of principles and ideals as well as the belief in the shared destiny of the member states. These, together with our, economic interests are the basis of our treaty links with our partners in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Inevitably instability in various parts of <Col N="1136" /> the world which could have a serious effect on the economic well being of the Community is a matter of concern for us as a member of that Community.  Ireland participates actively with its partners in European Political Co-operation with a view to working out common approaches to major international questions, such as the Middle East or Southern Africa. While these activities have been valuable in themselves and have enhanced the impact of Irish diplomacy, we continue to pursue our own specific foreign policy concerns: we continue to follow in the UN and other international fora, policies which we believe right and in the best interests of Ireland as well as the other states which share our values.</P>
    <P>In the case of a state like Ireland which is not a member of an alliance, diplomatic activities in pursuit of foreign policy concerns need to be distinguished clearly from the military problems of how to provide for our national defence.  We would prefer that the security of states in Europe and elsewhere could be guaranteed on the basis of mutual good faith and the exchange of assurances, but this is far from corresponding with the realities of the world today.  Many countries have decided that it is in their interest to combine in military arrangements to protect themselves against the danger of attack or to deter potential aggressors.</P>
    <P>The Charter of the United Nations recognises the right of member states to individual and collective self-defence and allows for the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with matters relating to international peace and security.  However, the Government believe that Ireland's interests and the general interest are better served by our remaining outside the existing system of military pacts.  Moreover as a number of Senators have pointed out in the course of this debate, Senators Cogan and McGuinness particularly, the fact that we are known not to be members of a military alliance, combined with our historical background, tends to enhance our acceptability among the Third World countries and our understanding of their concerns.  This can be beneficial to the <Col N="1137" /> relationships between these countries, not only Ireland but the EEC as a whole.</P>
    <P>Our involvement in UN peace keeping operations in various parts of the world has been referred to&mdash;the Middle East, the Congo, Cyprus, West Irian and the India-Pakistan border.  In all these and other instances we have been able to make a contribution to the resolution of dangerous international conflicts and tensions.</P>
    <P>In addition since we joined the United Nations we have taken a prominent role in the various disarmament debates and we have been associated with a number of important resolutions which advocate concrete and practical measures of disarmament. The most obvious measure which springs to mind being the Irish resolution which led to the Nuclear nonproliferation Treaty.  We have also been among the authors of several other major resolutions on subjects such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Convention Prohibiting Chemical Weapons, the Cessation of the Production of materials for nuclear weapons, the reduction of military budgets and the prohibition of inhumane weapons.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy pointed out, and I agree with him, that particularly in the year of our membership of the Security Council we have had world responsibility in regard to disarmament.  I assure him that we take this responsibility very seriously. In my own address to the General Assembly of the United Nations the portion of my speech on disarmament made our position in this regard very clear.  In it I spoke on the fact that things had deteriorated, rather than improved in the 12 months since the last General Assembly. It is perhaps a reflection of our concern that, except for the section of my speech dealing with Northern Ireland, this was longer than the section on any other topic.  Ireland's experience has shown how a country that remains outside military alliances can make a worthwhile contribution to maintaining international peace.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have said that there seem to be pressures in regard to our stance in this respect.  Senator Murphy said that in the EEC there appears <Col N="1138" /> to be pressure to conform, and Senator O'Mahony said he was worried about the implications of European Political Co-operation. It is, I think, as well that I should deal with these points in some detail in this debate even though I have been able to give you an assurance in regard to the Government's position in regard to the wider issue being discussed.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan was rather critical of me.  He said that I had distorted the position of Fianna Fáil in the EEC in regard to neutrality and he derided me as a great producer of smoke screens, in this regard.  He also suggested that I have been responsible in some way for the creation of confusion.  From my point of view, I have been very much concerned with the removal of confusion.  In this connection I think a great step forward was the fact that following the discussion at Brockett Hall and the subsequent London meeting, the agreed report on European Political Co-operation was published. For the first time there was a statement, a document which is in the Oireachtas Library.  Any Member of this House can go to the Oireachtas Library and read there in an official document what it is all about.</P>
    <P>There have been attempts to present what was agreed to in London last October as acceptance by this Government of a new dimension of discussion in European Political Co-operation which either in the short term or in a longer term would involve us in defence arrangements and thus be prejudicial to Ireland's military neutrality.  The Taoiseach has endeavoured to make it clear that this is not the case, and I am glad that in this debate I can also attempt to make the matter less confused.</P>
    <P>Ireland first became involved in European Political Co-operation on its accession to membership of the Community in January 1973.  In the intervening period, under successive Governments, discussions on political co-operation have touched on such matters as disarmament issues of the United Nations, the Conference on European Security and Co-operation which is currently taking place in Madrid, and problems such as Southern Africa mentioned by Senator O'Mahony <Col N="1139" /> and Afghanistan which has been mentioned by a number of other Senators.</P>
    <P>The London Report deals primarily with practical steps which were designed to improve the operation of this system and to enhance its ability to respond to crises situations, to make the whole process more efficient.  These steps, of course, are largely of a procedural or administrative nature.  This was prefaced by an introductory part of the report, by a reaffirmation of the commitment of the member states to political co-operation, involving not a new departure but a reaffirmation of their undertaking to consult one another before making a final decision on seeking the common ground where common ground existed, and where concensus is not possible acting according to their own foreign policies. In regard to security the relevant paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>As regards the scope of European Political Co-operation, and having regard to the different situations of the Member States the Foreign Ministers agree to maintain the flexible and pragmatic approach which has made it possible to discuss in political co-operation certain important foreign policy questions bearing on political aspects of this security.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Senators to some of the wording of this passage.  First, it makes it clear in a manner acceptable to us the sort of foreign policy questions with security implications that may be discussed.  I congratulate Senator O'Mahony on his own definition of political aspects of security.  He prefaced his remarks by saying that it is difficult to distinguish between the political and the military aspects, but he did it very well.</P>
    <P>He dealt with disarmament, the question of the Helsinki process and the follow-up of Helsinki, questions on the stability, or rather the instability of Southern Africa, the instability of the Middle East.  These are all political aspects of security that affect the Community. These matters do not touch on the military aspects of security.  For our <Col N="1140" /> nine partners they are matters for NATO.</P>
    <P>Second, the paragraph refers to &ldquo;the different situations of the member states&rdquo;.  It clearly implies that the specific circumstances of each partner will be taken into account in these discussions. There are differences within the Ten, of course.  France and Britain are nuclear powers and the others are not.  We are not a member of an alliance and the other nine are.</P>
    <P>The third point is that it is quite clear that the report does not seek to expand the scope of European Political Co-operation but rather to maintain and to write down and publish what has been the practice for a number of years.  As I have already stated, the member states have discussed a range of subjects relating to UN disarmament, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. These relate to political aspects.  The wording of the London Report does not include any undertaking or understanding that would involve Ireland in a defence commitment or in military or defence questions as such.  I would like to say here that I think that the publication of this report has been most valuable.  If people feel that there is any endangerment of our neutrality by EPC I can assure them that the London Report corresponds to EPC practice and that there is no change on the basis of that report.</P>
    <P>There was a specific question that Senator Murphy asked me and I would like to give a specific answer.  He asked whether we are committed to go to the defence of one of our EEC partners who comes under attack.  My answer is as follows. Unlike those EEC members who are also members of NATO and who are obliged by the NATO Treaty to consider an attack on any NATO member as an attack on themselves.  Ireland is under no such obligation.  Ireland is not committed and this Government do not feel committed to act in the way referred to by Senator Murphy.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have raised the point of the effect of the Genscher-Colombo initiative.  Is it an example of the type of pressure Senator Murphy referred to in the opening of the debate? <Col N="1141" /> Is it going to lead to a pressure that we cannot withstand, which will push us in the particular direction of defence commitments?</P>
    <P>The first thing I should like to say is that the discussion of that initiative within the Community is only now beginning. Herr Genscher has been making speeches since the beginning of the year on this topic but the actual proposal for a new European Act was only launched the week before last.  It was mentioned at the Foreign Ministers' meeting; it was also the subject of an address to the European Parliament and it was mentioned at the Heads of Government meeting last week.  But these proposals of Mr. Genscher and Mr. Colombo for a major advance towards European Union have been widely publicised.  They would involve, if they were adopted <i>in toto</i>, the extension of the present inter-governmental system of political co-operation to cover matters relating to security and culture and some legal questions in the member states.  There are other aspects of the initiative but we are not concerned with them in this debate.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward that in the present climate of severe problems with the Community and deteriorating international relations, a new act of political will is required on the part of the members of the Community to provide the impetus for further progress towards European Union.  This is the argument in favour of the new initiative. That the Community has experienced severe problems is evident but we have to ask whether developing new inter-governmental structures as against building on the foundations established by the Treaties of Paris and Rome is the best approach towards resolving these problems. The attitude of this Government is quite clear: we wish to build on the Treaty foundations.  Senator O'Mahony has said that this is the way in which we should go.  If there is to be a parallel in development between development under the Treaty and more informal development such as occurred in European Political Co-operation, then certainly the non-Treaty side should not outrun or outstrip the development under the Treaty.  However, <Col N="1142" /> we are prepared to examine these proposals put forward, now formally, by the Federal Republic of Germany and by Italy, and we will be doing so in the coming months.  I hope to be able to report more fully on the proposals and what happens to them in a future debate as part of the periodic reports on our membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one point specifically made by Senator Cogan.  He seemed to feel that I have been guilty of some dereliction of duty in not having spoken on the Genscher initiative and he seemed to accuse me of having accepted that there should be a meeting of Defence Ministers.  I want to say that I have spoken in regard to Herr Genscher's early speeches on this initiative.  I spoke a few weeks ago here in Dublin to a meeting of the Young Federalists and I spoke then of our concern about the direction in which movement forward should go.  In regard to the possible meetings of Defence Ministers, the position is that, at the first opportunity which was the meeting at Brockett Hall I spoke with my colleagues on this topic and said clearly, without the slightest equivocation, that as far as we are concerned there can be no meeting of Defence Ministers within the EEC framework or within European Political Co-operation.  I say that categorically now.  Though that was a private meeting, my statement in this regard was leaked to the press by one of my colleagues so it is now public property.  I have made it absolutely clear that this is something which we feel would be going beyond the bounds of the political aspects of security.  One must recognise that it must be difficult at times for our partners to see this boundary as clearly as we do because of their dual membership of the Community and the alliance.  We must allow for the fact that if we are subject to some pressures now and then, they are not all deliberate pressures, that some of them are inadvertent.</P>
    <P>There is the question which arises from time to time and which Senator Murphy touched on &mdash; perhaps this is the position at the moment but what is to happen in the final analysis: what would be the <Col N="1143" /> situation in regard to defence on the completion of European Union?  On present indications the development of European integration to a stage where questions of common defence might arise for discussion is unlikely to be realised in the foreseeable future.  In any case, apart from Ireland's position, it is not certain that all the other European Community member states would be willing, even in the context of a Europe which has achieved full economic and political integration, to commit themselves fully to a separate European defence system if this appears likely to interfere with their existing ties in the Atlantic Alliance and the security which these ties afford them.  In practice, therefore, the situation in which we would be asked to enter into a joint defence commitment with our partners, is unlikely to arise in any concrete form and in the present circumstances the question is hypothetical.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy instances as one of the directions of pressure in regard to our neutrality, Anglo-Irish relations.  This is a question that has been raised from time to time, whether we would be prepared to contemplate a defence arrangement with the United Kingdom in return for changes in that country's policy in regard to Northern Ireland which would facilitate the re-unification of Ireland.  I certainly do not want to accuse Senator Murphy of misunderstanding the situation in Northern Ireland but the way in which this question is often posed indicates a misunderstanding of what the fundamental problem in Northern Ireland is.  The basic requirement in that situation is that we in this part of Ireland should work to bring about the consent of a majority in the North to re-unification in whatever form it might be agreed on.  Without such consent re-unification would bring its own serious problems springing from the disaffection of the present Northern majority.  To speak of our neutrality as something which could be traded for action by the United Kingdom in regard to Northern Ireland, is to miss the essence of the problem as we now see it more clearly.  Such an attitude belongs to Senator Murphy's own subject of history.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> I should like to make one last point in regard to a point that came up in the debate, and that is in regard to the question of the Sinai force.  Senator Cogan here seems to be accusing me of supporting a NATO decision in relation to the Sinai force.  I want to make it quite clear that the agreement of four European countries to take part in the Sinai peacekeeping force was not NATO's decision but a decision of those four countries, a decision taken under the procedure of European Political Co-operation after consultation with their fellow members of the Ten.  I want to stress that this is a peacekeeping force.  The attempts to have a UN peacekeeping force in regard to the Sinai evacuation failed because it was considered that it would inevitably attract a Soviet veto in the Security Council.  The only role which the other Community members have in regard to this force was that they confirmed in consultation that helping by providing men or supplies for the peacekeeping force in the Sinai and so aiding the evacuation of the Sinai was entirely compatible with the Community policy which had been declared at Venice under the previous administration.  I think Senators have all read in the newspapers about the difficulties which arose because the Community and the four members of the Community concerned were insisting that they had a policy and that they were going to stick to it.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered the points which have arisen and I hope that what I have said has been of assistance to Members of the House. I conclude by repeating the basic position that, while we accept that our place in the world is among the democracies whose values we share, it does not necessarily follow that this fact or our interests logically require membership in a military pact.  Our interests and the general interest, we believe are better served by remaining outside military alliances and making our contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security through our contribution to the work of the United Nations both in their deliberations at various <Col N="1145" /> committees and in their peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by expressing my gratitude for the opportunity which this motion affords to set out the Government's position on this important question and to assure the Seanad that it is not the intention of the Government to seek or to accept membership for Ireland in any military pact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  Fianna Fáil's view in relation to neutrality and military pacts is well known, and certainly should be well known.  Neutrality achieved its most difficult and most successful realisation during World War II.  This, of course, was Fianna Fáil policy, the policy of Mr. de Valera, and it was not merely a policy concept but one which was realised and implemented very successfully indeed. There has been no significant change in Fianna Fáil policy since that time.</P>
      <P>When we joined the European Community some years ago we made it clear right through the campaign that there would be no military commitment.  If there had been a military commitment I do not think Fianna Fáil would have supported joining the European Community. Since that time we have declined to join NATO and have rejected any effort to join NATO through the back door, or to become a member of any kind of a military pact or military understanding which would be another way of becoming associated with NATO.</P>
      <P>There have been moves afoot in the European Community in recent months which have given rise to considerable apprehension.  The Minister has had an opportunity to deal with this and he has clarified the position to a considerable extent.  He has made it clear that it is not the intention of the Government to become a member of a military pact, or to become associated in some roundabout way.  That is his position at the moment but it is not the end of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that there are serious intentions on the part of some members of the Community to have some kind of pact dealing with security, defence and military <Col N="1146" /> affairs.  It looks as though it is going to be persisted in and it would be necessary not merely to have the good intention to remain out of such an arrangement, but also to have the determination, no matter how hard this idea is pressed, not to be involved in any way. I hope the Government will be as determined and as forthright as the Fianna Fáil Government were in rejecting any kind of alliance or any kind of association of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of what our position would be in a united Europe, whether in such a situation we would have to join some kind of a military alliance.  It is true to say that, if there was a united Europe, it would be difficult to remain entirely unconcerned or unaligned from the military point of view. That is, of course, a very long distance away.  It is doubtful that we will ever have a united Europe in the way which was conceived some years ago and consequently we do not have to worry about it at this time.</P>
    <P>In any event, if there were a question of a united Europe, it could not be implemented as far as this country is concerned without a referendum when the people would have an opportunity to weigh up the pros and cons and the cost which might have to be paid if we were to join a united Europe &mdash; the cost in the sense of involving ourselves in a military commitment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt at present that we should not join any kind of military pact. I have no doubt that we should refuse completely to allow our territory to be used in any way by any foreign power, or by any member of the European Community. The further build-up of armaments and the deployment of existing armaments merely lead to further tensions and merely make more likely the event of a Third World War.  There can be no doubt whatever that there should be no question of this country becoming involved in any military pact.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that either the United States or the USSR want war or are willing to risk war merely to enlarge their territories or their spheres of influence. Their activities in recent years, their <Col N="1147" /> adventures such as the invasion of Afghanistan, were basically defensive measures, no matter how offensive they were, or how offensive they were from the point of view of our conception of neutrality and of peace.  It was, I think &mdash; and perhaps I am giving the benefit of the doubt to them; perhaps I am being too naive &mdash; merely a strategy to defend themselves, to deploy their defensive weapons so as to deter the other power.</P>
    <P>If both the United States and the USSR were in some way able to know what was in the mind of the other power and realise that neither power intended to actually start a war, the danger would pass and their would be a great relaxation of tension in the world.  Whatever their intentions may be, we certainly have no part in the build up that appears to be taking place at the moment and the effort to deploy weapons in further territories.  It certainly would not serve our purpose, or serve our interests.  I do not think our involvement would serve the world interest, the interest of peace in the world, in so far as our decision one way or another would have any significant effect.</P>
    <P>By remaining out of all such pacts and by retaining our role as an independent and neutral State, we can best serve the interests of world peace, as well as our own interests.  In fact, as previous speakers have said, we have already played a relatively important part in the past because of the fact that we are a neutral State.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note the trend in Europe at present, the refusal of the people from various countries to allow further missile bases to be built on their territory.  This is a very healthy sign, a good sign.  I hope it will grow.  If this attitude continues and grows, it will certainly be a great help in achieving disarmamant and in helping the talks which are taking place at present between Russia and the United States.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to deal with one point to which the Minister referred, that is in relation to Northern Ireland.  He shrugged off this question a little too easily.  Whereas I do not believe that defence, or militarty pacts, or anything of that nature, go to the basis of the <Col N="1148" /> difficulties we have to face in Northern Ireland, it is conceivable that at some future time when some kind of agreement may be possible in the North of Ireland, when some kind of agreement between the North, ourselves and Britain will be arriving at fruition, the question of some kind of military pact in relation to the North would be a condition of withdrawal by the British Government, and we would then have to face a very difficult decision indeed.  However, it may never occur and we do not have to make any such decisions at this time, but it is something that we should think about because it may arise in the futuire.  I conclude by welcoming this motion and by completely supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome this debate this evening for two reasons.  First, the subject is of great importance for a small independent State.  Secondly it is a subject around which a great deal of misinformation, myth and mystery have grown up over the past couple of years.  We have had a chance this evening to hear from the Minister a clear re-statement of our position on neutrality.  Much of the confusion of the past couple of months has been cleared up by as fine a statement of Ireland's position as I have ever heard.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the mood of the country is strongly against any significant change, probably against any change, in our present position.  In a strange way, the whole question of neutrality has become for some people a matter of central importance. For some people it has become one of the fundamental principles of sovereignty. For some of these people, the neutralists of the strict observance as I will call them, even to discuss the matter becomes at times something akin to treason. Any indication of a weakening of strict observance leads to attacks bordering on hysteria.  For that reason it was useful this evening to have a fair and sophisticated exposition of what is actually happening both in relation to NATO, which means that nothing is happening, and on the question of European political co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support our present policy, but I do <Col N="1149" /> so for one reason only.  It is the policy which best serves our national interests at this point in our history.  That was the reason why this policy was adopted in the first place.  When we adopted neutrality we did not do so for philosophical or ideological reasons.  We did it for reasons of national interest and survival.  I want to take issue with those who equate neutrality with sovereignty, and they are a significant number in our community.  I do not see any alignment, be it military or political, as in any sense an infringement on our sovereignty.  It is precisely because the member states of NATO are sovereign that they can enter into and withdraw freely from this type of alliance. They can do this when they feel it is in their interests to do so.  If it was not in their interests they obviously would not have joined in the first place.</P>
    <P>The right to choose to align ourselves or not to align ourselves is the fundamental aspect of sovereignty.  The ceding of neutrality, should we do so &mdash; and I do not think we will &mdash; would in fact be an exercise of that self-same sovereignty. The questions we must ask this evening, in the very short time available, are why we adopted the policy and has it served us well?  Is it still the best policy in present circumstances?</P>
    <P>It is important to remember why we adopted a policy of neutrality in the first place.  It was not because we were neutral in terms of ideology on the great questions of fascism, or communism, or parliamentary democracy in the thirties. There was no question of that.  We adopted our policies because, in Mr. de Valera's cool, rational, assessment it was in our best interests at that time.  Our survival lay in adopting that policy.  It was a gamble and it worked.  It worked in part because our neutrality was not pure neutrality. Our neutrality was certainly slanted very much in favour of the Allies in day to day activities.  It was partly because of this, and only a small part, that we managed to survive the trauma and the ordeal of war.</P>
    <P>After the war there was a very perceptible change in attitude.  Now neutrality became a pawn in the Partition game.  It was seen as a means to put pressure on <Col N="1150" /> Britain, or at least as a possible bargaining point at some future date.  This seems to have surfaced last year in Deputy Haughey's Anglo-Irish Summit with Mrs. Thatcher.  In the forties and fifties, as Senator Murphy mentioned, it was argued that we could not enter any alliance with Great Britain as long as Partition remained.  In other words, our neutrality was seen as practical rather than principle.  This can be seen very clearly, for example, when Mr. Seán MacBride, as Minister for External Affairs, talked to the US Ambassador and to high US officials about his willingness to establish a bilateral defence treaty between the US and Ireland.  In other words, we were not against alignment.  We were against alignment with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Of course since we entered the European Community the whole question has been raised to a new level of intensity. Those who support neutrality have made this a central issue in our policy, but often in a way which is not particularly clear. While not doubting the motives of those who support a strong position on neutrality, it is significant that many who are strongest in their support of a very hard line on neutrality are also strongest in opposition to the European Community. They are the same people who, for totally bona fide reasons, argued against going in.</P>
    <P>The other group among those who are strict observers of neutrality are the pacifists in our midst.  As Senator Murphy said, it would indeed be a saner world if those people who are marching on the streets against nuclear weapons and for peace were in the majority and, perhaps, in the seats of power.  In fact people who argue that if we stay out of a military alliance we will not be involved in judicial war may be right &mdash; that if we do not have armies we will not have wars.  It is a pity, however, that the realities are slightly different.  In fact, if we were serious about being non-aligned, if we were serious about military neutrality, unfortunately we would have to spend a far greater proportion of our GNP on our own defence, as do the seriously neutral non-aligned countries like Sweden and Switzerland.  The third group of those <Col N="1151" /> who favour strong neutrality are those like Senator O'Mahony who spoke in a very moving and idealistic way this evening about the benefits of a strong and positive position on neutrality, as did Senator Murphy, Senator Hussey and many other Senators.</P>
    <P>I know other Senators want to speak. I will sum up by saying that I believe that we should support the present policy because it has served us well, although at times it may have given us a sense of smugness and heightened our sense of isolation.  Our policy should remain based on the principle which served it when we adopted it.  It was a question of adopting a policy which best served our national interest.  We have to use our common sense on the full question of the military alignment.  For example, if in the future the question arises of having our offshore oil rigs protected if we have not got the resources to do so in the context of possible terrorist attacks, should we refuse to use the resources of our European neighbours and friends?  It may be a question of looking after our fisheries, although that is not the major problem at the moment.  These question may well arise and may well mean some weakening of strict military non-alignment.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that our policy has served us well.  It is one we should continue.  I would strongly counsel against a strict application of this policy as being one for all times.  We can use it as a strong bargaining position to strengthen that neutrality which the Minister outlined and which has served us well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion as it stands does not deal in actual fact with neutrality. It deals specifically with the question of whether we will or will not join a military pact.  There is a substantive difference between the argument on neutrality and the argument about joining a military pact.  It is appropriate that this motion should come before the House at a time when there has been an amount of talk in the European Community about some countries joining a military force which together with 1,214 members of <Col N="1152" /> the American forces will go into the Sinai on April 2 when the Israelis are reported to be moving out.  It is essential that we reiterate our total opposition to the EEC as a whole, or member states of the EEC joining a force which is going into the Middle East as part basically of the Camp David Agreement.  France, Italy, Holland and Britain are to support a force from America in going into the Sinai on April 2 if the Israelis withdraw.</P>
      <P>If those countries wanted to join a peacekeeping force of any description they would have been better off to do so on an individual basis rather than bringing it into the area of the EEC where we are involved.  Not alone are we involved in the EEC, but we are also involved in the UNIFIL forces.  There can be a conflict as to whether or not we are involved in this particular force because we are a member of UNIFIL and we want to protect our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> peacekeeping forces all over the world, but the fact is that we are not a member of NATO.</P>

      <P>Could I inform the Senator that it would be legally impossible for us?  We are entitled only to send our forces abroad on UN peacekeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are a member of the EEC.  The debate on the forces to go to the Sinai took place within the EEC.  We are not a member of NATO. Those countries are.  We must protect our situation.  We must not get involved in any such force.  The nations going in as part of the Sinai peacekeeping force are ill-advised in the sense that two of the countries involved have already been in that area of the Middle East as rulers of that area, Britain and France.  To think they can go in there as a peacekeeping force is ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the Middle East is a difficult one.  We must retain our non-involvement except in peace keeping, and we must try to persuade other nations not to get involved.  I sincerely hope that on April 2 there will be a withdrawal from the Sinai.  I hope the force which goes in there will be a UN force rather than a makeshift arrangement between <Col N="1153" /> the United States and these four European countries.</P>
    <P>We are in a difficult situation here. What is neutrality?  We cannot be neutral on aspects of international politics, as has been said by Senator Manning, if the situation arises when we get oil we have to protect it and if we cannot protect it we will have to bring in somebody else. I do not think we should get involved in an alliance.  We should use the United Nations.  It has been proved that the United Nations force is an effective force. If we need protection the UN should be brought in.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House would disagree with the wording of this motion.  I sincerely hope nobody would disagree with it.  The Americans have a vested interest in the Middle East and that is why we are getting involved in this discussion.  Their vested interest as they see it is to protect Israel.  That interest is created by the huge Zionist lobby in America, rather than the actual situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> America and Israel.  There is no doubt the Zionist lobby in America is dictating American policy on the Middle East.  It has been suggested that by sending AWACs to Saudi Arabia they are changing their attitude.  They are sending AWACs to Saudi Arabia to increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we reaffirm our commitment to the UNIFIL forces our standing as a nation which is not neutral but can go into a particular situation and provide a buffer will be maintained.  We should try to stop member states of the EEC from getting involved in any alignment of a military nature except under the aegis of the United Nations.  It is ill-advised for member states of the EEC to get involved in the situation in the Middle East.  It is even more ill-advised when two of the countries <Col N="1154" /> involved ruled that area for many years and ruled it very badly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It had not been my intention to intervene in this debate because I felt that the movers of the motion, Senators Murphy and McGuinness, had ably put the case for an unequivocal declaration by the Government about our not joining a military pact.  I felt that the Minister in his reply dealt with the spirit of the movers of the motion, the concern that they expressed, and the removal of doubts in people's minds, if there were any.  Apparently there were some doubts in people's minds, or some grey area. Such doubts will have been removed by the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand the content of Senator Lanigan's contribution.  It was not compatible with the Minister's response to the motion.  Senator Lanigan contended that there was a fundamental difference between a military pact and neutrality. No two matters are so closely related as those.  Senator Lanigan should realise that one cannot enter into a military pact without affecting one's neutrality and one cannot remain neutral and enter into a military pact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entry into the EEC, as we know, aroused certain elements of doubt into people's minds especially peace-loving people, pacifists and others who opposed entry &mdash; particularly those who were worried about the sovereignty of their country &mdash; because they felt that entry into the European Community might involve some semblance of a hidden allegiance to NATO.  It was refreshing today to hear the Minister state categorically that he has conceded no such undertaking, that he has defended that fact that Ministers for Defence of the European Community shall not meet.  Senator O'Mahony has articulated our standpoint on this from a Labour Party point of view.  We have discussed our neutral stand throughout Europe with our Socialist colleagues in the Community, indeed worldwide with the Socialist International.  Our stand is like that of the Government, unequivocal. The contribution of Senator E. Ryan whose views I respect, worried me further because underlying his statement <Col N="1155" /> that there was absolutely no doubt where Fianna Fáil stood, I sensed that that statement indicated that at some future stage in our evolution &mdash; in Europe or in any other political alliance throughout the world &mdash; possibly a time might come when this whole question of our neutrality would be subjected to a change of policy or to a referendum if our constitutional situation was questioned.  I hope, when I read his contribution in the records of this debate, I will be proved wrong in this.</P>
    <P>In the beginning he confirmed their stand and then went on to elaborate on it.  I got the feeling that at some future date it might be possible that Fianna Fáil would take a different stand.  That would be unwelcome.  I hope Senator E. Ryan did not mean that.  Indeed, that was the only reason for my intervention.  I felt the Minister had dealt adequately with the spirit of the motion, that he had clarified or abolished any anomalies that had arisen from this debate that has continued in this country for most of this year. During the general election at a meeting in Killarney of the Socialist group people expressed concern there about a commitment of a former Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We were at pains to try to point out that we felt they were worried unduly about certain interpretations of a previous Minister because none of us questioned Ireland's neutrality.  I am glad that the Minister has confirmed today that we stand squarely behind the spirit of this motion.  I compliment both Senators for having given the Minister an opportunity to respond positively to this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put it on the record that I would have been quite happy to accommodate Senator Whitaker. I am even happier now that I can hear him in full and perhaps make my own contribution.</P>
      <P>I am particularly happy that, in a debate on our possible links in the future, or rumours of links with military pacts, there has been clear political progress made in this country in the perception of our role and position in the world.  I well remember ten or 12 years ago, on many successive Saturdays, participating in many great and small marches to the American Embassy to protest about the war in Vietnam and being criticised &mdash; not directly personally but by implication &mdash; as a Communist sympathiser because it was not understood that that was really a crusade against Communism.  I was much happier to see the much more objective, detached and balanced view that we have on a similar attempt by the United States in El Salvador.  Therefore I feel happy that some people like myself, Senator Quinn, Senator O'Mahony and indeed many others, perhaps contributed in some small way to political progress in this country by, shall we call them, extra curricular activities on those occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of military pacts presupposes that there is some benefit in militarism at present.  I am not too sure, given the capacity for mutual destruction that the world now possesses, that there is any great difference whether you are in a military pact and therefore destroyed or outside a military pact and therefore destroyed.  Whichever way it goes, if we have a war in the way the world is now organised what will happen to us is that we will be obliterated.  There is a slight tendency, emanating particularly from <Col N="1158" /> the United States, to suggest that there can be winners in a nuclear war.  Talk about joining military pacts and use of words, interchangeable, like &ldquo;defence&rdquo;, &ldquo;security&rdquo; and so on are not advisable. There is no such thing as &ldquo;defence&rdquo; in nuclear war.  There is no such thing as &ldquo;security&rdquo; in nuclear war.  Nuclear war leads to mutual and complete destruction; that is its only consequence.  There will be no limited nuclear war and no survivors worth talking about.  A few marginal people in the remotest areas of the United States and the Soviet Union might survive but the world as we know it will be totally obliterated.  Therefore military pacts for mutual defence have a hollow ring and deserve to be examined somewhat further.</P>
    <P>The first case to be advanced is that military expenditure is enormously wasteful expenditure.  Apparently we must multiply the number of times we can destroy the world individually and collectively in order to deter others.  Apparently if we can destroy the world twelve times and they can destroy it only ten times that is taken to constitute a deterrent.  I think it was Kruschev who said that destroying the world once ought to be sufficient for anybody's tastes in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is a scandalous contradiction in values in this whole area of military expenditure and military defence.  We keep on talking about the problems of the world, we keep on talking about what is needed and what is necessary.  At the same time we spend vast sums of money on military equipment.  This sort of frightening prospect of nuclear war ought to be of greater concern to us.  It saddens me that the pacifist and peace movement, so prominent and active all over western Europe, seems to be unknown and unheralded here.  Possibly it is one of the unfortunate side effects of our somewhat ambivalent neutrality that our young people here do not seem to realise the prospects for this country.  In many ways I wish the motion could have been worded more strongly and called upon the Government to ensure that neither in this part of the country &mdash; nor to the extent of their influence in any part of this island &mdash; would there be any <Col N="1159" /> nuclear missiles positioned at any stage now or in the future.  We have no role to play in that new and refined form of barbarity.  It is important in this whole area of neutrality and military pacts to remember something: there are no good guys in the world conflict between the super powers.</P>
    <P>As many abominations have been committed directly or indirectly in the name of freedom by the United States and its agents as have been committed in the name of Communism by the Soviet Union and its agents.  It is questionable to pretend that there are some good guys in the world on whose side we would ultimately fall if there was a conflict.  In theory, democracy and freedom are obviously a better choice.  But the things that have been done in the name of democracy and freedom should give us all great cause to question any possible benefit that could accrue to this country from such a military or defence alliance. The Soviet Union has invaded Czechoslovakia, Hungary and now Afghanistan. It might be as well to remember that the United States started off all this interventionism in Guatemala in 1953 and went on through Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile and El Salvador.  So there are no good guys.  Any pretence that there is one side that we might possibly lean towards as distinct from another is not realistic.  We ought to educate ourselves further.</P>
    <P>All this talk about militarism and military blocs fosters a kind of simplistic idea.  There is a good case, with respect to Senator Manning, to be made for pacifism. There is a good case to be made that the whole attitude to war and warfare reflects an inadequcy in our social development which ought to be challenged fundamentally and not by the sort of goodwill that we normally hear expressed, that we will abolish arms if the other side do.  Somebody has to challenge that vicious cycle of armaments and further armaments until somebody else is better than us.</P>
    <P>There is a good case to be made, for instance, for unilateral nuclear disarmament. There is no case for our pretending that we can link up with some sort of <Col N="1160" /> European security or defence with our EEC partners at some hypothetical day in the future when we agree with them on these issues.  We seem to be moving in that direction.  I understand, for instance, that we still recognise the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, or Kampuchea, the regime which was guilty of the most appalling genocide since Hitler.  Because of some technicality to do with the sort of issue that we often can ignore &mdash; because we did not like the way the Government was got rid of &mdash; we still recognise the most appalling genocidal regime in south east Asia.  Perhaps we do not.  I am subject to correction by the Minister. Will the Minister correct me?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. Obviously I would be out of order engaging in a dialogue with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to place on record a couple of simple facts.  One is that what the world spends on armaments in two weeks would feed, clothe, house and provide medical supplies for all the world's poor.  That is an important thing.  All the world's poor include &mdash; and I am quoting here from President Fidel Castro, the President of the People's Republic of Cuba &mdash; 570 million who are under-nourished, 800 million illiterate adults, 1.5 billion who are totally lacking in medical care, 1.3 billion who have an annual income of under $90 and 1.7 billion who have under 60 years of life expectancy; children who are not attending schools 250 million, unemployed 1,000 billion. They are the people the world could provide for if armaments no longer existed.  They are the people to whom we should be directing our objectives.  Even though we ought to be neutral between the two great super powers, we ought not to be neutral on the fundamental issues of the world.  We ought to be positively on the side of the Third World, positively on the side of the oppressed, positively <Col N="1161" /> on the side of the poor in the world.  May I say that it causes me a slight amount of pain that I can talk about the poor of the world in this House and apparently will have difficulty in talking about the poor of this country.</P>

      <P>Más deireannach fhéin ié, fáiltím roimh an Aire agus gúim lsíocháin lena linn.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for extending the time available and I do not want to abuse that generosity.  As strongly as anyone else, I would wish and hope that we can stay out of and be immune in any major war.  But I cannot see that any desire or hope of ours is sure of fulfilment in such a situation; that is my worry. There can be no assurance that our neutrality would be respected and there is certainly no way by which, on our own, we could ensure that it would be respected or could defend it successfully if it were violated.  It has been suggested that nuclear missiles are already trained on Irish airports, if not on our cities.  With that awesome language frequently used by experts in the field, Professor Laurence Martin in a BBC lecture recently said that &ldquo;if nuclear deterrence is the doctrinal centrepiece of contemporary strategy, Europe is its geopolitical focus.&rdquo;  There is naught in that for our comfort.  Nor was I comforted by Senator Murphy's doubt or disbelief about Russia's aggressive intentions in Europe.  Nor was I comforted by Senator Brendan Ryan's thought that whether we are neutral or not we would be blasted out of it anyway.</P>
      <P>We might say, with some credibility, that we would never join any defensive alliance if we had both the will and the might to make a significant or even a plausible effort to defend ourselves in a so-called conventional war. But we certainly have not that might and, for that reason, any declaration of permanent negative intent on our part could be said to be either imprudent or unreliable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By all means let us remain neutral as long as we can but let us see neutrality in its true light, as an expression of an aspiration rather than of a definitely achievable purpose, and as something that may <Col N="1162" /> last only as long as it suits others stronger than us but which it is to our advantage to maintain while we can.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread notion that, for Ireland, neutrality is a traditional policy. I am not pursuaded of this.  Neutrality, in an unqualified sense, has never been a principle of our foreign policy as I see it. In a world of confrontation between major powers our ideological sympathies are with Western democracy rather then with Eastern totalitarianism.  During the last war Irish neutrality was skilfully maintained and, fortunately, was not in fact violated despite recurrent risks and temptations.  Our observance of neutrality during that war, though formally scrupulous, was, in practice, benevolent towards the Allied powers.  We declared that any attempt to make the Republic a base of attack on the United Kingdom would be resisted by us.  As we all know, tens of thousands of our people fought and worked on the Allied side.</P>
    <P>When the formation of NATO was being considered after the war, we received an invitation from the United States Government to join.  We rejected this, as Senator Murphy said in his opening speech, not on any grounds of principle &mdash; indeed, we declared our agreement with the objectives of NATO &mdash; but because we thought our possible importance in anti-submarine and air warfare gave us a lever we could use against Partition. We wanted the United States to put pressure on Britain in this matter. Mr. Seán MacBride's response to the invitation as our then Foreign Minister was couched in such extremist language as would be unthinkable for any Government to use to-day.  I refer to, but will not quote from, the Aide Mémoire we presented to the United States Government on 9 February 1949.  It is to be noted that, although we baulked at the NATO obligation to respect and join in defending the territorial integrity of the parties because the parties included the &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;, we did not object later to joining the United Nations whose charter commits us to respect the sovereignty of the other members and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the <Col N="1163" /> territorial integrity of any state.  When we took our United Nations seat in 1956, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, then Minister for External Affairs, said that we would not be associated with particular blocs or groups as far as possible but, at the same time, that Ireland would support those powers which were dedicated to preserving freedom from communism &mdash; in effect, Canada, the United States and Western Europe.</P>
    <P>To return to 1949 for a moment, the American reply to our rejection of their invitation to join NATO was in effect &ldquo;it's been nice knowing you.&rdquo;  Dr. Ronan Fanning of University College, Dublin, in a paper published by the Royal Irish Academy in 1979 has outlined the consideration given subsequently by the United States Government to informal suggestions from the Irish side about the possibility of a mutually beneficial bilateral defence arrangement under which Ireland would receive American military aid but would avoid commitments it would have to undertake if it became a member of NATO.  I mention this only to confirm that unqualified neutrality has not been our invariable official policy.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of our non-commitment to a policy of neutrality in all circumstances is provided by the quite recent stance of the leader of Fianna Fáil who, as Taoiseach, declared in the Dáil on the 11 March last that, if an appropriate political solution of the Irish unity problem were arrived at &ldquo;we would of course have to review what would be the most appropriate defence arrangements for the island as a whole.  It would be unrealistic and improvident not to do so ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact that the concerting of special defence arrangements with Britain could be contemplated by Fianna Fáil was a mark of courage and a major gain for good sense.</P>
    <P>I regard in the same light the commitment expressed by successive heads of Government, both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, in relation to our readiness to participate in any common defence arrangements which the European Community may ultimately, or hypothetically, <Col N="1164" /> develop and agree in the context of political unity and a unified foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by repeating that neutrality, though justifiable and appropriate as a policy for ourselves at present, and indeed a help in various ways to the preservation of peace in the world, is unfortunately not within our competence to maintain unilaterally even if we wished to do so in all circumstances.  We must recognise that, in the last resort, our defence depends on the goodwill and the action of others.  Neutrality is not traditional and cannot be an invariable principle. Whether it was a principle or not, we have no guarantee of immunity in time of war.  Although it is beyond our capacity to defend ourselves, I do think we should make sure that all of us know how best to behave for our own safety in the event of an outbreak of war involving the use of nuclear missiles.  It seems a long time since we were given any official guidance on this subject.  We must also pray for the success of the talks which have started in Geneva with a view to lessening the risk of Europe becoming a nuclear battleground.</P>

      <P>I do not think I will take up the entire time.  The House has been generous with its time already.  I am glad that the motion has met with general support.  Senator Whitaker would have a fundamentally different world view from myself in these matters in that I see neutrality not simply as the response of this island to its situation in the world but as the view this nation has of the world as a whole.  Both he and Senator B. Ryan are right in that fundamentally there is no defence against nuclear war.  Therefore the question does arise as to whether it makes any difference whether we are inside or outside a military pact if the worst happened.  But, of course, there is a moral position to be taken up, and as long as there is life there is hope, and as long as there is hope there is the possibility of action and of combination with other small countries.  Therefore it is not to escape the nuclear holocaust but to do our little best to prevent a nuclear holocaust that we should maintain the position of neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> Referring again to Senator Ryan's point about scandalous waste on armaments, I touched on that in my own address and we had a debate here on the Brandt Report, perhaps a year ago, in which there were very detailed figures on the incredible amounts that poor countries spend on armaments when they need to spend it on their own population. One of the things we should be doing at meetings in the EEC is impressing on our partners how scandalous it is for some of them to be conniving at this situation by profiting through arms sales to all kinds of countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning's support for the motion was also very qualified since he saw neutrality as a kind of contingent issue which might well be changed in the future.  Otherwise I was glad to note the support, from the Fianna Fáil speakers particularly.  It is only what indeed I would have expected from a party whose founder ultimately preferred that this State should rule its own destinies rather than trade it off for any will-o-the-wisp benefit in the long term, whose classic statement was &ldquo;neutrality is not for sale&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator G. Hussey and others, and indeed the Minister, brought up the context of Northern Ireland.  So did Senator Ryan.  Let me clarify my own position on that.  I was not saying anything so simplistic as that the solution to the problems in Ireland would be in terms of trading our neutrality for a defence pact with Britain.  But within the general discussions between the sovereign powers it is not unlikely, to say the least, that the United Kingdom would in the case of withdrawal from this island, have a particular regard to its security and strategic interests.  In that kind of situation a trade-off could become a factor.</P>
    <P>In that kind of situation I think our Government leader, if and when the day comes, might well again look to Eamon de Valera, in whose regard I am, shall we say, a certain admirer, because when militant Irish-Americans in 1920 were saying to him &ldquo;being independent means you have to be anti-British&rdquo; he said &ldquo;no, Britain would legitimately <Col N="1166" /> require certain assurances for her security and we can supply that by observing our version of the Monroe Doctrine&rdquo;, in other words, by giving a solemn guarantee that we will not allow our island to become a base for attacks on Britain.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, something of the same resourceful solution should not be hit upon again if the time comes.  Indeed, the ghost of de Valera looms over this debate in more ways than one, because when I heard Senator Dooge making the fine distinctions that are involved in the EPC clarification it would indeed take a de Valera to maintain these distinctions and to see that they are observed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view of Senator Lanigan on the EEC proposed Sinai force.  I share his apprehensions on that point.  I would ideally prefer to support Senator O'Mahony's view of neutrality, in other words, that it should be positively pushed into a political philosophy; ideally it should be non-alignment.  But we have to have regard to realities and I, for one, accept that our neutrality policy has never been actually non-alignment.  It has been a kind of continuation of the beneficial neutrality of World War II in a way. Henry Kissinger once described us fleetingly, in one reference out of 600 pages, as a reliable and constructive neutral. Some other American put a colloquial gloss on that by saying we were the kind of neutral you could bring home to mother.  There is a sense in which we have to remain that kind of neutral.  But I still maintain that it is in absolute keeping with our history, our tradition, our world view, our relations to the Third World that we should resolutely set our face against a military pact.  I was glad to hear the Minister's explanations in that regard and I am reasonably satisfied with the assurances that he gave that essentially what the London Report did was to clarify and formalise an existing position.</P>
    <P>I take this to be the nub of the argument between the Government and the Opposition in this regard.  I accept that, but at the same time I think it is also true that there is a difference between clarifying the position on the one hand, and <Col N="1167" /> attempting to push and widen the scope on the other.  It would be disingenuous to suggest that all that is involved is clarifying the position.  There is obviously an Italian-German axis, if that is not the inappropriate word to use in the circumstances, which would want to widen the scope as distinct from a kind of British-based idea that what is needed, perhaps, is a clarification.</P>
    <P>In two respects I welcome the Minister's view.  One is his own belief that there should be a kind of a parallelism here, that there should be no pushing on the foreign and defence policy sections until and unless there is at least some progress on the social and economic promise of the EEC which has not been delivered.</P>
    <P>The other is, it seems to me, that the Minister has made a fundamental or important distinction from a Fianna Fáil position over the years in that, beginning with Seán Lemass long before we joined the Community and articulated by Dr. Hillery and again by Mr. O'Kennedy, we have had the repeated position from the Fianna Fáil side that if any of our EEC partners were attacked we would go to their defence.  We had today from the Minister an assurance that his Government <Col N="1168" /> do not regard the situation in that light, that we are not so committed, and I think that is a useful distinction.</P>
    <P>Finally, Herr Genscher has been mentioned numerous times.  It is a new name for us to get our tongues around.  We might remind ourselves that he has his own particular set of prejudices and positions.  He is a member of the Liberal Party in the German Federal Republic, which is to say that he is well to the right of the centre and that his party does fervently believe in the siting of American nuclear weapons in Europe.  So we should keep a cautious eye out for the same gentleman.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleague, my supporter, Senator McGuinness who made a spirited contribution and the Minister, who, of course belatedly at this stage, as an old UCC colleague, I must congratulate and wish well.</P>
