      <P>This Bill is the first comprehensive piece of legislation concerned with the treatment of mental illness to come before the Oireachtas since the enactment of the Mental Treatment Act of 1945.  Before 1945 the treatment of mental illness had not been the subject of legislation since the heyday of Victorian mental hospital building.  From this chronology it might appear that legislation makes only sporadic and widely-separated forays into an area which raises many serious questions of importance to doctors and lawyers and which has effects on one of the most vulnerable sections of society.  In a sense this is true and reflects a more widespread reluctance among the public to interest themselves in the whole area of mental illness and its treatment.  On the other hand the years in this century in which legislation has been passed, 1945 and 1981, mark fairly obvious milestones in changes in attitudes to mental illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nineteenth century legislation was enacted in an era which saw no hope or <Col N="1906" /> future for those diagnosed as suffering from mental disorders, and created large institutions, often in isolated parts of the country, to contain and separate those whose behaviour would not be tolerated or understood: little distinction was made between those who were considered lunatics and those who committed criminal offences.  They were both dealt with by similar judicial procedures and consigned to almost identical institutions. The similarity in architecture between some of our older mental hospitals and prisons constructed at the same time is striking.</P>
    <P>By 1945 attitudes to mental illness had changed considerably.  The origins and causes of mental illness were better understood and consequently modes of treatment became available which, though they may not have effected cures in the strict medical sense, did at least help people to manage the symptoms of their conditions and so helped gain acceptance for the notion of mental &ldquo;illness&rdquo;. These mental hospitals replaced lunatic asylums and, for the purpose of committals, judicial procedures were replaced by medical certification.  This was the major advance made in the Mental Treatment Act of 1945.</P>
    <P>During the entire span of human activity enormous changes have occurred since 1945 and so it is only proper that the legislation dealing with mental illness should be re-examined in the light of contemporary needs and attitudes.  This is not to suggest, of course, that no legislative changes or changes in the organisation of services for the mentally ill have occurred in the past 36 years.  The Mental Treatment Act of 1945 was amended in 1953 and again in 1961.  The Report of the Commission on Mental Illness was published in 1966.  Many of its recommendations which did not require legislation have since been implemented.</P>
    <P>The Health Act of 1970 which radically altered the pattern of delivery of health services also affected the mental health services.  That Act obliged health boards to provide in-patient and out-patient services for patients suffering from mental disability &mdash; a point missed by some critics of the Bill.  Therefore, in the light <Col N="1907" /> of the number of amendments which had already been made to the 1945 Act, and the general re-organisation of the health services which had occurred in the early seventies, it was felt that the Bill which is now before you was necessary to reflect the changes which had already taken place as well as providing a legislative framework flexible enough to accommodate changes likely to occur in future years.  The obvious question arises now of how to construct such a framework.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is that the Bill should reflect contemporary and likely future attitudes to those suffering from mental illness.  An obvious starting point is that mental illness is indeed an &ldquo;illness&rdquo; much like any physical ailment.  Its causes may be more complex and difficult to find, but it most obviously must have a cause and much mental illness must have a cure.  These characteristics are common to all branches of medicine.  Therefore, a fundamental principle of this Bill and of the mental health services is that, where possible, mental illness is treated on a similar footing to physical illness.</P>
    <P>There are obviously some areas where special facilities and procedures may be needed, and these must be the concern of mental health legislation.  In my view there is no need for special legislation to deal with the patient who voluntarily presents for treatment for some acute disorder. The Health Acts are perfectly adequate to deal with such cases, which constitute the great majority of admissions to mental hospitals.  Special provision needs to be made for those who, by reason of the severity of their illness, are no longer capable of making the rational decision to seek and accept appropriate treatment.  I make no apology for the fact that the bulk of this Bill is concerned with the provisions which need to be made for this category of patient.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of discussion the Bill can be readily divided into three areas: the registration and supervision of psychiatric institutions, admission and discharge procedures and safeguards for patients.</P>
    <P>As I have just mentioned, these are areas which are not of general concern to <Col N="1908" /> voluntary patients except where indicated in the Bill, and this approach has led to some misunderstanding.  Some critics have claimed that the Bill does nothing for the voluntary patient, and that it does not make provision for community care services or out-patient clinics.  Anyone familiar with health legislation knows that there is provision for all of these categories of patient and service in existing health legislation.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the three main areas of the Bill as I have outlined them I will indicate where major amendments were made to the Bill in its course through the Dáil.  As I have said before, I welcome comments and suggestions as to how the Bill might be improved.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the registration and supervision of psychiatric centres the Bill aims to simplify the existing categories of institutions.  In future there will be only two basic types of psychiatric hospital, district psychiatric centres run by health boards and registered psychiatric centres run by private individuals or organisations. These centres will provide treatment and care for the overwhelming majority of psychiatric patients.  A third minor category are registered psychiatric homes which would provide convalescent home care.  There is only one such home at present.</P>
    <P>In basing the services on psychiatric centres I do not mean to imply that hospital care is the only treatment for mental illness.  I regard the modern psychiatric hospital or unit as a resource centre which provides in-patient care as only one element of a total service.</P>
    <P>The hospital also services out-patient clinics, day hospitals and hostels.  It is also the base for the community psychiatric nursing service.  Of course hospitalisation will be needed for some patients, even if only for a short period.  However the objective is to keep this period to a minimum and to return the patient to a full life in the community where treatment can be continued if necessary.</P>
    <P>In dealing with admission and discharge procedures the Bill simplifies matters by proposing to have only one category of detained patient.  In this context <Col N="1909" /> I should point out that the Bill abolishes the existing category of a person of unsound mind, who was subject to indefinite detention.  However the major change is the requirement that two medical practitioners should sign a recommendation for reception before a person is detained in a psychiatric centre.  This change has aroused some controversy, though I should point out that such a requirement already exists for private patients.  It has been argued that there are areas of the country where it might be difficult to get two doctors in an emergency. To allay such fears I introduced an amendment in the Dáil which allows the Minister to designate geographical areas or circumstances in which the signature of one doctor will suffice.  I hope that such areas do not exist and that such circumstances will not arise, as I believe that the two-doctor requirement is a reasonable one where nothing less than the deprivation of an individual's liberty is at stake.  I could not consider the insertion of a more general emergency procedure as I believe that where such procedures are available they rapidly become the norm.  Experience elsewhere provides ample evidence of this tendency.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, these procedures apply only to those who need to be detained.  They do not affect voluntary patients seeking treatment of their own accord.</P>
    <P>Section 19, subsection (5) (vi) requires that the doctor who signs a recommendation for reception must each certify:</P>
    <P>(i) that the person is suffering from mental disorder of such a degree that detention and treatment in a psychiatric centre are necessary in the interest of the person's health or safety of the protection of other persons or property, and</P>
    <P>(ii) that the person is not prepared to accept or is not suitable for treatment otherwise than as a detained patient. </P>
    <P>These criteria are as amended in the Dáil.  In the course of the consultation process which I initiated on the Bill's circulation I was advised that this formulation of the criteria for detention is <Col N="1910" /> more in keeping with the contemporary terminology of psychiatry.</P>
    <P>There is one point to which I must make special reference.  I was, reluctantly I must say, persuaded to make one change in the area of the voluntary patient, and that was to agree under extreme pressure in the Dáil and by the medical profession to require that such a patient give 24 hours notice of his or her intention to leave hospital.  I was persuaded primarily on the grounds that it was necessary in the interests of a small number of cases to do so.  Deputy Browne took issue with me for doing so, and I found the amendment difficult to defend since it represented a marking out of a difference between the person undergoing treatment voluntarily for psychiatric illness and a person undergoing treatment for any other illness.  This part of the Bill also makes considerable improvements to the whole area of patients' rights.  New procedures are introduced to inform patients of what is happening at each step in the detention process and of their rights under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fear of indefinite detention in a mental hospital is almost certainly one of the main reasons for a certain reserve which attaches to the psychiatric service. To allay this fear and so, we hope, to remove any remaining concern on this point the Bill has a number of provisions establishing review procedures for all detained patients.  The most significant change is the establishment of review boards to which a detained patient or other categories of persons designated by section 38 can apply for an independent review of the need for continued detention. These boards will consist of one consultant psychiatrist, one legal practitioner and a third person who is not a member of the medical or legal professions. Each health board area will be served by one or more review board or boards.  This is a most significant development, which has been widely welcomed by those interested in the care of the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>Some elements in the medical profession have been concerned that the consultant psychiatrist's advice might be ignored or over-ruled by the other two <Col N="1911" /> members of the review board.  As I said during Second Stage debate in the Dáil, this seems to me to postulate a very abstract and unreal situation.  I cannot seriously believe that highly qualified psychiatrists would not be able to articulate their opposition to the discharge of a patient in a manner which would convince their non-medical colleagues.</P>
    <P>In practice, of course, the non-medical members of the board will have the fullest regard for the professional opinion of their medical colleague and also to the opinion of the medical consultant in the psychiatric centre where the patient is detained.</P>
    <P>There has been, I might say, a criticism of the absence of definition of treatment. It is in my view impossible to provide a meaningful legislative definition of treatment. In any case such a provision would serve little purpose.  Programmes of treatment now encompass not only the application of medical treatment and nursing care but increasingly demand the establishment and development of a very high degree of personal integration between staff and patients.  Patient activation has become a major element in the treatment of mental illness&mdash;occupational and industrial therapies, workshop activity, social intergration and so on.  Because treatment is not defined in this Bill does not mean treatment is not provided.  Of the patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals 90 per cent have been there for less than three months and in 1978, total discharges came to 26,684 as opposed to a total admissions figure of 27,662.  These figures reflect a high level of treatment activity. Further, despite a trebling of the number of annual admissions to psychiatric hospitals during the last 20 years, the public hospital in-patient population has fallen by about one-third over this period, that is from 19,400 patients in 1960 to 12,500 patients in public hospitals at present.</P>
    <P>A feature of the hospital service provided for psychiatrically-ill persons is that provided by acute units associated with general hospitals.  There are 400 such beds and a further 500 such beds are being built or are in planning.  Even more <Col N="1912" /> significant are the developments which have taken place in the provision of informal treatment in the community setting. Day centres and the provision of treatment at home are both areas which can prevent unnecessary hospitalisation in the first place, while an increasing use of residential hostels to provide intermediate and after-care services for discharged patients can serve to provide rehabilitative care and thus minimise readmissions.</P>
    <P>In 1977, there were 30 supervised hostels within a community setting, providing care for some 300 patients.  There are now 600 patients cared for in more than 60 such hostels.  Community psychiatric services are provided by 200 psychiatric out-patient clinics and by 150 community psychiatric nurses at which there are annually now more than 180,000 attendances by 36,000 patients.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by a number of critics that I should specify in the legislation minimum standards of care for mentally-ill patients.  Such a proposition raises interesting questions.  Can one, for example, set down minimum standards of professionalism and dedication on the part of medical nursing and other personnel caring for patients?  Professionalism and dedication are, of course, essential not merely in ensuring the efficacy of treatment and in securing the necessary degree of individual attention for patients but also in developing a humane and caring environment within the hospital setting.  However, it has never been made clear how professionalism and dedication could in practice be regulated and then &ldquo;policed&rdquo;.  Such a system would totally undermine the self-confidence of staff, assuming as it would a lack of basic competence on their part.  Such a system would also necessitate a constant intrusion by central authority into the day-to-day operation of psychiatric hospitals, thus robbing staff of their basic authority and independence.  This draconian situation would be a logical outcome of any attempt to define in law a concept as nebulous as that of &ldquo;adequate treatment&rdquo; for the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>The question of minimum standards of mental health care would include matters <Col N="1913" /> such as accommodation, patient dignity and privacy and so on.  The general question of the feasibility of providing for minimum standards in these tangible areas is at present under consideration in association with the Irish Medical Association. I am strongly of the opinion that any meaningful standards of mental health care would also have to encompass closely related questions such as activation programmes for patients, and the degree to which staff-patient integration contributes to simulating normal life settings. These are complex topics which cannot be provided for in legislation, but which might be catered for by general &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In concluding may I ask Senators to approach the legislation in the spirit in which it has been introduced, namely, that of bringing the custodial element of the psychiatric service into line with the requirements of the late twentieth century to protect the best interests of those who need to be detained for treatment? The provision in section 13 of the Bill that nothing in the admission and discharge procedures should be seen as discouraging a person from being admitted voluntarily for care and treatment is intended to emphasise the fact that for more than 90 per cent of patients requiring to go to hospital for treatment for psychiatric illness there is essentially no difference between them and anybody entering hospital for treatment for a physical ailment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that the Minister is a little disappointed at the reception which has been given to this Bill in the other House and also by interested parties. The Minister possibly expected that, because this was the first major piece of legislation in this field since 1945, there would have been a greater welcome for it and possibly a recognition that it was a significant measure.  Part of the reason for the low key reception of the Bill is that it is to some extent an anti-climax when one considers the expectations that were raised for legislation and reform in this area by the manifesto of 1977.  There was an undertaking in that manifesto for a complete reorganisation of the mental <Col N="1914" /> health service and for a comprehensive national programme for the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>When we look at this Bill in the light of those undertakings we have every reason to be grievously disappointed. Regarding the first undertaking &mdash; to undertake a complete reorganisation of the mental health service &mdash; I do not think anyone could argue in even the slightest degree that this Bill fulfils that undertaking.  As the Minister has said, the Bill is a comparatively narrow Bill in so far as what it deals with is the law concerning the minority of mental illness cases, those who have to be compulsorily admitted to hospital and compulsorily treated.  That is the essence of what the Bill is about and the vast majority of the sections in the Bill deal with that particular part of the problem.  As I say, the patients in that category are a very small minority of the total.  I do not think that a Bill dealing with their admission and discharge and providing for the registration and supervision of psychiatric institutions can be called a Bill that provides for a complete reorganisation of the mental health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that professionalism is not something that can be legislated for.  This is something that comes from the level of training and the personal commitment of the professionals concerned, and I sympathise with him in having to sustain that particular criticism. I do not think there is a need for him to be as defensive about it as he was in his opening speech here.  One can sympathise, too, with the critics who argue for the highest degree of professionalism and the highest levels of care to deal with all ill people, but it is a mistaken notion to think that an Act of Parliament can lay down the level of care.  That is something that comes from the training and the commitment primarily of the people involved, but it is something that also depends on a third factor, and here the Minister could have a role to play.  That third factor is the infrastructure &mdash; we will call it that &mdash; that the State provides for these people to exercise their professional role.  I recall when moving changes in the adoption law that there was considerable <Col N="1915" /> pressure for the introduction of standards in the adoption law concerning the level of expertise in adoption work, and, like the Minister, I had to point out that an Act of Parliament cannot provide for specific levels of expertise.  That is a matter for the persons concerned, their dedication, commitment, professional skill and training, though one can provide the general context in which these people operate so as to provide the optimum context so that their services can be best availed of and can be most effectively implemented.  Again the Bill is not very encouraging from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his concluding remarks spoke of the improvements that might be made in that area when he spoke of providing for more sophisticated therapy units and so on.  Again, I find the Bill is a bit depressing in that there is no indication by the Minister of a clear longterm policy for providing this enhanced and improved physical infrastructure for the mental health services.  It is referred to, but I suppose one cannot blame the Minister for being reticent about this because the money that would be involved would be substantial and the Minister, having regard to the promises that he has made in recent tours of the country for the expenditure of many thousands of millions in medical institutions of one kind or another, would really pass the credibility gap if he were to come in here and talk about the further millions that would be necessary to do what would need to be done to fulfil the manifesto undertaking of a complete re-organisation of the mental health service.  The Minister is caught in his scene by the profligate misuse of the nation's resources during the past four years to the extent that the Exchequer is now in a penurious condition and is incapable of providing any of the services that the people need and are entitled to.  However, that did not prevent the Minister doing a tour of the west, the southwest and the midlands in recent times and making the most extravagant promises of his intention to spend enormous and huge sums of money.  That commitment, if commitment is a proper word for that <Col N="1916" /> sort of exercise, is such that if he were to come here and say that the health services are now going to be reorganised in order to fulfil the Fianna Fáil manifesto his credibility would take a final plunge into oblivion.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the manifesto in relation to mental health was to undertake a comprehensive national programme for the mentally handicapped. Unfortunately there is not a single word in this Bill dealing with the mentally handicapped.  In particular the omission in regard to the adult mentally handicapped is a serious one.  Mentally handicapped children are catered for reasonably well at this stage.  There has been a growth in the past couple of decades of residential and day-care centres for the treatment of mentally handicapped children and there has been a considerable advance in community recognition of that problem and of community involvement in the care and treatment of it.  Most communities now have voluntary associations who do an immense amount of good work, and it is right that we should pay tribute to the people involved in those associations for the good work they have done.  This necessitates being personally involved as volunteers and assisting the professionals in the institutions. It also involves what is possibly the most difficult and distasteful part of voluntary community work, which is the raising of funds.  They have been persistent and dedicated in discharging that particular function, and they themselves will admit generally that they have found a ready and generous acceptance by the members of the community of appeals for funds.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable advance in recent decades in the field of the treatment of the mentally-handicapped child but, unfortunately, the mentally-handicapped adult has been neglected and the number of institutions, whether residential or day centres, available for the mentally handicapped adult is scandalously low.  It is a matter of great disappointment that the Minister and his colleagues in Government four years after promising a comprehensive national programme for the mentally handicapped have now done <Col N="1917" /> literally nothing for the adult mentally handicapped.  The adult mentally handicapped is still a patient in psychiatric hospitals, and of course they are most unsuitable places for such people.  I have heard the Minister personally, and I have seen him reported as saying, and rightly saying, that there must be a realisation that the mentally handicapped adult is entitled to the same prospects for the fulfilment of his personality and the realisation of his abilities, limited though they may be, as any normal person and that the scene in which he has to be given the opportunity to achieve that fulfilment must be compatible with that aim.  I would suggest to the Minister that merely to provide for the mentally handicapped the physical surroundings of a mental hospital is not the scene in which that person can fulfil himself, albeit to a limited degree but to a degree to which he is entitled to aspire.  He is entitled to look to us to help him to realise that aspiration.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that in this Bill these people have been put on the long finger, I am afraid that they have been put on the long finger in the Minister's work over the past number of years.  To provide for them would require a big administrative and financial effort.  The financial effort is not possible for the reasons that I have already referred to, that the Exchequer has been run into the ground financially speaking and the resources that should be available to assist these weaker brethern are not there.  I do not know why there has not been the administrative push to involve the community in the same way as the community has been involved in the case of the child mentally handicapped.  I know the Mental Health Association of Ireland are doing good work but they need encouragement and support to expand their activities so that we might have the facilities necessary, whether they be residential or day care.</P>
    <P>One reason why so much of the work for the adult or the mentally handicapped child is successful is that they can now be maintained in their homes.  The burden of maintaining them has been eased by the provision of day care centres so that <Col N="1918" /> there is an ideal mix of day care and home care.  That, of course, might not be as easy to arrange in the case of the adult mentally handicapped because it is obviously a different problem to deal with an adult than to deal with a child. We do not know how far we can go in that area.  So far as I am aware experimentation and development work has been regrettably small and light.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has introduced this piece of legislation without touching at all on the problem of the adult mentally handicapped is a matter for grave disappointment.  It is not a matter for surprise in so far as it is another promise not fulfilled, but obviously it is a matter for disappointment that in this sensitive area the promise which was made now looks a particularly cynical piece of electioneering at the expense of a handicapped section of the community. One can understand promises in the economic field not being achieved, where the policies went askew or where the finances were badly managed and targets were not achieved.  One can possibly be a little cynical politically about it, but one cannot have the same sympathy for failure to meet a promise to the mentally handicapped of our community.  The Minister and his colleagues must stand condemned for their failure to live up to what was a solemn undertaking given to people who had to rely on that particular undertaking and who have no political clout of their own.  From that point of view the Minister's Bill is disappointing. It fails on both scores to implement the manifesto undertaking of a complete reorganisation of mental health services on the one hand and to provide a comprehensive national programme for the mentally handicapped on the other. Quite frankly, it does neither and is a failure in that regard.</P>
    <P>So far as it goes I would not have any great objections or quibble with the detailed provision in it, with one or two exceptions.  The Minister in his speech tells us that the Bill deals with three areas, the registration and supervision of psychiatric institutions, the admission and discharge procedures, and safeguards for patients.  Obviously the registration <Col N="1919" /> and supervision of psychiatric institutions is something that is desirable and I would not take issue with what is proposed here.  Provision for the designation of institutions under the health boards and for the registration of private psychiatric centres is desirable and commonsense. Such institutions should be designated and supervised.  It is inevitable that there will have to be specialised hospitals for the mentally ill.  As the Minister pointed out, the type of buildings we have are a hang-over from Victorian days when their lay-out, design and architectural style were unfortunately similar to custodial institutions and that reflected the thinking of those days in relation to mental illness.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been the beginning, and I suppose some journeying along the road towards recognition of the fact that mental illness is just another form of illness, that it is not a matter for shame, or a matter to be hidden or a matter for disgrace for the unfortunate patient or his family connections. This is something which requires a change in social attitudes.  How they come about is the problem.  I suppose they can come about in two ways.  The medical profession and the people in the Minister's position have the obligation to preach that mental illness is another from of illness and is not something socially disreputable.  That is one way in which the climate of thinking towards mentally sick people can be changed for the better.</P>
    <P>The other way, of course, is to change the physical conditions in which they are treated.  In recent years there has been a very desirable opening up of the buildings of the mental hospitals in the country. The grim perimeter walls have been taken down and there has been more mixing between the institutions and the local community.  The idea of these people being in purdah and isolated from the community is being done away with. Both of those things have contributed to the growing realisation that mental illness is now just an unfortunate trauma that strikes people in much the same way as a physical illness can strike a person and that it is nothing to be ashamed of or a <Col N="1920" /> matter for disgrace within the family concerned. All of us have to do what we can in our own way to ensure that there is continuing development of public thought and public acceptance along those ideas.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister, through the health boards and through his registration powers, will ensure that psychiatric centres and psychiatric institutions will be designed, built, organised, managed and integrated into the community with the objective of breaking down any distinction between mental and physical illness.</P>
    <P>The second area that the Bill deals with is with regard to the admission and discharge procedures.  There are a couple of aspects with regard to this that have given rise to controversy.  The first is with regard to the admission of a patient on a compulsory basis, and of course that is what we are talking about essentially in this Bill.  The Minister has said we do not need law for voluntary admissions and I take his point.</P>
    <P>There was considerable controversy in the other House and in medical circles over the requirement that for a compulsory reception there has to be a certificate from two medical practitioners.  It was pointed out in the other House that this could lead to considerable difficulty in many parts of the country, not just in isolated rural areas but indeed in urban centers where medical rota systems operate, where possibly only one doctor is on call in a surgery and in some areas maybe a second doctor on duty is doing house visits.  It was said that it might be difficult to get a second medical practitioner in what would almost invariably be an emergency context.  It was urged on the Minister that the reception recommendation could be made by one general practitioner and that the confirmation from the second could be given after the admission of the patient to the mental institution concerned.  The Minister did not accept that suggestion and he has offered a compromise by taking power to make regulations to deal with the difficulties envisaged by critics of this particular provision.  I am not so sure that regulations are the answer, because regulations <Col N="1921" /> in this particular area would be difficult to draft to deal with the unforeseen and that is what we have to contend with.  I do not know what sort of regulations or provisions the Minister has in mind to overcome the difficulties that arise because of his proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>He indicated that his regulations would possibly designate geographic areas where some exemption from the two doctor requirement would be given.  I would make the point that if that is going to be the main criterion for the regulations applying it is mistaken, because this is a problem which can apply in the largest urban area as much as in a remote rural area.  The Minister, too, was afraid that if the two doctor rule was to be avoided in cases of emergency where only one doctor was available this would become the norm, that it would be certified as a matter of course and that there would be no willingness or wish to go and get the second certification.</P>
    <P>I do not know if that is an altogether fair or good argument.  I think that if the law provides that there should be two and that if in a case of emergency there is only one available and that one suffices, we have to make some act of faith in the professional integrity of the people concerned that they would implement the law in the spirit in which it was intended as well as in the letter.  I think it would be preferable to leave this problem to the medical people concerned rather than for the Minister to make regulations as to when there should be one or when they should be two people to certify a person as requiring compulsory treatment.</P>
    <P>On the question of discharge from institutions, the Minister has said that it was with reluctance he introduced the requirement that 24 hours notice would have to be given in the case of voluntary patients.  Up to now the notice required to be given by a voluntary patient before he could be discharged from hospital has been 72 hours.  I gather from what the Minister says that it was his original intention not to have any length of notice at all.  He did this for the commendable reason &mdash; commendable at first sight&mdash; that this person is a voluntary patient coming into hospital so why should he or <Col N="1922" /> she not be allowed to leave voluntarily as soon as he or she thinks fit?  There is a certain logic in that if one equates that these people are all patients, but I think the logic ignores the differences between a person who is suffering from a physical ailment and a person who is suffering from a mental illness.</P>
    <P>In the case of many mental illnesses severe medication may be required by way of tranquillising drugs and the effects of these may not have worn off within the 24-hour period.  A very common case of admission to mental hospitals on a voluntary basis are alcoholics seeking admission to be dried out.  People in that category can require a considerable period under tranquillising drugs before they are in a position to be treated at all.  To allow them to make a decision that they are fit to be discharged in 24 hours when they are in for a course of treatment that may necessarily require longer than that is, I think, retrograde.  While I have sympathy with the libertarian element in the Minister's views, I think we have to balance that with the commonsense requirement of providing services to treat these people and providing a scheme under which they can be treated.  If a person goes in voluntarily for treatment I do not think it is too much for us to ask him to give 72 hours notice before he leaves so that he can get some good out of his voluntary admission.</P>
    <P>I understand it has been the position since 1945 that 72 hours notice is necessary before a voluntary patient can discharge himself, that is discharge himself without medical consent.  Of course, that is not to say that voluntary patients must all give 72 hours notice before they can go.  Obviously in suitable cases a voluntary patient will be let go on ten minutes notice, but for patients who are not in a position to make an assessment about their own condition in order to be discharged or patients who have not taken the minimum of treatment for the condition for which they admitted them selves, I think they should be made subject to the 72-hour notice requirement.  I am not aware of any cases since 1945 where this obligation to give 72 hours notice has been a hardship or a burden <Col N="1923" /> on the patients concerned.  It is an admirable libertarian concept on the part of the Minister and one must sympathise with him and admire him for it but I do suggest that it is mistaken and that there is no need for it in the sense that there is no abuse needing to be rectified or remedied by it.  If there was an abuse it would certainly have appeared and would be publicly known and well manifested since 1945.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to change something so fundamental that inured since 1945 without being an abuse or without causing difficulty or hardship for reasons of theoretic liberalism.  We have to consider the facts and realities of the real world which we are speaking about: in this case the patient suffering from mental trauma who is half-way through a course of preliminary treatment and who for some reason &mdash; obviously not a properly thought-out reason because of the very condition for which he admitted himself &mdash; decides to leave half-cured and perhaps full of drugs.  The medical profession is happy that 72 hours is a reasonable time for certain preliminary treatment to be given or for certain preliminary treatments to wear off, so that it would be safe for a person to discharge himself voluntarily. When this has worked well since 1945 the Minister is making a mistake in changing it.</P>
    <P>Another matter concerning the discharge is the review body.  I would agree with the Minister that the proposed structure is a good one.  There will be a psychiatrist and a lawyer, and to bring commonsense to both there will be a layman. It is a good mixture and I would not quibble with it.  Some of the medical profession feel it should be an entirely medical board who should decide this matter but in view of the type of case that would be coming before it and having regard to the length of time during which that person is a patient, there should be other disciplines involved besides the purely medical discipline.  You would be asking a board of entirely medical people in what is a fairly narrow profession to deal with the professional judgment of a <Col N="1924" /> colleague.  Undoubtedly, they would bring total impartiality to their deliberations but in order to avoid any suggestions that there might be less than total impartiality, the Minister is quite right to expand this board to include non-medical people.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill goes there is much it to be commended but there are some points of criticism.  The main point of criticism I have is the provision for the notice to be given by the voluntary patient in order to discharge himself. Twenty-four hours is inadequate, and I urge the Minister to look again at that.  I would be anxious to hear from the Minister in his reply what advice he got from the medical profession regarding that particular aspect.  In his opening speech dealing with this matter, it seems it was apparently as a result of pressure from the medical profession that he introduced the 24-hour notice requirement.  I am anxious to know if the medical profession urged on the Minister the 72-hour notice requirement and on what grounds he decided to compromise on 24 hours when the professionals say that 24 hours notice is dangerously inadequate.  I ask the Minister to spell out for the House the reason he is satisfied that 24 hours is enough when the medical profession urge that it should be a minimum of 72 hours and particularly why he has put forward this proposal when it is obvious that since 1945 this provision has caused no difficulty. I am not aware that it has interfered with the rights and liberties of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>It is commendable on the part of the Minister to provide that voluntary patients should be able to go voluntarily. But that ignores the peculiar nature of mental illness and particularly the peculiar nature of the treatment that may have to be given to people who come in voluntarily in an emergency situation.  These people should not be allowed to sign themselves out.  They may be a danger to themselves and possibly to the community and their families until the medical profession is satisfied it is safe for them to leave.  The Minister is taking a big risk in reducing the term of notice to 24 hours. I should like him, to spell out for us the <Col N="1925" /> medical indications on which he has based this decision to go for 24 hours rather than 72 hours.  That is my main criticism of the Bill.</P>
    <P>My other main criticism is with regard to what is not in the Bill.  Obviously everything that is required cannot be in the Bill, but it makes a poor effort to fulfil the manifesto promise.  The people who are involved in this whole area of mental health had expectations that what was promised in 1977 would be delivered. It is a matter of regret, but at this stage not a matter of surprise, that there has been this failure to deliver.  This is the one consistency of the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977&mdash;its consistent failure to deliver honest promises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill with great sincerity.  I thank the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>The Bill should be designed to give the best possible attention to the mentally ill while, at the same time, having regard to the working conditions of those with the task to ensure the smooth running of the units and the hospitals.  Senator Cooney was most upset about the inclusion of the mentally handicapped child in this Bill and his colleagues in the other House had also the same concern.  I will deal with that later.  I am amazed they are so unaware that the two areas are separate.  This matter needs a reply from somebody who has worked in this area for a long time.</P>
      <P>There is in the Bill the provision that great care should be taken to ensure that there is agreement with staff at all times before any centre or unit is designed for a hospital.  In the past we have seen buildings empty for years because in the first place there was no working agreement with the staff at the time of planning.  It is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that voluntary admission should not be discouraged.  There are often many complaints about the fact that anybody can get himself admitted to a mental hospital without being referred to it by a doctor.  It seems odd that a voluntary patient can admit himself or herself at three or four o'clock in the morning without consulting his or her GP. However, I agree that voluntary admission <Col N="1926" /> is a must.  The present system consists of a few minutes visit to a GP and then the patient goes home again with a fistful of tablets or a prescription.  No doubt the patient will feel better but the cause of the condition or illness is not being treated and of course it will flare up again.  This is something that makes it easy for the doctor but it means only more trouble for the patient.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 16 is required but it is, of course, seldom used.  It may be necessary in the case of a person who has no relatives and who has opted out of society.  If such a person becomes very ill then somebody must step in and deal with him.  The gardaí are the obvious choice.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in section 17. There could be the case of a patient who had a brother, sister, or other relative in the hospital and for the betterment of both the patient and the person on the staff it might be better that that patient would be moved to another hospital.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with escort duty.  I am totally opposed to this.  If somebody has to be detained, it is a social problem.  A person resisting going into hospital has to be arrested and taken in.  That is a Garda function only, as I see it.  Perhaps I am reading it wrong.  This has been debated for long periods.  I hope the Minister will be able to re-assure me about this at a later stage.  We are sending nurses out to force somebody into a hospital and then we are asking those same nurses and patients to work together.  Instead of having confidence in each other from the very start, the situation has been badly damaged before treatment begins.  Section 27 is necessary because we have an open door system in our hospitals. Patients can go out at a very dangerous time in the treatment towards recovery.</P>
    <P>Section 36 is quite good.  It is nothing new.  Places have been inspected down through the years.  I have strong views on section 38.  We must ensure that justice is done.  We hear so much talk about justice that I am confused about my rights, your rights, their rights, our rights. I have confidence in the Minister and the officials in his Department who are dealing with this Bill.  I have personal confidence <Col N="1927" /> in them even if it is only lately acquired.  I am very glad there is provision to safeguard against the unnecessary detention of persons.  This certainly was abused, and I am glad it is there.</P>
    <P>Does the Bill provide that the task of visiting and inspecting mental hospitals will be assigned to a medical officer of the Department by the Minister?  Is the Minister happy about the fact that this most important task is to be given to one person?  I would be concerned about one person being given that very, very important task.  We must remember that some 36,000 persons are currently availing of outpatient clinic facilities.  I suggest that we might give even more encouragement to upping this service given by all of us who happen to serve in the field.  The Minister referred to out-clinics.  It is a very important field and enough emphasis was not put on it before now.  Rather than having our hospitals packed with patients, some of them could be dealt with at home by efficient GPs in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I come now to Senator Cooney and his colleagues in the Lower House.  I did not intend to bring mentally handicapped children into this debate.  I have very strong views on this matter and very strong backing from parents of these children who, with all due respect to mental hospitals, do not see their children as mental patients.  I agree.  After 17 years as chairman of a federation, I can see what I and other dedicated people have achieved.  There are very strong views that a mentally handicapped child and a mental patient in a mental hospital are in two separate categories.  I want to make it quite clear that I am in no way detracting from our mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>People in this House and the other House do not seem to know that the Government have 5,000 places for special residential care, and 8,000 places available in day facilities, including schools. Unfortunately, I have not the figure the Minister of State, Deputy Tunney, said the Fianna Fáil Government have poured into the mentally handicapped field out of the education budget.  It must be colossal. In the past four years 580 places <Col N="1928" /> became available.  In 1980 alone, 100 new residential places and 180 day care centre places came into operation.  This is the achievement of the Minister and the party of which I am proud to be a member. This is our record.  Capital expenditure on mental handicap has risen since 1977 from £1,400,000 to £6,500,000.  Let nobody in any other party say we have forgotten the mentally handicapped children of this nation.</P>
    <P>The domiciliary care allowance for the severely handicapped in 1977 was £25 a month.  This week it is £45.  The disability maintenance allowance was £11.25 in 1977.  Today it is £25.30.  We have given a service to these children in care.  We have dedicated ourselves to them outside of politics.  I never mentioned the mentally handicapped in the field of politics until today.  I hauled Ministers over the coals for not giving them more service. When the Opposition see fit to bring these children into the field of politics, and even go as far as to talk about election gimmicks, somebody has to stand up and take them on.  I am doing that now. There are 998 approved new posts in the service and a further 480 new posts, making a total of 1,478, with a wage bill of £3,257,335, which speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Everyone serving in this field knows a lot more should be done.  We have come a long way.  I speak from experience of 17 years in the field as a totally voluntary worker.  I know what I have seen, and what has been done.  I know what still remains to be done.  Only a certain amount can be done.  I do not accept that we have been lacking in concern for the mentally handicapped.  I am very glad to have the chance this morning to speak on this most important Bill.  It seems to be important to a few of us only when I see how few Senators are in the House.  We are dealing with people who, sad to say, were forgotten for far too long.  I served in this field as a public representative elected by the people.  I put a lot of long hours and hard work into it and I never brought politics into it before.</P>
    <P>I thank you a Chathaoirleach for allowing me to speak.  I thank the Minister for trying to deal with a very complex and tough Bill.  I congratulate the senior officials <Col N="1929" /> sitting behind him.  I will finish by paying tribute to the staff who serve in this field.  They serve the people of this country, the patients and the children with total dedication and total commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  The history of mental illness and mental disturbance generally is a very difficult one.  Quite often we still think in terms of attitudes which were prevalent in the past and which are no longer appropriate today. Although great advances have been made in the treatment of mental illness, nonetheless there are many forms of mental illness which, while they may be alleviated, cannot be cured as yet.</P>
      <P>Perhaps one of the most important things which happened over the past few years has been the growing acceptance, the growing realisation, that there is not an absolute line of demarcation between mental illness and physical illness. Almost any physical illness a patient suffers from has some mental component, whether it be something as simple as a natural anxiety, or whether it be so great that, in itself, it is the cause of the physical illness.  Certain skin conditions, for example, are related to emotional disturbances. We have tended also to draw a totally arbitrary and unwarranted distinction between those forms of mental disturbance which we could readily understand. We could understand someone suffering from a fever being delirious. We could understand someone being obviously mentally incapable and disturbed when suffering from the effects of excess alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the person was suffering from schizophrenia, from some form of depressive illness perhaps, about which until recently there was very little knowledge or understanding, we tended to shy away from this sort of illness and put it into a <Col N="1930" /> separate category.  We were not willing to accept that, perhaps, there was a chemical abnormality causing the schizophrenia, causing the psychosis, which was just as understandable and just as reasonable as the excess of alcohol causing the symptoms and the signs in general behaviour which we associate with alcoholism, or just as simple as the change in temperature, the change in enzymes, the chemical changes which affect the brain when someone is suffering from a severe fever.  We were unwilling to make this very real acceptance.</P>
    <P>There is still a great deal of virtual superstition or deep emotional feelings when people think of mental illness.  We find is very hard to accept the justice in any physical illness.  There is a change in blood pressure, a change in the action of the stomach&mdash;or whatever it may be.  In mental illness there is a physical change going on which we are now begining to understand and which, in years to come, will become much more explicable, much more reasonable.</P>
    <P>That is not to say we should necessarily assume that all people suffering from mental illnesses can be treated at the present stage of knowledge just as we would treat someone suffering from some more obviously physical illness such as high blood pressure.  We are tending very slightly to swing from the dreadful situation in which someone diagnosed to be mentally ill tended to be put away and locked up.  Sadly there are many people who have been placed in psychiatric institutions and who are rarely if ever visited by their friends or relations.  One has a certain sympathy with the friends and relations in these circumstances.  It can be a very difficult situation.  It is one I am glad to say which is changing.  Visits to patients in psychiatric hospitals are becoming much more accepted.  People are much more willing to admit that one of their relations or friends is in a psychiatric hospital.  People are much more willing to treat such a person in a humane and Christian manner and to realise, also, that such people are suffering from an illness just as much as if they had high blood pressure, or a gastric ulcer or whatever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> There is still a certain minority of patients who, for their own sake, or for the sake of their relations, or for the sake of the public at large, are not fit to be released from psychiatric care.  We must be very careful here.  The Minister has just about got the balance right between safeguards for the individual.  In commiting people to a psychiatric institution, one is doing something even more serious than committing them to a criminal prison.  One is depriving them of their liberty and, not only that, but saying they are incapable of managing their own affairs.</P>
    <P>This is something which must be faced. It must be accepted and it must be realised that there is a small minority of people who must be admitted compulsorily to psychiatric hospitals and who must not be released from psychiatric hospitals unless they are very definitely cured of their illness, or at least sufficiently so that they can take their place in the community. We must avoid swinging from a situation in which large numbers of mentally ill patients were automatically institutionalised to a situation in which we can assume large numbers can be sent out into the community to families who are, perhaps, unable to accept them, or unable to receive them, the community in which they are unable to cope, in which under certain circumstances they may find themselves at so total a disadvantage. One is not doing anything for the patient, or his relations, or the community by releasing him into that community. One is giving a spurious freedom to the unfortunate individual.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful indeed to draw this line between the individual's personal freedom and the necessity, in a very small minority of cases, but a necessity nonetheless, to retain for their own sake, for the sake of their relations and the community a certain small minority of patients in hospital.  We must also ensure that such patients can readily be admitted to hospital.  I have had personal experience myself of the tragic circumstances which can arise in these cases.  It is absolutely essential for the sake of the patients themselves, for the sake of their <Col N="1932" /> families, for the sake of their local community, that they can be readily admitted to hospital.</P>
    <P>There was some mention of the voluntary patient.  We must draw a distinction here again between the voluntary patient going into a hospital with a psychiatric illness which he or she believes requires immediate treatment.  Such people must have ready access to psychiatric services if they feel they need them.  This relates particularly to the point raised by Senator Honan.  I would not like to see a situation in which such a person was compelled first of all to go to an outside doctor, was then referred to a psychiatric consultant, and eventually went into hospital. It is very important that they have ready access to treatment when they believe they need it.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of discharging patients.  Again here we are trying to balance two things: the actual good of the patient from the medical point of view, and his right to personal freedom.  The Minister, who has had to take this very difficult decision after listening to his expert advisers, has just about got it right.  Such a patient without being well enough to go out into the community might demand to be released.  It was initially the Minister's intention that this should be the case, that a person who had voluntarily given up his liberty should be able to regain that liberty once again at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>That was a very understandable attitude, but one which might not necessarily be in the interests of the patient himself or herself.  By the very nature of the illness of the patient he or she might not be in a position to decide coherently and rationally whether or not he or she was in fact well enough to go out into the community, well enough to give up treatment. At the same time, there is no way in which such a person should be detained indefinitely without the gravest of reasons. This amendment which the Minister has inserted providing for 24 hours meets the needs of the patient, which are the paramount needs in this situation.  It is a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I must associate myself with remarks Senator Honan made about mental handicap. <Col N="1933" /> Unfortunately, we have tended to think of mental handicap as a form of psychiatric illness.  This is very understandable, but it is totally incorrect.  A mentally handicapped person is not necessarily in the slightest degree psychiatrially disorded and should be regarded and treated in a very different light.  It is, of course, a very major and very tragic area of our medical services, but it is a very important one.  Certainly from talking with the parents of such people and, indeed, with mentally handicapped patients themselves, I know that one of the things about which they are most sensitive, and quite rightly sensitive, is being regarded as being psychiatrically disturbed when, in fact, they are not so disturbed.</P>
    <P>The situation in our psychiatric services is by no means satisfactory as yet.  I am sure the Minister would agree that there are many improvements which we would like to make, some of which have been commenced, and others which I am sure we will continue.  This is not something that is unique to this country.  Psychiatric services generally have tended to be a neglected area of health services right throughout the world.  In fact, in many ways we are very much ahead of many other western countries in our provision of hospital beds for psychiatric services, and so on.</P>
    <P>This is shown very clearly in Table E6 of the Department of Health document giving statistical information on the 1980 health services.  The number of beds in Ireland is 4.8, that is, beds in psychiatric hospitals per 1,000 population for each Member State of the EEC, 1960, 1965, 1970 and 1975.  Taking the 1975 figure, it is 4.8 in Ireland as compared with 3.8 in Luxembourg, two in Italy, 2.9 in the Netherlands, 3.4 in the United Kingdom, 1.8 in the German Federal Republic, and 2.5 in Denmark.  In fact, in this statistic we compare very favourably.  That is not the whole story by any means.  I am sure what we would wish to see is a situation in which very few psychiatric beds were needed in our health services.</P>
    <P>There are many disturbing figures in Table E3.  We note that there is a very substantial improvement to which the <Col N="1934" /> Minister has referred.  Between 1963 and 1971 the total number of patients in residence fell from nearly 20,000 to 16,600. Nonetheless, one cannot help thinking that many people in that 16,600 under certain circumstances could well be able to live in the community but not all of them by any means.  There is this percentage who, in fairness to themselves and in fairness to the community, should under no present circumstances be related.</P>
    <P>Another worrying feature of these figures is that 82 per cent of these people are single, suggesting strongly, when you consider the married level of 11.8 and the level of 5.8 for widowed, that one of the elements in this may well be a lack of home or community services to which such people could return.  Another very worrying feature is that 50 per cent of these patients are diagnosed in the category of schizophrenia.  This is a very high percentage in itself.</P>
    <P>Of course, schizophrenia is an illness about which we are beginning to learn quite a lot.  There is quite a lot of information coming along about it.  Quite a number of therapies are now coming into practical use but, nonetheless, it is by no means a situation in which we can claim to have a cure at this stage of our knowledge. It is one of the conditions to which I was referring earlier about which, in due course, we may be able to realise that there is a definite physical or chemical basis causing this condition just as there is a definite physical or chemical change causing bronchitis, or pneumonia, or high blood pressure, or whatever, and react in a better manner to such conditions as schizophrenia, psychoses, and so on.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  As the Minister said, it covers a certain group of patients and is specifically directed towards this particular group of patients who are compulsorily admitted.  Particularly in this year and age, it is very appropriate and right that we should bring in a Bill, an excellent Bill, which on the one hand brings up to date our concern for an individual's human rights and personal freedom and at the same time brings up to date the necessary medical therapy <Col N="1935" /> and safeguards for the individual and for the community.  I commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their very thorough analysis of the Bill and its contents and for some of the relevant points which have been made in the course of the discussion here.  I include Senator Cooney, for, while he digressed from time to time, feeling an obligation to have a tilt at the Minister and the Government, he made a very honest attempt to consider and discuss the essence of the Bill and to give us the benefit of his own experience.  I welcome his contribution.</P>
      <P>Some useful points emerged from the debate which perhaps, if they had been made in the Dáil debate, might have saved a lot of confusion during that whole period.  I regretted that confusion because it took from what is a step in the modernisation of our mental health legislation, and a particularly important step in that whole process.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney said that he was concerned about two main elements in relation to the Bill, that the manifesto had promised a complete reorganisation of the mental health services, and a national programme for the mentally handicapped. In this respect I disagree with Senator Cooney, because we have been involved in and embarked on a major programme of reorganisation to assist the mentally handicapped.  Senator Honan quoted some of the figures which were given recently in this regard.  If you take the whole question of the mentally handicapped services, one of the figures which sticks in my mind is that last year we were providing £6 million for capital services. This year we are providing £8 million. That is money being spent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney was concerned about the various projects which I initiated or advanced during this year.  I assure the Senator that it has all been entirely responsible and within the budgeting requirements, both of myself and of my Department, which is taking very seriously and responsibly the level of expenditure <Col N="1936" /> involved over the next five years or so.  Our total expenditure on capital services has increased very significantly over the last four years.  In the current year we are spending £47 million on our health services.  Assuming that we maintain expenditure at or about this level then each and every one of the projects which I have either initiated or advanced will be finalised.  I want the Senator to understand that.  In 1976, admittedly, the level of expenditure was £11.2 million on our capital health services.  It is currently running at £47 million.  Without any further major increase, other than the likely increases in relation to inflation, in continuing this level of expenditure, we have provided for all these projects.</P>
    <P>Adult mental handicapped &mdash; I agree with Senator Cooney here &mdash; is one of my priority areas.  I want to spend the capital on the provision of places for mentally handicapped.  The projects which we have started this year in that area amount to £7.7 million.  I can provide the Senator with any facts he would like to have and I can bring him to meet the people who are undertaking these works.  If you take, for instance, the adult mentally handicapped, we have the Loughlinstown project which I announced as part of this year's programme for the development of the health services; St. Mary's, Drumcar; Cregg House; St. Patrick's, Upton; the Camphill Community; St. Joseph's in Kilcornan and the Western Care Group Home.  We have a number of other projects which are being initiated or advanced significantly in the current year.  It is a very important part of the overall capital allocation, and the current capital expenditure in that area amounts to £8 million as against £1.4 million which was expended in this area under the previous administration in 1977.  It is only fair to put on record that we have made a major commitment in this area, which is evident. I know this very well because I travel a lot to these units.  I regard it as part of my work, although I have been criticised in the Dáil repeatedly for doing so.  Admittedly, it places a greater strain on me because if I visit one of these units I must get back in a hurry.  Nevertheless, it is one of my priorities.  I am very aware <Col N="1937" /> of the high standard of the work which is being done.</P>
    <P>Over the past four years new residential services for children and adults started in Kilkenny, Westmeath, Limerick, Sligo, Roscommon, Kerry, Dublin, Cork, Mayo and Galway.  New community hostels came into operation in Wicklow, Dublin, Galway, Kildare and Kerry. In addition, various new day-care and workshop facilities started in Dublin, Waterford, Longford, Cork, Offaly, Westmeath, Kildare, Wicklow, Kerry, Cavan, Meath, Louth, Galway and Donegal.  These new places involved the approval of 998 new posts in the service at an additional cost.  We can see from that that there has been a major commitment on the part of the Government, in line with that given in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>The revenue expenditure on mental handicapped services, has increased from £25 million in 1977 to £60 million in 1980 and it will be higher in 1981.  Senator Honan mentioned the increases in the domiciliary care allowance which was recently increased to £45 per month and the disabled persons' maintenance allowance, which not only has been increased but has been extended to cover dependants who were not covered previously. We also had in April 1980 services for the mentally handicapped.  The report of the working party was published and it provides guidelines for future planning.  It advocates a strong orientation towards community based services and recommends the full development of such services. The important roles of the hostels to enable the handicapped to continue living in the communities is emphasised and some guidance is given as to how this might be done.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that community services will be developed to their full potential, the report provides estimates of the numbers of places required for persons who will need residential care. We are working on the basis of this report and proceeding vigorously in that direction. There are various other areas in which funds have been allocated, such as in the early childhood intervention services to which in recent years we have allocated special funds to enable counselling <Col N="1938" /> to be developed for parents of young, mentally handicapped children. These were intended to support the families in the management of their young mentally handicapped children and to assist the child's development to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>We have some of the most modern facilities in Europe currently in development. I refer any Senator who doubts that to see the work which is going on at Cheeverstown, St. John of God's, Island-bridge, Stewart's Hospital, Palmerstown, or any of the St. Michael House Units.  I could list a great number of activities which are taking place throughout the country.  I think it is sufficient to indicate that it is an area which we take very, very seriously, an area to which we have given priority and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the major developments in this area which we have and which we have encouraged, promoted and provided finance for, is the provision of psychiatric facilites at general hospitals.  The acute units and day care facilities are nearly all provided now as standard.  This is a major change and it fits in with the whole approach which is taken in this legislation to mental illness.  Already in operation as a result of that programme we have in St. James's, 50 beds, in Castlebar, a 45-bed unit, in Limerick General Hospital, 50 beds, in Letterkenny General Hospital, 50 beds, in St. Vincent's, Elm Park, 30 beds, in Cork Regional at Wilton, 50 beds, Galway Regional at Merlin Park, 35 beds.  We have 22 beds at St. Anne's Unit in Skibbereen General.  At St. Stephen's, Sarsfield, in Cork, there are 50 beds and, near completion, in Beaumont, 50 beds and in Tralee General Hospital, 50 beds.  We are going to build the acute units into general hospitals as a normal part of the scene and obviously legislation is required to complement this development which is taking place on the ground.</P>
    <P>Cavan General Hospital will have 65 beds which will include 15 for alcoholics, Sligo General will have 46 beds, which will include 16 for young people and the Mater Hospital, Dublin will have 50 beds.  There are various others at different stages in planning and proposals at Nenagh, Kilkenny, Wexford, Blanchardstown, <Col N="1939" /> Ardkeen, Waterford, and a number of others where acute beds are planned.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting introduction to the whole development which is taking place.  It is sufficient to refute any suggestion that we are not undertaking currently a major reorganisation of our mental health services.  It shows quite clearly that we are undertaking this major reorganisation. The total cost of those beds over that period will be about £25 million and we are engaged in this complete reorganisation of the mental health services. It does not require legislation, it requires commitment and the will of a Government to do it.  This Government are committed to doing it and we also have a national programme for the mentally handicapped.  From the figures which I have given it is quite clear that this is a major and extensive programme.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney congratulated the Mental Health Association and I agree with him.  They are doing excellent work, we are in very close contact with them and we are supporting them in that work. It is an organisation which is gaining new enthusiasm and support throughout the community which in itself is encouraging it in the work which it is doing.  This is very valuable work and I know that Senator Cooney recognises that fact.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney sees great changes and improvement in the psychiatric centres, he sees the walls going away and various other opennesses coming to these centres.  That is part of the scene.</P>
    <P>He raised especially the question of two doctors certifying the recommendation for reception.  He was inclined to think that it might be possible to have one on the spot and one after.  I have said, and I would be very concerned, that if you bring in that system, in fact the one on the spot and the one after will become the norm.  Undoubtedly, that is what would happen.  I appreciate and I sympathise with the views expressed here in relation to this question of two doctors certifying because, from the community point of view, I have been involved.  I am with reasonable frequency involved in arranging that people, especially elderly <Col N="1940" /> people with whom I work a fair deal, at certain stages have to be admitted, requiring certification.  I appreciate there can be difficulties and I know that in practice this requires some extra work on the part of those who are arranging for such certification and reception.  Nevertheless, I must balance this against depriving individuals of their liberty and freedom and a small administrative inconvenience to any of us in this regard is a very worthwhile price to safeguard, in so far as we can, the liberty of the individual and to ensure that such admissions are properly protected.</P>
    <P>I would like to make clear to Senator Cooney that I introduced the regulations only as a mechanism to deal with any situation which might arise in the future. I do not envisage using them but there were views expressed in the Dáil in relation to this point that there might be some regions of country where it might be more difficult to have two doctors certifying. By providing the power and by giving to the Minister the power to make regulations, we ensure that there will be a means of dealing with such a situation if and when it arises.  I did point out in my introductory remarks that it is rather odd to have a difference between a private psychiatric institution and a public one because, even at present, for the private psychiatric institution you must have two certifying doctors.  For the public one, under this Bill, you will also need two certifying doctors.  The regulations are there as a means of dealing with any anomoly that may arise in that regard.  I do not envisage it at present but I made provision for this power in deference to the views expressed by Deputies at the time.</P>
    <P>The next major point which Senator Cooney raised was that of the 24 hours' notice in relation to voluntary patients. I hope Senators will appreciate my concern to normalise the voluntary patient as much and as far as possible.  I consider that the 72 hours' notice was a very considerable length of time and there was the very strong view that it could act as a deterrent to people going in voluntarily. This is the point that I want to make to Senator Cooney, that while it is <Col N="1941" /> extremely rare to have to use it, nevertheless the concern was more on the other side of the coin.  The fact that it existed there was regarded as being, certainly in some instances, a deterrent to people going in voluntarily.  If we were convinced that it would be to our advantage to go in as voluntary patients, we would like to think this did not commit us to more than that at the time.  It might have the effect, therefore, of ensuring that people would go along more readily for treatment at the initial stage.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make it clear that the medical profession were quite happy with the compromise arrangement of 24 hours.  They felt this was a reasonable arrangement and would be quite workable for a situation that they do not see arising with any frequency but, nevertheless, against which they would like to have some safeguard.  That view was reflected by Senator Conroy who said he regarded this as a very reasonable and right provision.  I am quite happy that the 24 hours to the person going in will seem more like a normal hospital situation where you would give notice in any event of your intention to go.  After some time that should be adequate.  I am also advised that if it is a question of providing sedation in relation to a patient who gets into particular difficulty, there is no special difficulty in that regard with modern medicine and therapy.  I do not visualise a problem in that regard.  I see it more as a deterrent and I hope, in reducing it to 24 hours, that this will be helpful in encouraging people to go in as voluntary patients.  This was Senator Cooney's main criticism of the Bill.  His view was that it caused no difficulty since 1945 and, therefore why change?  I have made clear the reason for changing, which is merely the other side of the coin, that it can act as a deterrent to those who might go in voluntarily and this is something which we do not want to happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan, who has had long experience in the field of mental handicap, made quite clear the separation between mental handicap and psychiatric illness.  It is something which parents would be particularly concerned about. It is true that some mentally handicapped <Col N="1942" /> patients may also be psychiatrically ill. This can cause confusion in the minds of people generally.  Senator Honan and Senator Conroy drew the distinction very well in this regard.  I am sorry we did not have them in the Dáil to make the distinction as clearly there because it would have been very helpful to the debate which took place.  Senator Honan raised the question of the escorts and was concerned that the psychiatric nurse would be coming out from a centre to act as an escort and, therefore, the patient going in would see that person as the person who brought him or her in and there would be a bad relationship established from the beginning.  It is envisaged that it would be the community psychiatric nurse who would do the escorting and this might meet the point which has been raised by Senator Honan in that regard. The Garda are only called in when necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also paid a tribute to the staff in this field.  I have been around most of the psychiatric institutions.  I find it difficult to make comparisions but apparently they regard Queen Victoria as the last one to visit them before me and I was made very welcome.  I have specially gone to visit the psychiatric centres and all the patients in the centres, including the most disturbed patients.  I should like to re-emphasise what Senator Honan said in relation to staff.  They do a very difficult task on behalf of the community and one which must be particularly wearing when it has to be done day in and day out, especially when caring for severely disturbed patients.  They do a wonderful job.  It is marvellous to see the extent to which they are now involving even very disturbed patients in their activation projects of various kinds, whether playing cards or doing jig-saws.  They are involved with them in these elementary games and in some cases they go very much further than that with workshops and other developments.  There is a tremendous change taking place there and it is a pity the community at large do not recognise the work which is being done. The Mental Health Association are bringing and will increasingly bring, this message home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> Senator Conroy made a very good point when he said there was no clear line of demarcation between physical and mental illness.  He said that very frequently emotional disturbances are associated with physical illness.  He went on to say that it is now recognised that a chemical abnormality can be and often is the cause of mental illness.  When we see that it is a physical base that exists under the abnormality we may then reach a point where we will have a better understanding of mental illness generally.</P>
    <P>This is Epilepsy Week and the Association for Epilepsy are trying to get information across to people this week particularly.  I should like to congratulate them on the work they are doing.  It brings to my mind a point which is somewhat analogous to Senator Conroy's, that we have a great misunderstanding of epilepsy. I have seen a number of cases where totally normal people, boys or young men, who had been playing a game, or riding a bicycle, had fallen on a concrete path or whatever, and developed one of the forms of epilepsy.  This may be transient or it may last for a long time.  When you see this physical presence as the obvious result of a change in the electrical conductivity or in the electrical mechanism and the electro-chemical situation within the brain, it gives you a better understanding of the situation and a realisation that there is nothing specially strange about such a person. There is actually a clear physical scientific base with which you can associate your understanding of the illness.  If we could bring more of that understanding to the community it would help a great deal in getting people to understand mental illness.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the debate has been particularly helpful and valuable and it has added considerably to the thinking on the whole question of mental illness.</P>
    <P>Again, Senator Conroy was concerned that a patient feeling that he or she needs treatment should have ready and easy access.  I would certainly hope that, with the system which is being developed at the acute units within the general hospitals and the other community units, there <Col N="1944" /> will be easier and more readily available access in future.  Again, he agreed totally with Senator Honan on the distinction between mental handicap and psychiatric illness and this is something for which the parents concerned will thank both Senators very much.  As I said earlier, they might be sorry that they were not in the Dáil to make those points as clearly as they have made them here this morning. I agree with Senator Conroy that there is a great need for increased community services.  I hope he recognises that that is what we are currently doing and that in so far as the total resources are available to the health services, I will pursue that line and, indeed, might pursue it even beyond that point.  That is another question and another day's work.  It is very urgent and is something to which we are certainly very much committed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions on Second Stage and to recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 3, &ldquo;authorised medical practitioner&rdquo; is defined as meaning a registered medical practitioner holding an appointment or providing services as a consultant psychiatrist in a psychiatric centre.  Now, I hear this term <Col N="1945" />&ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo;, and &ldquo;consultant surgeon&rdquo; and consultant this and that used.  What, precisely, does the word mean when it is used in an Act of Parliament? When is a psychiatrist a consultant and when is a psychiatrist a non-consultant psychiatrist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorised medical practitioner is, in practice, a registered medical practitioner holding an appointment as a consultant psychiatrist and would be a medical practitioner fully registered in the Register of Medical Practitioners, possessing the MD degree in psychiatry or equivalent qualifications, for example, the MRCPI and having at least seven years' experience in the practice of medicine, including five years' experience in psychiatry.  It is a consultant who is registered as a consultant psychiatrist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand if, what the Minister has in mind here is a doctor with certain degrees in psychiatry and a certain experience in the practice of psychiatry, and the use of the word &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; is a piece of shorthand to embrace all those qualifications.  If a person purports to be a psychiatrist without having those specialist qualifications and says that the training he got in general medical training is sufficient and that he did six months or whatever in that particular branch of his medical training and is a psychiatrist, what is to stop him from being an authorised medical practitioner under the Act? This term consultant is constantly being used, but I do not think it has any legal standing.</P>

      <P>In practice, he would not get the job, in the first instance, but the intention here is to ensure that the level of medical competence at which these decisions are taken for detention and discharge of patients would not be diluted in any way.  The person is registered as a consultant.  Now there could be change in future, in relation to the requirement for registration as consultant, but these are agreed requirements and they apply <Col N="1946" /> not only in this area but in other areas of consultancy for appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with what the Minister wants to achieve, that is to ensure that a person properly qualified will be the person who comes in to do whatever has to be done under this Act.  What I am merely querying is the legal standing of the word &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; in a definition section, when the term could mean anything.  Why did the Minister not say a psychiatrist properly appointed to the staff of a registered psychiatric centre or district psychiatric centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am puzzled as to what legal standing the word &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; has in a definition section, to indicate a particular type of professional person. Has the word &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; ever been defined judicially, legally or statutorily to show that it indicates to members of the public what exactly it means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have described the post basically as a consultant post and I have defined what that means for the purpose of this discussion.  How much further one would want to go in defining that is another question.  Obviously, it could vary, as I say, in relation to the requirements which seem to be necessary for registration of medical practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter of <Col N="1947" /> the registration of the consultant psychiatrist, but it is a very widely accepted term.  The intention is to ensure that it is someone with the higher level of experience other than, as in your question, siderably less in terms of experience or training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the title and of the intention, and agree with them but I am puzzled as to whether this is the way to identify these people, by giving them the title consultant.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very clearly established in practice.  There would, of course, be instances where there would be practitioners who would like to regard themselves as consultants but who have not conformed to the terms which would be required for registration as such. Obviously, this is a question of how many years' experience in practice may be necessary. In practice, it is quite clearly defined.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think that there is any benefit in expanding the category of persons who could, if you like, trigger off action by the Garda?  At the moment the garda can move when he forms his own opinion on whatever information comes to him.  I would read the section then as meaning that he must <Col N="1951" /> move when he is informed by an authorised officer.  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because any other community person may, in fact, inform him and he may make his own decisions from such general information, which would happen frequently enough in emergency cases, the type of case that I have been involved in, in any event.  People are dealing with elderly people who come to a point where they need to be detained.  This may happen in the small hours of the morning.  It may often be a community person who informs the Garda, in that instance, if an authorised officer is not readily available.</P>

What I have provided for is the situation which may arise for one reason or another.  The Senator suggested that there may be circumstances even within cities where such a situation may arise.  I do not think, in practice, that this will or need arise.  The regulations are there to deal with either the geographical or any other kind of problem which might arise. In that sense it is adequately covered.  We must bear in mind all the time that private patients already require this provision and it certainly has not caused any problem. It is hard to see why it should cause a problem in relation to public patients.

      <P>I appreciate that, but if a voluntary patient decides that he is not going to give any notice there is no way in which he can be kept in the institution and any attempt to keep him in the institution would constitute unlawful imprisonment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably he would be detained for the period in that event.  The question really which the Senator raises is that the patient could have an appeal against that in that he was only required to give the notice.  There is an administrative means by which he would appeal. Is this not the point the Senator is making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is very desirable that a voluntary patient would not be allowed to discharge himself without giving <Col N="1960" /> notice.  We may disagree over the length of notice but we agree that it is desirable that he should give some form of notice.  The point I am making is that under the present law he need not give any notice.  We can express here a wish that he would give notice but if a voluntary patient decides to get out without giving any notice whatever there is no way by which he can be impeded from leaving the institution and if he should be impeded from leaving the institution he would have an action for false imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic point here is that the doctor is protected by the requirement to give the notice and on that basis the doctor would detain the person as being in his or her medical opinion not suitable for release within that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>So what the Minister is saying is that subsection (2) allows the medical officer in charge of the centre to detain a person for 24 hours after he gives notice of his intention of wishing to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must disagree totally with the Minister.  That power could not be read in any way into that subsection. Perhaps it is a pity we raised it and exposed it.  We have been codding voluntary patients for the last 30 odd years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a common law obligation on doctors to protect the patient in the first instance.  It is probably under this provision that the procedures then give the doctor the right to require the notice of a person's intention to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the common law obligation would extend to imprisoning the voluntary patient if he wants to go.  The doctor's obligation would be discharging and recommending and advising the patient but I do not think it would extend to imprisoning the patient which is in effect what would happen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the patient <Col N="1961" /> could leave after that period of notice and then the doctor would have to make arrangements for a formal reception order if in his view the person needed attention and was not prepared to have it voluntarily or was not suitable for voluntary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better to have a situation where the medical officer could not detain the person for the period, let it be 24 hours or 72 hours, and that in law there would be a specific provision to provide for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice there is no difficulty in detaining a patient, especially with modern treatment methods and otherwise, but in the event of a patient being unduly upset or disturbed it is to cover the doctor more than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are of one mind about the desirability of it.  What I am querying is the legality of it as presently proposed. What I am suggesting is that in order to protect the doctor and the patient there should be a positive legal provision to ensure that a person cannot leave, that a voluntary patient becomes in effect a detained patient for a period of 24 hours, that there is some certification process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, the mechanism has operated quite satisfactorily and obviously the number of instances when it occurs is very small.  The danger of providing further legislative certainty about it would probably have a very adverse effect on patients going in in the first instance as voluntary patients.  In view of the experience to date with the previous measure and the likely situation <Col N="1962" /> arising under this, I think it is desirable that we have this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that in view of the satisfactory experience so far and this would include the 72 hours requirement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Our difference of opinion here is that we see that from the other side of the coin, that is, that having a 72-hour requirement is a sort of negative influence on people going in in the first instance.  It is not that the problem arises internally but that it can be seen as a somewhat draconian measure.  I might add that we have had discussions with the profession about this and they are quite happy with the 24 hours as a new arrangement but they are reluctant to depart from having any period of notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the profession indicated, or how does the Minister know, apart from his instinct, that the 72 hours has been a deterrent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it is not quantified. Nevertheless, that is the suggestion and even from the point of view of commonsense and the fact that we are trying to encourage more people to go in for treatment at an earlier stage it is a facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a system of inspection. There is an inspector of mental hospitals. Under the Bill the inspector is not required to report annually.  In fact I have arranged for him to present a report which will be available very shortly.  He carried out an extensive study during 1980 and that also will be presented shortly.  The provision here would be for a visit and inspection in each year of each of the special district and registered psychiatric centres and to report to the Minister on the study.  There was no requirement to do that each year in the previous situation.</P>

They are much closer to the units anyway. They have visiting committees.  The whole situation has changed.  The old walls have gone and people are going in more frequently and so the original concept was somewhat different.  This will provide for a system of inspection and to ensure that there is such an inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can appoint one for each health board or centre if necessary.  It is important to bear in mind <Col N="1964" /> here that under this legislation we will have a system also whereby the review boards will be reviewing the patients as well as another independent grouping for each centre.  The way in which the other institutions or the health services operate currently is that the Minister is in a position to designate an officer for a particular job and this works very satisfactorily. If the Minister is not satisfied with a particular offer then he can designate another one.  There is more flexibility in this way from the point of view of the Minister in relation to the person designated, whereas in the previous system there was just a person who was the inspector and who had the total task nationally.  I just want to add to that that the report of the inspectorate which is due out shortly, is a three-year report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A view was expressed by some of the representatives in the medical profession.  In our discussions we covered the point that there should be a majority of the medical profession on the review board.  The attitude which I took was that there are different elements to be considered at that stage.  A consultant psychiatrist would be involved as a person who would have the most specialised knowledge in relation to any case which comes up.  Then the person presenting the case or discussing the case at the board would be a consultant from the centre itself.  There is a fairly strong <Col N="1965" /> weighting in that event in relation to the professional side.  The question of the person's rights in general can be covered by the legal profession and then there is the commonsense layman to bring forward the views of the layman.  That has been accepted.  There was discussion about it certainly but it has generally been accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This provides for periodic reviews by the review board in the case of long-term patients.  The provision states that it shall, if it thinks proper, decide that the person should not be discharged or that he be discharged conditionally. It also provides that before directing the discharge the board should satisfy iself that detention and treatment are no longer necessary in the interest of the person's health or safety or for the protection of other persons.  It is commonly and correctly believed that in our mental hospitals there is a substantial proportion of non-mental geriatric cases who are very long-term patients &mdash; indeed maybe for the bulk of their natural lives they have been patients in some of these hospitals.  Will it be purely medical indications or will the board be entitled to take social indications into account when deciding what to do?  How is it going to ignore people who are there so long but who should not be there? There is an obligation here to discharge them unless it can be decided that for their safety they should not be discharged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of administrative measures are being taken in relation to that.  Obviously if provision can be made elsewhere this is most desirable if the people are prepared to go elsewhere, which is not always the case.  They may not be suitable for detention over long periods and yet may have become very accustomed to it and it can be very difficult to send them away.  There is also the <Col N="1966" /> extreme case of the person who is 104 years old and obviously the place cannot have been too bad.  Sections of the centres can be re-designated and that is one way in which that could be dealt with. There is a great deal of work going on currently to modify and improve the sections within the centres.  Some of them are quite capable of modification and improvement and others are not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The section envisages making rules, if circumstances warrant it, relating to treatments which are hazardous. The section does not compel the making of regulations and is a safeguard. The provisions in this section are new. There is also the fact that nothing exists in our present mental treatment legislation regarding the giving of consent to any therapeutic procedure.  In practice, what appears to happen is that where a patient is capable of understanding the <Col N="1967" /> situation he or she is asked for consent. Where he is too disturbed to give it, the doctor proceeds with the treatment in any event if he considers that this will be beneficial.  There is a view, and not a unanimous one among those concerned with the psychiatric services, that there should be some statutory directions in this regard.  The principal procedures that might be covered by these provisions are in relation to induced convulsive therapy, photo-convulsive therapy, lobotomy and a number of other measures like that, ECT, which is commonly known as shock treatment, and certain forms of psychotherapy. This provision is made here so that the medical profession themselves can give a judgment on what therapy is suitable and if there is a reference to them.</P>

That section provided that on the occurance in a mental institution of any of the following matters a report shall be given to the Minister in respect of an injury to a patient in the institution, an assault or alleged assault, an outbreak of infectious or epidemic disease whether affecting patients only, staff only or both, and any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of the patients.  The new provisions make the following changes: a report of the matter must be sent to the chief executive officer of the health board in addition to the Minister; existing injuries on reception and minor injury to the person while undergoing treatment are not required to be reported; all deaths must be notified. The existing legislation requires that assaults or alleged assaults on a patient by a member of the staff be notified but new provisions in this respect are more generalised.

It is proposed to take advantage of this Bill to provide also for the capital needed for development of the telex, data and telegram services and to fund from the capital allocation certain expenditure met from the Vote at present. I will return to these points in more detail later.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Bill was intended broadly to provide the funds estimated at that time as likely to be needed over a five year period, based on 1977 costs.  This sum has not proved adequate for five years because of the effects of inflation and of the adoption of an accelerated telephone development programme by the Government in 1979.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the accelerated five year development programme, spanning the years 1980-84, are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to raise the quality of the telephone, telex and data services for subscribers to the level in other EEC countries and maintain it at that level.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to provide a fully automatic service, including subscriber trunk dialling, internally and internationally for all subscribers.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to increase the rate of connections so that applications for telephones can generally be met on demand.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to lay the ground work for continuing growth. </P>
    <P>To achieve these objectives requires greatly increased investment compared with that envisaged in the 1977 Act.  Last year over £123 million was invested in the development of the service and this year it is planned to invest £220 million.  The reasons for a Bill being necessary at this stage rather than in 1982 as might have been expected in the ordinary course will therefore be clear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> In the debate on the 1977 Bill in the Seanad, a number of Senators suggested to my predecessor that the organisation of the telecommunications service should be reviewed, and questioned whether it was possible to operate a service of the size and complexity of the telephone service satisfactorily in the civil service. Some time after that, the Government appointed a review group under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael Dargan, to examine this issue and the group recommended that the telecommunications and postal services should be taken out of the civil service and responsibility for them entrusted to two separate State-sponsored bodies.  That recommendation was accepted by the Government and the preparatory work for establishing these bodies is being pressed ahead vigorously. A Green Paper was issued last year and a White Paper will, I expect, be issued quite soon.  Substantial progress has been made in the drafting of the necessary legislation.  I am hopeful that the draft legislation will be introduced in the Oireachtas this autumn and that the State-sponsored bodies will be established in the first half of next year.  But of course, as Senators will realise, it is not possible to be certain of this.</P>
    <P>I have made this point at this stage because the new State-sponsored body for telecommunications will be expected to raise the necessary capital for development of the service and consequently this Bill does not provide for capital for about five years ahead as did earlier Bills. However, because it is not possible to be certain when the State-sponsored body will take over and in order to provide against unforeseen difficulties the new body might have in raising funds quickly, this Bill provides a margin for contingencies to avoid the need for further legislation. I would like to emphasise, however, that as I said earlier the Bill is an enabling one and the authority sought in this Bill will be drawn upon only to the extent necessary.</P>
    <P>There is another development that also affects the amount of capital to be advanced under the Bill.  As Senators may already be aware, the Government's <Col N="1972" /> 1981 Investment Plan envisaged that up to £200 million of the total capital programme of £1,700 million this year would be funded by the private sector.  The aim is to fund in this way at least £100 million of the £220 million required for telephone capital purposes this year and whatever sum might be regarded as appropriate next year.  For this purpose a new company, Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd., were established recently and to the extent that this venture is successful in achieving what they were established to do, as I expect they will be, the need to draw capital from the Central Fund under the provisions of this Bill will be reduced.  This factor has been taken into account in the amount of money being provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that this Bill is intended to make funds available for development of the telex, data and telegram services.  Previous Bills provided only for capital for development of the telephone service.  Capital for development of the telex, data and telegram services was met from the Vote provision and not under the authority of the Telephone Capital Acts.  That was done on the basis that the capital required for development of these services was relatively small and did not warrant separate capital provision being made for them.  Telex and data services are assuming a more important role and can be expected to require more capital in the future.  The time has come, therefore, to fund capital development of these services from a capital fund.  In any event, from an accounting point of view, it is anomalous that capital for development of these services should be funded differently from that for telephone development. This Bill provides, therefore, that money for development of all telecommunication services &mdash; telephone, telex, data and telegrams &mdash; should be funded in the same way, and explains why this Bill is described as the Telecommunications Capital Bill when previous Bill were described as Telephone Capital Bills.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that all money spent on renewal of plant, such as telephone exchanges, should be funded under the provisions of this Bill.  Heretofore, much <Col N="1973" /> of this expenditure was borne on the Vote.  Renewals increase the life of the asset and, in general, involve expansion and modernisation.  It is reasonable and in accordance with good accounting practice that all expenditure on renewals should be treated as capital, and it is proposed that all such expenditure should now be met by the moneys to be authorised under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I propose to outline now the need for the funds sought under this Bill and to set out briefly what development is proposed over the period up to the end of 1984, the target date for achieving the objectives of the current accelerated telephone development programme.</P>
    <P>Nobody will, I believe, contest the need for a massive development of our telephone service.  It is generally accepted that the standard of our telephone service lags well behind that in our EEC partner countries and is an impediment to the efficient conduct of business as well as a deterrent to foreign firms to establish industries here.  There is, of course, also a pressing need for telephones for social purposes, such as for the aged.  The quality of our internal trunk call service still leaves much to be desired and the delay in meeting applications for telephones is much too long. These shortcomings clearly must be put right.  In practical terms this means the difficulties in making trunk calls must be eliminated, the 10 per cent of subscribers who have only manual service must be given an automatic one, dialling of all calls must be made possible and the waiting list of over 90,000 for telephones must be eliminated so that, like other services, applicants can be given promptly the services for which they are prepared to pay.  This, effectively, is what the current development programme aims to do.</P>
    <P>Expressed in these short simple terms it may seem a relatively easy task to accomplish what the accelerated programme aims to do but any such assumption would be very wide of the mark.  To get into a situation where these aims are met will involve</P>
    <P>&mdash; the provision of some 500 new buildings,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the replacement or extension of virtually <Col N="1974" /> all the existing telephone exchanges as well as the provision of many more new ones,</P>
    <P>&mdash; at least doubling the size of the existing trunk network,</P>
    <P>&mdash; carrying out cabling schemes in every area of the country so that service can be provided to applicants,</P>
    <P>&mdash; installing some 450,000 to 500,000 telephones,</P>
    <P>&mdash; converting all the remaining 450 manual exchanges to automatic working,</P>
    <P>&mdash; extending subscriber trunk dialling to all of Northern Ireland and Britain and international subscriber dialling to all subscribers in the country,</P>
    <P>&mdash; wiping out the existing waiting list for telex and data services. </P>
    <P>This is an undertaking of unprecedented scale and involves expansion at the rate of about 14 per cent per year so that the total size of the network is doubled over the five year period.  This rate of expansion has been attempted or achieved by very few other telecommunications administrations.  But given the necessary capital, as the Government have committed themselves to provide, and given the degree of the commitment that is forthcoming at all levels in the Department at present, I am confident that the very ambitious programme targets will be met.</P>
    <P>The cost of the five year programme covering the period 1980 to 1984 is estimated at £800 million at current prices. This sum will be spent under the following main heads:</P>
    <P>&mdash; subscriber and local network development,</P>
    <P>&mdash; local exchange development</P>
    <P>&mdash; trunk development</P>
    <P>&mdash; buildings. </P>
    <P>It will be noted that provision for staff is not provided for separately but the appropriate staffing costs are included under each of the four headings that I have referred to.  I will now outline what main work is proposed under each of these heads.</P>
    <P>Estimated cost for subscriber and local network development over the five year period is £379 million.  The aim over the five years 1980-1984 is to install between 450,000 and 500,000 telephones depending <Col N="1975" /> on the level of demand over the period, with the object of being in a position by the end of 1984 where applications for telephone service can be met promptly.  This would involve installation rates of 60,000, 80,000, 100,000 and perhaps 110,000 to 120,000 a year in later years if the level of demand warrants that.  While it is expected that there will be a continuing growth in demand, it is not possible to predict with confidence what the level is likely to be even in the medium term as demand is influenced by general economic circumstances.  It is not possible to assess accurately either what will be the effect on demand of the more ready availability of telephone service.  If about 450,000 telephones were installed over the five years the telephone density would be 28 per 100 of population at the end of that time.  This would still be quite low by comparison with other EEC countries. It has to be borne in mind, however, that the level of income per head here is generally lower than in other EEC countries while the family size is bigger, so that in the medium term at any rate we probably will not have as high a telephone density in this country as in some of the more prosperous countries.</P>
    <P>The size of the task involved in increasing the rate of connections from 41,000 a year, the highest achieved before last year, to over 100,000 in the space of three years or so cannot be over stressed.  It is not simply a case of installing a telephone in the applicant's house.  To provide a telephone connection involves the wiring of the customer's premises, the installation of the phone having a pair of wires from each telephone either in overhead or underground cabling back to the nearest exchange, having spare terminations in the local exchange to which the phone can be connected, and having adequate capacity in the trunk exchange and trunk circuit network to carry the extra traffic generated.  The work involved in providing a telephone is broadly the same from one year to the next, which puts the size of the current task into perspective. Increasing the annual rate of connections along with lines described will require a very substantial increase in the local <Col N="1976" /> cabling network, whether by laying underground pipes and cables or by erecting poles and stringing wires overhead, all of which are highly labour intensive as well, of course, as being expensive.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of extra staff will obviously be needed to carry out the programme. The staff are being built up as quickly as can possibly be done, but there are limits to the number that can be absorbed in any year &mdash; limits imposed by the accommodation available to house them and by the ability to train and absorb them productively into the work force.  Over the last year 1,000 extra installation staff were recruited, adding to the 6,000 or so already on development and installation work.  There is the problem in seeking to overtake the backlog of demand in a short time that the risk of over-staffing and of having to lay-off staff subsequently must be guarded against and this is being watched closely.  I should add that contractors are being used extensively to supplement the efforts of the Department's own staff on the range of work on which they can be employed.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost for local exchange development over the five year period is £160 million.  To meet the demand for new subscribers' lines, additional automatic exchange equipment will be provided at virtually all existing exchanges. Over the next two years some 300 new exchanges will be provided or existing ones extended.  These will include major installations at Ballyboden, Belcamp, Clondalkin, Crown Alley, Dolphin's Barn, Finglas, Terenure and Tallaght in Dublin, and at Athlone, Ballinasloe, Bantry, Carlow, Castleblaney, Cavan, Ceanannus Mór, Clonmel, Cork &mdash; ten centres &mdash; Donegal, Drogheda, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Galway &mdash; Shantalla and Mervue &mdash; Kilkenny, Mullingar, Naas, New Ross, Sligo, Tralee, Waterford and Wexford, to name but some of the bigger centres in the provincial areas.  In addition, all the remaining 450 manual exchanges will, it is planned, be converted to automatic working by the end of 1984.  The aim is to changeover almost 300 of them over the next two years but it is not possible to be <Col N="1977" /> certain at this stage that this can be done as the volume of work involved in conversions by way of overhaul and replacement of linework, changing of instruments and so on, is very great and staffing resources may be inadequate to cope with a peak of work of this kind over such a short period.  However, every effort will be make to meet this target.</P>
    <P>As the programme progresses, digital equipment will form the greater part of the equipment being installed.  In all, subscriber exchange capacity will be increased by about 440,000 lines by the end of 1984 making it possible, in so far as subscriber exchange equipment is concerned, to give service to that number of additional subscribers.</P>
    <P>In regard to trunk development the estimated cost over a five year period is £125 million.  Development of the trunk network is an essential feature of the programme.  The failure rate on trunk calls in the internal trunk network and on calls to Britain is much too high and is a source of frustration to users.  These difficulties have been due primarily to congestion in the trunk network, caused by overloading of the existing trunk exchange capacity and by inadequate trunk circuit capacity on numbers of main routes.  These problems must be eliminated if we are to reach the targets set in terms of call success rates.  To do this will involve replacing or extending the trunk exchanges in most centres and substantially strengthening the trunk routes. Work on this is already well in hand.</P>
    <P>For example, in Dublin, which is the hub of the trunk network, a new 4,000 circuit capacity trunk exchange was opened at the end of last year and is being brought into use on a phased basis.  This will relieve congestion in the Dublin trunk exchanges and will enable numbers of badly needed additional trunk circuits required on some of the main trunk routes into and out of Dublin to be provided.</P>
    <P>Installation of another exchange of the same capacity is in progress and should be ready for opening early next year while a new 8,000 circuit capacity digital trunk exchange is on order and should be ready for service next year.  When these <Col N="1978" /> exchanges are available, all congestion in the Dublin trunk exchanges should be relieved and it will be possible to withdraw from service some obsolete STD equipment which is no longer fully satisfactory and is hard to maintain.  These measures will result in a doubling of the existing trunk exchange capacity in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Similar schemes are in progress or planned at many centres outside Dublin. For example, in Cork the installation of a major new trunk exchange is well advanced and it is expected the exchange will be opened later this year.  Other centres where new trunk exchange will be opened this year are Athlone, Ballinasloe, Bantry, Ceanannus Mór, Cork, Donegal, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Longford, Mullingar, Naas, Navan, Tralee, Tuam, Sligo.  It is planned to provide new trunk exchanges next year at Dublin, Athy, Carrick-on-Shannon, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Enfield, Ennistymon, Kanturk, Limerick, Mallow, Waterford, Youghal and Wexford.</P>
    <P>About 5,000 new trunk circuits will be brought into service this year.  These include circuits on the cross-Channel route, Dublin-Sligo route and Dublin-Arklow route, some of which are already in service.  Among the trunk routes to be strengthened this year by the provision of new microwave radio links or new co-axial cables or by increasing the capacity of existing cables are the following:&mdash;Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Waterford, Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Athlone, Dublin-Navan, Sligo-Letterkenny, Galway-Athlone, Limerick-Tralee, Galway-Tuam and Dublin-Mullingar.</P>
    <P>In addition it is planned to install a new digital microwave link network spanning the main trunk arteries throughout the country.  As well as providing additional trunk capacity this new network will have the advantage of providing alternative trunk routes in the event of trunk cables or existing microwave links being out of order for any reason.  Altogether, it is planned to increase the trunk circuit system capacity by about 30,000 extra circuits by means of microwave radio links, by over 20,000 extra circuits in coaxial <Col N="1979" /> cables and about 20,000 more circuits by extra underground cabling, and optical fibre cables.</P>
    <P>The number of trunk circuits in use at present is about 33,000 and that puts the projected additional system capacity into perspective.  Work on expanding the trunk exchange and trunk circuit system will, of course, be a continuing feature and the development work carried out over the next few years will have to be built on in the years after that.  But the major work will be done over the next two to three years.</P>
    <P>All of these schemes could not of course be planned or implemented at once and some are, naturally, more advanced than others.  Improvements in trunk call performance are already beginning to become evident with the opening of the new trunk exchange in Dublin that I have referred to, and the pace of improvement will gather momentum from the second half of this year onwards. It is important, however, that it should be well understood that it is likely to be 1984 before a high quality trunk service is available in the country generally. Users of the service generally can be assured, however, that a high quality service will be available by then, and will be available well in advance of that for many of them.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the trunk service there are some other aspects to which I would like to refer.  These are the STD service to Northern Ireland and Great Britain and the international service.  Calls can be dialled by customers at present to Belfast, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester. Calls to all other areas in Northern Ireland and Britain must be obtained <i>via</i> an operator.  There are difficult technical and other problems involved in extending subscriber trunk dialling to all areas in Northern Ireland and Britain and any extensions can take place only in cooperation with the British administration. As a result of recent technical developments, and in particular the introduction of digital exchanges, it is expected that it will be possible to find satisfactory solutions to the technical problems.  Discussions <Col N="1980" /> with the British telecommunications administration have, therefore, been intensified and I am hopeful that a substantial extension of direct dialling to centres in Northern Ireland and Britain will be possible within the next two years or so.</P>
    <P>International direct dialling is now available to subscribers in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Drogheda, Dundalk, Athlone and Shannon Airport.  New trunk exchanges now on order include the equipment needed to enable subscribers to dial their international calls and international subscriber dialling will be extended progressively in this way.</P>
    <P>International traffic has been growing at a much faster rate than internal traffic and the existing international telephone exchange is being extended to cater for this growth.  A second international exchange in Dublin is planned for 1985 but much of the advance work will be done in the period up to the end of 1984. A satellite earth station which will provide circuits for traffic primarily to North and South America is planned to come into operation in 1984.</P>
    <P>The site for the earth station is at Midleton and preliminary work on the design of the earth station is in progress.  This country has already shares in international communication satellites and is at present exploring the question of taking shares in a European satellite planned to come into operation in 1983-84.  My Department are also keeping in close touch with the development of business satellite systems which are beginning to be used extensively in the United States.</P>
    <P>Estimated cost of buildings over a five year period is £120 million.  One of the basic tasks involved in achieving the service improvement targets set has been to provide the necessary accommodation for equipment, for staff, for training, for stores and for housing and maintaining the very large fleet of over 2,000 motor vehicles.  A huge programme involving the provision of over 500 buildings has had to be undertaken.  Virtually all the sites for these buildings have been acquired and by the end of this year work on about 400 of them will either have <Col N="1981" /> been completed or be in progress.  To ensure that buildings would be made available in the shortest possible time the arrangements and procedures for processing their provision between my Department and the Office of Public Works and within the Office of Public Works were greatly streamlined with, I am happy to say, satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>While improving the basic services is clearly the prime task and the main thrust of the programme is in doing this, other possibilities of improvements are not being neglected.  I propose to refer to only a few of these to show what is being done.</P>
    <P>A programme of installing payphones which allow callers to dial trunk calls as well as local calls is now under way.  The first of these were installed earlier this year and the aim is to install them in all public call offices in the next two to three years, as well as making them available for rental to subscribers who opt for them.  In addition, trials of a new type of payphone suitable for installation in supervised locations such as public houses, shops and hotels will take place over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Kiosks are now being installed more extensively to meet the requirements of the public, particularly in rural areas and in newly built-up estates in urban areas. Altogether there are some 4,000 public telephones in kiosks and call offices.  For many years it had been the practice to instal kiosks in rural areas only in replacement of call office telephones in post offices where the use likely to be made of the kiosks would justify this.  For the past two years or so, kiosks have been provided in rural areas where there is no local post office but where the use likely to be made of a public phone would justify its provision.</P>
    <P>In deciding whether a kiosk should be provided at a particular location regard is had to such factors as the number of private phones in the catchment area, whether there are churches, schools and shops in the area which would be likely to affect the use made of a telephone, as well as other local features.  It is envisaged that the number of kiosks provided in rural areas will be extended gradually <Col N="1982" /> on this basis.  A scheme is also in operation where local authorities can have kiosks provided at their request under guarantee against loss in areas where their provision would not be justified on the basis of the criteria used by the Department.</P>
    <P>The provision of a public mobile radio telephone service is also proposed.  A decision in principle has been taken to introduce it, the likely market has been surveyed and the technical requirements are now being examined.  It is expected that the service will be introduced in Dublin late next year, and the extension of it other areas will be assessed in the light of experience in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The telex and data services are assuming growing importance for the business community.  The telex service is a particularly valuable one and telex density in this country is among the highest in Europe.  Demand for the service continues to be high.  Like telephones there has, regrettably, been delay in meeting applications and there is at present a waiting list of over 1,500, the number of machines installed last year being 770, which was a record.  Steps have been taken which, if implemented, as I expect they will, should ensure that by the end of next year applications can be met promptly. The measures taken include extending one of the existing two main telex exchanges and installing a third one, expected to be opened next month, thus providing enough exchange capacity for a number of years ahead, the opening of sub-exchanges at Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the strengthening of trunk routes for telex and assigning extra staff to telex installation work.</P>
    <P>Data services are also assuming a growing importance for certain sectors of the community.  There is scope for improvement here too and the aim is to step up the installation rate over the next two years to a point where it will be possible to give a service that will meet applicants' needs.  A new data centre was opened last year and this has capacity for further extension.  A new data centre is planned for 1984-85.  Last year access was provided for data subscribers here to Euronet, an EEC data bank, giving information <Col N="1983" /> on a range of subjects such as science and medicine; this year access will be given to similar data banks in the USA. The aim is to have a separate packet switched network for data in 1984-85.</P>
    <P>Since funds for development of the telegram service are also covered by the provisions of this Bill, I propose to refer to that service very briefly.  The telegram service here, like that in other countries, is a declining one and the question of discontinuing it will arise in the course of time, but this is still some way off.  In the meantime, a high standard of service will continue to be given.</P>
    <P>Development of the telecommunications services will provide substantial additional employment, both directly and indirectly.  The telecommunications services themselves give employment at present in the Department to over 17,000 people and indirectly to some thousands employed by contractors who erect exchange buildings, manufacture and instal equipment, supply and lay ducts and cables, supply stores, and so on.  This year it is expected that the investment of £220 million in the development of the service will enable some 4,400 more jobs to be provided, 2,000 of these in the Department, 2,000 in the building industry and 400 in ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>The Department are naturally concerned that the maximum benefits should flow to the economy generally from the investment in the telecommunications programme.  Already arrangements are being made that will result in the telephone exchanges needed for the programme being manufactured in this country. Much of the trunk equipment, whether in the form of multiplex equipment or pulse code modulation equipment is already being obtained from Irish manufacturers and much of the subscriber cable is already being made here.</P>
    <P>The Department's policy is to order equipment and stores from Irish manufacturers wherever the price is competitive and the quality satisfactory.  Altogether some 60 per cent of the stores used are obtained from Irish manufacturers and the Department are offering every encouragement to Irish manufacturers to supply the balance.  For example, last <Col N="1984" /> year in association with the Irish Goods Council, the Department arranged a display of imported stores at four centres in the country.  This attracted a lot of interest and already some of the imported products displayed are being manufactured here.</P>
    <P>The Department have joined too with the National Board of Science and Technology, the Higher Educational Institutions and the manufacturing sector in a new Council for Telecommunications Research, Development and Training. The role of the council will be to improve relationships between Government and industry in the telecommunications area so that each will have a better understanding of the needs of the other, that action can be taken to meet their joint needs and that the country will be geared to take maximum advantage of the employment opportunities afforded by developments in the telecommunications and electronics area.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the telecommunications services is that taking one year with another the services should pay their way.  To enable this to be done charges for services have had to be increased at intervals in recent years. Investment in the services is therefore paid for by the users and in practice a significant part of the capital invested comes from within the services.  About £70 million will be met from depreciation provisions over the next two years.  The development of the telecommunications services is also being funded by the European Investment Bank and other EEC Institutions.  Loans of £165 million have been made available over the past few years to the Minister for Finance and grants of about £75 million have been approved by the European Regional Development Fund for telephone projects.</P>
    <P>Over a long period of years the telephone service operated at a profit.  The seventies, however, was a period of exceptional difficulty for the finances of the services due to a combination of factors &mdash; high rate of inflation, high interest rates, economic recession and industrial action.  A period of heavy investment in the service such as is taking place at the <Col N="1985" /> present time, and which will be continued over the next few years, will also make for a more difficult financial position.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, investment in the infrastructure such as in buildings and more exchanges and trunk systems which are not used to capacity place a strain on the finances.  However, according as more subscribers are connected to the network and increasing use is made of the expanded exchange and trunk and local cabling network, the financial position will improve.  This improvement should take place on a gradual basis and the financial position of the services should be in a healthy state by the end of the programme period in 1984.</P>
    <P>While the purpose of the Bill is simply an enabling one, I would like to stress the Government commitment to according development of the telecommunications services a high priority and making the necessary capital available.  Telephone improvement schemes have a long lead time and it is essential that there should be an assurance of the continued availability of capital and that development of the services should not be subject to stop-go financing as it was in the past. The Government's good faith in this matter will be evident from the amounts made available last year and this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, as I mentioned at the outset, an investment company has been established to help in financing development, thus easing the burden on the Central Fund and making it easier to provide the necessary finances.  There is no reason, therefore, why the capital required should not continue to be made available. It is essential for the good of the economy and for our social development that it should.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to point out that, when the current programme objectives are met, investment at a high level will continue to be necessary.  There will almost certainly be a continuing high level of demand for telecommunications services in the years ahead and the system will have to be expanded to cater for this as well of course as providing for the growing volume of calls and for modernisation of the services.  That expansion will, I expect, take place under the new <Col N="1986" /> Telecommunications Board which, as I said earlier, will be expected to raise the funds needed for development of the services.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill the the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Telecommunications Capital Bill, 1981.  It is an enabling Bill, as described by the Minister of State.  I will be much briefer than the Minister&mdash;he will be relieved to hear &mdash; in the few comments I want to make on this Bill.  Living in an open economy, as we do, telecommunications are absolutely vital.  This is not simply an internal issue because of the nature of our export -import economy.  The provision of wealth and jobs is dependent on the free flow of commerce with the outside world and, therefore, a satisfactory telecommunications service is absolutely fundamental.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has been very active in this sector and there was a great deal of activity by the previous Government and by the previous Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  There is a consensus in this area for very obvious reasons. Without a satisfactory modern means of communication countries in the world of today simply cannot survive.  Yesterday in this House we were discussing a Bill under which the Government propose to give to the Industrial Development Authority the function of giving grants to the service sector, a sophisticated service sector to do with consultancy, to do with all kinds of services for which Ireland might be a base.  In that area even more than in industry itself any possibility of success must depend on a satisfactory telecommunications system.  For that reason my party support this measure fully to bring this country out of the darker ages and into a more modern position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time one visits the United States one is struck by their tremendous ease of communications, the little push button telephones, the ease with which one can dial direct across a continent of 3,000 miles, and the simplicity and the effectiveness of that service in comparison to what has been the peculiar Irish situation. There is a vast gulf there.  It is mind-boggling what we will have to do if we <Col N="1987" /> are to reach the standard provided in the modern countries of western Europe and in the United States of America.  But it has to be done.</P>
    <P>The review group reported back to the Minister the recommendation that this sector should be taken out of the civil service and that two semi-State bodies should be established.  I find that an acceptable idea.  There are obvious constraints on a Government Department attempting to develop a service such as this.  We have seen the semi-State sector as a very successful arm of Government in areas covered by bodies such as the Industrial Development Authority and Córas Tráchtála, with the greater freedom of movement they have.  It is very sensible to establish a similar type body to deal with the telecommunications issue.</P>
    <P>Investment by the private sector in this new company which has been formed, Irish Telecommunications Investment Limited, and the provision of funds by the private sector is a fairly novel idea.  It is to be welcomed, but the extent to which the private sector is prepared to invest in alliance with the public sector is debatable having regard to the different functions and the profit motive being paramount to the private sector as opposed to the functions and objectives of the public sector.  I am a little bit dubious in the long-term about its success in this area.</P>
    <P>Having given our full support to this Bill I do not think we should paper over the cracks because there are still very serious problems.  A waiting list of over 90,000 people is completely unsatisfactory. Many business people simply cannot get telephones.  The service is not adequate.  It is difficult to get through from the Dublin exchange to telephone numbers which are not automatic.  You dial 10 and wait for a very long time before there is the courtesy of a response. The Minister will be personally aware of this difficulty in phoning many remote places in Connemara in his proposed new constituency, and the problem there is in getting through from the Dublin Exchange.  I know the Department are not ultimately responsible, but the number <Col N="1988" /> of broken phones and telephones in which money is jammed due to vandalism and factors outside the Department's control is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of the new pay phones system.  Developing this trunk call system and international call system on the pay phone system is an excellent idea.  The only problem is that it probably should have happened long before now.  I welcome too the fact that an attempt is being made by the Department in this capital programme to ensure that, in so far as is possible, the largest possible proportion of this plant, machinery and building materials is purchased within this country.  It is very heartening to see that there is investment within this country in manufacturing some of the most sophisticated equipment in the world in the telecommunications field. This is to be applauded.  These companies should be very successful, given the base they will have, and the captive market they will have, because of the commitment of this Government and the previous Government in the telecommunications sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I can assure the Minister that he will have the support of my party.  While we are making the progress which is very necessary having regard to the enormous waiting list, we need to reach the point of being able to provide telephones on demand.  We need a modern system.  We need a modern structure and the sooner we get on with the job the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech.  We know about the capital development which is on-going but, looking to the past, we also know that this side of the telecommunications system was neglected.  The extent of the capital input into the telecommunications system is very welcome.  Compared with previous years I have experienced a considerable improvement in the provision of telephones in some areas.  I am a little disturbed to see that the Minister refers to a waiting list of 1,500 people awaiting telex machines.  Telex, as the Minister knows, is almost a part of the lifeblood of industry.  With the programme the <Col N="1989" /> Industrial Development Authority are pursuing, we realise that industrial expansion and development depend to a great extent on the provision of telex.</P>
      <P>On the question of the provision of telephones in housing estates, certainly around Dublin, there has been improvement in some areas.  But I should like to see the Minister's Department, through their planning section, providing information on when customers may expect to be connected.  It is not enough for prospective subscribers to be told that the question is being looked into and that the Department will get in touch with them in due course.  People would be far happier if they had some idea whether it was going to be three months or six months before they were likely to get service.  I know the Minister, his Department and his officials are dealing with a backlog but the provision of that kind of information would be very helpful to the public.</P>
      <P>Another area to which I would like to refer very briefly is that of the reporting of faults by subscribers.  I have had a number of cases recently of subscribers whose lines had gone out of order, which had been reported regularly, but which had not been repaired.  Would the Minister check on the procedure that is adopted in reporting complaints?  I am sure he does that from time to time but there is a good deal of this recently and it should not be necessary for public representatives and others to get in touch with the Department if a subscriber's line is out of order due to some defect or accident.  If the reporting system is working it should not take more than a few days to repair that line.  I reported a number of cases recently where subscribers had to wait two and three weeks.  I know that the officials and technical staff of the Department are overworked.  It may be that the communications system is not working too well.  Would the Minister say whether the interest charges on the capital borrowings are covered in the projected estimates for the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the projected cost of the use of satellites?  I welcome the introduction of the idea of using satellites.  Would the Minister give details of vandalism to telephones <Col N="1990" /> reported to his Department during the first four or five months of this year and any information that he may have of the new, modern vandalproof telephones which the Department are providing?</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress which is being made by the Telecommunications Branch.  I particularly welcome the initiative that was taken with the Irish Goods Council in arranging for the display of imported stores which encouraged the setting up of small industries here to produce the same goods.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on the most comprehensive coverage of the plan for the reconstruction and development of the telecommunications network.  It is a great tribute to him, to the Minister, and to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for all the work which has obviously gone into this.  It is a chronicle of success.  What is being done now will carry over into the future no matter what happens.</P>
      <P>There were some very brave decisions taken over the last couple of years.  It was recognised early that the telecommunications system was an obstacle to effective industrial development.  I remember when I was working in Shannon we did not have an automatic exchange in the industrial estate there.  The ridicule which I had to put up with from Americans, Germans and Japanese about the problems of telephone calls was most annoying for an engineer, particularly one who had worked in Posts and Telegraphs at one stage.  It is most heartening to hear the Minister spell out the developments which are to take place and that they are founded on the best of modern technology. It was a brave step to go straight into digitals, to take the bull by the horns and force the supply companies to come forward as well, because it was as easy for them to go along with the old system. They had plenty of work in progress, now thy have to do something new and that puts pressure on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other area of technology, satellites, to which Senator Brugha referred, is obviously going to make a fantastic <Col N="1991" /> impression on telecommunications in the future.  I can see from the data systems and the inter-connections for conference facilities, that people will not necessarily have to fly the Atlantic to have detailed technical conferences.  It will be done by video transfer through satellite.  These things are upon us and we are ready for them.  The Minister and the Department have taken the steps which bring us into the post-1984 era.  It was rather interesting that 1984 is the year that kept popping up in terms of certain exchanges.  &ldquo;1984&rdquo; was also a bad date in the past, when everyone was going to be snooped on. The Minister's speech has given 1984 a good flavour.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see also that the heavy borrowings which will be required for this are not going to be all lumbered on to the normal Government financial system.  An attempt will be made to bring money in through private resources.  We have talked a lot in the past about economic and financial policies so I am not going to elaborate, but here is a good example of doing this.  I am looking forward to seeing some money coming in for this purpose which will be got at a good cheap interest rate.  There is plenty of money available in the world at cheap interest rates.  We should take some chances on this.</P>
    <P>I wish the Telecommunications Council well.  It is a good way of harnessing the technological know-how in the country. It is heartening to see people like Tom Hardiman, Chairman of the National Board of Science and Technology involved in the review committee that put forward the recommendations for the restructuring of the Department.  He is also Chairman of the International Broadcasting Telecommunication Committee, which is a great honour for an Irishman. We have people in this country who can do these things themselves.  As the Minister pointed out, in terms of basic supply there is a big shift towards getting more and more of this equipment supplied by Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  He has succeeded in achieving the targets for this year.  I am sure he has put in train a <Col N="1992" /> process which will lead to the achievements of the broader targets that he has set out.  I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate some of my old colleagues in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who are now at the top of the technology field in the Department. They have seized the opportunities and made fantastic leaps forward.  When you meet people in the Department you can see how excited they are by the whole prospect and morale is great.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to delay this Bill one minute longer than is necessary, but after that eulogy from Senator Mulcahy a few words of realism should be said.  When I was listening to Senator Mulcahy I felt he was really talking about some other country when he spoke about the dazzling achievements and the wonderful congratulations due all round.  I see this Bill as a commitment which we must make to improving telecommunications which are an absolutely vital link in the development which we are trying with such difficulty to make.</P>
      <P>I have been in constant communication, as I am quite sure very many Senators in this House have been, with the Minister and I want to compliment him on the courtesy of his replies which always give the bad news in the nicest possible way.  However, it does not soften the blow for the people upon whose behalf I make these inquiries.  I have in front of me the most recent answer from the Minister which is again couched in the most considerate and courteous terms but ends by saying he is sorry the news is not better.  All the letters I get from the Minister end with &ldquo;I am sorry the news is not better&rdquo;.  I write a letter to my friends and tell them I am sorry the news is not better.  We are all sorry the news is not better but there are great things ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that, since we have larger families than usual in EEC countries, maybe we could manage with less telephones.  At least that is the impression I got.  Young people are growing up in the telecommunications era and the bigger the family and more demands there are to communicate with each other <Col N="1993" /> and with friends.  In my innocence, being a busy politican, I decided I would get a second telephone, one telephone for me and another for my family, which is a perfectly normal, natural thing in any country with a decent telephone system. When I rang the relevant office to discuss this question, the only expression I can use is that the girl who answered nearly fell around laughing.  She said I must be joking to ask for a second telephone.</P>
    <P>She mentioned 1986, not 1984, as a time when there might be some question of people being able, as they can, for example, in the United States, to have as many phones as they like providing they are prepared to pay for them.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a brief note of realism on behalf of all the people who will not find a great deal of comfort in being told that 1984 is nearly upon us.  This is only 1981 and promises do not help people who are living in isolated areas with sick relatives and who simply cannot get a telephone.  The letter that I mentioned this morning from the Minister deals with a person in an isolated area with a sick child.</P>

      <P>I also want to mention the effect on employment and industrial development of the lack of telephones.  I am dealing at the moment with a very successful small company which is an exporter of tubular steel hospital equipment. They are now at a point where expansion is required; they have a new factory in Bray and they want to enter the next phase of their development by moving their office staff into that factory and get it off the ground.  Apparently 18 months ago a team from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs put a black box on the wall and the company were expecting great things.  The black box is still on the wall and there is no telephone.  They cannot move the staff into the building and they are grossly hampered in their development by lack of ability to communicate. The Minister mentioned the commitment to maintain the high morale of the Department.  It is important that <Col N="1994" /> everybody takes an opportunity to help that commitment and to make sure that it does not flag.  I welcome the Bill and the great future it has for all of us.</P>

      <P>I join in the welcome for this Bill because I think the development of our telecommunications service is vital for the social and economic growth of our country.  Not only is this going to help and improve social life between the citizens of our country but it is also going to help economic development.  An efficient telecommunications service can do perhaps more for industrial and commercial development than any other single aspect of our infrastructure.  It has been neglected in the past and one cannot but give a great welcome to the new impetus that has been given to this important area of our economy in recent years.  I hope the maximum possible use will be made of Irish sources of material in that development, consistent with the highest standards of product and productivity.  I also hope the State-sponsored body to be established will be self-sustaining, that it will generate sufficient revenue to cover all its costs and remunerate the public for the investment they will have in that new telecommunications self-sponsored body.  I welcome this Bill and the intention of developing further our telecommunications service.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their views and for the constructive approach to the debate, particularly for the welcome that has been given to the Bill today.  The current programme for improving and modernising the telephone service should be continued. There is no alternative to this. The necessity for it is primarily from the industrial point of view.  We must strive towards giving that sector the most modern service possible.  I welcome Senator Staunton's remarks because he lives and works in a constituency similar to my own, a region which has suffered the consequences of a bad telecommunications system for many many years.  He understands and stated clearly and <Col N="1995" /> emphatically that we should have a push button service as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey said that she got the nice letter which gave the bad news.  If it was good news we would not have to write a nice letter.  There is a misconception about what is possible and impossible. In regard to the alleged bad service in areas a long way from exchanges, it is still a far superior service to that in America and parts of Canada, Wales and Scotland. In any of the big urban areas of America or England, one thinks that the system runs very freely but in rural and remote areas the system is so obsolete that to all intent and purposes it is nonexistent.</P>
      <P>I regret I have to send letters like that received by Senator Hussey, but it is better to tell people the facts and apologise for them.  This Bill will remedy the situation. Last year we went to the major island of the Aran Islands and opened a new automatic telephone exchange.</P>
      <P>We have tried to keep a balance in the distribution of the network.  I hope we will have reached them all by 1984.  This year we are changing from manual to automatic at the rate of one exchange per week or a fraction more.  That is a terrific standard.  Some Senators remarked they are delighted that progress is being made. Progress is only possible when money is made available to us.  A Minister cannot do what he wishes or meet his programme unless the Government of the day give him the finances and the money to back it up.  Approximately £350 million has been given to this Department by the Government freely and willingly in the last two years.  That is why there is a change in the service.  It will take an enormous amount of capital to make it exactly what we want but the Department and the Government are totally committed to the implementation of that vigorous and strong programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators wondered why the waiting list is 90,000.  I have on many occasions in the past 12 months explained the situation.  In January 1980 there were approximately 83,000 telephone applicants on the waiting list.  In 1980 we installed approximately 62,500 telephones. <Col N="1996" /> One would think by the end of the year we should have nothing left but the balance, yet at present we are back up to 90,000 on the waiting list.  We intend that the programme for this year of 80,000 telephone installations will be carried out.  One would imagine there would be only 10,000 at the end of the year on a waiting list but, due to the needs and the expanding efforts of business and people in general we will be up again to a figure of 90,000 if not more, at the end of the following year.  One can understand that while people might try to adjust the figures to suit a situation, our programme states that this year we should install 80,000 telephones, next year 100,000 telephones, in 1983 120,000 telephones and in 1984 140,000 telephones. I hope by 1984 we shall be able to give telephones on demand.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha, Senator Mulcahy and others asked about vandalism to kiosks and pay phones.  I am glad that it is recognised now, not alone in the Houses of the Oireachtas but by the public at large, that vandalism of telephone kiosks is not acceptable.  I am delighted with that attitude. Last year we spent £150,000 on repairs to kiosks.  This shows the lack of education and the lack of respect that vandals have when they attack such a tender unit.  A telephone is a very tender machine and it has got to be treated gently.  We have now tried in the most exhaustive way to develop a new type of machine which should be able to resist vandalism.  So far the success rate is good. We hope that it will be even greater.  The pay phone itself is a little more difficult to vandalise and we hope that it will continue to resist attacks.  Again it must be treated very gently, otherwise it will not operate.  I want that to be made known in this House, as I have tried to do in several places.  It gives a tremendous service.  You can get through to 70 countries without the help of the operator.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who have so generously welcomed this Bill.  I assure Senator Mulcahy that we have the push button telephone service and we should be installing it in certain exchanges particularly as the digital exchanges come in <Col N="1997" /> line this year.  We should be able to give a choice to the consumers to use the push button telephone if they so desire and by the time the complete programme of digital exchange installations is completed, you may then have a choice of using push button or PABX systems.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator Hussey did not get the second line.  I suppose she may need it.  Perhaps it is a bit much for any of us to ask for a second line when one sees that we still have 90,000 people waiting for a single line.</P>
    <P>Some Senators were worried that the waiting list for telex installations seemed high.  At the end of this year we will have installed over 2,000 telex sets.  There is a waiting list now of about 1,500.  We have brought new telex exchanges into operation and gradually they are in process of completion.  We should be able to give on demand a telex service by the end of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend and generally reinforce the provisions of the existing law, as set out in section 22 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, relating to the making of barring orders in cases of domestic violence. The main improvements proposed are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, under section 3 of the Bill a spouse who applies to a court &mdash; normally this would be the District Court &mdash; for a barring order will now be able, following the making of the application, to obtain an injunction-type order, to be called a &ldquo;protection order&rdquo;.  That order will direct the other spouse not to use or threaten <Col N="1998" /> to use violence against, or molest or put in fear, the applicant spouse or a child of the family.  It will ensure interim protection to the applicant spouse and children while the application for a barring order is being considered by the court.  Breach of a protection order, like breach of a barring order, will be a criminal offence. Second, section 7 will confer on the Garda a power to arrest without warrant a spouse who contravenes a barring order or a protection order.  Third, under section 8, where a person who is charged with breach of a barring order or protection order is given bail and then commits one or more further breaches while on bail, any sentences of imprisonment imposed for the breaches will have to be consecutive.</P>
    <P>In addition, the maximum duration of a barring order which can be made by the District Court is being extended from three to 12 months, and the existing High Court jurisdiction to make barring orders is being transferred to the Circuit Court. Senators will recall that these latter provisions were originally contained in the Courts Bill, 1980, which has recently become law.  They have been taken over into this Bill for the sake of completeness.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill proposes to give the courts greater flexibility in dealing with applications for barring orders and to enable rules of court to be made providing for the expeditious hearing of these cases.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1976, the only civil law remedy, apart from judicial separation, available in these cases was an injunction from the High Court or Circuit Court ordering the offending spouse to leave the family home.  However, one could not always be confident of obtaining such an injunction and that situation, together with the problem of costs in the absence then of civil legal aid, meant that for practical purposes a remedy was not available to many people.</P>
    <P>The 1976 Act, following a recommendation in the 19th Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, introduced the concept of a barring order obtainable from all first instance courts.  This was a radical innovation at the time, and over the years <Col N="1999" /> since then the barring order has become the principal means by which spouses who are subjected to violence in their homes seek relief from the courts.  This is illustrated by the fact that in the three years ending July 1980 an average of about 200 barring orders a year were made by the District Court for the Dublin Metropolitan District alone.</P>
    <P>It was to be expected that experience of the operation of this new legislative provision would show up areas where there was scope for improvement.  This is what in fact happened.  The present Bill is the result of a detailed examination of the operation of the barring order provision in the 1976 Act.  It has been prepared after detailed consultations with those concerned in its operation, notably members of the Judiciary and the Garda authorities, and with a number of voluntary agencies, mainly women's organisations, active in the area of family problems. Some valuable studies and reports were received from these organisations. The Bill has the relatively modest but nonetheless important purpose of ensuring that the statutory provision for the protection of spouses and children in cases of domestic violence, first introduced in 1976, is as adequate and effective as the law can make it.</P>
    <P>The principal innovation in the Bill is the provision in section 3 for the making of a protection order.  Such an order can be made in favour of a spouse who has applied for a barring order where the court is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of the applicant or of any child of the family requires it.  The protection order is an order in the nature of an interim injunction directing the other spouse not to use, or threaten to use, violence against the applicant spouse or a child, or molest or put them in fear. The court may make a protection order at the time of the application for the barring order or at any time before the application is decided upon, and whether or not the summons in relation to the application has been served on the other spouse.  The protection order will expire at the conclusion of the barring order <Col N="2000" /> proceedings but, if the court decides to make a barring order, it will be able to include in it a prohibition of violence and molestation in the same terms as in a protection order.</P>
    <P>The protection order provision has been introduced in response to representations that a spouse who applies for a barring order would in many cases be in danger of being subjected to further violence until such time as a barring order was made by the court.  The suggestion was made that this situation could be met by providing for the grant of an interim barring order by the court on the <i>ex parte</i> application of the applicant spouse.  However, it would be a serious matter to bar a spouse from the family home without first giving that spouse an opportunity of being heard.  I do not think that such a provision, which would amount to a power to grant an eviction order without notice of the proceedings, would be acceptable to this House.</P>
    <P>A spouse against whom a protection order is made will continue to be entitled to live in the family home but will be under a very strong compulsion to refrain from acts of violence or intimidation towards the other spouse or the children. Contravention of the order will be a criminal offence and an offender will be liable to arrest on complaint being made to a garda by or on behalf of the applicant.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate in the Dáil the point was made that the involvement of the Garda in incidents of domestic violence may not always be appropriate.  In fact, it is probably true to say that the Garda are reluctant to get involved in family disputes of any kind in view of the intimate and sensitive nature of the issues that may arise and the allegations and counter-allegations that usually accompany them. It was considerations of this nature that influenced the decision not to give the Garda a power of arrest without warrant in the 1976 legislation.  However, that legislation was not long in operation when representations began to be received from the voluntary organisations concerned as to the need for stronger enforcement of the barring order provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> In August 1978 the Garda Commissioner issued instructions that full use be made by the Garda of the summons procedure. This resulted in an improvement, but the procedure of enforcement by way of summons involved delays in most cases of upwards of three weeks in the hearing of complaints of contraventions of barring orders.  The position was kept under review in consultation with members of the Judiciary and the Garda authorities. Following further representations from the voluntary organisations about the inadequacy of the summons procedure and emphasising the need for a power of arrest without warrant to ensure effective enforcement, further consideration was given to the matter, in consultation with members of the Judiciary and the Garda authorities.  The decision finally to come down in favour of including a power of arrest without warrant in the present proposals can be said, therefore, to be a fully considered conclusion arrived at following the experience gained over a number of years in operating the provisions of the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>The grant of a power of arrest without warrant for breaches of a barring order would not in itself be a solution.  Indeed, without any other provision, it could make matters worse.  The arrested spouse would usually be entitled to release on bail and there would be a distinct danger that during the period of bail further violence would occur.  To deal with this situation section 8 of the Bill introduces a new feature into this area of the law which will have a strong deterrent effect on a respondent spouse who may be tempted to defy a barring order or a protection order.  This provides that, where a person is arrested for breach of a barring or a protection order and released on bail and then commits a further breach while on bail, any sentences of imprisonment imposed for those breaches will have to be served consecutively. Moreover the present maximum limit of 12 months on consecutive sentences which may be imposed by the District Court will not apply.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a power of arrest without warrant imposes on us an obligation to incorporate safeguards in the <Col N="2002" /> procedures to ensure that a spouse liable to be arrested is made aware as soon as possible of the existence of the order. This would be especially important where the respondent spouse was not present at the proceedings, as would usually be the case on the granting of a protection order.  However, if reliance were to be placed on customary methods of serving a copy of the order on the respondent spouse, such as leaving it at the family home or sending it by registered post, there would be no assurance that the making of the order would have come to the personal notice of that spouse.</P>
    <P>Senators will, I think, agree that adequate provision in this regard is made in sections 4 and 5 of the Bill.  Under section 4 an order will not take effect until the respondent spouse is notified, but the notification can be done informally by the applicant spouse telling the respondent spouse that the order has been made and producing a copy of the order.  Section 5 provides that the court shall cause a copy of the order to be given to or sent as soon as practicable to both spouses, as well as to the local Garda station.  Normally, I would expect that a copy of the barring order or protection order would be handed to the applicant spouse at the conclusion of the hearing, so that that spouse would be able to produce a copy of it to the respondent spouse at any time afterwards and thereby bring it into effect.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the power of arrest can only be exercised following a complaint made to a garda by or on behalf of the applicant spouse.  This will leave the way open for reconciliation between the spouses.  The possibility will, of course, remain for the applicant spouse or a garda to proceed by way of summons as under the existing law.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I should stress that, while the Bill deals essentially with the situation arising between spouses in the context of family violence, it does not alter in any way the existing statutory provisions for the protection of children.  Assault, ill-treatment, neglect and abandonment of children are dealt with by the provisions of the criminal law&mdash;for instance, the Children Act, 1908, and the Offences <Col N="2003" /> Against the Person Act. 1861.  A barring order is a statutory procedure whereby a court is empowered, in the interests of the safety or welfare of one spouse and the children of the family, to order the other spouse to leave the family home, notwithstanding the mutual duty of the spouse to cohabit that is implicit in the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>Among those consulted prior to the preparation of the Bill there was a general consensus as to the aspects which called for improvement and these improvements are now embodied in the Bill.  Indeed, I can say with some assurance that not only does the Bill meet the case made by the organisations&mdash;and these were mainly women's organisations, since it is usually wives who are the victims of domestic violence&mdash;who made representations in the matter, but in some respects it achieves substantially more than they had sought.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that no legislation dealing with human problems, with all their complexities, can hope to give full satisfaction. However, this Bill is the Government's response to representations by people concerned with domestic violence that the existing law does not give spouses&mdash;in virtually all cases wives&mdash;an adequate measure of protection from such violence.  It is, in my view, an effective response and it has been generally welcomed as such.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by once more acknowledging, as I did in the Dáil, the debt we all owe to the voluntary organisations who are doing so much good work in this area?  I now commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly as another step forward on this long road embarked on so recently in Irish legislative history towards coping with the realities of unfortunate problems within marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that every Senator feels that it is not at all pleasant to have to bring in Bills of this kind to strengthen procedures for keeping violent spouses away from their victims, who usually are their wives and children.  It would be better for all of <Col N="2004" /> us if this kind of legislation never had to be introduced and brought before us.  It is quite sad that we should be even considering it.  Having said that, the provisions in the Bill are things which have been pointed out over the last few years as being necessary.  I compliment the Minister for responding to the items which were pointed out to him by the voluntary organisations which he has mentioned.</P>
    <P>encourage voluntary organisations and, in particular, women's organisations who have so comparatively recently involved themselves in what one might call the legislative process in the democratic part of society, in meeting Ministers and making representations, in digging into how remedies can be found and in putting forward those remedies and joining in discussions with politicians on how best to tackle the problems.</P>
    <P>These voluntary organisations should be complimented at every opportunity because, as more and more problems come to light, more and more people become involved in the process of applying pressure to have wrongs righted. They need encouragement.  Sometimes I get phone calls from people saying that such and such a thing is worrying them and they feel that something should be done about it and do not know what to do about it.  I talk to them and describe the success which various women's groups have achieved over the last few years in having wrongs righted.  Then they are very much encouraged and set about organising themselves.  That is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>It is also sad that, with so much violence in our society, there is another under-world of violence which is by no means limited.  Perhaps we see only the tip of the iceberg in the cases that require the remedies which are in the Bill.  The nature of this problem means that in many cases it remains hidden, even more so among families who might be described as higher socio-economic groups, who feel very strongly that a great deal of shame attaches to having to admit that there is violence in the home and who literally hide their mental and physical scars, rather than come out and <Col N="2005" /> admit that this is actually happening. Obviously, people must make their own decisions about the wisdom or otherwise of saying that they have a problem, but it should be pointed out at every possible opportunity that for the sake, particularly of the long-term stability of the family and the children of that family, it would seem to be usually much better to seek help where help is available.  Unfortunately, enough help is not available. This is a general problem in this area where enough help and knowledge are not available to tackle the problem at source.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks basically to add something to a previous Bill which was found not to be strong enough.  I agree with my colleague in the Dáil when he questioned the naming of this Bill, as a Family Law Bill.  It is limited enough in its provisions. However, it seeks to give more protection to spouses and children than has hitherto been available.</P>
    <P>We must see why this Bill has been necessary and acknowledge the size of the problem.  I have a report entitled &ldquo;Family Violence&rdquo; which was brought out by the organisation Women's Aid, which is the principal organisation in the field of helping the victims of domestic violence.  The report says that in the five-and-a-half-years since the organisation started over 2,000 women have sought and been given refuge, with over 15,000 children, ranging from babes in arms to teenage boys and girls.  That is a terrible chapter of violence&mdash;2,000 mothers and 15,000 children.  Many organisations, particularly Women's Aid, describe the problem as a revolving door, the situation being that these women, the majority of whom, unfortunately, do not seek barring orders, come to the refuge and sooner or later go back to their original situation.  This is what they mean by the revolving door.  They also describe it as a circle of violence, because it is a very sad fact, apparently &mdash; and I say apparently because there is a frightful lack of research in this area &mdash; that where children were brought up in a very violent atmosphere they themselves expect and perpetrate violence when they grow older.  That is not confined only to men. <Col N="2006" /> I listened in Dublin recently to Erin Pizzey, the founder of the English organisation, who said one of the problems of a family which is a victim of violence is that there is an addiction to violence which grows up among the husband, wife and children.  This addiction to violence is very hard to break and draws women and children back inexorably to the wretched situation which caused the problem in the first place.</P>
    <P>Family violence is one of our big problems. The week the Women's Aid organisation in Dublin began, a very fine woman, who I am glad to say is a candidate for Dáil Éireann in the next election, one night was watching television and saw a programme entitled &ldquo;Scream Softly or the Neighbours will Hear&rdquo;.  That programme touched her so deeply that that very night she rang several women and said &ldquo;We must deal with this problem in Ireland&rdquo;.  They set out and dealt with it. There are now people right across the country genuinely concerned.</P>
    <P>There was at that time, and I think still is, a reluctance on the part of many people actually to admit that the problem exists.  When cases of family violence which require a great deal of help are described, the people involved have often been accused of sensationalism.  It is a great pity that we have a reluctance to face up to really unpleasant facts.  It was, indeed, the so-called sensationalism of the reality which was certainly one of the factors in drawing me, as I am sure it was in drawing many others, women in particular, towards the political field.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, despite the reality and the numbers in question, we still find a reluctance to get involved.  A very sad report in yesterday's newspaper <i>The Irish Press</i> detailed the paucity of the response of the general Irish public to the appeal for funds by the women who are helping the victims of violence which this Bill sets out to protect.  They apparently raised only £470 in donations since they had a big meeting in Liberty Hall in Dublin in mid-March and only 94 people have taken up the offer of a £5 associate membership. That is a very sad story of public indifference.</P>
    <P>It would make one reflect, perhaps, <Col N="2007" /> that violence in our society has grown to such a pitch that we have become hardened to it and that the domestic violence suffered by these victims does not seem to us as terrible as so many other violent happenings.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the need for research right across the board into family breakdown, its causes and remedies, into the effects of family violence on children, into the whole area of social problems which has been very sadly neglected.  In a recent document produced by the party which I represent, we undertake to set up a special department for that research, because it is a top priority.</P>
    <P>One of the problems for people trying to protect the victims of family violence is, of course, drink.  It is estimated in this book that in something like 90 per cent of the cases they are dealing with, abuse of alcohol enters into the question in some way.  This is why I am very happy about the protection order in the Bill. However, it is very difficult to imagine how a very drunken, violent spouse will react when his wife produces a piece of paper and says &ldquo;I have a protection order, so go away&rdquo;.  That, unfortunately, may not mean anything at all to the person who not only is in a very violent mood, but is drunk as well.  In that context, I quote something which Justice Seán Delap suggested at a meeting in <Col N="2008" /> Liberty Hall, that judges very often now make a rule that drunken or violent husbands must sign on in police stations on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights a quarter of an hour before closing time. That is an immensely practical suggestion, very simple, solid and possibly a very good approach to one aspect of this problem.  Apparently, the vast majority of violence cases in the home occur on pay night and at weekends.  I compliment Justice Delap on that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The abuse of alcohol and the violent pattern of behaviour are symptoms of an underlying malaise about which we have not even begun to think and about which we must think.  I am glad that the Garda have been given more powers in this question and am quite sure that they will use them.  I know that they are very good and sympathetic in these cases.</P>
    <P>We should look at two suggestions which have been made by the Aim Group and perhaps the Minister would bear with me if I bring them to his attention.  We are, in this Bill, increasing the possible duration of the barring order to 12 months.  That is a very long time, and, obviously, the previous three-month period was too short.</P>
