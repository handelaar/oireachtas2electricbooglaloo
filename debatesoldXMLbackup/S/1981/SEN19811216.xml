      <P>I have received a letter from the Speaker of the People's Assembly of Egypt which I should like to read to the House.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Cairo, November 29, 1981.</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Chairman:</P>
      <P>I have received with deep appreciation and gratitude the record of the sitting held by your respected House on October 8, 1981 part of which was devoted to the commemoration of late President Mohammad Anwar Sadat.</P>
      <P>A translation of this part of the record was read in the sitting held by our Assembly on November 21, 1981 and the members were deeply impressed by your brotherly noble sympathy at the loss of the martyr of peace and of humanity.</P>
      <P>After listening to it, the Assembly adopted a resolution of sincere thanks and appreciation to your highly esteemed House for your feelings and sympathy at our great loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been authorised by the People's Assembly of Egypt to convey to you and to every member of your Parliament the true thanks of all the Egyptian People and of mine for your noble feelings.  Such feelings shall remain the genuine expression of those <Col N="1404" /> relations of close friendship and cooperation binding our two assemblies and our two peoples for the purpose of achieving our joint sublime goals.</P>
    <P>I have the honour to enclose the record of the sitting no. 4 held on November 21, 1981 and which contains the above-mentioned events.</P>
    <P>Will you kindly accept my highest regards.</P>

      <P>What business have we for tomorrow?  When will we get the Appropriation Bill from the other House?  Every year we have a problem about the Appropriation Bill but it looks as if it will be worse this year.  I and most Members felt the Appropriation Bill would have gone through the other House yesterday in order to give us an opportunity to discuss it this week.  I have been told that the Bill will not be passed in Dáil Éireann until Thursday night which means that either we have to sit on Friday or sit next week, Christmas week, to discuss the Appropriation Bill.  It is most unfair of the other House.  They are treating us with disrespect as far as this Bill is concerned.  I should like to voice my protest.</P>

    <Title>Youth Employment Agency Bill, 1981: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation at a time when we have a very serious job crisis.  It is the worst for 50 years. While I welcome the Bill I also have some reservations about it.  The Bill deals with a scheme for the training and employment of young persons and provides for the payment of a levy on incomes to defray the expenditure.</P>
      <P>I wonder if we are introducing this Bill at the right time.  I know the Labour Party were anxious to have it but, having regard to the fact that we are in an economic depression rather than in an economic expansion, I feel the Bill would work better if we were on schedule with our economic targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right to pay tribute to groups which are already involved in this type of work, for example, AnCO who in my <Col N="1406" /> town have a training centre and are doing fabulous work training people.  They do not get good results all the time.  They do not have the success rate that we would like.  Nonetheless, they should be congratulated and complimented for the great work they have been doing and will continue to do.  If I were in AnCO I would show some concern for this Bill.  It strikes me that there is a clear duplication of work.  Will AnCO take over this new agency or will this agency take over AnCO?  Two bureaucratic organisations dealing with one problem does not seem to me to be right.  I wonder if this Bill should be forgotten about.  If AnCO were expanded would that not suffice?  If additional money was put into AnCO and into building new training centres would that be the answer?</P>
    <P>The Bill is not as strong as I would like, and as many would like, in regard to job creation.  Surely this is the nub of the whole thing.  There is no point in having youth employment agencies if there are no jobs for the youth.  What are we training them for?  I am aware of many people who were trained for welding and were unable to get jobs.  They took other jobs in our area which were completely different from what they were trained for. Unless at the end of the day there are jobs for these young people, this agency will prove to be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In the Cathaoirleach's own constituency there was a meeting held recently to have Westmeath and Longford declared as disadvantaged areas in the hope that opportunities for more jobs would be created.  There is in that constituency one advance factory which has been built for close on seven years and nobody has taken it up.  If this situation was to continue we would be training people for advance factories which maybe would never be occupied.  Not enough emphasis is placed on job creation.  I wonder what role the National Development Corporation will play in the future.  Will it be doing the same work as the IDA?  Should we not expand the IDA and give it greater powers?</P>
    <P>If we asked any young man or woman which they would prefer, a job in the Post Office, the ESB or any of the semi-State <Col N="1407" /> bodies, to be a labourer or an installer or to do a course with AnCO in the hope of getting a job, I feel that 95 per cent of them would be in favour of taking the job.  Therefore I feel that instead of having this agency expanded or introduced at all the embargo on jobs should be lifted.  Why not allow the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or the ESB or any other body to take on these young men? They would gladly jump at it and would prefer it.</P>
    <P>The whole strategy of economic progress by the Government is in some way in reverse.  I read recently that the programmes which were planned by the National Board for Science and Technology may be scrapped due to economic pressures.  Advance technology is one of our greatest industrial needs and there will be no jobs without it.  While I appreciate and have very serious concern for youth and the fact that they should have jobs, I am not all that happy that this Bill is necessary.  I would prefer to see an expansion of the AnCO scheme which has in many ways proved itself.  Perhaps at the end of the day the result of this Bill will be that the only people who will get jobs will be the new instructors that may be employed.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the job crisis must be tackled and solved.  The real role of Government must be to put 80,000 or 100,000 young people into jobs over the next couple of years.  I cannot see this Bill doing that.  The 1 per cent levy is another form of income tax and is reducing the incomes of the PAYE sector and possibly that will bring extra claims.  If people were asked to pay 1 per cent or 2 per cent for the creation of jobs they would have very little objection to doing so.  Perhaps when the contents of this Bill are fully realised, the people will revolt in some way.  It might appear to them that this is not really the way to tackle the problem of job creation.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will prove everybody wrong.  I have reservations about it and I will continue to have them until I am proved wrong.  Nonetheless, I have to give some agreement to it because the <Col N="1408" /> youth are our greatest asset and they are desperately in need of jobs.</P>
    <P>There was a programme about Finglas recently on television and it highlighted the violence there.  Because young people had no jobs, they were on the streets and engaged in vandalism and violence.  I hope the Bill succeeds and I wish it every success.  I hope that many people who like myself have reservations about it will be proved wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three aspects of the Bill which are very worth while.  The first is the principle that the employed carry some responsibility for those who are not fortunate enough to have jobs. That is one of the great virtues of earmarking the 1 per cent levy for this specific purpose.  A prominent leader of one of the unions said recently that people are willing to make sacrifices if they feel that it will benefit those in need. This is a scheme where we can make it clear that the sacrifice of 1 per cent of income from those in employment will go to a specific area of need.  With reference to the remarks of Senator Fallon, the fact that it is ear-marked for a specific purpose will make the public all the more sensitive to how well the money is being spent. Perhaps this is a worth while initiative because too many schemes are financed from general taxation and nobody thinks any more about them.  This one will have a specific tax allocated to it.  The public who are paying that tax will be watching to see how their money is spent.</P>
      <P>The second aspect of the Bill, which I warmly welcome, is the aim to help young people who get a poor start in their employment career.  There is no doubt that many people are entering unemployment-prone occupations, particularly those who leave school without adequate training or qualification.  In later years the likelihood is that they will become the long-term unemployed who have to be financed by the State.  They are also a tremendous loss to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third aspect of the Bill that I welcome is the fact that it gives an opening to voluntary organisations to come up with proposals that would be financed by <Col N="1409" /> the agency.  There is an enormous number of voluntary organisations who are doing worthwhile work but they do need a certain amount of pump-priming in cash to get their ideas going.  Although there is a big problem at present for all young people seeking jobs, I should like the agency to give priority to those who leave school at 15 or earlier, often without qualifications.  There is a strong bias in our educational system against children from unskilled and semi-skilled backgrounds. It has been shown that about 80 per cent of those leave school at 15 years of age whereas no children from professional backgrounds leave early.  There is a need to redress that imbalance and this agency will perhaps give us an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence that as many as 25 per cent of those who leave school early have reading problems.  That is a serious handicap for anyone seeking a job.  I should like to see this agency tackling that problem through its training activities.  There is also evidence that those who leave without qualification are prone to very high unemployment.  A recent survey showed that within a year 20 per cent of those who leave school without a qualification are unemployed whereas the proportion of those who leave with their leaving certificate is only 4 per cent.  There is no doubt that people who leave without qualification are suffering high unemployment and there is also evidence that their employment history is very chequered.  They get a job and they are likely to be out of it a short time afterwards when full adult rates have to be paid.  I should like to see the Youth Employment Agency provide an opportunity to redress the balance in our educational system and give specific attention to these people.  It is estimated that there are about 5,000 people in this category.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he would be looking at the question of how school-leavers are equipped when they leave school.  He should also look at what pressures bring them into unemployment-prone activities.  Studies of the inner city show that there is tremendous economic pressure for young <Col N="1410" /> people to go straight into such activities as unskilled labour in the building industry where there is a high risk of unemployment. That situation should be examined to see if there is any way the agency could reduce vulnerability there.</P>
    <P>I am a bit sceptical about the temporary job experience and public work ideas that are at present in operation.  If people have a trade, in good or bad times they will always have something to put their hands to and there is not the same risk of unemployment.  We may not approve of nixers but people with a trade have opportunities to do small jobs that will keep them going.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the present situation in that people without their leaving certificate who want to do a second chance course might gain entry to it on the grounds of their experience do not get assistance from the State but the Department of Education grants require one to have the leaving certificate and some of the AnCO grants require one to have the promotion of an employer. There are people who have been caught in a catch-22 situation.  They did not get their leaving certificate, want to improve themselves but find they cannot get State assistance.  That is another area worth taking a look at.</P>
    <P>If I was to question something about the agency, it is that it may be casting its net too wide by considering 40,000 people.  If we were to do the job properly for a small number of really vulnerable people we would be doing a better day's work.  Forty thousand people are about two-thirds of school-leavers.  It is an immense task to consider providing opportunities for that number.  Such a scheme, with its net thrown so wide, would be availed of more by the relatively privileged as is the case with so many schemes.  They are better informed of what opportunities are there and they are usually more adept at getting what is going.  I question that aspect of the Bill.  I appreciate that there is a commitment in that area but it would be worthwhile to emphasise a target group within those 40,000 people.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Minister, the Youth Employment Agency's activities <Col N="1411" /> will be in three distinct areas.  One is training, the other is something in the area of public works and the final one is in the area of new enterprise.  The training programme conducted by AnCO is highly successful, particularly in the high placement rate of people who have completed the programme.  I have some misgivings about the cost of the training programme. I was looking at the AnCO report and it appears that the training of an individual costs about £2,000 for an average of a 12 month course.  The cost of a full year in university is hardly much more than that.  The question is, why is it so dear?  I do not think that payment of allowances is the explanation because they do not seem to make up the balance. Perhaps one of the results of this Bill will be to get more people to join the courses thus reducing the unit costs.  There may be too many courses run by AnCO with too few members.</P>
    <P>The other area of training is the work-experience programme which costs £400 per person for six months.  This does not seem very expensive but the problem here is placement.  What happens to people who do the work-experience programme and are then left without jobs? I should like to see some placement emphasis brought into that programme to avoid having the young people back at square one after the six months' course. The Farm Apprenticeship Board should not be forgotten as it could do with assistance for its activities.</P>
    <P>The public works area is the most thorny of all that the Youth Employment Agency are taking on.  It is very difficult to devise tasks that have a worth-while experience content and at the same time permit people, if they find an employment opportunity, to take it.  It is designed to avoid unfair competition with workers or small businesses.  Many things like hedge cutting or drainage are the sort of things people think of in terms of public works and there are legitimate private businesses who have bought equipment to serve those needs.  This area will be very difficult for the agency to tackle. Another question raised by several speakers is what opportunities that will <Col N="1412" /> be available for people who finish these programmes.  This is a big problem in a programme that does not include training content.</P>
    <P>Another worry I have about the public works aspect is the danger that it will become a continuing subsidy towards certain schemes.  Perhaps the county councils will build it into their finances and instead of providing a new activity it will end up financing something that would have gone on anyway.  These are problems that have to be solved.</P>
    <P>There are at present 20,000 new entrants into the labour force each year and the problem of youth unemployment will not go away.  The two existing schemes carrying this kind of work are the environmental assistance through the county councils and that of the Department of Education.  They are costing about £1,600 per person.  What is not clear is whether those people get a full year's work.  In the council with which I work people just get seasonal work. Environmental schemes involve council engineers who are highly paid.  If this scheme is to continue perhaps it would be possible to recruit young people for work on the ground and also young graduates who would be involved in the designing and supervision of these schemes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the public works area, the main thrust should not be through any Government or local government agency such as a county council.  The main emphasis should be on the voluntary organisations who have worth-while ideas that will mean additional new works for young people.  They would also provide local funding in the locality where the scheme was going ahead.  All in all, it would be a much better scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a major emphasis on advertising the availability of assistance by the Youth Employment Agency for voluntary organisations.  There are many things that could be done in this area.  In the specific area of the disabled person's grant for home improvements there is an enormous number of people who would like to avail of that grant but are not able to and the county councils are not willing to take on the work by <Col N="1413" /> direct labour.  That is a worth-while grant but it is effectively closed to the people who are most in need.  They do not have the capacity to organise the work.  That is the sort of area I would like to see emphasis on rather than the environmental work schemes that are at present being undertaken by the councils.  The final area which I think is the most interesting and exciting part of the Youth Employment Agency is the commitment to new enterprise promotion for young people. I would mention a few points in that connection.</P>
    <P>The first point is that design in this country has been the real Cinderella of our industrial policy.  In Denmark and several other European countries their great success has been in their ability to have small industries which thrive by virtue of the fact that they have exceptionally good design.  They design their furniture, shoes and so on specifically to the needs of their domestic market.  They have perfected design.  I would like to see more educational emphasis put on design in this country and more centres, such as the Kilkenny Design Centre, located throughout the countryside.  If we could encourage young people, particularly young people who get a trade through AnCO courses, into thinking about design and new products, we could really make a worth-while contribution to employment creation in the country.</P>
    <P>One idea floated recently in Wales and in Northern Ireland is that for people coming off training courses such as those run by AnCO there would be the possibility of worker co-ops setting up new employment centres where they would actually take an idea and bring it to the commercial stage.  I think that is worth while studying in this country because the problem with young people who are considering setting up in industry is that they are on their own and feel a bit isolated and if they had the support of an AnCO course plus that of their own peers something worth-while could be done.</P>
    <P>The area of new small enterprise is one which we should be thinking about very seriously.  The existing IDA scheme for new enterprise is restricted in that it requires management experience for <Col N="1414" /> people to avail of it.  To my mind the kind of person who comes forward with ideas for products is much more the person with a trade who is used to working with products rather than someone with management experience.  I question that restriction in the IDA scheme.  I think we should go further, if possible, and perhaps give a tax holiday of the nature that has been given to larger industry to young people setting up new enterprises.  A short tax holiday could ease them over the difficult setting-up period.</P>
    <P>Another thing I would like to see the Youth Employment Agency do is to list in areas such as counties or regions services that are available and perhaps identify gaps into which young people could slot.  In the agricultural area there are agricultural relief services or agricultural contracting in some counties.  There are big gaps there.  People are not able to make silage because of the lack of contractors. There would be opportunities that could be identified by this agency and help given to people to fill them. When dealing with new enterprise promotion the agency should not be afraid of a high failure rate.  Perhaps a high failure rate would be a symptom that it was at least getting to the sort of people who might not otherwise get a chance to get going.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the IDA-type job with its very high capital expenditure per place is not going to be the answer for the sort of employment growth that the Minister was talking about &mdash; 20,000 per annum new entrants to the labour force as well as our existing high level of unemployment. We must look to the new areas, such as new enterprise, on-going programmes of work for young people and training, as is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a very exciting Bill.  It opens enormous possibilities but it also faces enormous problems.  I would like to wish it well in the coming years.  I would also like to request that perhaps every two years or so there would be an independent review, perhaps by the Oireachtas Joint Committee, of its activities.  There is no doubt that in other countries programmes such as this have run into problems. The British programme was radically <Col N="1415" /> changed yesterday because of problems it encountered.  I do not know the details of that and there may be some political activity going on there that we do not know about, but I think there is a real need to examine at frequent intervals what is going on in this area.  I would like to see the Minister accept a two-year review of its activity by an Oireachtas Joint Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Minister to the Seanad and to wish him well in his very demanding and onerous portfolio. The proposed Youth Employment Agency looks like a logical development but we will, of course, have to wait to see how it works out in practice.  Clearly there is merit in establishing a single coordinating body concerned with the training and employment of young people. However, I hope the agency will serve as an imaginative forum for examining and promoting further ways and means of providing job opportunities for our ever-growing numbers of young people. Given the scale of the youth employment problem, imaginative and even radical steps will be necessary if a serious impact is to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike other European countries, in Ireland we have unique demographic features. Half the population is under 25 years and the birth rate is particularly high by international standards.  This makes the challenge to create more jobs for young people that much greater. When I left secondary school in the fifties, emigration was commonplace.  The position then was that collectively we deplored emigration but individually saw it as a valuable route to jobs, however disappointing it might have been for those who had to emigrate.  Today, however, educational levels and expectations are much higher than they were 20 years ago or so.  Young people today understandably expect to get jobs in their own country.  Emigration in sizeable numbers is no longer an option.  Job opportunities abroad are minimal particularly because of the persistence of the international recession. <Col N="1416" /> Like so many others, I am very disturbed by the high level of unemployment among our young people.  It can result in a discouraged and demoralised youth whose educational achievements and expectations are generally high.  The challenge is to make every conceivable effort to create more jobs and to avoid demoralising these young people at the start of their working lives.</P>
    <P>Getting the first job is the biggest single problem.  This is a particular problem for those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Senator Bruton has already elaborated on the problems relating to this category.  Prospective employers, as we all know well, place great store on experience, especially if that experience relates to the job under consideration. However, experience which is not directly relevant can be turned to advantage.  The existing programmes conducted by AnCO and the National Manpower Service are certainly important steps in the right direction.  There is the need to allocate more resources to job creation for young people.  If we do not &mdash; and we must look at the alternative here &mdash; not alone will the cost of keeping these young people unemployed continue to be a big drain on the Exchequer but we may provoke our youth into rejecting our democratic system, which they will see as having failed them.  Government have the primary task of undertaking all possible measures to stimulate job creation and reduce job losses.  I readily recognise that any Government have to operate within financial constraints.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the link between manpower planning and education. Much emphasis has been correctly placed on the transition from school to work. This underlines the important link between manpower planning and our educational system.  Furthermore, it underlines the need for the closest liaison between the Departments of Labour and Education.  The <i>ad hoc</i> responses to date reflected in the training courses now available underline the need, first of all for long-term planning in relation to manpower and, secondly, on the educational and training side, the urgent need for a <Col N="1417" /> long-term plan for curriculum development. The need for curriculum development was emphasised and elaborated upon by the Minister for Education when we were discussing a motion here quite recently.  Curricula must be constantly monitored in order to keep them relevant to the needs of our changing society.  I welcome, therefore, the provision in the Bill that one of the directors of the proposed agency will be nominated by the Minister for Education.  There is also an urgent need, as the Minister has underlined, for close liaison between the Department of Education and those who formulate industrial policy.  It is a serious omission in the Bill that not even one of the directors will be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>On the question of preparation for work, too often we have seen the mismatch between jobs available and the skills of people who are seeking jobs. Industry and small industry in particular offer hope for jobs in the future.  The Curriculum Development Centre attached to the comprehensive school in Shannon is particularly relevant in this respect.  It is an exciting development relating to the preparation for the transition from school to work.  This community-based learning experiment in Shannon is being run in schools in the mid-west region, in Shannon, Limerick city and in several schools in my native Clare.  It is funded £ for £ by the Department of Education and by the EEC.</P>
    <P>In order to break down the divide between schools and the community they adopt particular strategies.  First, liaison groups of local parents, teachers, employers and trade unionists act as a link between the schools and the community. In Ennis, for example, the liaison group have conducted a survey on the difficulties experienced by young people in moving from school to work.  In Scarriff the liaison group have worked on a module on farm accounts with a view to incorporating it into the school course in commerce.</P>
    <P>The liaison groups serve as the link for community-based learning run by the schools.  Under this arrangement young <Col N="1418" /> people go to a variety of work places for three hours a day over a number of weeks.  Somebody in the work place acts as a tutor, as a focal point for the pupils. The pupil is expected under the guidance of the teacher in the school and with the co-operation of the tutor in the work place, to fill out work sheets, and write reports based on what he has learned through inquiry about the particular work place: what it does, the trade union side of the picture, the management side, how the company is organised and so on.</P>
    <P>The third element in this very interesting and relevant programme is the mini-company, where students learn literally through doing.  In some cases it is a part of the school metalwork course where the company product is a metalwork product, for example, the production of metal brackets.  In others it is a longer running scheme as part of a pre-employment course.  The most successful mini-companies have learned most from the tutors in the work place.</P>
    <P>This experimental work in curriculum development has attracted international attention, in Britain, Germany and Denmark. It costs money but there is no financial provision for it beyond 1982. Once more we are back to the cost factor. It is a pilot scheme recognised by the Department of Education.  When it is evaluated it may be considered worth-while to be recognised officially as an alternative programme available to all schools.  I hope it will be so considered.</P>
    <P>Clearly the experiment is addressing the vital phase of the transition from school to work and the results should be of immediate interest to the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>I wish the Youth Employment Agency well and I would like to live up to the hopes placed in it by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddieByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to speak on two aspects of this Bill: one, the Bill itself and, secondly, the attitude of the other side of the House towards the Bill.  Much has been said about the Bill, its terms and what it envisages doing and little more can be added.  I will deal with the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party towards this Bill but first I should like to compliment Senator <Col N="1419" /> Hillery on his very constructive approach towards the Bill.  His speech was an excellent contribution.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the debate here and having read the reports of the debate in the other House, I find it extraordinary that this measure which aims to provide a solution to unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, should be receiving, in the words of the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, a reluctant acceptance. It sickens me to listen to and read reports of attempts having been made to extract what can be termed political mileage in such a sensitive and important area.</P>
      <P>The question was posed this morning: is this the right opportunity to introduce the Bill?  It has been insinuated that it is not necessary, while other speakers have questioned why it has taken so long to introduce this Bill and have admitted the urgency of taking the necessary steps.</P>
      <P>I have heard in this House the Bill being called a monster, ready to gobble up funds made available for other jobs. Personally I do not mind if this Bill is called a monster because I associate a monster with strong teeth and this Bill will need strong teeth if it is to grapple with the many problems in this area of youth unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to unemployment has been classed as pessimistic, depressing and uninspiring.  Yet, the people on the other side of the House supported the Bill in the other House and from what I can gather they intend supporting it here as well.  It has also been described as a fraud, seeking to extract money from one area and to use it in another, or to finance existing agencies. It is spelled out clearly in the terms of reference that while the existing agencies are providing for some 20,000 places per year, this Bill proposes to facilitate 40,000 people in the year ending December 1982.  One would honestly think that the Fianna Fáil Party were a new party altogether, like Shirley William's party in England, with no experience whatsoever in government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another feature I found difficult to accept was the inference that this Bill was <Col N="1420" /> an indictment of existing agencies, that the Government have no faith in AnCO, or in the National Manpower Service. That is not so.  The Government recognise the tremendous work that has been done by these agencies and it is to coordinate the work that they are doing and to extend it to include more of our young people that this Bill has been introduced.</P>
    <P>Serious reservations were expressed in this House about the operation of AnCO, particularly in relation to the apprenticeship scheme but the major point made, which I find unreasonable, was the attack on the 1 per cent levy.  I suppose we can excuse it to some extent as it is coming up to Christmas, but you would honestly think that some fairy godmother existed to provide funds out of the sky for carrying out operations such as this.  Concern has been expressed that the poor PAYE workers will have to put their hands in their pockets and pay this levy. I know that people in secure employment are only too willing to assist in providing employment for our young people. Someone even had the audacity to say that some scheme should be introduced whereby this 1 per cent levy would be refunded to employees.  This is extraordinary double-thinking.  Nowhere in the thousands of words that have been spoken in the Lower House and in this House has there been an alternative to financing this scheme.  Of course, it can be said that this is a responsibility of the Government, but in my opinion it is an irresponsible attitude.</P>
    <P>I believe we owe it to our young people to take what steps we think are reasonable, steps we think this country can afford and which the country demands, to make avenues of employment available to them.  This Bill provides that no young person will be left without some form of work training or work experience within a relatively short period of completing his or her education.  I take the words from the Minister's address to this House.  I hope that this work will encompass meaningful work, that it will be properly supervised and lead to full-time employment.</P>
    <P>Above all our youth must be steered away from the soul-destroying dole <Col N="1421" /> queues which are sapping the moral fibre of many.  At a time when so much infrastructural and amenity work is left undone in this country, the payment of unemployment benefit and assistance does not make sense.  I feel strongly about this.  I have referred to it on other occasions and I will keep focusing attention on this system of paying out vast sums of money when so much work can be done for a little more money.  I admit however, that to bring about a change would need an in-depth study but I hope cognisance will be taken of it in implementing this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to join in the welcome that the House is giving to this Bill.  I would like in particular to congratulate the Minister on bringing it in so soon to tackle such an important matter. Having read through and listened to the whole argument on the part of Fianna Fáil, I think they should have the courage to vote against it.  I leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not join in the general welcome which is being given to this Bill. I may be on my own about this.  I would certainly vote against it if I had enough Members on my side to force a vote.</P>
      <P>I see the Bill purely as the keeping of an election promise.  Very little thought and planning have gone into this Bill. The whole attitude is &ldquo;Let us set up this agency that we promised to set up during the election campaign and let them get on with it&rdquo;.  That is not the way to tackle unemployment.  Unemployment is a serious and a fundamental social problem. You cannot tackle unemployment by just setting up an agency, taking 1 per cent off people's income and then saying &ldquo;Let us get on and see what happens&rdquo;.  Unemployment has to be tackled in schools and in all areas of society.  Unemployment cannot possibly be solved by setting up an agency like the National Manpower Service or AnCO.  I do not know what the relationship of this agency will be with them but we will come to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Bill is not more detailed.  We have absolutely no clear indication of the Government's thinking in the detailed tackling of unemployment. <Col N="1422" /> All we have is the setting up of a very vaguely defined body whose powers are set out in the Bill very vaguely also.  We have no clear indication of how the Government think unemployment is going to be reduced as a result of this.</P>
    <P>The obvious idea behind the establishment of the agency is to provide training for the unemployed.  I represent a large number of graduates from Trinitv College many of whom do arts degrees &mdash; which train you for nothing &mdash; but many are extremely well trained in engineering, law and medicine.  An enormous number of these very well-trained people cannot get jobs.  This Bill is an escapist Bill in that its intent is to train people and thus occupy them for a certain amount of time, but they will be trained for jobs which do not exist.  This happens in universities to people who are trained for very technical subjects.  I would like the Government to say that at the end of this training programme, people who have availed of the services of the Youth Employment Agency will find jobs.  That is where the problem lies.  People who will be occupied for a certain period of time will have absolutely nothing to do after their training.  Nothing is worse than over-qualification for jobs which do not exist and to have people technically over-qualified for jobs in which they are employed is not much better.  The thinking in this Bill reveals that escapist attitude to training for employment.</P>
    <P>I like the idea of a 1 per cent levy which is earmarked for a specific object but I am worried about how this is going to work.  I would like the Minister's assurance about this.  The 1 per cent presumably will be levied and then go to the Exchequer.  When the Department of Finance get their hands on this 1 per cent will they hand it straight back to the Youth Employment Agency or will they take their cut on the way?  I will be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.  I doubt whether the Department of Finance, having obtained that money, will undertake to give it all back to the agency immediately.  I suspect that it will get lost in the system and will not go straight to the Youth Employment <Col N="1423" /> Agency.</P>
    <P>The Government have put much emphasis on youth employment, but the enormous problem of middle-aged unemployed people exists.  A large number of people who have been trained by AnCO and the National Manpower Service are unemployed, and they are in their forties and fifties.  They seem to be forgotten. The youth are very important and that is where the votes are, but the middle-aged unemployed are a real problem. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to wish the Minister well.  We all agree that one of the most serious problems facing our country at present is unemployment, particularly of youth. Unemployment has been the root cause of serious problems in many countries, and we cannot ignore it.  It has caused wars, for instance the Second World War. The figure of 27 per cent of our unemployed in November being in the youth bracket gives rise to serious thought.  We hope that the Youth Employment Agency envisaged in this Bill will operate with the various agencies that exist at present, such as AnCO, and the schemes operated by the Department of the Environment, because of their various activities should be co-ordinated.</P>
      <P>Regarding the 1 per cent, I suppose we all have reservations regarding deductions. As the last speaker said, once money finds its way into the Department of Finance there may be a problem in re-routing it to the purpose for which it was intended in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO have done terrific work.  The schemes which they are operating throughout the country should be extended to at least one VEC in each country.  For instance, the centre for the Cavan-Monaghan constituency which I represent is in Dundalk.  With two large VEC's in the constituency at least two centres could be set up to deal with the crafts and operations in that area.  These counties specialise in furniture and footwear manufacture and light engineering and the people there are adaptable <Col N="1424" /> to those occupations.  In the five Border counties money is made available under the non-quota section of the regional fund to promote craft industries, yet they have fewer craft industries than practically any of the other counties.  At the craft display in the RDS I was struck by the fact that the areas to which money was being made available under the non-quota section were very weak as far as displays were concerned and only a few examples were on exhibit.  In this field availability of money from the EEC should be examined and the various Departments should co-operate for this purpose.  The Minister in his speech mentioned under the terms of reference of the company:</P>
    <P>(g) to identify areas outside the scope of existing programmes into which Government aid to young people could be extended, for example, agriculture and other primary activities;</P>
    <P>Here the Minister's Department are concerned in conjunction with the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Department of Agriculture.  A Department will tend to set up agencies to deal with their own area and build up their own structure.  More co-operation is necessary.</P>
    <P>The development of agriculture was mentioned.  At present we import massive amounts of fruit and vegetables. Today's Order Paper for the Dáil lists Deputies' queries to the Taoiseach regarding amounts, quantities and so on. It is sad that at present we have massive imports of fruit and vegetables and advance factories lying idle.  In every county large areas of land are held by the Land Commission which could be put into production on a short-term basis. Some two-pronged action must be taken to create employment and eliminate the unnecessary importation of fruit, vegetables and various other products which we have the capacity to produce at home.</P>
    <P>Probably the local authorities and the health boards could do more in the field of youth employment.  It is important that the Department ensure that local authorities do not absorb youth in maintenance <Col N="1425" /> and similar jobs and that money devoted to youth employment through the Department of the Environment be used on projects some of which would have long-term benefit.</P>
    <P>The farm apprenticeship scheme has been mentioned.  This country is facing a serious problem regarding employment and balance of payments, and we must take a very hard look at our natural resources.  Extra jobs provided under the farm apprenticeship scheme would have the additional effect of reducing imports.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker seemed very critical of the approach of the Opposition in Dáil Éireann to this Bill.  He mentioned AnCO and the apprenticeship scheme.  It is important that the Opposition keep the pressure on the Government when Bills are going through either House.  They are the watchdogs and they must ensure that the best possible use is made of our resources.  The Senator should not be too sensitive about the Opposition prying into every aspect of legislation which comes before either House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, is mian liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo chun fostaíocht agus traenáil a chur ar fáil don aos óg.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go breá leis an mBille chun chuid de na fadhbanna fostaíochta agus traenála atá againn a leasú agus a réiteach.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with the other Senators in welcoming the Minister to this House and in welcoming the decision of the Government to set up a Youth Employment Agency so that young people can be spared the social evil and economic waste of long spells of unemployment and inactivity.  The magnitude of the daunting task facing this Government and the new agency can be seen from the fact that we have 37,000 unemployed young people in the 15 to 25 age bracket.  That represents almost 28 per cent of the total number of people unemployed. We must also remember that 65,000 young people are leaving our schools annually in search of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome this Bill which will have a wide mandate to tackle in a unified and concerted way the great problem <Col N="1426" /> of youth unemployment.  It will have the flexibility to embark on new departures and new schemes.  The proposals in the Bill represent a comprehensive package on the lines of the youth guarantee programme in the Scandinavian countries and will assist in alleviating the plight of our young school leavers.  A total of 40,000 young people or an additional 20,000 will be catered for in 1982. This is a very significant effort on the part of this Government and it represents a doubling of the effort in 1981.  The agency will have a special role in catering for the socially deprived and the disadvantaged young people.  I am sure that this agency will intensify the effort on behalf of those young people who have been more than six months out of school.  These proposals are designed to ensure, as the Minister said, that no young person will be left without some form of training or work experience within a short time of leaving school.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact also that the European Social Fund will be used to play a significant role in financing the training schemes.  The agency will have the power and the facility to relate directly to local interest.  This is an important aspect of this Bill.  They will have the facility to assist financially and with advice and back-up services and to devise and implement schemes at local level.  In this connection I would like to compliment SFADCo in my own area of mid-west Limerick for the great expertise, endeavour and sense of purpose which they have shown in advancing and promoting small native industry.  I believe that the new agency will co-operate fully with that company.  I also urge the fullest co-operation between the innovation centre and the national micro-application centre situated at the NIHE, Limerick.  The basic aim of those two organisations is to push Irish industry abreast of that of other countries in technology in export performance and in the development of new products.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill I take the opportunity of congratulating a lady from Limerick, Mrs. Greta McMahon, who this week won the award for the best overall adult trainee of the year.  Unfortunately <Col N="1427" /> some years ago this lady lost her husband and three of her five children in tragic accidents, but she picked up the pieces and got back into the world of work.  It was marvellous that this week she won that award.  This was due mainly to AnCO in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The new agency will have a major role to play in alleviating the problems and the scourge of unemployment among our young people.  I am very pleased to welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the debate which this Bill has generated.  I would not like Senator Byrne to think that we on this side of the House are being too euphoric about what is contained in this Bill.  He ran away with himself in his comments on what was purportedly said on this side of the House.  He mentioned the iar-Thaoiseach.  That may have been a slip of the tongue and I am not sure what he meant.  The only regret Deputy Haughey expressed in connection with this Bill was his reluctant agreement to allow all stages of the Bill to be pushed through the Dáil before Christmas, and I do not think that anyone should be too worried about that.</P>
      <P>The Bill is merely to set up a structure which will not itself create jobs but will create within the civil service another bureaucracy even though it is being set up as a limited company.  The limited company's board is to be made up of two employer representatives, two people from trade unions, two people from youth organisations and five from Government Departments.  It would appear that at present the structuring of training courses and training organisations involves a superfluity of people from Government Departments.  I cannot see how we are going to get away from bureaucracy if another agency incorporating too many people from Government Departments is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion was made that every penny collected from the 1 per cent levy should go to youth employment directly. It has been suggested also that the money collected will go not alone to schemes <Col N="1428" /> which will arise as a result of this new agency but also to the agencies which exist already.  What increase in money will be available to agencies such as AnCO, Department of Education and Department of the Environment schemes, the National Manpower Service and so on?  It sees that very little extra will be available because no money is to be taken from general taxation and that all money will come from the 1 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>The problem of youth unemployment is a major one and the setting up of an agency who will consider basically short-term work courses and short-term training courses will not solve it.  It is impossible to get into an AnCO apprenticeship scheme at present.  The training courses are completely full.  One of the problems arising now in the AnCO training centres is that a number of the apprentices there who were sponsored by firms now find that these firms are going out of business.  A large number of appretices at present in AnCO training centres will have no jobs when they complete their year or second year or whatever time applies to their full-time release courses.</P>
    <P>Another major factor inhibiting youth employment is the fact that employers in, for example, the building industry, the motor industry and allied engineering businesses are not now taking on apprentices. This is creating a problem of youth unemployment on the one hand, but sufficient people will not have the skills or the training to take up jobs which will become available if and when an upsurge in our economic situation occurs.</P>
    <P>Employers throughout the country are extremely worried because of the imposition of levies on the gross salaries of their employees and the PRSI content which they themselves have to bear.  A 1 per cent levy might not seem a large imposition on any employee but taken in context with the enormous increases in PAYE and PRSI, that 1 per cent is a significant levy.  According to reports it will be taken from all salaries which are taxable.  Therefore an apprentice starting work, because of the low point of tax relief, will immediately be liable for payment <Col N="1429" /> of the levy.  It would appear that in January PAYE and PRSI charges will be increased again.  The levy cannot be taken in isolation.  It has to be seen in the context of all the other deductions from gross salary that already exist.  Nobody should criticise a levy which is intended to pay for the creation of jobs, but I am afraid that that will not be the outcome of the setting up of this agency.  I sincerely hope that it will be.</P>
    <P>Most work experience programmes that I have seen up to now have not been of great benefit to the participants.  They have been of too short duration and have not produced jobs for the people who have gone through the process.  People attending these courses sometimes develop a psychological belief that they will be able to continue in employment, while unfortunately, all too often the reverse is the case and they simply revert to the unemployment assistance queue. If they live at home and are assessed as contributing to the family income, they will not be paid unemployment assistance. A great many young people at present have very little income, and people then wonder why they get into trouble with their parents and with society in general.  This is bound to happen.</P>
    <P>The young people of today will not praise us if we suggest that this Bill is the panacea for all their troubles or that it will solve even a small portion of their problems.  It will not.  Its major beneficial impact will be the establishing of an agency who could co-ordinate the work of the agencies that exist at present in the field of youth training and youth employment, but will this be the case when there is no mention in the Minister's speech or in the Bill of the co-ordinating role that the agency will paly between Manpower, the AnCO training centres and the other services which exist at present?  This Bill does not appear to set up a structural arrangement.  I cannot say what will happen when the Bill becomes law.  Maybe the people nominated to the board of the agency by the Minister for Labour, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education will be working already within the ambit of the agencies <Col N="1430" /> which exist at present.  I do not know.</P>
    <P>Rural schemes were mentioned and it was said that environmental schemes throughout the country could be brought into play under this Bill.  One thing that people need if they are going to work is supervision and the expertise of people in the county councils, or the Department of the Environment.  We are at the stage, particularly in county councils, where there is no money available to employ supervisory staff of any type.  It is wrong to say that we can put young people to work in environmental schemes without having them properly organised and without the back-up service being given by the county councils.  There is no county council here at present which could release staff on a scheme of an environmental nature such as a work programme for young people.  I may be wrong, but it definitely could not happen in our county at present.</P>
    <P>Regarding the HEA courses available to young people at present, somebody must have a look at the courses available under the HEA scheme.  It seems that the preponderance of courses which are involved there are to do with the arts type subjects which, while good in themselves, are not exactly wealth-producing. They are not job-producing in many cases.  It is well for somebody who can get four or three honours in the leaving certificate and who does not have a job, to be able to head off, with a Government grant, to Limerick, UCC, TCD or UCD to do an arts degree which is going to be of no use to him or her in three years' time.  Maybe it is grand for Mary from the country to spend three years in town and pretend that she is studying arts and that she is going to get something out of it.  She might get something psychological from it; she might extend her mind.  Definitely, as far as this country is concerned, it is of very little use.  We will have to look at the third level education establishments and try to change the emphasis from the arts type subjects to the practical type subjects.  Training for practical subjects is very badly needed here.</P>
    <P>Will the agency, when they get down to looking at their reason for existing, be able to get certain people to change their <Col N="1431" /> attitude towards work in industry and work in factories, rather than work in the offices of the civil service, of local authorities, or offices in general?  If one looks at the average industrial wage that a girl can get and then looks at what is being paid to girls in offices throughout the country, it is only a social factor which keeps them from going into factory jobs where they are available.  The agency would do a very good job if they could get the emphasis in second level education changed from the academic to the practical.</P>
    <P>Would the agency look again at the amount of money being spent on third level education, when there is such a need for an input of an enormous amount of money into first and second level education, where most of the jobs in this country are going to come from?  If one looks at the industrial set-up throughout the country one will find that 90 per cent of our industrialists have not had third level education.  They have succeeded and will succeed in the future because many of these people have the foresight to know where they are going and are quite capable of finding their way through the dictionaries that are spewed out by the third level education establishments.  Third level students swallow the vocabulary of the business administration schools of the time, but they have no practical advantage when they get into industry.  They are not able to talk to the people working with them, not to mind lead them in the industries.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not going to solve all our problems but I welcome it because it gives us an opportunity to discuss the problems.  I hope that when the agency is set up it will not jump into the matter of producing jobs for young people for two or three months, or work experience programmes for two to three months which are not going to be of any practical advantage to the country or people involved.</P>
    <P>As one last point, would the agency look at the possibility &mdash; as has been done on a very small scale with AnCO &mdash; of young people working for periods of 12 months in particular firms, having to go in early in the morning, and go through <Col N="1432" /> the discipline of the employment situation. They are paid for by the training centre.  Their only difference from the rest of the staff in that business would be that instead of being paid by the employer they would be paid by the agency, whether it be the employment agency, AnCO, the National Manpower Service, or whatever.  Co-ordination is very important between our schools, the Department of Labour and the National Manpower Service.  If the agency did nothing else except set up proper co-ordination between the schools, the Department of Labour, the employment agencies and National Manpower they would be doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>It is not the fault of the schools, but too often when children leave school and look for a job they are asked if they are registered with Manpower and they say they have never heard of it.  There will have to be better co-ordination in that area.  The prospects of this Bill creating jobs for all our young people are very slim.  However, it is available and it should be recommended.  There should be a continuous demand for an input from industry from both sides and from the education establishments over the next few months while the agency is being set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make just a few short points.  This Bill has to do with the establishment of a Youth Employment Agency.  Certainly that title sounds very well.  The very mention of a youth employment agency would give encouragement to very many young people seeking employment.  Times force many of us to be very cynical.  We are inclined to ask the question, is this just another agency, or another scheme? While one may question it, on the other hand we welcome anything that will hold out hope of creating employment.  The fact is, and of course we have to realise it, an agency of itself cannot create employment, but would help to bring it about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why many of the existing agencies are not able to do as much as would be desired is that young people are unnecessarily particular as <Col N="1433" /> regards the work they wish to do.  If a job is vacant and the applicant is able to do that job, then he should take it.  It may not be the job he wishes to take up, but he should keep himself employed.  We have been disastrously over-selective as far as jobs are concerned.</P>
    <P>Employment prospects are at present appalling.  Senator Carroll forecast that unemployment could possibly reach the 200,000 figure by this time next year, but we hope it will not.  Anything of that magnitude is frightening and youth will form a significant proportion of that huge number.</P>
    <P>I would like to offer a few suggestions which may help the agency as regards what could be done to create employment. There are a lot of things which should be done.  People cry out about them and tourists remark very unfavourably on them, matters to do with infrastructural development.  One of the greatest problems in the country is litter, not alone in cities and towns but in rural areas.  That is one thing which could be tackled and would create considerable employment.  A team travelling through the country with a small lorry could do a lot of cleaning up in a few days.</P>
    <P>One difficulty about litter is the fact that indestructible plastic bags are being used and thrown into ditches and the wind carries them away.  Work could also be created, through the county councils, by the development of swimming pools, hurling and football pitches, playgrounds, keeping hedges and ditches by the sides of the roads trimmed, filling in potholes and attending to gardens.  The agency should concern themselves with these things which can be done and, with so many on the various unemployment lists, some people who are drawing dole could have their efforts directed towards doing necessary work.</P>
    <P>There are 42 sections in the Bill and 12 of those specifically mention, or allude to, the word &ldquo;levy&rdquo;.  One gets the impression that this Bill has more to do with arranging for this levy to be collected than with anything else.  The PAYE sector seems to be, as usual, the main target for this levy.  Admittedly it is very easy to collect from the PAYE sector.  I would <Col N="1434" /> like to ask the Minister in that connection if there is a possibility, or perhaps a probability, that this levy will be continued over a long period?  I thought originally that this levy would be just for one year, but when I read section 19 I see the possibility, if not probability, that this levy will be continued year after year. Could the Minister deal with that point when replying to the debate?</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed to the debate.  I assure them that their suggestions and the criticisms will be taken into account by the agency when it is set up.  Their advice will be important to the members of the board in formulating their policy towards this agency and in going some way towards providing some answer to youth unemployment. Senator Ross was the only person who was not in favour of this Bill and both Houses gave this Bill a general welcome, with the exception of one criticism that it was unnecessary and would not benefit those whom we hope it might. One criticism he made was that it was an election promise and therefore had to be fulfilled, and I agree with him.  It is an election promise and it is being fulfilled at a very early stage in the life of this Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <P>I agree generally with the analysis of youth employment set out by the Senators.  They have rightly brought to attention the difficult employment situation facing our young people, the disheartening effects particularly of long spells of unemployment, changing aspirations of young people in so far as unemployment is concerned, particular problems of the disadvantaged, the importance of the transition from school to working life.  What are we attempting to do in the Youth Employment Agency Bill is to make some contribution to the solution of these problems and further the right-to-work idea referred to by a number of Senators.  I accept that the agency will not solve all the problems of unemployment experienced by young <Col N="1435" /> people.  There is a need to set the youth labour market and the Government's interventions in it in the context of the total labour market and the effects being made by Government to improve its operation, to planning, job creation measures, national development corporation and other programmes.  I spelled out, in my opening speech, both here and in the Dáil, what was being done in that connection.</P>
      <P>I was also asked for a breakdown of the live register figure of 36,839 young people unemployed on 27 November. This figure is made up of 24,420 males and 12,419 females, representing 11.8 per cent and 8 per cent respectively of the estimated under 25 male and female labour forces.  The Youth Employment Agency will co-ordinate what has already been done for youth.  It will develop and improve schemes, will also mount schemes where there are gaps in existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>There is no question of the agency taking over schemes that are already being done effectively by the programme sponsors, including voluntary organisations. The agency will operate in the opposite direction and will help to advise planning and finance to expand effective schemes.  It will also be responsible for the enterprise schemes announced by the Minister for Finance some time ago.  I referred in my opening remarks to the registers to be prepared by the National Manpower Service on young unemployed people.  Their location will assist in meeting local needs.  I also expect the agency to place a high emphasis on employment in agriculture and other primary activities.  This will further local and rural interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cranitch referred to the levy mentioned in the various sections of the Bill and of course the Bill, as I said in my opening remarks, has two parts&mdash;one dealing with setting up an agency and the other dealing with the levy to provide the funds for it: obviously the levy occupies a large part of the Bill.  A number of points were made on the use of the levy and I can tell Senator Cranitch that as long as this problem of youth unemployment <Col N="1436" /> continues the levy and the agency will continue.  It would be nice to think that in a few years time there would be no need for this agency, that we would have a situation when youth unemployment would decrease.  I think, however, that the role being given to the agency of co-ordinating the various schemes will be needed for a very long time to come.  I hope that the underlying problem of youth unemployment will begin to decrease, and that is something about which we would all agree.</P>
    <P>The levy has been made variable, not upwards but downwards, so that if the same amount of money were not needed in years to come, the levy can be varied downwards.  If there was extra money needed and the levy had to be increased it would require legislation to do that, by way of amendment to this Bill, so both Houses would again have the opportunity to consider the matter, if that was ever necessary.  Certainly, we all hope it will not be.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senators that it is my intention that the expenditure will be at least as great as the receipts from levy.  Furthermore, all funds collected will be used to benefit youth and will allow for expansion of existing schemes.  Specifically in relation to AnCO, which body was mentioned by some Senators, I expect to see an increase of about 15 per cent in the number of young people trained in 1982. As regards doubts expressed by some Senators over the reference to devoting funds as far as possible to the agency, I would point out that this is a temporary, interim measure aimed at overcoming any difficulty that may arise in funding programme sponsors in 1982.</P>
    <P>My intention remains that all the funds from the levy will be devoted, as soon as possible, to the agency.  When I said as far as possible, I certainly did not intend it to be understood that less money would be devoted than was collected.  The difficulty is that in the initial year the moneys will be collected from, say, a social fund towards the end of the year and it would not be possible for me to gauge exactly what amount of money we will get from the social fund.  We have to make as close a guess as possible for the <Col N="1437" /> Estimates this month or the next month, to put before the Senators and the Deputies. We must put in a figure that we expect the levy plus social fund moneys to yield.  This is why I say as far as possible.  In the first year, it will be a very close estimate.  We hope to get more, but it may not be that we will get in every penny.  I wanted to draw the Senators' attention to that point.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments will not be liable for the levy, while those in receipt of other social welfare payments, including pensions, will also be exempt. Everybody will agree that social welfare recipients, as far as possible, should be excluded.  We have taken that point into consideration in applying the levy.  I did consider, however, excluding pensioners as a group, but since some pensioners can be in receipt of quite substantial income over and above their social welfare receipts this would be inequitable. Indeed, when we talk about pensioners there might be some pensioners in this House or elsewhere who might have higher incomes than some people working and it would be inequitable to let those escape the levy.</P>
    <P>In addition to youth, the recession has affected other groups with a weak bargaining position in the labour market, such as the disabled and, indeed, women. It would be my intention that the agency should maintain continuous contact with the National Rehabilitation Board and Employment Equality Agency.  In formulating my proposals.  I took the point of my departure as being the need to build on existing structures and not to duplicate what has been adequately done already.  I believe that the disabled, women and, indeed, other groups with a weak bargaining position in the labour market should have an input into the agency as well as various public and voluntary bodies who look after their interests.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I had intended to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> board but the progress of the Bill has been so rapid that I may not have to do this now.  I hope that we will get through all Stages today and, therefore, <Col N="1438" /> I can go ahead immediately to set up the board.</P>
    <P>I have set an ambitious target for the agency.  I want to give it the finance and the expertise to do the job well, so that 20,000 additional training or work experience jobs can be created for our young people.  From what I have heard in the Seanad today and last week almost all Senators agree with that objective.</P>

      <P>The Minister has explained something that I was going to ask, that the agency means the Youth Employment Agency.  Having spoken on the Bill last week and having read it again and again because it is a field I am particularly interested in, I am still confused about why an incorporation of all the existing bodies could not have been carried out rather than having to set up another bureaucratic agency.  I have a thing about these agencies but not about organisations and I am totally against regionalisation, which worries me.  I must again put on record that the Bill has my absolute and sincere good wishes but I am afraid that we might finish up with a board of directors of bureaucrats.  While bureaucrats may not have destroyed the country, or created a lot of the trouble certainly they have contributed in a big way.  I have my feet on the ground and I hope to keep them there regardless of newspaper reports.</P>

      <P>I share the Senator's concern about setting up a bureaucratic organisation, but we have a safeguard in setting up the Youth Employment Agency in that it will be of a very representative nature.  The <Col N="1439" /> people appointed to it will be concerned too to see that it is not a bureaucratic organisation spending the money which should be devoted to other activities on paying salaries, travelling expenses and so on.  It was never the intention to set up a huge bureaucratic organisation.  I kept the numbers on the board relatively small so that the servicing of that board would not require a large bureaucratic organisation.  Finally, let me say that the Minister for Labour, whether it be myself or somebody else, will be following the operation of this agency.  I can assure the House that under the present incumbent we will not see the work being duplicated or the funds being dissipated on very large offices with lots of people sitting around in them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 4, it is not clear anywhere exactly what the effect of the agency will be.  I am worried about how this agency, when it becomes operative, will affect the present systems that I referred to.  The manpower work experience is very worthwhile but I would ask the Minister to look at the badly needed updating by £20 in regard to the work experience scheme.  I am still worried about the effect this Bill will have on the present schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, stating part of what will be in the memorandum of association, is really the only section which refers to the precise objects of the agency.  They are stated in general terms which is the right way to approach it if this agency is going to have new and very extensive powers.  I would be concerned that the agency would have the power in its memorandum of association where necessary to commission or delegate from other bodies some of the work which it is set out here will be its objects, &ldquo;to establish, develop, extend, operate, assist, supervise, co-ordinate and integrate either directly or indirectly, schemes for training and employment of young persons..." It is clear that there will have to be a much greater knowledge of the number of young people who are unemployed, and who have been for a particular period, who are precisely the group we want to help through this agency.  I am not quite clear whether it is the agency itself which will do the job, for example, of compiling a register of all school leavers or compiling more precise information, or whether it would have the authority, in its memorandum of association, to look to other existing agencies for that kind of work.  Perhaps, in commenting on that the Minister might give some idea at this stage of how he envisages the objects being realised by the agency, what kind of co-ordination there will be with other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of my questions are similar to those that have been asked <Col N="1441" /> already.  I would be interested to know does the Minister have any clear view at this stage of the relationship between the agency and AnCO.  Obviously there will have to be close co-ordination between them, since otherwise there would be an unfortunate overlap.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the Minister's reference to encouraging productive enterprise by young people.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, I have been sceptical of the capacity of State agencies to respond to the commercial demands of these other enterprises, particularly when they are in new structures or run by young people.  I mentioned the problems in Connemara.</P>
      <P>I have not got any clear idea from the Minister yet of how it is proposed that the agency will achieve the objectives set out.  Is it by the fact that it will have funding which it will offer to various other bodies and therefore would be in a position to persuade other bodies or will it have legislative authority to tell other bodies what to do?</P>
      <P>I am interested in its relationship with voluntary organisations.  The original proposal was that some of the Youth Employment Agency funds would be used to stimulate or encourage participation by young people in various voluntary services.  Is this going to be a statutory function by which voluntary services will be told what they can do, or how they can take people, or will it be funds that will be available to be distributed on request or on the basis of proposals made by voluntary organisations?</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister mentioned particular concentration on disadvantaged youth and disadvantaged areas.  Has this crystalised at all?  What does he have in mind to achieve that? Will it be a special concentration of funds in identified areas or will it be concentration on identified groups?  I mention in particular the 25 per cent or so of school leavers who leave at 15 years.  Has there been any thinking of how these objectives will be achieved?</P>

      <P>I am probably in the same area as previous speakers.  I would <Col N="1442" /> like to ask the Minister if it is intended that the agency should involve itself in a substantial way in direct employment?  In other words, will this agency be concerned mainly with encouraging other organisations or will it cut through red tape and initiate schemes of its own with direct employment?</P>

      <P>to establish, develop, extend, operate, assist, encourage, supervise, co-ordinate and integrate, either directly or indirectly, schemes for the training and employment of young persons,</P>
      <P>That is quite clear.  The next part of that sentence reads:</P>
      <P>being principally persons over the age of 15 years and under the age of 25 years.</P>

Under the same two headings I would also like to raise the point I raised previously, whether the Minister would see this agency as having a function in the leaving years of an educational establishment.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to query this section.  Senator Brendan Ryan has expressed what I think would be the concern, if that is the right word, about the duplication by the agency of what AnCO are doing at present.  I would certainly like this to be spelled out clearly.  Will this agency erect buildings?  Will they engage their own people to train trainees or will they just channel the money to AnCO?  AnCO are a very excellent organisation doing tremendous work <Col N="1443" /> turning out excellently trained people. But there is concern about duplication in the Bill.  I would love if the Minister would spell out the function of this agency as opposed to the work and the present function and role of AnCO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker probably summed up many of the points being made under this section.  Let me say immediately what the agency is intended to do.  On the general training for young people under the age of 25, including apprentices, we have had discussions with AnCO and we expect an increase under this heading of 2,500 trainees in the coming year.  In the work experience programme we expect to see an increase from 5,000 to 7,000.  The temporary grants scheme of the Department of Education can, we believe, after discussions with the Department, be extended drastically from the present 900 to 5,000. The community youth training programme, another AnCO programme, will be increased from 1,730 to 4,000. The environmental and group improvement scheme, which has a fairly low base, can be extended to 5,600.  As I said, it was not intended that we take over schemes from sponsors but we will assist sponsors, and schemes put forward by them, from rural groups or from areas other than those already mentioned, will cater for up to 4,000 young people who could get experience or training or jobs with the assistance of the agency.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked about the criteria for disadvantaged people.  The main criterion is to be without employment for six months.  Obviously educational disadvantage, disablement, social disadvantage, would all have to be considered under the title of disadvantaged people. But the main group will be those who have not been able to find employment in the previous six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The register to indentify young people will be kept by the National Manpower Service because they already have the expertise and we do not want to duplicate work already being done.  They also have offices over much of the country.  Perhaps their register does not totally identify the <Col N="1444" /> problem and may need some strengthening but we feel that they have the expertise to do that job.</P>
    <P>With regard to AnCO we have already had discussions with them on how their schemes can be extended.  We have excellent relations with AnCO and they are anxious to be involved and to see their schemes expanded.</P>
    <P>Will the agency erect buildings? Obviously not.  It is not in the business of building; The sponsors do that, AnCO have a five-year programme which stretches up to 1985 and they are expanding their training centres in most of the main areas in the country.  So that operation is best left to the organisations that are at present carrying out that work.</P>
    <P>We take the age limit from the EEC yardstick for social fund measures, and 25 is now the EEC upper limit for the younger people.  Here we tend to consider people a little older than that as youths or young people, particularly in rural areas.  Organisations such as Macra na Feirme cover people up to the age of about 30.  Therefore we feel that we should not draw comparison too tightly with the European model and we should allow people over that age, if they have started a course, to continue it, even though it might mean that we would not be able to attract funds from the EEC Social Fund for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Honan that £20 a week for the work experience scheme may seem low in this day and age but I will have a look at that when we get to that point.  I think I have covered most of the points raised on this section.</P>

      <P>I do not want to appear to be harassing the Minister.  I have no intention of doing so.  As I said, this is a very useful piece of legislation.  But the Minister said in his address &mdash; I may have misunderstood him &mdash; that the agency was going to give special emphasis to disadvantaged young people and to disadvantaged areas.  I understand from the Minister that in disadvantaged areas the percentage of youth unemployment and the level of unemployment among disadvantaged young people will obviously be greater.  That would just mean that the <Col N="1445" /> ordinary activities of the agency would be more concentrated in those areas.  My understanding was that the agency was going to pay particular attention to those areas over and above its normal duties. Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister. But if that was the intention I am still interested to know if any criteria have been established by which that extra emphasis would be given to disadvantaged young people and to disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister comes in again, let me say that he has emphasised, in relation to questions previously asked, the degree of co-ordination there will be and the attempt to avoid overlapping.  There is another aspect that some of us referred to on Second Stage and that is the need to ensure that the agency and its objectives are known to young people on the ground and are not remote, that it is not a further structure more remote than the agencies they know, like Manpower and AnCO.  It seems from the objects which will be in the memorandum of association that the agency can deal directly with young people.  That has not been brought out sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my contribution on this Bill I emphasised the importance of trying to stimulate creativity and action by young people themselves, that they come forward with co-operative schemes, come forward with ideas in relation to their own environment, in relation to their <Col N="1446" /> own experience, and seek to have direct contact with the agency.  That should be one of the values of the agency, that in its approach to youth employment it would be accessible, open and receptive to young people coming forward and not either remote or intimidating or over-bureaucratic. This would be extremely important because what we want to do, as well as providing work experience and opportunities and a greater prospect of permanent jobs for our young people, is to give them some power and responsibility and some control over their own lives.  We do not want to reinforce this concept of dependency, a further dependency in a limited work experience job for a few months and then back on the dole again.  This agency, because it goes much further than anything we have seen before in this country &mdash; indeed it goes much further than most countries in western Europe proportionately in the amount of financial resources that it is allocating for youth employment &mdash; should try as far as possible to be in direct contact with young people, young people in disadvantaged areas or young people in any setting, whether urban or rural, and encourage them to come forward with schemes which could be funded or assisted by the agency and which could provide this kind of work and possibly lead to further development of the schemes.  I would like to see an emphasis on this direct contact with young people, an emphasis on the stimulating of co-operative ventures, an emphasis on incentive by young people themselves and, above all, that the impression conveyed to young people on the ground that this agency is very accessible to them, very close to their needs and to their wishes and not either patronising or bureaucratic or alien.</P>

Will there be branches throughout the country, or will it operate through the existing Manpower offices? I want to know exactly how a young person in Athlone would go to this <Col N="1447" /> agency and get all possible information about a job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to evade any queries that are put to me, but one thing I must point out is that, in order to give flexibility to the agency, it was my intention not to write down every activity it could be involved in.  Section 2 gives the flexibility that it will require in order to get at the problems that have been mentioned by Senators.</P>
      <P>I do not want to identify an area and say that particular place is some sort of a ghetto, that there are many disadvantaged young people in it and therefore we are going to go in there and do something in that area.  The National Manpower register would identify where young people who have no employment are and will provide the basic information for the agency in formulating their policy to deal with the various areas and their problems and in seeing what the programme sponsors can do initially and what has to be done on their initiative to bring work experience or work training to people in those areas.  In no way do I want to evade any question on this point, but I believe that if the agency is to have that co-ordinating role, that flexibility to do the job, then I cannot spell out to the last comma what it is to do.  Knowing what the National Manpower Service register is like and how it identifies the problems, I believe the agency's main task, first of all, will be to see where existing schemes can be used to the advantage of young people in their own area, and if the sponsors cannot be helpful in those areas, to see how a programme can be put forward to bring the mobile section of AnCO to those areas. I want to leave that sort of flexibility so that the agency can develop.  As to where the agency will be located, I could not possibly say.</P>

The agency will make this decision but I would imagine that since we have the headquarters of AnCO and the headquarters of the National Manpower Service and the Department of Labour in Dublin, it would seem reasonable initially to have its headquarters in Dublin.  I hope that the people who will be on the board will decide on where they can do the job best and that is the most important thing.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson suggested that the agency should deal directly with young people and I quite agree with her.  We have left some flexibility in the memorandum of association so that it can do exactly that.  I would encourage it so to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a small point on section 7.  Whilst the previous speaker has said he hates tokenism, I would like to reiterate a point I made earlier in the debate.  I see that the number of directors of the agency shall be 11.  Could five or <Col N="1449" /> six of these directors be of the female sex?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two young people out of 11.  On my past experience, and I say this with respect to the various august bodies, the nominees of the Irish Congres of Trade Unions will be anything but youthful.  The nominees of the employers will be anything but youthful. It is quite unlikely that either of those bodies will nominate women.  The two young people will probably not be representative in any way of unemployed young people.  I do not know if there is any organisation with unemployed young people whom they would nominate to a body such as this.  What bothers me is that the perception that young people have of the National Manpower Service is very unfavourable.</P>
      <P>I do not claim that this is representative. My experience of talking to unemployed young people is that they do not find the National Manpower Service particularly accessible, sympathetic or helpful. Many people do not understand young people.  Our young people, particularly the urban young people, are different from the previous generation in their values, culture, aspirations and in their cynicism about the political process. Great care must be exercised in the nomination of young people to the agency. The Minister cannot tell outside agencies whom they should nominate so I would strongly urge that he should ensure those who are nominated by the agencies over which he has some direct influence, particularly Government Departments, are young at least in their mental attitude if not in years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this agency operates the caution that I customarily associate with senior civil servants, senior trade unionists or senior representatives of employers, it will exhaust the patience of young people. Young people are impatient.  They will set up structures which are not necessarily ones that young people will be patient with and they will set up systems that young people will not necessarily be patient with.  I suggest that at least five young people should be nominated, at <Col N="1450" /> least one or two of whom are young trade unionists.  The young entrepreneurs that the country very occasionally turns up would be ideal material for this board. Otherwise I am worried that the agency will not understand young people, will not respond to them and will have great difficulty in understanding the incredible alienation of a large part of our disadvantaged and poor young people from all State agencies, services and structures. They form a large number of our young unemployed.  They are alienated from all our State services.  There is an urgent need to draw them in under the aegis of an agency such as this and unless the agency is imaginative, flexible and responsive in the way that young people expect to be responded to it will not do the job that it is set up to do.  I am not happy with the proposed composition of the agency.  Great care must be exercised in the selection of the individuals to go on the agency board.</P>

      <P>Following on from what Senator Ryan said, I should like to know from the Minister with regard to subsection (5) how many bodies are involved?  Will the Minister be nominating specific bodies or will he accept nominations from a large number of bodies? Is the Minister bound to accept otherwise respectable people nominated by such bodies as the Congress of Trade Unions? I agree with what Senator Ryan said that it is essential that this agency be seen as an imaginative approach to the problem and that it breaks through this barrier of alienation and cynicism which he referred to and which is familiar to any of us who have to deal frequently with young people.</P>

      <P>Looking at the composition of the directors of the agency, a gap is already created between the youth and the people who will be nominated.  The Minister should wait to see who is nominated. Then he, in his good commonsense, might put on that board some of the people who went out and pioneered the youth movement when it was not a popular thing to do.</P>

      <P>I agree with other Senators that perhaps this agency more than any other established by the State will create an aura for itself by the people who are involved: the chairman, members and directors.  It is extremely important that they be representative of the area they are intended to work in.  I can see from my arithmetic that the Minister will have three appointments which will not be nominations from others.  He obviously cannot dictate the nominations. Presumably he could indicate that it would be appropriate for Congress and for the Federated Union of Employers to consider that in this instance the directors should be representative.  I agree with Senator O'Rourke that they should not only be representative of youth but should be demonstratively representative of the 51 per cent of the population which is not usually given that kind of representation. This is not in any sense &ldquo;tokenism&rdquo; or an irrelevant point.  It is relevant to the way in which the agency will make an impact with the young people and how it will be received.  If someone who is sufficiently above the age level that we are discussing here is nominated, it should be up to the body to justify that nomination.  This would be very interesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take account of suggestions made by Senators when I am appointing the board.  I will be contacting the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisation and it will be their task to select their members.  I hope that this debate will be drawn to their attention.  I will suggest to them that they take into account the fact that it is a youth employment agency and, therefore, people dealing with youth should be considered. Whether they will be men or women is up to these organisations.  That will be their task.  As regard my nominees, I will take Senators' feelings into account on the sex of the various directors I nominate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to move away from the composition as it is set out.  To directors of other agencies and boards coming from the trade union movement and the employers' organisation, we owe a debt <Col N="1452" /> of gratitude for the work they have done over the years.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with employment and training and we hope employers will employ these young people.  As they will be going in the main to organisations which are highly organised it is logical that organisations that know that area of the economy should be directly involved so that problems that could arise about displacement could be ironed out.  That would be preferable to having some area which would have no representation and which would say that the agency would displace certain people in a county council and so on and that their members were coming out on strike as a result.  We do not want that problem to occur.  We can avoid it by having representation from these areas.</P>
    <P>I intend to contact the National Youth Council.  I am anxious that somebody representing rural youth be nominated to the board.  It is important that young people in rural areas are directly represented. Other Departments, apart from my own, will be carrying out many of the schemes and they should be represented. They will also be giving us advice, particularly the Department of Education on the changeover from education to working life, to training and so on.</P>
    <P>On the environmental side, through their director, every local authority, county councillor has a representative on the youth board.  It is very important that members at local authority meetings can talk about the youth agency and the problems that may occur.</P>
    <P>There is a very good balance in the composition of the board.  We kept it small.  We could have made it a board of 20 or 25 members and try to bring in everybody we could think of on to it.  It represents the social partners, Government Departments and young people right across the board and I hope that it is acceptable.</P>

      <P>This section together with section 15 is one that it would be helpful to have clarification on.  It provides that the Minister may from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, advance such moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine for the purposes of the expenditure.  I am anxious to have clarification on how this will work in practice. If one reads the wording, it could give the Minister a dominant control on all expenditure and, by the same token, could undermine the very independence and flexibility of the agency that the Minister was emphasising in answer to a previous question.  It would be helpful to know whether there will be a block grant from time to time or if the agency will have to apply before it could advance with a particular scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As we see it operating, the agency will bring forward its schemes and costings to the Minister and will look for money to meet these costs.  It would be reasonable to do it on that basis rather than just give £40 million or whatever to the agency without having some control over the operation.  In the end, the Minister will be responsible for the money.  It is on the basis of programmes put forward to the Minister for agreement that funds will be released.  That is the only way it can be done.  Very large sums of public money are involved and the Minister in the end is answerable for the proper expenditure of that money.</P>

      <P>In 1981 AnCO, CERT and the work experience programme grants came to £35 million.  Now we are told the new levy will bring in £40 million. We have not been told what the administration of it will cost.  Will we finish up with more money or less money?  There is confusion there.  Many of our youth are not concerned with legislation and would not know what Bills were being debated here or in the Dáil, but they will want to know the end result.  How much money will be spent on the youth?  When the Minister in reply to Senator Fallon spoke <Col N="1454" /> about buildings and so on, I thought he was talking about an extension of AnCO. There is only £5 million of a difference between the 1981 grant and the new levy. We do not know what this will cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pursue further the precise relationship between the Minister and the agency as regards control of the purse strings.  There was widespread concern that the agency would be flexible, adaptable, non-bureaucratic and close to the young people on the ground whom it was desired to help and provide with jobs and work experience.  I would be concerned if in relation to getting money the agency had to clear every scheme with the Minister because that would only make for potential delay and bureaucracy.  I accept that the Minister is accountable to the Oireachtas and that we are dealing with a very significant amount of public money.  Senator Honan must bear in mind what the other part of this Bill does. It is raising money through a levy, which has not been done before, in addition to other moneys which have been spent on various projects affecting young people. We are talking about a new scale of money and an agency to dispense that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the provision in section 8 does not spell out how exactly that will work.  In relation to each scheme that the agency seeks to approve, does it have to go to the Minister for his approval?  This could lead to considerable bureaucracy and could prevent the kind or risk-taking in relation to some schemes which is necessary and desirable when we are talking about schemes for young people, particularly if the agency will be open to young people themselves to come forward with co-operative ventures and with their own ideas.  They may feel that, having been persuaded that the scheme is one which would come within the general terms of reference not to be funded, there is then a second stage with a period of delay in between when the Minister has to agree that the scheme is one that comes within the terms of the agency and it is appropriate that they should fund it. I want to know if the Minister will decide <Col N="1455" /> whether to advance money for each scheme, or once it is vetted by the agency will he automatically advance the money?  In order to avoid that delay could money be given periodically in relation to schemes in advance of them being cleared by the agency?  The agency could be given periodic budgets throughout the year in order that clearance and financing can come through rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that the levy will be put to the moneys that have been spent prior to the setting up of this agency on youth employment schemes, work experience programmes, on the schools industry link and on all the various headings under which youth employment was helped or will the levy supersede the earlier moneys?  Will the levy only go on youth employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency will not have to clear individual schemes.  It will provide a broad plan of expenditure to the Minister who will approve that.  This will be the way in which it will be approached rather than the Minister having to sit down every morning to agree the schemes with the chief executive of the agency.  It is intended that a broad plan will be drawn up by the agency and that the money for that will be given by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In a full year the levy and the social fund are expected to net £90 million.  In the coming year, because it is the first year of operation, the only thing that can be said with certainty is the amount the levy will bring in and that is approximately £40 million.  What I cannot say is how much social fund money will come in during 1982.  Therefore, I cannot give an accurate answer to that because the schemes will be vetted and it will depend on the level of funds they attract.  Some will attract 50 per cent, others 55 per cent and some £11 a week.  It is not possible to say when the money will be paid to the agency.  I hope that we do not mislead anybody in this area.</P>

I am afraid that when the social fund is distributed it may be <Col N="1456" /> said that Ireland is now employing a levy for youth employment and they have a fund built up for that.  It is becoming clear that it will jeopardise our share of other funding which would go towards youth employment.  If that is the case then it is not a good idea.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that the same emphasis will be placed on additional funding as was on previous funding for youth employment.</P>

Is the money that is at present coming from other Departments for youth schemes and so on, still going to come on-stream or will the final package be £90 million?

      <P>I listed earlier the schemes that would be extended.  I also mentioned a few of the smaller ones that are coming from the Department of Education for which the agency will have some responsibility.  We will be looking to the social fund to finance any additional schemes that come from individuals, groups or committees.  We will not, in other words, be substituting something that is there already unless an organisation sees an advantage to be gained from so doing.  I made it clear in my opening speech that I wanted a co-ordinated approach between what is being done, what was done in the past and what will be done in the future.  I am convinced that the best way to do this is by having a single source of Exchequer finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the youth group that we are talking about was supported partly by the social fund and partly by the youth agency there would simply be chaos.  They would go to the social fund looking for a portion and we on behalf of the agency would be looking for a portion.  We need a co-ordinated approach.  We can move ahead <Col N="1457" /> and get money for organisations on the basis of one application for all the 25 year-olds.  That should commend itself to everybody.  We are creating the policy for the youth group between 15 and 25 years of age who are unemployed and therefore we should make approaches to the social fund.  We should look at the schemes that are being run by the agencies I have listed as one unit rather than dividing them up. I hope Senators accept this approach rather than a piecemeal approach to the problem.</P>

      <P>This section provides that the agency has an obligation to furnish balance sheets accounting for the money spent, that the Minister can request further information and that a copy of these will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Neither in this section nor anywhere else in the Bill is there an obligation on the agency to submit an annual report of its activities, a report which would set out what it had done and perhaps to some extent evaluate its work and experience during that year.  It is fairly common to find in relation to State agencies of this kind an obligation to report.  For example the Employment Equality Agency and such other agencies report to both Houses. Occasionally such reports are debated; in this House we have had a number of debates in the past on reports of agencies of this kind.  I accept that this particular agency are a company to be registered under the Companies Act, but because of the importance of their work and because they will be a permanent agency, it would be very helpful if they were required to submit a fuller report to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Simply a balance sheet on income and expenditure is not really adequate for the purposes I am <Col N="1458" /> talking about.  It would be of great interest to this House to have an annual report on the kinds of schemes that have been funded, on the way in which the individuals and agencies had approached the agency itself and an evaluation of the success or the problems that were incurred during that particular year.</P>

If there were a chance then for Members to read and debate it there would be valid points of view which they could put forward. This Youth Employment Agency will be dealing with young people between 15 and 25 years.  It should not be an inactive operation but should be constantly changing according to the needs of the young people whom the agency will serve.  We should not just get figures at the end of each year but we should get facts regarding what had been done or had not been done, perhaps showing a way forward for changing in the following 12 months.</P>

If a person chooses to engage in politics in the Upper House automatically he will have to take leave of absence from his place of employment for the duration of the Seanad session.  It is not exactly an incentive to people to participate in politics.

      <P>Has the Minister considered the adverse effects that this section may have on the employment opportunities of people who have full eligibility under the medical services, namely, medical card holders?  When employers become aware of the fact that they will be liable for the youth employment levy in the case of any of their employees who are medical card holders, is there a danger that there will be a tendency on the part of employers to shy away from the employment of medical card holders? This may happen on two grounds, firstly on the ground of the additional cost involved and, secondly, because of the additional administrative work that will be involved on the part of employers. Would it not be better if there was an exemption from the levy in the case of medical card holders, as there is in the case of other categories?</P>

First of all, there are very few involved in this.  Apart from that, I <Col N="1461" /> do not agree that there will be any real disincentive effect on employers when employing people at that level.

      <P>What I am endeavouring to do in this Bill is to follow the health regulations in applying the 1 per cent levy.  I have excluded a number of people who are in a very low paid sector.  As regards the group that may not get employment simply because another 1 per cent is being paid by employers, I hope that number would be very small, but if it is represented to me as a serious problem, I will look at it again.</P>

For many years in the European Parliament, in my own party and now in government, I have endeavoured to get a scheme like this brought forward.  I think it is worthwhile and from conversations I have had outside this House people seem to agree that it is well worthwhile and that the way in which we intend to finance it is the right one.  It is proper that people in employment should pay. It will be paid on gross income.  Farmers with a valuation above £40 paying tax will pay and anybody paying tax will be liable. If a farmer has a valuation below £40 and has not been considered for health contributions he will not have to pay this 1 per cent but if he is caught by the health contributions he will pay.</P>

      <P>Obviously we are talking about a levy of 1 per cent.  In my main contribution I tried to suggest that we were going to face an overall situation in which conventional methods might not necessarily produce a solution to our problems in the field of unemployment generally and youth unemployment in particular.  The Minister must have the power in this Bill to vary the rate of the levy so far as is needed by particular circumstances.  Clearly the Minister and the Government of the time will take account of what the market will bear and what people will be prepared to contribute. One of the advantages of this levy proposal is that workers, farmers, and people with other forms of income can see quite clearly that they are making a direct contribution towards something which has a positive aim and which will be worthwhile if it provides employment for young people.  I would like the Minister to know that we are very much concerned that he should have flexibility in this matter within reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to <Col N="1464" /> the provisions for exclusion from the requirement to pay the levy.  I am somewhat concerned that the Minister's view represents a view that has already been advanced by the Government, that the only poor people are people on social welfare because the only people excluded are either people on social welfare or some other form of State support.  That is not true.  I dislike quoting family or personal circumstances but my mother is the widow of a secondary teacher and her income is about £50 a week.  She is not eligible for a contributory widow's pension because secondary teachers did not pay social insurance at that time.  Many of the widows of the public servants, gardaí, teachers and so on are on a quarter of the income of their husbands which is not that much greater than the social welfare contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may feel that £40 or £45 a week is more than enough for a single person but that is not my view.  I do not understand why some attempt was not made to determine, for instance, the minimum level of income for a single person at, say, £50 a week.  I suggest that people over 65 years should be exempt because of the fact that they are low paid.  There are a small number of people over 65 years who are particularly well off but, as I have said, my major concern here is the implication that the only people in our society who are poor are people on social welfare.  There are many poor people who, for various reasons, do not qualify for social welfare.  The means tests for all of the means-tested social welfare benefits are fairly restrictive and fairly ungenerous. Many people do not qualify under the means test because they have £30 or £40 a week from a private pension fund or from some investments.  Far be it from me to be justifying investments because they are more than enough people to defend them.  There are many people who do not qualify on a means test for social welfare assistance but who are poor.  Yet, it appears all of those who have an income will be subject to this 1 per cent levy.  I do not understand why that should be the case.  I know the Minister is not lacking in compassion but I wish the Government would get away <Col N="1465" /> from this assumption that the only people who are poor in our society are those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  This thinking was reflected in the July budget where special provision was made for social welfare recipients as if they were the only people who were poor.  I wish that was the case because then we would have some measure of the problem.  The problem is much more widespread, much more extensive and this levy will mean another small diminution of the living standards of a large number of people who are poor already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, one would agree with what Senator Ryan says as regards the poor.  I never said that the people who are excluded in section 22 are the only poor people.  What I said was that this situation is being considered by the Government and if the Minister for Health excludes certain people from health contributions then I will exclude them too.</P>
      <P>Initially, I would have to say that this levy on all incomes will provide a certain sum of money to deal with a very difficult problem but if I begin to exclude categories we will have to investigate them. Members of local authorities will be aware that in the matter of health cards there are differences from one area to another.  Certain counties have a 66 per cent level while around the city it is 27 per cent.  Therefore, we struck a clear line.  I thought rather than include everybody, we should allow a small category out and these are the identifiable ones. Certainly I agree if changes are made in the very near future in defining the level of the low paid I will take that on board. There is no doubt about that.</P>

      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1981,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 7 December, 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Seanad to endorse the resolution passed yesterday by Dáil Éireann authorising the Minister for the Environment to make an order continuing the Housing Act, 1969, in operation until the end of 1984.</P>
      <P>The 1969 Act is a temporary measure which was designed to prevent the unwarranted demolition or change of use of habitable houses.  Under the provisions of the Act the permission of the housing authority must be obtained for the demolition or change of use of any habitable house.  In determining an application for permission under the Act, a housing authority must have regard to the state of repair of the house to which the application relates and to the adequacy of the supply of dwellings in its functional area. An authority may grant permission, with or without conditions, or may refuse the permission sought.</P>
      <P>At least 38 housing authorities have availed of the powers made available to them by the Act.  However, the controls have been utilised consistently only by a few &mdash; principally by the Dublin authorities and Cork Corporation.  These authorities have indicated that the Act has helped to preserve a considerable number of houses in their functional areas and they have strongly recommended that the Act should be continued in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 30 September 1981 applications for permission in respect of 2,463 dwellings had been made to Dublin Corporation. Permission was refused in 1,045 <Col N="1467" /> cases and granted subject to conditions in 1,365.  Of the 325 applications received by Cork Corporation in the same period, 222 were granted, 87 were refused and 16 were withdrawn.  These figures do not, of course, provide a fair indication of the effectiveness of the Act which has a deterrent value considerably wider than the range of applications.  By availing of the powers which it confers, local authorities have secured the provision of numbers of replacement dwellings.  Relevant, too, has been the assistance to local finances by the contributions made by developers where permission for demolition and change of use has been granted subject to such contributions.</P>
    <P>Where a housing authority has refused permission or granted it subject to conditions, there is the right to appeal to the Minister for the Environment.  By the end of September 1981 1,106 appeals have been submitted.  Of these 59 were not received within the statutory period, 116 were withdrawn, 879 were determined and the remainder are awaiting decisions.</P>
    <P>When previous draft continuance orders were being considered by the Dáil and Seanad the question was debated whether the Act should be continued in its existing form.  In 1979 the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment recommended that the Act be continued for a further temporary period.  He felt then that some form of permanent control for the purpose was necessary, but he was not satisfied as to the proper form of such controls.  Before making a decision on the matter it was his intention to consult those local authorities who had experience of operating the controlled system.  Local authorities were consulted and the investigation established that very few availed of their powers under the Act, preferring instead to use the Planning Act to control changes of use of residential property. Only two local authorities made a case for the retention of the Act but, although both used their powers extensively, neither offered any positive suggestions as to how the undoubted weakness of the Act might be overcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> In my opinion, there is a need for some control of the type provided in the Act but I am inclined to the view that the control would best be exercised by the planning authorities under the planning code and that whatever legislative amendment is necessary for the purpose in that code should be made.  Pressure of other business since last July has prevented the preparation of proposals for legislation along these lines.  The position is directly related to the question of reviewing the present provisions governing the withering of planning approvals and permissions, a matter on which important representations have been made concerning which the Government intend to make an announcement in the immediate future.  In the meantime it would be undesirable that the powers available under the 1969 Act to those local authorities who use them, should be lost through the lapsing of the Act and I propose to continue them through this order for a period of three years from 31 December 1981.  When I ask the Seanad in the circumstances to approve the order now before it I assure the Members of the House quite definitely that the situation will be reviewed in the coming months.  If appropriate safeguards can be provided by planning legislation my intention will be to allow the 1969 Act to lapse before the terminal date now proposed. On this basis I commend the motion to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a non-contentious order which is acceptable to this side of the House as providing a necessary safeguard. I accept the Minister's point of view that it should be looked at and perhaps updated and any necessary improvements made.  It provides the necessary safeguards for keeping housing stock still standing that would be levelled by bulldozers were it not for this provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1981.  It is very important, particularly for the cities of Dublin and Cork where the conservation of existing housing stock has been threatened, particularly prior to the original Housing Act, 1969 when <Col N="1469" /> buildings not alone in residential use but also of high architectural merit were demolished at short notice.  This Act has handed over to the local authorities the opportunity to conserve our housing stock and to do something positive to retain a residential atmosphere in parts of both cities where the movement into commercial use has been far too fast and very changed planning problems have arisen.  This Act needs to be strengthened.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comments of the Minister of State in relation to the planning legislation and what he might do in the foreseeable future to strengthen it and make it fall in line with the planning arrangements existing in both cities.  The development plan can be at variance quite often with decisions taken under the Housing Act by either the local authority or by the Minister.  The Act must be dovetailed into the planning arrangements and into more respect for the development plans existing in each city and in other local authority areas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the move to review the close association that must exist between the Housing Act and the Planning Act.  When we come to review the legislation and reach an amendment to the Planning Act we must ensure that the Housing Act is not used in some curious way under the precedent established over the last ten years when consent given under the Housing Act is, to some extent, taken by the local authorities as having a connection with the proper planning and development of an area and must therefore be implemented and the development plan is not allowed as the overwhelming argument. The development plan brought into being by proper consultation in a city or any other local authority area must be seen to give the fullest control of the development of property and in particular to protect not just residential areas and places which need's that protection but equally the conservation of listed buildings and places of architectural merit.  There is a great need to move forward into associating these two Acts and amendment of the Planning Act at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is coming before this House to seek a further extension of an order under the Housing Act, 1969.  This matter was debated at some length in this House when the then Minister came before the Seanad on 31 October, 1979 to extend the order to 31 December, 1981.  The Minister then also referred to the measure as temporary and said that the Department were examining extensively a proposal for a permanent legislative measure to govern this area. The first speaker on the Opposition side at that time was Senator Alexis FitzGerald. I am referring to the Official Report of the Seanad, column 26, volume 93.  He said that he did not intend to oppose the motion because he had to support the objective of preserving the housing stock, but that the measure itself showed a lack of concern for proper legislation in this area.  I quote from part of his contribution on that:</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand, from a study of this Act and of all the other different codes which apply to the matter of the provision of houses of which one of the most important is the fiscal code, what is the overall policy of the Government on this matter.  I submit to the House that the object of housing policy should be to house people, not to build houses, particularly if the overall effect of the different codes is to let fall into disrepair through lack of maintenance, through lack of activity in the matter of maintenance, existing stock which could be available to house people or be more efficiently altered to house people and to build houses in green fields instead.</P>
      <P>The order proposes that we should continue the Act for two years.  In the meantime, two years having passed since we continued the Act already, consideration is to be given to the alternative set of structures to replace this particular item, which is only one item in all our legislation and policy with regard to this vital human matter of ensuring that our economic resources are applied with a real priority for the people and with the greatest efficiency and justice for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> I look forward to being here when this order expires.  If I am here and if another similar order comes before this House I shall be merciless in judgment of the Executive who would dare present it to us.  I am just about patient with regard to the order.  It is only fair that not merely the Minister, the entire governmental system, the bureaucracy or whatever, but everyone should have an opportunity of studying the very comprehensive review which is made by the ESRI of housing policy.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that that time he would be patient.  My contribution followed and I said that I found myself less patient than Senator Fitzgerald on that occasion in October 1979 in regard to this very important area of housing policy.  We need very badly a broadly-based measure which deals with the problem and it is depressing to come back two years later under a change of administration and find the same approach of continuing a temporary measure which has received a great deal of criticism of its admittedly indirect impact on housing policy and of the defects of that.  These were indentified fully on the record of the House in October 1979.  It was made clear at that time that we needed proper planning legislation which effectively would ensure both that the housing stock would be maintained in a physical sense and that people would be aware that the housing policy was addressed to the need for housing in areas where people had lived and wished to continue to live.</P>
    <P>One of the gravest defects in the 1969 Act which we are in the process of extending for a so-called temporary period is that it can be evaded.  It has a number of defects and it does not solve the most serious aspects of the housing problem.  This matter has been discussed in both Houses of the Oireachtas since the motions started to come before the Houses for extension of the 1969 Act. The issues were clearly made known to successive Ministers of the Department, and what concerns me is that we are now extending it for a longer period.  The last time we applied for an extension it was <Col N="1472" /> from 31 October 1979 to 31 December 1981, a two-year period.  This time the Minister is looking for an extension to the end of 1984, a three-year period.</P>
    <P>What depresses me is that this measure cannot be seen in isolation from other legislation and financing, fiscal and administrative measures in relation to housing.  It reveals a lack of concern to deal with the problem, which does not bode well.  We are to discuss two other measures in this House in the next day or two on aspects of housing, specifically private rented accommodation and protection of tenants in private rented accommodation, but there has been a failure down the years to have a policy in relation to existing housing stock, to the maintenance and preservation of that housing stock, to the recycling and re-use of that housing stock and to the expansion of the basic stock to meet the growing demands in the greater Dublin area. That is very much reflected in the city of Dublin now.  It is reflected in the gaps, derelict sites and destruction in parts of the centre city area, and in the human tragedy of people being displaced and re-housed elsewhere where they do not have pre-existing roots, community facilities, shops, proper transport etc.  It is reflected in some of the problems that we are now seeing in a surburban sprawl without proper infrastructure and community planning.  I can only re-affirm with an even greater sense of despair the comments that I made in October 1979.  I was then on the Opposition side and I was opposing a Minister of the Fianna Fáil administration bringing in an order.  Now we have a change of Government but apparently no change of policy in relation to this aspect of the housing problem.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give very concrete assurances in his reply to this debate as to what he proposes to do as Minister to provide a broad-based legislative solution in this area.  We are tired of assurances that the measure is only temporary and that something will happen. We have had that from successive Ministers in successive Governments. Meanwhile the problems of the 1969 Act and the general state of decline have continued. The 1979 urgency is still here and <Col N="1473" /> there is a very real need for a commitment long before the end of 1983 to bring in a broad-based legislative measure which will reflect a planned and thought-through approach to housing which will indentify the very grave problems that we have and we should decide to meet them in that structured and broad-based way.</P>
    <P>Any objections which I had on the record of this House in October 1979 to the extension of the temporary order I have today.  Any assurances that were given by the Minister then were similar to the assurances given on the previous occasion.  I hope that whatever indications of policy in this area the present Minister may give will be convincingly different in his request to the House to give a further extension to the 1969 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I was not present in the House when the Minister had the rather distasteful task of moving this order, but I was in the other House in 1977 when his predecessor, bar two, had the similar distasteful task of moving what was admittedly bad legislation which was to be given a temporary lease of life until such time as the Department of the Environment and the responsible Minister got their Act together and produced proper legislation.  In 1979 the same rather distasteful task was imposed upon a new Minister for the Environment with the same kind of assurances.  To my regret, a person who is not four weeks in office in his present position is charged on behalf of the establishment of both Government and civil service to come into the Houses of the Oireachtas do ask us yet again to extend bad legislation.  It is totally, utterly and completely unacceptable that this should happen.  Somewhere within the halls of the permanent Government and the not so permanent Government are a group of people who are responsible for this nonsense.  I gave a long, detailed critique in 1977 as to why this Act should not be extended.  I gave a long, detailed critique that the House manifestly was failing to do what the primary author of this measure, ex-Deputy Kevin Boland, then Minister for the Environment, or Local Government as it <Col N="1474" /> was then, had attempted to do.  He had been forced to do it by the likes of myself and other students who took to the streets of Dublin marching to protest against the destruction of sound dwellings when there was a housing crisis in the city.  It was hasty legislation, it was bad legislation, extracted out of an unwilling Fianna Fáil administration at that time.  It did part of a job for part of the time.  It no longer does what the original housing agitators wanted it to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every personal sympathy for the present Minister of State at the Department of the Environment who has been handed the brief and told to go in and defend this totally unacceptable position. We have an enormous housing crisis which has been aggravated by disastrous management of our public finances for the past five or six years.  This Act does nothing in real terms to alleviate that despite what many of its defenders would argue to the contrary.  I rise to speal here because there is nothing nore I can do to put into the record what I hope might be stinging comments in relation to it.  Somewhere between Government Buildings in Merrion Street in that padded Cabinet room and the Custom House some group of people have been grossly irresponsible over the last six years and have objectively, consciously or not, misled public representatives, elected representatives of the people, in both this House and the Dáil on this legislation.  I make this charge in all seriousness.  Somewhere somebody is not doing his or her job.  If the politicians of either party's political complexion find the machinery of Government so difficult to operate and to combine with the prospect of political survival, then surely we should be honest with the people and inform them so, and try to reform the system.  It is not sufficient for us here to try to put the blame on civil lervants as has been done in the past.  The civil service may be grossly incompetent collectively or individually, but they are not politically responsible. Irrespective of the talent individually and collectively in the civil service, at the end of the day the civil service are not politically responsible.  The elected Members of this House are responsible.  This is one <Col N="1475" /> area of legislation in which that responsibility has been scandalously abused in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I will not go into the arguments regarding the legislation because they have been put on the record in the past in this and the other House.  I endorse the contribution of my colleague, Senator Robinson, on this matter in every word.  I would like a commitment from the Minister of State that this is the last time this order will see the light of day on the Order Paper of either the Seanad or the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We are not in any real sense defending the housing stock of the country or providing homes for people who might otherwise find themselves homeless.  We are devaluing the process of law-making in general and undermining our won credibility to ourselves and to the public service who have the task of drafting legislation, preparing memoranda and doing the groundwork for which we as public representatives ultimately carry the political can.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that i have to put those comments on the record of this House, but I could not possibly let the situation continue.  I regret that the Minister of State has the unfortunate task of being personally responsible in a political sense for something that is totally unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I understand the frustration of Members of the Seanad at the situation now when a commitment was given some time ago that this order would be terminated and some alternative legislation introduced.  I do not want to acept responsibility for the former Government or for any commitment they made.  Senator Robinson referred to Senator Alexis FitzGerald saying that he would be merciless if this ever came before this House again, and I suppose that is one of the disadvantages of changing Government.  I sincerely accept the views expressed here.  I cannot account or do not intend to give any explanation for any form of commitment made here.  I accept responsibility for what has happened since the change of <Col N="1476" /> Government last July and, even though I have been in the Department as Minister of State for only four weeks, I accept responsibility for my immediate predecessor also.</P>
      <P>I assure Senator Quinn that it is not the fault of the civil servants.  Over the last five months we ahve had some very contentious legislation, particularly in relation to housing, with much discussion and debate and I had no opportunity ot examine some form of alternative legislation. I asure this House that early in the new year I intend to examine in detail how I can build into our planning laws safegaurds to preserve the housing stock.</P>
      <P>All Members here who spoke have agreed and all other Members in both Houses will agree that it is necessary to conserve the housing stock or to have some sort of control.  In the absence of more permanent control, unfortunately, I have to come in here today to ask the Seanad to approve of this temporary measure.  Long before the termination of this order I will have the matter examined and I assure the House that there will not be an extension of this order.</P>
      <P>I thank the Members who sopke on this matter and I have taken note of their comments.  It is only a temporary measure which I will have examined in the new year and I hope to have something more permanent to replace that in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the firmness of his personal commitment in this area that early in the new year he will seek to ahve legislative proposals but forward.  In his opening speech he referred to the control that could be exercised through planning authorities.  The planning authorities very often cannot control effectively in this area.  Under the 1969 Act we have seen and can potentially see lack of effective control and the ways in which this can be evaded, ways in which property can be left vacant, geting around the provision.  Therefore, the leaving of controls to planning authorities is worrying because they are not at the moment in a number of key areas able to exercise effectively the planning controls they <Col N="1477" /> already have.  I would ask the Minister to look at it more from a point of view of housing legislation which sets down criteria in itself.</P>

      <P>The difficulties facing any Government in legislating for protection of tenants of dwellings formerly controlled by the Rent Restrictions Acts and for the private rented sector as a whole are immense.  Not only must Government policy seek to encourage the supply of rented accommodation and improve its standard but it must also take into account the different circumstances of landlords and tenants and provide the means by which the terms of a tenancy can be determined in a manner <Col N="1478" /> which is fair to all.  In relation to controlled tenants on low incomes the Government must provide assistance for those tenants who are unable to pay for their accommodation.  The Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the Rent Restrictions Acts has highlighted these problems and made their solution all the more urgent.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, is an attempt to meet the immediate issues arising out of the Supreme Court's decision.  It does not deal with all aspects of Government policy towards the sector nor is it necessarily the final answer to the problems arising. What the Bill does seek to achieve is a balanced approach which gives reasonable protection to the tenants and their families of controlled dwellings and at the same time allows landlords a progressive increase in the return from their dwellings.  It does not deal with the provision of assistance for tenants suffering hardship as a result of rent increases &mdash; this will be dealt with elsewhere &mdash; nor does it deal with the longer term problems facing the non-controlled private rented sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the limits I have outlined the Government consider that the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, will fill the statutory void referred to by the Supreme Court and avoid the social upheaval that would result if no legislative action was undertaken.  In preparing legislation in this area the Government were very conscious of the constraints imposed by the provisions of the Constitution and the decision of the Supreme Court.  The Government have been advised that the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, is, in all regards, in conformity with the Constitution. Indeed the Government have a duty under the Constitution to protect all the citizens of the State and this Bill seeks to fulfil this duty.  In particular, the State is enjoined by Article 45 of the Constitution to direct its policy towards securing that: &ldquo;the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good&rdquo;.  The State <Col N="1479" /> acknowledges in Article 43 that while man has the natural right to the private ownership of external goods, the exercise of the rights ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice. To this end the State may &ldquo;as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Over the years since it was first introduced in 1915, rent control has been rigid on the level of rents of certain dwellings and gave considerable security of tenure for the tenants.  No mechanism was provided whereby the landlord could increase the rent to keep pace with inflation and no incentive was given to landlords to maintain the property, as he had little prospect of ever regaining possession of it.  The result has been a wasteful deterioration in the standards of these dwellings to the stage that many of them became unfit for habitation.  This is reflected in the substantial decline in the numbers of such dwellings to the point that at the moment there are likely to be no more than 30,000 controlled dwellings in existence, though this is only an estimate.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that a constitutional challenge to the Rent Restrictions Acts would be successful. The Supreme Court, in its judgement on 29 June last, held that Parts II and IV of the 1960 Act, which controlled the level of rent and restricted the landlord's right to recover possession of controlled dwellings, were contrary to the provisions of Article 40, paragraph 3 of the Constitution. That Article provides that: &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Part II of the 1960 Act was seen as an unjust attack on such rights, being both arbitrary and unfair, in that it restricted the rights of one group of citizens for the benefit of another, without compensation, without regard to the financial capacity or the financial needs of either group, with no limitation on the period <Col N="1480" /> of restriction and with no possibility of review.  Part IV of the 1960 Act, which curtailed the rights of a landlord to possession of a controlled dwelling, did not have a viable statutory existence of its own, independent of Part II and so, also, was constitutionally defective.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that the constitutional issues arising out of this Bill are highly complex.  In order to provide the time necessary to resolve them, once and for all, they introduced and had passed by the Dáil a second Bill, the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1981, which extends for a further three months the life of the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1981.  The Bill extending the life of the temporary legislation is necessary in the event that the President might refer the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981 to the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution.  Of course, such a referral is entirely a matter for the President, after consultation with the Council of State.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to outline some of the main provisions of the major Bill, I would like to advert to two matters which are not dealt with in the Bill but which were the subject of much debate in the Dáil, namely the provision of assistance for needy tenants and the use of a body other than the courts to fix rents and resolve disputes.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Second Reading in the Dáil, the point was made that there was no purpose in giving security of tenure to tenants under this Bill if the tenants concerned would be unable to afford the higher rents to be charged.  As I will indicate later, this Bill does go some way towards meeting this difficulty by providing for rent rebates up to 1986.  However, I recognise, and the Government recognise, that even with these rebates some tenants will be unable to afford the higher rents they will be asked to pay.  It is for this reason that the Government gave a commitment, in both Houses when the temporary Bill was being discussed last July, to provide assistance to tenants suffering hardship.  That commitment has been repeated by way of public <Col N="1481" /> announcement since and I now wish to reaffirm that the Government remain determined in their conviction to help those tenants for whom payment of higher rents will create hardship.  The provision of such assistance, however, is not something that is proper to the present legislation.  That is why no mention of it is made in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to outline the details of the form of rent subsidiation at this stage.  The need for the assistance will not arise until after 25 April next if both Bills before the House are passed. The details of the subsidy will be announced in advance of that date.</P>
    <P>The second matter of concern during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil was the use of the courts to fix rents where agreement could not be reached by landlords and tenants.  Some Deputies felt that the courts were not the appropriate mechanism to use to fix rents, while others were worried about the capacity of the courts to deal with the volume of cases that might come before them.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the courts have been the traditional mechanism for the settling of disputes between landlords and tenants.  Under the Rent Restrictions Acts, the arbitrating role rested with the Circuit Court or the District Court in cases of dewllings with low valuations, or rents, or where both parties agreed.  Similarly, under the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, a whole range of matters, for example, fixing rents and the other terms of tenancies, come for settlement to the Circuit Court.  These arrangements have operated with a good degree of satisfaction.  The Government in their consideration of the Bill concluded that the District Court was the appropriate and best agency to deal with matters under the Act requiring arbitration. The District Court provides a less formal and less costly means than does the Circuit Court and also gives a wider spread of sittings throughout the country. As regards costs, it will be noted that section 17 of the Bill makes a landlord who makes an application to the court liable for the tenant's costs, reasonably and necessarily incurred, unless the <Col N="1482" /> court, on consideration of all the circumstances, orders otherwise.</P>
    <P>On the question of the capacity of the District Court system, at this stage it is not possible to predict what is the likely volume of cases that will need to be decided by the District Court.  The emphasis in the Bill is on the landlord and tenant reaching agreement without recourse to litigation, and these provisions may result in a lower number of cases reaching the court than might be indicated at first sight.  However, I accept that a significant increase in the workload of the District Court is possible and the Government will take appropriate measures to ensure that the District Court can deal with the extra workload.</P>
    <P>The Bill was criticised in the Dáil for not taking the opportunity to introduce rent tribunals.  As Senators will appreciate, the time available to have an entirely new system operational for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants is very short and would not be sufficient to get a new body started from scratch and functioning.  This in no way implies a departure from any undertakings in our programme for Government.  The system for arbitrating in disputes between landlords and tenants must be operational in a very short time, if the interests of tenants are to be protected.  In these circumstances, the Government consider that the arrangements proposed in the Bill are the most appropriate at this time.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the main provisions of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981.  These will be dealt with in detail during the Committee Stage discussion. The Bill gives existing tenants of controlled dwellings and their spouses the right to remain in possession of their dwellings and their spouses the right to remain in possession of their dwellings for their lifetimes.  A member of the tenant's family, bona fide residing with him, who succeeds to the tenancy, will have a right to possession for 20 years from the commencement of the Act.  These rights give the tenant and his family security of tenure but also ensure that the landlord can expect to recover possession of the dwelling at some stage in the future. Under the Rent Restrictions Acts, where <Col N="1483" /> the landlord had no realistic prospect of ever regaining possession, he had little or no interest in maintaining the property. This feature is removed from the proposed legislation without, at the same time, affecting the rights of the existing tenant or his spouse to remain in possession of the dwelling.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, a mechanism is being provided whereby the District Court will fix the terms of the tenancy, including the level of rent, in default of agreement between the landlord and the tenant.  It is hoped that the parties involved will be able to come to voluntary agreements in many instances, but the District Court will arbitrate in others.  The terms of a tenancy, whether agreed to or fixed by the court, must be set out in writing. Where agreements are reached between the parties involved, it is expected that the guidelines set out in the Bill for issues coming before the court will have an important bearing on the terms of the agreements.  Even where the landlord and the tenant enter into an agreement, there is provision in the Bill for either party, after a period of time, to apply to the court to set the terms of the tenancy.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where a rent is fixed by the court a rebate shall operate to allow for the gradual increase in the level of rent due over a five-year period. The rebate in the first year will be 60 per cent of the difference between the existing rent and rent fixed by the court.  The rebate will reduce by 15 percentage points each year until the tenant is due to pay the full rent fixed by the court in the fifth and subsequent years.  Where the financial circumstances of the landlord and tenant so warrant, the landlord may apply to have the amount of rebate reduced.  This right is limited to landlords who owned the dwelling concerned before 31 December 1960, the date of the coming into force of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>In fixing a rent under this Bill, the court will take into account improvements which add to the letting value of the dwelling, made by the tenant since 31 December 1960.  The formula for fixing the rent is similar to that in the Landlord <Col N="1484" /> and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, and is what the court considers a willing lessee would give and a willing lessor would take for the dwelling, on the basis of vacant possession and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and the letting values of dwellings of a similar nature and in a comparable area.  Rent reviews are provided for at five yearly intervals: the absence in the former legislation of any basis for reviewing rents was one of the aspects on which adverse comment was made by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the normal provisions of rent restrictions and landlord and tenant codes there are circumstances in which a landlord must reasonably be allowed to recover possession.  Section 12 entitles the landlord to regain possession for non-payment of rent, a breach of tenancy obligation, where the dwelling is required as a residence for the landlord or other person living with him, or an employee, for the carrying out of a scheme of property development for which there is planning approval and in the interests of good estate management. In certain circumstances where the grounds for possession favour the landlord, as distinct from arising from faults or failures of the tenant, the tenant is entitled to compensation for moving and to pay for alternative accommodation.  In addition, on quitting, the tenant may obtain compensation for improvements which he, or his predecessor in title, carried out on the dwelling since 31 December 1960.  Repossession of a dwelling can be obtained only where the court considers it reasonable and the other circumstances mentioned above are met.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Minister the power to make regulations for the registration and standards of all rented dwellings.  It is intended that regulations for the registration of all controlled dwellings will be in operation from the commencement of this legislation.  Registration will be central to the operation of the procedures envisaged under the Bill since a new rent becomes payable only after registration. The regulations prescribing standards for rented dwellings are intended to replace <Col N="1485" /> by-laws under section 70 of the Housing Act, 1966, which are at present operated by some housing authorities.</P>
    <P>It is not to be expected that a Bill such as this will satisfy everybody.  It is the nature of this area that the main parties involved, landlords and tenants, have opposing interests and any legislative action must seek to balance these opposing interests.  Nobody should expect to get everything he or she demands.  Given the decision of the Supreme Court, tenants cannot expect to continue to benefit from the protection they formerly enjoyed.  One the other hand landlords have to expect the Government to act in accordance with their constitutional obligations to safeguard with special care the interests of the weaker sections of the community, among which are many controlled tenants.  At the same time, this Bill represents a genuine attempt to achieve the middle ground, protecting the right of both landlords and tenants without unduly favouring either group.</P>
    <P>The legislation attempts to deal with an urgent social problem and to prevent a major upheaval which would leave thousands of persons homeless.  I consider that it succeeds in this within the confines set by the Supreme Court decision. The legislation does not deal, nor was it intended that it should, with the longer term problems of the non-controlled private rented sector.  Policies in this area can duly be achieved when this urgent legislation is operative.</P>
    <P>To deal with the urgent problems I have mentioned, I commend these Bills to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me take this opportunity to welcome the Minister to this House and to wish him every success in his new portfolio, plus safe driving in future.  The Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1981, is only a holding operation until 25 April and that does not indeed, pose any problems from this side of the House.  I welcome the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1981.  It is a Bill long overdue and, indeed, tenants who had to go into flats and housing over the last number of years felt that some <Col N="1486" /> better accommodation should be available to them.</P>
      <P>First of all, much injustice was done to tenants by landlords in the past, without any redress whatever.  I can cite many young boys and girls who came to this city and had to get housing under desperate conditions and at rents that were uncontrollable.  These young people had no redress to anybody and were too young to know where to go to have their rights thrashed out except through the courts.</P>
      <P>Many young people who came to this and other Irish cities had to accept flat accommodation of a type which meant living in very unsatisfactory conditions. No doubt this Bill will correct many of the deficiencies in the system.  I know of dwellings all over the country that are let under a system that obtained even in the twenties and thirties where the rent being paid to the landlord today for premises, perhaps a prospering licensed premises, by that tenant is a mere pittance. That rent cannot be changed, the tenant cannot be evicted and the landlord cannot get hold of his premises even though it had been let in the first instance as a private dwelling and has now developed into a flourishing business, maybe at a rent of £2 or £3 per week.</P>
      <P>We have that anomaly and, indeed, many others that I could cite throughout the country.  It is time that this Bill reached both Houses of the Oireachtas to put this whole renting system in proper perspective and to give some assurance and guarantee to both landlord and tenant that, on the one hand, the landlord, would be safeguarded and on the other hand, that he would provide a proper house or property with all the modern conveniences available today.  That is the least that any landlord would be expected to provide for his tenant in this modern day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should mean that the type of property offered for letting would be of a very high standard and would be inspected by the planning officer, the fire chief and the sanitary officer within the local authority of the relevant area.  It is essential that a high standard of property should be on the market for letting.  With <Col N="1487" /> regard to price, the best place to settle on an agreed rent may be in the District Court.  People in the field of evaluation, perhaps an auctioneer, an evaluation officer, or an estate agent, may be in a better position to evaluate what type of rent would be necessary to levy on a particular property.  However, where agreement cannot be reached, in the final analysis perhaps the District Court where proper valuation advice would be available would be the proper place to set the figure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the <i>pro rata</i> subsidy over a period of five years to alleviate the great impact on some people who might be in occupation of property and not be in a position to vacate that property in a hurry.  This subsidy over a period would give them time at least to find their feet and to see if they could continue financially in that type of accommodation.  The tenant, on the other hand, must be safeguarded under this Bill.  In the past a tenant had no redress.  Especially with regard to flats, an inspection should take place and the tenants should have some safeguard while in residence there.</P>
    <P>In the provision of a reasonable type of flat at an agreed rent for people, especially old people, who are in occupancy at present, they will have under the provisions of this Bill a certain amount of security that they did not have heretofore. The Bill will, therefore, safeguard the old and the young.  Plenty of dwellings would not stand up to any inspection at present, but because of the shortage of housing this situation obtains.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government to provide additional finance to accelerate a solution to the housing problem for a population which is continually increasing.  Housing is the first essential and is the first base of any family unit.  It is the duty of the Government of the day to provide the funds necessary to ensure housing for that ever-increasing population. I am glad to see that this Bill makes some effort to control the rent system.  I will have further comments to make on other Stages but at present I am glad to welcome the Bill from this side of the House and give it my full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on behalf of the Labour Party in relation to this legislation. I take this opportunity to have my congratulations of the Minister of State put on record.  He is, to my personal knowledge, a very welcome officer to that position.  I am very happy about the Minister of State but I am not so happy about this legislation.</P>
      <P>Generally the situation in terms of people who cannot afford to house themselves has worsened, in objective terms, more over the last three to four years than it has for a long time.  A combination of factors has affected that situation.  The age of our housing stock has caused problems for a number of people, as has the change in the housing population.  This legislation was provoked by an action in the Supreme Court by an individual who sought to obtain his private property rights under the theme of Article 43 of the Constitution.  It was done consciously and in the context whereby the contravention of such an Act could be socially calamitous.  I believe that the Government have attempted in this legislation to reconcile the irreconcilable.  In attempting to produce a legal document that will meet the test of the Supreme Court and meet the test of Article 43 they will, if it is successful in meeting those tests, produce social chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recognised the validity of the argument that that was a possible outcome and talked in terms of other provisions being made by the Government in relation to the position of needy tenants.  Regrettably, there is no more appropriate place and time than here, now.  Unfortunately, commitments are one thing, law is another.  In the previous item of business in this House the Minister was faced with the unenviable task of having to explain why previous commitments had not in fact been honoured. I fully respect the sincerity with which the commitment has been given by the Government which I support.  Regrettably, it is not worth anything in relation to what is printed in the legislation.  Commitment is one thing, law is another.  We are here as lawmakers in this House, talking about legal rights.  Therefore, unless this law deals with all of the human dimensions of <Col N="1489" /> the problem, commitments emanating from the Department of Social Welfare, the details of which will be given at some later stage, are not, as far as I am concerned, acceptable.</P>
    <P>What, in fact, are we talking about? Estimates are very difficult to make precisely in relation to the extent of the number of people who will be affected by this legislation.  There is a consensus both in the replies to various parliamentary questions from myself and in the other House and from organisations such as Threshold, that aproximately 30,000 people will be affected by this legislation. Within that group of 30,000, at least half, and probably as high as two-thirds, are people who would be categorised as (1) elderly (2) either single or widowed (3) living on fixed income with fixed means, whether it be savings with a small annual interest income from it or, alternatively, pensions of one kind or another.  Under any categorisation those people are extremely vulnerable.  Despite the best intentions of the people who drafted this legislation, I do not believe that the position of these people will be protected by this Bill if enacted in its present form.</P>
    <P>At the outset I want to recognise fully and clearly the extremely difficult timetable within which this legislation has been conceived and within which it has to operate.  The House is not divided at all on the question of extending the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  But to confine ourselves to 25 April is to confine ourselves to an unnecessarily short timetable at this stage, although I recognise that there are great pressures on the legislators and on the Government to keep that timetable as short as possible.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 9 in particular of this Bill will be to ensure that people currently paying the controlled or protected rent on a weekly or monthly basis will, within the space of five years, have to move to full market value rent.  In some cases there are people who can perfectly afford to accommodate such a change in the rent that they have to pay. Indeed, the Supreme Court case that was undertaken by the individual very cleverly exploited what I believe is a minority <Col N="1490" /> situation that occurs around the country. By selecting on the one hand, examples of landlords who were experiencing real and genuine hardship and, on the other hand, tenants who had a substantial income which enabled them to pay rent far in excess of what they were legally required to pay a biassed picture was presented.</P>
    <P>In this instance, we have to look at the total situation.  The total situation is, I would suggest, not in accord with the one that was presented in the court action to which I refer.  I accept the assessment made by Threshold and by others that the majority of tenants covered by this legislation are economically and socially vulnerable.</P>
    <P>It is my political responsibility, as a member of the Labour Party in this House, to speak on behalf of these tenants and to defend their interests.  In so doing I may very well be accused of not adequately defending the interests of other people in our society.  Unlike other Members in this House, and perhaps in the body politic, I do not accept the rather benign view that we are a homogeneous community with common interests and common pursuits.  We are not. I do not feel that I represent all the community. Nor do I feel that all the members of the community equally on a proportionate basis voted for me.  They did not.  I believe that I represent a section of the community some of whom are extremely vulnerable.  The Labour Party particularly attempts to represent that vulnerable section of the community.</P>
    <P>I want to signal to the House that I consider that a substantial number of people who live in my constituency of Dublin South-East are going to be made extremely vulnerable as a consequence of this legislation being enacted in its present form.  I would put the figure at approximately 2,000 people in the postal district areas of Dublin 2, 4, and 6 who would find themselves, within a space of 12 months, unable to meet the market value rent which the District Court would impose upon them when the provisions of this Act are availed of by their landlord or landlords.  I shall set out to the House the alternatives that such persons will <Col N="1491" /> then have if they are to secure a roof over their heads, if they represent the typical example, because it relates to specific representations that I had during both the last general election and immediately prior to that when the Supreme Court case was being heard.  The characteristic profile of the person that I am describing is a single or widowed woman, usually over the age of 60, frequently in her seventies, with a pension or a fixed income of a very small amount &mdash; in that context, £25 a week would be quite a substantial income &mdash; living in a rent-controlled flat or room or portion of a house and having a very limited or frugal style of life.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems that such persons have is their total vulnerability to the unreliable public services on which they exclusively depend, such as, public transport, ESB, and so on.  They have great difficulty in providing adequate heat for themselves in winter.  It is no exaggeration to say that the prospect of this legislation becoming law and the prospect of the protection of their rent being removed has caused emotional and social terror among the categories of people I have described.  I have had the letters and telephone calls from them. There is no doubt in my mind that these people live in real fear of what might become of them if this legislation were to be enacted in its present form and if the protection which they have previously enjoyed were to be removed.</P>
    <P>When landlords take the opportunity to avail of the provisions of this legislation and get the market rent established by the District Court, even allowing for the discount that will be taken off for improvements that the tenant may have made since December 1960, and even allowing for the five-year phased introduction of that market rent, there will be a substantial number of people who will not be able to meet the increase in the rent that the court has granted.  The landlord will say that he is entitled to a just return on his privately owned property and if the tenant cannot pay the rent he should go to the Department of Social Welfare to see if they will make up the <Col N="1492" /> balance.  That will be a substantial amount of money in some cases and I see nothing in the present economic climate that would provide for that balance to be paid by the Department of Social Welfare. We could be talking about a difference of £20 a month to £200 a month between the gross rent as set by the courts and the current controlled rent that exists on the dwelling, and £20 a month would, in some cases, be high.  If the Department of Social Welfare is not in a position to provide the balance of over £100 in the first year, increasing by 15 per cent in each of the succeeding four years, that tenant cannot stay in that accommodation.</P>
    <P>The only other choice is to go to Dublin Corporation, as the legal housing authority for the area and say that she is now being made homeless through no fault of her own.  First let me explain the operation of Dublin Corporation.  That dilemma alone is not sufficient to get overall priority on the housing list.  The corporation, in order to ensure that the case is bona fide will demand that a court order be produced by the applicant for housing clearly indicating that she is being made homeless through no fault of her own.  The tenant would have to undergo a second court case.  The first court case would be the one in which the rent is established.  The second would be where one would go back to the District Court and plead inability to pay and the justice would reluctantly have to grant an order for possession to the landlord.  The tenant would go to Jervis Street with that court order and on that day Dublin Corporation's housing official would say &ldquo;We have a number of keys at the moment; we have some keys for Gardiner Street; we have some keys for Ballymun; we have some keys for Fatima Mansions; we have some keys for Dolphin's Barn, and we can make you an offer of one of those.&rdquo;  That would be on a good day when there would be vacancies.  The person in question may say &ldquo;I have lived in Baggot Street for the last 35 years; I have friends whom I meet after Mass in Haddington Road at 10 o'clock every day and I would like to stay in the area.&rdquo;  The Corporation official would reply with <Col N="1493" /> great sympathy that that is a high demand area and all they can offer would be what is euphemistically described as open area housing or areas of low demand where, if the truth were known, people who are homeless do not want to live because of the declining social conditions.  This accommodation would be for people with young families of a working-class background who would have some knowledge and understanding of the prevailing culture in the areas.  If the applicant declines an offer of accommodation in one of those areas the offer is regarded as having been refused and the applicant is no longer regarded by the local housing authority as being homeless through no fault of her own.  That person can then land on the doorstep of relatives, children or friends or on the doorstep of a charitable organisation such as the Simon Community or others.  I am not exaggerating when I spell out that scenario.  I will add a rider which demonstrates that the situation is even worse.  The obtaining of court orders for non-payment of rent was abused by a number of people over the last couple of years to effectively jump the housing queue in Dublin Corporation's functional area and the housing committee of Dublin Corporation recently revised the system so that a person would have to be on the housing waiting list for at least two years or, alternatively, have a number of children before even an offer of open area accommodation would be made.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald is in the House and may perhaps correct me if I have inaccurately reported that.  But I am given to understand that that is the situation because the abuse of court orders did, undoubtedly, exist.</P>
    <P>That is what will happen to 2,000 people in my constituency, and I would put the number, conservatively, at 2,000. With the best will in the world, the multiple commitments that have been given by the Minister of State, which is a repeat of the commitment which he made very clearly in the other House, and the commitments made by my much regarded colleague, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  Deputy Desmond, are totally intangible compared with what <Col N="1494" /> I know to be the reality confronting somebody who would be affected by the provisions of this Bill if it is enacted.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I envisage social chaos in certain areas if the Bill is passed in its present form.  I do not wish to be alarmist or to exaggerate the situation. But I am aware of the genuine fear that exists in the minds of many of the people whom I have attempted to describe.  To be honest, from my knowledge of the housing situation in Dublin over the last ten to 12 years, I share that fear and alarm.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, why are we doing this?  On whose behalf are we envisaging a situation where this could be the law of the land?  On behalf of which constituency of Irish citizens are we enacting into law provisions that would have the effect which I believe they will have?</P>
    <P>Who are this category of people who need to get this kind of protection from the laws of the land and from ourselves? They are what are described, in general terms, as landlords.  Some of them are people who were left property by their husbands or relatives as their sole means of income and support.  Some of them are people who are not dissimilar to the tenants whom I described earlier, elderly women, perhaps widowed, with a fixed and declining income in real terms and perhaps, in some cases, living in worse accommodation than the property they own and for which the tenants pay small rent.  I accept that.  But there are others who knowingly bought rent-controlled property at times when it could hardly be given away, before the abolition of domestic rates because, at that time, the outgoings from that property were higher than the income and were a net liability. Depending on its location, such a property could be bought for as little as six or seven years' purchase.  Such a property could be bought with the legally protected tenants for about £2,000 to £3,000 when its full market value with vacant possession would be ten times that.</P>
    <P>These landlords bought this kind of property on the open market.  They were wise men, advised by bankers, helped by the legal profession and, indeed, assisted by my own honourable profession.  They <Col N="1495" /> knowingly bought this property and we are now going to enact massive legislation that will give them a bonanza.  We will not provide a balance to the scales.  We are going to phase that bonzana over five years, not let it be delivered in one fell swoop.  I have no brief for that category of landlord.  I say it openly and sincerely. If anybody in this House feels he has a brief for that kind of landlord, let him openly and honestly stand up here and declare that he supports that category of persons.  Let him say that he stands here as a Member of Seanad Éireann and represents the interests of that category of persons and let him openly and honestly argue his case, and then let him take his chances before the people of this country in the next election.  That is the stark choice, and it is complicated by the real administrative/political dilemma that is in front of this House and in front of the Minister and his officials who are responsible because we are being asked to square the circle; we are being asked, on the one hand, to say to the public at large and specifically to these tenants that we do care about them and we will fight to protect their interests but we must have regard to the Constitution and we must have regard to the provisions of Article 40.3, and we must take into account what the Supreme Court has recently adjudged to be the interpretation of Article 43 When that is boiled down and is presented to Mrs. Murphy in Baggot Street who goes to 10 o'clock Mass every morning in Haddington Road, what it effectively means for her is that when this House has got to decide between ordinary basic human rights and property rights, we are constrained and confined and directed every time into coming down on the side of private rights.</P>
    <P>I reject that with all the passion I can command and I reject it on behalf of the strongest defenders of the 1937 Constitution because, whatever about the political conservatism of Éamon de Valera and some of the people who phrased the Articles of that Constitution, at no time in the thirties did the Republican movement ever envisage a situation where the provisions of a Republican Constitution <Col N="1496" /> would give more power for the exploitation of Irish citizens than any previous legislation that Mother England imposed on this land.</P>
    <P>That is the reality.  We are creating a new generation of native born gombeen landlords, protected in a way that Mother England never had the nerve to do in exploiting our own.  That is totally and utterly unacceptable.  So why try to pretend to ourselves and, even more important, to the public at large and specifically to the Mrs. Murphys, that somehow or other we can attempt to do the impossible and square the circle.</P>
    <P>There has been a view expressed that even this Bill, which will operate in the way I described, will itself be found to be repugnant to the Constitution.  There has been a view stated that even the miserable attempt to delay giving the full market value for a period of five years as set out in section 9 will itself be taken to the courts, argued with great skill for expensive fees by all of the professional classes &mdash; my own included; I make no distinction. At the end of the day the Supreme Court will take the holy document of our Constitution and say that notwithstanding that clause which talks about the exigencies of the common good and all the lovely, flowery Articles that talk about the rights of people, notwithstanding that remarkable Preamble that proclaims us to be a Christian nation, when the chips are down, we have no choice because &ldquo;private property rights rule, OK?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This House started its lifetime debating what the Taoiseach requested would be a crusade on the Constitution.  A very esteemed Member of this House, Senator Murphy corrected, I think properly, the Taoiseach's description of our Constitution as being sectarian.  I agreed with Senator Murphy's distinction in describing our State more accurately as a confessional State.  If one stretches the semantic meaning of the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; and applies it to the distinction between human rights and property rights, then one could rightly charge that the Constitution is sectarian.</P>
    <P>If it is sectarian at all then it is in favour of the people with property and against <Col N="1497" /> the people who do not own or who do not possess property and who have no prospect of doing so.  We, today, are being asked at Second Stage to write into the tablets of law in this independent Republic another statute that will strengthen the property owners and weaken the tenants.  I find the Bill totally and utterly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I find it unacceptable for many reasons. I find it unacceptable for political, ideological and historical reasons.  I do not believe that that is what the struggle for Irish independence was about.  I know, definitely, it was not for that that my family, both my parents and grandparents on both sides, fought.  I reject the Bill on that overall condition first of all.  But I reject it for a more precise and more specific reason.  I know, clearly and distinctly, from my own political constituency involvement, that the Bill will provoke enormous social chaos, great personal distress, and great hardship for a number of people who are absolutely and totally vulnerable and for whom there is no voice if there is not a voice in this House.  I know that despite the commitments that have been put forward clearly and sincerely by the members of the Government, including the Minister here, given the present economic climate, it simply is not possible for us to take out of the provision for the Social Welfare Estimate adequate funds to ensure that those people will not be made homeless.  The House knows, and every local authority member knows, that every local authority are not in a position to meet or clear their own housing list let alone add to it the prospect of additional people being provoked on to it as a consequence of this legislation.</P>
    <P>If there will ever be a time when the State can democratically invoke some of the powers that run through our Constitution in relation to special circumstances, emergencies and difficult times, surely this is one of them.  Surely this is an opportunity for our economic Ministers, independent economic institutions, the Central Bank and so on, to describe in graphic detail how serious is our financial position.  Allowing for a certain <Col N="1498" /> degree of polemics which political debate inevitably produces, there still is a broad measure of support on all sides of the House about the serious nature of our public finances and the difficulties in which we find ourselves.  Against that background there can be no moral judgment or argument in favour of supporting, through public funds, landlords who have no need of the full market price of this privately owned property.  If there is such an argument on any side of the House let us hear it and, more importantly, let the public hear it.  Let us hear it from where it comes and identify the representatives of such an argument.</P>
    <P>The House finds itself in a very difficult position.  We all support the Constitution and the idea of constitutional Government. We all recognise that in many ways the Constitution has served the nation well in some parts.  We all know that the courts are there to protect and dispense justice to all citizens without distinction. We know that the essence of good Government and efficient administration is to produce laws which work administratively, technically and legally.  Yet at the end of the day we take our mandate from the public.  We get our supports from people who we think need support.  We try to move society on to a higher and better social plane for the majority of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I suggest seriously to the House that in trying to reconcile those two objectives we are currently in conflict.  The lawyers in the Attorney General's Office are aware of the conflict.  They have struggled with a formula of words that would enable us to square the circle.  The officials in the Department of the Environment are acutely aware of it.  They have been aware of the necessity for this legislation from the time the first court action was successful.  That was, if my memory serves me right, two years ago.  The people in the parliamentary draftsman's office are very much aware of the contradiction of trying to square the circle.  The Minister of State is aware of the difficulties involved.  I hope that, by the end of the debate in both Houses, we as politicians will be aware of that difficulty.  If we do not pursue a particular course of <Col N="1499" /> action, one which I am suggesting, then I do not believe that the public will be aware of the difficulty.  If the public are not made aware of it in a deliberate and definite way, the possibility of amending the Constitution to remove its bias in favour of private property or alternatively establishing a climate whereby the Supreme Court will take a balanced view of the entire Constitution &mdash; as I would argue they have not so done in the past &mdash; then we will not be doing our job as legislators.</P>
    <P>There are many sections of this Bill which could be changed or improved. There are many sections which could be more properly fitted within the context of landlord and tenant legislation for all forms of rented residential accommodation. There are many comments which I will make on Committee Stage.  In the heel of the hunt, the core of this Bill rests in section 9.  We must adopt an amendment to section 9 that will take account of the people I described earlier who can be defined adequately by the parliamentary draftsman, by the Attorney General's Office and indeed by the officials in the Department of the Environment along with the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, and who by virtue of their age or income simply cannot meet the rent that the District Court will fix.</P>
    <P>I would say to the landlords that where someone is over 60 or alternatively with an extremely low fixed income and without the prospects of augmenting it in any way, the rent for the property which they own and which they rent can only be increased in any given year by the percentage increase in the social welfare allowance in the same year.  That would prevail while that tenant was alive.  At the end of that time the property would revert in full vacant possession to the owning landlord.  I am sure that is outrageously unconstitutional.  I make no apology for it.  It is the correct social policy.  It is one of the kinds of social policy for which I was elected to the House.  The view has been expressed by more than one person that even in its present form section 9 is likely to be <Col N="1500" /> deemed unconstitutional.  Why not test it and try to get some degree of substantial protection for the categories of tenants who are uniquely vulnerable?  I am concentrating my argument exclusively and perhaps with a certain degree of repetition on that category of persons in the full knowledge that there are other categories both of landlords and of tenants who have other problems.  But the most vulnerable and most urgent case &mdash; we are talking about emergency legislation &mdash; is the one I have identified.  I suggest to the Minister that he consider very seriously the proposal I have put before him.  We must confront the emerging conflict between the role of legislators who get a mandate from the ballot box.  There are only about 26 countries in the world who have such a form of Government. We are not increasing in number within the family of nations represented at the United Nations.  It is a very sacred form of Government.</P>
    <P>The mandate from the ballot box was to do things which we are constrained from doing because of the provisions of the Constitution.  I am taking the most benign view of that Constitution, the people who signed it and the generation of Irish people who enacted it when they voted for it in 1936-1937 and we would be holding faith with their intentions if we took the progressive social interpretation of the Constitution which I am offering today in contrast to the rather narrow and conservative interpretation that the courts have placed on it from time to time.  It is our responsibility to move on this issue.  It is not just this legislation which will be in conflict with the provisions of Article 43 and the interpretation placed upon it but the legislation which this Government are committed to in relation to urban building land will undergo exactly the same gauntlet of arguments for and against.</P>
    <P>I will close on the following agrument of a generalised nature.  This country, within the EEC and even allowing for the proposed enlargement of the Community to take in Spain and Portugal, has a faster rate of population growth than the existing nine members.  A greater percentage of our population are under the ages of <Col N="1501" /> 15 and 25.  We are urbanising at a rate faster than any other State in Europe and there is constant conflict between our social needs, in some areas verging on Third World characteristics, and those of a developed European Community State.  We are faced daily with the conflict between the social and political obligations to deal progressively and effectively with the demands of such a state and the constraints imposed by the judicial interpretation of the Constitution.  I do not believe that we can meet the basic objective set out in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, to provide shelter for everybody at a cost they can by and large afford if we adhere to the narrow interpretation of private property as outlined in the interpretation of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>To change the Constitution is far from easy.  We are by nature a rather conservative people.  But on those of us who feel that we have enough experience as members of local authorities and of the Oireachtas to give leadership to the people there is an obligation to try to take the people with us, conservative and all as they may be, on this question.  The majority in any community hall or of any audience in any county, presented with the arguments that I have presented, would accept the need to respond along the lines on which I have argued.  It is through ignorance, fear and lack of clear understanding of the implications and restrictions which the interpretation of the Constitution imposes upon us that the people are reluctant to accept changes.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is a substantial political constituency that would passionately and vehemently defend the interest of the landlord.  I do not see it and I certainly do not hear it.  If there is, then we as politicians and certainly the Labour Party are prepared to take on that constituency and confront it with the reality of the difficulties of meeting basic social needs such as housing and other forms of shelter, which we will need to do in the next 18 years.</P>
    <P>In 1910, around the turn of the century, 20 per cent of the population lived in what we describe as urban areas, towns <Col N="1502" /> with the census definition of 1,500 people or more.  At present approximately 55 per cent of the population live in urban areas.  By the end of the century, which is now only 18 years away, at least 80 per cent of the population &mdash; the estimates vary between 70 per cent and 80 per cent &mdash; will live in urban areas.  We have not the slightest hope of responding to the complex needs for shelter and urban infrastructure of various kinds if we do not deal with the question of urban building land and housing as set out in this legislation.  We cannot go on pretending that somehow or other some legal genius, some legal expert with all the wisdom of King Solomon, can come up with a formula of words that will be able to reconcile the circle and the square and will give to the landlord full market value rent and give to the homeless, give to the Mrs. Murphys, a degree of security of tenure or a house at a price their daughter or son-in-law could possibly afford.  That is the clear stark choice facing this House and facing society.  It is a dilemma in which we find ourselves.  This is not imposed upon us by the bankers of Zurich.  It is not announced to us by the oil cartel of OPEC.  This is an internal constraint that does not fall under any decree of common policy operated from Brussels.  It is not subject to any provisions in the Treaty of Rome.  This is one of the few areas left in our society where we have total and exclusive control over our own destiny.  The issue hinges entirely on getting a new definition of the balance between the clear and necessary rights of private property, which are not in dispute, and the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>The argument must be initiated here, must start from here, must be led from here, and must be provoked from here until some time in the future when we have a Supreme Court that recognises the pressures I talk about and will come forward and say the exigencies of the common good enable such legislation to be valid in the eyes of the justices of the court and under the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are two tasks which we have embarked upon here on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> One is the technical one of dealing with the consequences of a Supreme Court ruling and the other is the political one. I do not profess and I never have attempted to profess to be a legal or a Constitutional expert.  I do not have those skills.  I recognise that other people have them.  But if we leave the task exclusively to the technocrats in the Attorney General's office, in the Department of the Environment or in the parliamentary draftsman's office, they will come forward with a technical solution that will pass the test of Constitutional acceptability and fail totally on the test of political acceptability.  That is the conflict, stark and clear.</P>
    <P>There will be a test of one kind or another of section 9.  That is conceded by everybody in the House.  Either the Government may decide in their wisdom to ask the President to review it or the President and the Council of State may decide under their own power to review it.  If neither action occurs the people who initiated the legal action from three years ago have now got their tails up sufficiently to do it and within a very short while a writ will be issued and legal proceedings initiated with a view to having the constitutionality of section 9 tested in the courts.  I suggest to the House that that is what will happen.  Willy-nilly we will find ourselves yet again arguing the case before the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Do we really want to be in court defending the rather lame and miserable provision of section 9 as set out here?  Is that the extent of the protection that we, as an Oireachtas, as a group of Senators representing different political parties, want to give to those tenants who are totally vulnerable?  For my part and that of my party that is not the case and I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that having regard to the more general argument which I, with the forbearance of the House, put on record here today about the undoubted conflict between the interpretation of private property rights in the Constitution and their implication for social policy in society, we must clearly articulate in section <Col N="1504" /> 9 a much more balanced and protective view for tenants.</P>
    <P>That argument is already accepted in principle by the Minister and the Government. In his introductory speech the Minister referred to the fact that the Department of Social Welfare would have to respond to the needs of tenants who will be adversely affected.  The Government made a commitment in the introduction of this legislation and he was re-affirming this commitment, but building into this legislation commitments in relation to the Department of Social Welfare was not possible.  Therefore, what would stay on the record of the House was a general commitment unspecified in terms of money on the one hand and at the same time specific legislation.  Three, four or five years ago I might have accepted the equal value of those two positions.  I am somewhat wiser now and I realise that when it comes to the courts the arguments of points of law centre exclusively on what has been enacted by the politicians and, by way of precedent, what has been decided by the court. Statements made by politicians, be they Ministers of State or otherwise, during the passage of legislation are of very secondary and limited value in contrast to the enacted law and the case history that goes with it.</P>
    <P>Unless we can build into the legislation clearer protection for the tenant, explicitly phrased and embodied in the legislation, the Supreme Court will not be able to adjudicate clearly and properly in the way that I hope it might.  I fully recognise the pressures which are behind this legislation.  I fully recognise the constraints that the Minister and the officials have had to operate under.  The solution which has emerged, with the best of intentions, will fall between two stools. While I welcome the response of the Government and support the Second Stage, I strongly suggest to the Minister that review be given at Committee Stage of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a rather disturbing tendency which I see emerging from the Custom House on every occasion that they get their hands on legislation.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> The Bill gives the Minister the power to make regulations for the registration and standards of all rented dwellings. It is intended that regulations for the registration of all controlled dwellings will be in operation fron the commencement of this legislation.  Registration will be central to the operation of the procedures envisaged under the Bill since the new rent becomes payable only after registration.  The regulations prescribing standards for rented dwellings are intended to replace by-laws under section 70 of the Housing Act 1966 which are at present operated by some housing authorities.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister kindly explain to me who is in the Custom House or what body of opinion is in the Custom House that automatically thinks on every occasion that somehow or other they know better than the officials at local authority level? What kind of demonic colonialist attitude prevails in the Custom House that seems to suggest that local authority officials and local councillors are, by definition, incapable of establishing their own local priorities or drawing up housing regulations and, therefore, cannot be trusted and that somehow or other the know all wise officials and the Ministers who occupy the Custom House, irrespective of party political affiliation, can somehow do the job better?  It is an extraordinary arrogance to presume that the officials of Dublin Corporation, which has been in operation longer than the Department of the Environment, are somehow less well equipped to draft housing regulations.  It is an extraordinary presumption by any responsible politician to think that in consort with his technical advisers he will draw up regulations which will be more finely tuned to the needs of either Phibsboro', Ranelagh, Finglas or Sandymount than would the local officials and the local councillors who represent those areas.</P>
    <P>In the last four years the Oireachtas has seen the consistent rolling back of local autonomy and local democracy in all legislation emanating from the Custom House.  I find this totally and utterly unacceptable.  I do not know what the motivation for it is.  God knows, when <Col N="1506" /> the Custom House have to administer matters over which they have taken full control they do not do as well as the local authorities would have done.  Let us not dwell on the nightmare of house improvement grants.  Every public representative in the House knows the Gilbert and Sullivan pantomine that went on in O'Connell Bridge House in relation to that saga.  It would be funny if it were not extremely sad.  It got to the stage when even the Minister of State was locked out by the porter in the building because of the chaos that was generated in the early part of 1980.  I am saying this in a lighter vein to the fundamental points I have already made.</P>
    <P>My mind goes back in memory to the many hours that I, along with Senator Alexis FitzGerald, spent on the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation drafting regulations for private rented accommodation, looking at the reality of rented accommodation on the ground in areas that we both represented, like Ranelagh and Rathmines and as recently as three weeks ago at a residents' association meeting we listened to the response of responsible citizens who give their free time to work in a residents' association. How somebody in the Custom House, who would not even know where the streets are or what the housing situation is like and who complains of being overloaded with work, would do this better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am directing all my comments to the Minister and I do it with some regret.  There is no personal animosity involved as the Minister well knows but somewhere buried in the political <i>corpus</i> of the Custom House, somewhere soaked into the plasterwork of the ministerial office and the Minister of State's office, there is a kind of odorous centralisation that invariably begins to affect all incumbents.  That is a symptom of bureaucracy and there is absolutely no necessity for it.  First of all, it will take weeks and months for the work to be <Col N="1507" /> done.  Secondly, the regulations prescribing the standards for rented dwellings are intended to replace by-laws under section 70 of the Housing Act.  It may come as a surprise to the Minister but those by-laws were actually approved by the Department. They went up to the Department. In local authority legislation the Minister has the right to approve of virtually everything and this applies also to the Minister for Finance.  Local government in itself is a euphemism.  Effectively we have local administration with democratic councils who are consulted every so often by the county manager.  Let us not even talk about local government. Virtually everything that they do has to be approved by the Minister.  In this instance, the regulations that are to be replaced were approved as recently as 1975.</P>
      <P>Has there been some revolution in thinking at the Custom House in relation to the administration of private rented accommodation that would require their replacement?  It is incredible.  I have a healthy respect for the political commitment both of the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment.  I also have a very clear idea of the enormous workload that both they and their officials have to undertake to make the present baggage of responsibility function. What are they doing taking on more when they will leave redundant people in local authorities, who can do the job more effectively, more efficiently and with the greatest degree of fine timing to the peculiar requirements of the locality in which the housing regulations are going to be applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister either to drop that section or let it expire but much more important, since it is only four weeks since he took office I ask him to get the relevant insecticide or pesticide that would be needed to cleanse and delouse the Custom House from the kind of atmosphere of pervasive centralisation which has characterised all of its legislation in the last five years.  The local government financial provisions legislation and the last Housing Act ensure that everything goes to the Custom House to <Col N="1508" /> cause unnecessary delay and confusion and to create an entirely new growth industry of public representatives writing to the private offices of the Ministers, and ministerial secretaries devising formulae of words that can be used in standard replies such as thanking the public representative for being interested in the matter and so on.  I believe that is something that should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have lightened the tone from my earlier contribution by digressing into that area.  I take the whole question of local government decentralisation of powers and responsibilities very seriously. I hope the Minister will respond to the points I have made.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister and the Government, and indeed this House, to recognise what is the nub of the political argument in this entire matter and to grasp the nettle very firmly on behalf of the people who need it most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">

      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister of State is here and will be dealing with this matter as legislation is processed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe in dealing with the Minister of State concerned, we are dealing with a man of great commitment and industry.  If there is a way to find a solution to this problem he will play a great role in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the concerns expressed by Senator Quinn a few minutes ago are concerns I share.  We are dealing with an extremely sensitive problem.  We are dealing not just with an urgent social problem to which the Minister of State referred earlier but are catching up with the extremely grave repercussions of the Rent Restrictions Act on property and on the very important area of the housing stock through the many years in which the Rent Restrictions Act has been operating.  I say that in the interests both of the landlord and tenant.  The housing stock in which so many old people live has been deteriorating over many decades and for many of the people the conditions are appalling.  New standards are required in this area.  I hope there will be an increased amount of accommodation as a result of the passage of this Bill <Col N="1509" /> and the recent result of the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the opportunity to examine the motion that has been put before it.  The problem referred to in the motion, as Members of the House will understand, is a problem which has been occupying the Government since last July and where we can define three main areas of the problem.</P>
      <P>The first segment of the problem is the obvious problem we have in relation to farm incomes which is a matter I will dwell on in a little more detail in a few minutes. It is one part of the problem of which we must be aware.  The second part relates to the volume of farm output.  It is here we have run into a certain number of difficulties over the last couple of years which are serious not only in their direct effects on the incomes of our farming population but have very serious implications also in other sectors of the economy, in the agri-business sector and on a wider basis than that and which also affect the level of our export earnings and, therefore, our balance of payments problem. The third part of the problem which I think we must address ourselves to relates to the decline we have seen in our livestock breeding herds particularly over the past two years.  This is the cause of part of our problem in relation to the volume of agricultural output but it is so important it merits particular attention as a separate part of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties that we experience now are not, of course, new.  The problems I <Col N="1510" /> have referred to have been building up over the past three years.  It is very important we should realise that because it has obvious implications for the kind of measures we can take in order to deal with those problems.  We have gone from a situation in which during the period 1973 to 1978 we saw rapid increases in farm incomes and indeed an increase in the total volume of farm output, to a very different situation in 1979 and 1980 in particular, where we had falling output and falling incomes both in nominal terms and in real terms.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the volume of agricultural output continued to fall but owing to a conjunction of other circumstances we have had a stabilisation of real income levels for our farm families.  During 1979 and 1980, we saw a more rapid increase in costs of farm production than in the prices being received for farm output.  In 1979, output prices increased by 5.9 per cent over the year whereas input prices increased by 12½ per cent.  In 1980, output prices declined by 2.7 per cent but input prices continued to grow at a rate during that year of 14½ per cent.</P>
    <P>This sharp divergence between the trend of output prices and that of input prices created the classic cost/price squeeze which gave rise to very severe pressure on farm incomes and the kind of drop in farm incomes over those two years to which I have already referred. The size of that drop can be appreciated by looking at what happened to consumer prices in those years.  In 1979, the consumer price index increased by 13 per cent and in 1980 it rose by 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to this cost/price squeeze we have had a decline in the level of output to which I have already referred. Taking 1975 as the base year at 100, the volume of gross agricultural output in 1978 was 111.5; in 1979, 110.6; in 1980, 110.7, which was no change, and in 1981, 108.3.  There lies one of the main roots of the problem which we have at the moment.  In addition, during 1979 and 1980 there was a serious amount of de-stocking particularly in our cattle herds and this resulted, for example, in our cattle breeding herd falling from 2.368 million head in 1979 to 2.245 million head <Col N="1511" /> in 1980, a drop of 123,000 in our basic cattle breeding herd.  At the same time, there was an increase in the use of certain farm materials on farms from 1978 onwards at a time when the volume of output on farms was declining.</P>
    <P>Again I refer to the volume figures. Taking 1975 as the base year at 100, in 1978 the volume of farm materials used was 147.5; in 1979, the volume increased to 175.2; in 1980, it declined to 153.2, which was, nevertheless an increase over the 1978 level; and in 1981 there was a further increase to 159.3.  This has added to the effects of the cost/price squeeze. This is a problem which merits particular attention.  If we have a situation where the volume of output is declining and the volume of input is increasing, obviously we must be very concerned about it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why this might be happening on individual farms. It is perfectly conceivable, for example, that at the beginning of a particular year a farmer might have planned to buy in a certain number of cattle and would, therefore, have planned his feed and fertiliser purchases to cater for that level of activity on his farm.  He might then have found that it was not possible for one reason or another to get that level of stocking on his farm and might, therefore, have found himself during the year overstocked with feed and fertilisers. That kind of situation obtaining on any kind of a wide basis throughout the country would have created to some extent a divergence between the trend in the use of inputs and the trend in the volume of outputs.  In my view that alone is not a sufficient explanation of these divergent trends.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the point straight away that in pointing out this trend and drawing attention to something which as I have said is a very worrying factor, I am not making the point nor am I suggesting that there has been any large-scale mismanagement on farms or that there has been any large-scale wasteful use of money on farms.  I can see what might be some of the explanations for this divergence between the trend in inputs and the trend in outputs but I am not sure we <Col N="1512" /> know all the causes.  Equally, until we have examined this in greater detail than has been possible up to now, we will not be able to make as good an effort at redressing the situation as we would like to make.  This is a feature which we need to examine, and which is being examined closely by my Department, and if we find explanations as to why these things have happened then we can deal with them in a reasonable way.  I will be very happy to do so and the farming community would also like to know the explanation for these trends.</P>
    <P>The problem as I have outlined it has been building up over the past three years.  It is only reasonable to point out that given that kind of background to the problem it is realistic to say that we cannot solve that problem in the space of a few months.  The causes of the problem are fairly deep-rooted and they require action extending over a period in order not simply to eliminate the causes but to turn around the trends in output, in inputs and in incomes to which I have referred and to get ourselves back into a situation where we can look with some confidence for an increase in the volume of output, for an increase in the margins being earned by farmers on what they produce and, therefore, for an increase in the level of farm incomes.</P>
    <P>A number of instant solutions have been put forward in recent months and it is worth looking at some of them in order to see what kind of contribution they could make.  One area of instant solution that has been put forward relates to a devaluation either of our green currency rate or a straightforward devaluation of our currency.  It would be useful if I were to indicate to the House some of the considerations which have led the Government to take the view they have taken in relation to these two matters.</P>
    <P>Taking first the question of a devaluation of our green currency rate, I would have to say that were we to propose such a thing at the moment we would be proposing to pursue a course of action diametrically opposed to that which successive governments here have followed in relation to green currencies since 1973. The House will recall that our national <Col N="1513" /> aim in relation to green currencies during that period has always been to reduce the gap between our green currency rate and our market currency rate.  The normal situation over that period was that our green currency rate used in the conversion of EEC prices and aids of various kinds into Irish currency tended normally to be above the market rate because our currency tended to devalue over that period.  Successive Irish Governments have made the point that the proper thing to do was to align the two rates by bringing the green currency rate closer to the market rate of the currency.</P>
    <P>We have a different situation at the moment.  Were we now to propose a devaluation of our green currency rate, we would be proposing to create a new gap between the market rate of our currency and the green rate.  We would be proposing to bring the green rate down below the market rate and that is the opposite of the policy that we have followed in this country since 1973.  Without having put the question, I am quite sure that the reaction among our partners in the European Community and, indeed, in the Commission would be one that would be completely negative in this regard and would, again, be inconsistent with a number of things which we have been doing over the past few months and which we will continue to press in the forthcoming price discussions in the Community, one of those things being that we want to reduce monetary compensatory amounts now being applied in other countries which, in our view, are a hindrance to exports from this country to our partners in the European Community. For those reasons a devaluation in our green currency rate, attractive though it may seem, appears to me not to be a real option at this point.</P>
    <P>The other question is, of course, the more general question as to whether we should seek to bring about a devaluation of the general market exchange rate of our currency.  This was a question we were faced with last October during the realignment of exchange rates within the European Monetary System.  At that time given what was going on in relation to the other currencies in the system and, <Col N="1514" /> indeed, our own economic situation here, the Government took the view that it was not the right moment and we were not in the right circumstances to justify a devaluation of our market rate relative to all of the other currencies in the European Monetary System.  There are a number of reasons for that and I will refer only to some of the agricultural arguments in that connection.</P>
    <P>A devaluation of our currency or, indeed, of the green rate would bring apparent immediate benefits in terms of the value in this country of EEC price supports and various aids.  A devaluation of our currency would bring about the same result if we were to ensure that our green rate stayed in alignment with the market rate.  It would also bring about certain costs on the agricultural side to the extent that our farmers use imported materials, raw materials, machinery and so on, and they would feel the effects of a devaluation in terms of an increase in the prices they would have to pay for those imported inputs.  This is something that we should bear in mind particularly since we are at a time of the year now when farmers tend more to be buying inputs than to sell outputs.  The least one could say is that the risk would be that the ill-effects of a devaluation on farm incomes would be felt at this point more quickly that the benefits in terms of increases in farm prices since we are in what is more a buying period than a selling period. When we add those arguments to arguments of a more general economic nature, we come to the conclusion that a devaluation of our currency is not an option that we would follow at this time to deal with the problem we have to deal with in the agricultural sector.  I would make the point that indeed I have been saying this since last September.  Some of those who have been putting forward devaluation as a solution to the problem appear since last week to have taken the points I was making and now say that they would look at it only as a last resort. We are not at a point yet where we need to resort to the last resort to deal with the problems before us.</P>
    <P>Another one of the instant solutions being put forward is that we should borrow <Col N="1515" /> substantial amounts of money abroad to inject into the agricultural sector of the economy.  I would make the point straightaway that the Government have no objection in principle or in practice to borrowing abroad for productive purposes.  However, we have to deal with a problem which exists, which is the problem of servicing an already high level of foreign indebtedness.  The servicing of foreign debt is taking up a substantial proportion of our current tax revenue. That being the case, the servicing of existing foreign debt puts a number of constraints upon the Government in terms of what they are able to do with the remainder of current revenue, either for current purposes within the economy or to support measures to help the productive sectors of the economy.  Given the problems we have at present this does not seem to be the moment to incur further large increases in foreign borrowing because that would further constrain our ability to do the kind of things we want to do within this country.</P>
    <P>That is a very broad review of the problems that we face and of some of the less likely solutions that have been put forward.  I would like now to illustrate what has been done to meet the problem since we took office last July.</P>
    <P>Almost the first thing we did was to lay before the Oireachtas the first Supplementary Estimate for agriculture of £35 million, prepared by the last Governfent before they left office, which we, of course, proceeded to pass through the Oireachtas in order to ensure that we could continue with the programmes that were in operation at that stage.  We then announced a series of measures in the July mini-budget which were aimed at implementing points outlined in the Government's programme and which we believe would make a contribution to solving part of the problem with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>We first of all secured agreement and then brought into operation an EEC interest subsidy scheme which applies to borrowings contracted by development farmers for investments eligible for aid <Col N="1516" /> under the farm modernisation scheme. This scheme provides for a 5 per cent interest subsidy in respect of outstanding borrowings for those purposes.  That scheme came into operation on 1 September and so far the response to that scheme has been satisfactory after a relatively slow start.  It is clear that that scheme does not apply to all investments made by farmers.  The essential point is that it applies to those investments for which farmers have already got grant aid if they are working on development plans and it will apply to new investments carried out under the terms of existing or new development plans entered into by farmers.  It represents a substantial reduction in the rate of interest to be paid on the loans in question.  Even though it may not cover the whole of a farmer's borrowing, and in many cases it does not, nevertheless it represents a useful contribution to those borrowings which he needs to undertake in order to carry out the development plan which he has agreed to carry out.</P>
    <P>Another measure which we announced in July which equally came into operation on 1 September was a reduction in the rate of value added tax on contractors' charges from 10 per cent to 3 per cent. Members of the House will know that this has been a matter of controversy for some time, not only among the farming community themselves but among the agricultural contractors who felt that the level of value added tax on their services in the circumstances made it difficult for them to continue in business.  We have reduced the rate of value added tax there and that came at a useful time for farmers when many of them were coming to the point where they would be buying substantial amounts of services from contractors in the harvest period.</P>
    <P>Another measure which we took at that time was to increase the flat rate value added tax reimbursement for farmers to offset the effects of the increases in the basic value added tax rate on those farm inputs which are subject to VAT. We increased the flat rate compensation from 1 per cent to 1½ per cent.  On the basis of the information we have in relation to volume and prices of farm outputs and equally of farm inputs, I am fairly <Col N="1517" /> confident at the moment that the new 1½ per cent rate compensates adequately for the element of value added tax included in farmers' input costs.</P>
    <P>Finally, in July we announced an increase in the rates of grants under the sheep headage scheme.  Total increase in expenditure under this head would be in the region of £2.5 million this year and all of that expenditure will go into areas in the western part of the country where there was a clear farm-income problem and farm incomes were already low before we got into the problem that has emerged over the last three years.  Those were the first measures that we took in order to respond to the problems that we found on taking office.</P>
    <P>More recently we introduced a second Supplementary Estimate for agriculture of £37 million.  Some of the more notable features in this Supplementary Estimate included provision of £3 million to finance a national interest subsidy scheme which will provide for non-development farmers a level of interest subsidies equivalent to that provided under the EEC scheme for development farmers. We provided an amount of £3 million under that scheme for this year.  The cost in a full year would be somewhat more than that.  In addition, that second Supplementary Estimate included a provision of £8 million extra for aids to farmers in less favoured areas in order to maintain in operation the various headage schemes that are in existence and a further provision of £13.3 million to cover expenditure under the farm modernisation scheme including the western measures and the EEC interest subsidy scheme.  Therefore, between the measures we took in July and the other measures taken and reflected in the second Supplementary Estimate we have already begun to implement a number of points set out in the Government's programme and which address directly the problems that I have been outlining here.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have made further progress in the sense that we have got EEC approval for a series of three national aids that deal with problems with which the House will be familiar.  The first is a national aid for second-time silage <Col N="1518" /> makers.  That is for people who last year, 1980, benefited from the EEC aid for first-time silage makers.  That scheme was continued this year in order to provide extra encouragement for people who made silage for the first time in 1980 to make sure that they continue making silage. We are trying to ensure that more and more farmers get into the habit of making silage because it seems on all the advice we have that it is a very good method of conserving winter feed and one which should be more widely followed throughout the country.  The schemes in question have shown that it is possible and viable to make silage in areas of the country where silage-making had not been the practice up to now.</P>
    <P>The second measure is a subsidy of £30 per ton for one ton per farm of nitrogenous fertilisers announced earlier this year.  The third measure is designed to encourage further increase in our breeding herd.  I refer to the scheme which provides for a £70 subsidy next year in the form of an interest subsidy in relation to extra breeding heifers kept on farms in June of next year compared with June of this year.  I would like to say a few words on this because there has been considerable public discussion of the measure and what it constitutes.</P>
    <P>The previous Government announced their intention to pay a £60 subsidy on extra heifers in the herd.  Part of our Government's programme was to pay £100 subsidy, £60 of which would be paid in 1982 and the remaining £40 two years later.  Our intention was to bring in a measure which would ensure that extra heifers brought into the herd in 1982 would be retained.  This is a national aid measure funded from national resources which would have an effect on the level of our breeding herd and, therefore, on the volume of our production.  That being the case, it is necessary for us to clear that measure with the EEC authorities and with the Commission.  Immediately on taking office I took the matter up with the Commission authorities and during the discussions which I had with them I found a certain reluctance simply to allow the measure to go ahead in the form in which we had put it forward.  A number <Col N="1519" /> of suggestions were made to me as to other ways in which we might go about achieving the result we desired but my view was that we needed a specific measure that would directly tie an increased aid to an increase in the number of breeding animals in the herd.  The agreement we reached finally was that we would be able to pay £70, not £60, in 1982 and that it should take the form of an interest subsidy.  My intention will be that that subsidy should be paid, if at all possible, on every extra heifer in our breeding herd in June of next year compared with June of this year.  The original measure which we put forward was part of a four-year programme to bring about an increase in our breeding herd.  The measure which we now have in operation is a one-year measure which will apply in 1982.</P>
    <P>That is not by any means the end of the story.  It is still my intention to carry on with a four-year programme to expand our breeding herd.  We have the first part of it in operation.  I will be taking up the remaining part of the first subsidy during the course of the forthcoming price discussions in the EEC and in future years I will be taking up the continuation of that measure or a measure that will have equivalent effect to ensure that we will get the kind of increase in our breeding herd that we want to bring about.</P>
    <P>I referred to the national interest subsidy which we brought into operation. That is a 5 per cent interest subsidy scheme which is parallel to the EEC interest subsidy.  As I said, those subsidies will not cover all of the problems for a number of farmers who have serious financial difficulties at the moment.  My concern is to ensure that farms which are basically commercial units capable of providing a decent living for a farming family should be able to stay in production and I am looking at measures which will enable us to achieve that aim.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware from press reports and so on that a separate discussion is going on between myself and the lending institutions in order to arrive at this result.  Those discussions have not yet been concluded and I cannot say when they will be concluded.  The intention <Col N="1520" /> of the measure being discussed is to ensure that farmers in serious financial difficulty will be enabled to overcome their immediate problem in order to stay in production and think again in realistic terms about expanding production.  In this respect we must recognise that some farmers are facing serious financial difficulty, not because of mismanagement or bad lending or borrowing decisions, but for the simple reason that farm plans which can show a profit when money is available at 10 or 12 per cent may very quickly become unprofitable when interest goes to 19 per cent.  That problem has afflicted farm enterprises over the last couple of years just as much as it has afflicted production enterprises in other sectors of the economy.  We must recognise and deal with this problem to the best of our ability, not only for the sake of the farm families involved but also for the sake of all those people whose livelihood depends directly or indirectly on agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the measures which we have taken and one which we are in the process of negotiating at the moment.  I talked about the price cost squeeze.  We need to do two things in order to get out of that.  The first is to tackle inflation, to find a means of reducing the rate of increase in costs of inputs and the cost of living for our farm families. This Government are committed to that and further measures to deal with it will be forthcoming.  We must also look at the price side of that equation.  In this connection I am looking at our approach to the Brussels farm price review which will begin early in the New Year when the Commission publishes its price proposals. I will be looking for as much increase as I can possibly get from that discussion, in the grand tradition of every Minister for Agriculture we have had since 1973 when we joined the Community. In addition, I will be looking for other complementary measures, as they are called, to deal with problems which we have which do not apply either at all or to the same degree in other member states of the EEC.  I have already told Commissioner Dalsager that that is my intention, and he was not surprised to <Col N="1521" /> learn that.  We will be discussing and approaching the price proposals with that in mind.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say at this point how much one wants to look for.  Therefore I will not go further into that.  Even if I knew what the figure was I would not say it too loudly.  You do not start such negotiations by showing your hand in advance.</P>
    <P>Another reason for being cautious about saying what we are looking for, which is related to policy in the EEC, is that we are still in the middle of a discussion on the mandate of 30 May.  One of the elements in that discussion is an effort on the part of some of our partners to ensure that the rate of increase in expenditure on the common agricultural policy is not greater than the rate of increase in the total budgetary availabilities of the EEC and a desire on the part of some interests in the Community to ensure that we fix the total amount of spending on the CAP at or about its present level.  We must view that development with very serious disquiet.</P>
    <P>At the European Council in November and at meetings since then, the latest on 15 December, and a forthcoming meeting around the middle of January, we have been and will be ensuring that that kind of development will not come about. We need to be sure that within the European Community the conditions exist for us to be able to continue to expand our agricultural production at whatever price levels we manage to get agreement on during the course of the annual price negotiations.  I am very conscious that as an exporting country we need to be sure that whatever measures should be taken within the EEC to sustain an expansion in agricultural production in a country like ours are taken and that our hands are not tied in advance by artificial or autonomous limitations on the amount of funds being made available to support the common agricultural policy.  That is one of the priority areas of activity which we are following at the moment.</P>
    <P>I pointed out the problem and what we are doing in order to remedy it.  In spite of the fact that we have come through <Col N="1522" /> three very difficult years in agriculture, I still take the view that we have not come to the end of the road.  We still have a sound basis for further expansion in agricultural production.  We have seen this year at least a halt to the decline in farm incomes.  The final results for this year will probably show that in money terms total farm income will have risen by somewhere in the region of 20 per cent or, in other words, that total farm income will be in real terms at about the same level in 1981 as it was last year.  That, perhaps, is not the result we would wish to see but it is an improvement over the decline we have seen in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Something which is easily forgotten in the kind of debate that has been going on for the last few months about the difficulties we have in agriculture is that a very substantial amount of investment has been carried out on farms in this country, particularly under the farm modernisation scheme.  That infrastructure is available to sustain increases in production in the years ahead.  Some discussion which takes place would almost lead one to the conclusion that all of the investment up to now on farms in terms of improvement in farm buildings, construction of new farm buildings and land improvement has been lost.  It has not.  It is there to sustain increases in output over the coming years.  With a continuation of the kind of measures that we have introduced I am confident that we will see increases in production during years to come.  They will not, perhaps, be as rapid as we would wish but they will not be held back by any reluctance on the Government's part to follow the kind of measures that are needed in order to get us out of the problem we are in at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;is deeply concerned at the manner in which the Government is tackling the problem of the agricultural sector and calls for a halt to the decline in farmers' incomes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> In tabling this amendment I was concerned about the situation that our farmers find themselves in at present.  Not since the bad old days of the Economic War have we seen such gloom and despair in Irish agriculture.  Over the past few months we have seen the farmers, both big and small, marching and taking part in pickets on the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the banks.  We even had a sit-in at the headquarters of Fianna Fáil and at the Fine Gael headquarters here in the city and there were many other activities by which the farmers throughout the length and breadth of Ireland have shown or tried to highlight the situation that they find themselves in.  Much has been said about the bigger farmers who find themselves in trouble now because of the over-borrowing which took place over the past couple of years, and many of them are, unfortunately, in that situation.  Those are the leaders in the farming community; those are the people who led the way when times were good and decided to invest in the development of their land and decided to erect modern buildings and so on.  Also the farmers in the west have been affected seriously by the depression in agriculture over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>In October of this year the Agricultural Institute in their report revealed that income on western farms under 30 acres last year averaged £15 per week.  This means that the bulk of western farmers earned less than £1,000 in the year.  On farms in the 50-100 acres category income amounted to only £33 per week or £14 per week less than can be got by a married couple with two children on unemployment assistance.  Perhaps the western farmers have not been shouting loudly enough about the situation, but it is very serious.  They have not the chance to develop as other farmers in the better-off regions of the country might.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that money has been taken out of the two schemes that were launched principally for the development of the west and spent in other areas.  I refer, in particular, to the western drainage scheme which I launched in 1979 for the purpose of draining and reclaiming a <Col N="1524" /> quarter of a million acres in the west of Ireland.  This was one of the most forward-thinking schemes ever introduced into the west and for the first time it gave the western farmer the chance of developing his farm and reaching the same development potential as his counterparts in the rest of the country.  I am afraid that this scheme is grinding slowly to a halt and I am horrified to see that happen.  A sum of £1 million has been withdrawn from that scheme and I would appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, who is present and who is responsible for western development, to make sure that that scheme is protected and that it goes ahead and reaches the target which was set in 1979, which was to reclaim a quarter of a million acres of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the £300 million western development programme.  Here again, we see that £5 million has been taken out of that scheme.  This is disgraceful when western farmers are struggling on £15 a week as I have quoted earlier. This scheme was designed principally to help them to develop their farms and now money has been taken out of it by the Government.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the headage scheme.  We see the change that has been made in that scheme in recent times, particularly since this Government took over.  Many farmers this year who were relying on headage grants to pay off their debts found that they were not getting even as much as they got last year because of the changes made in the scheme this year by the Government.  Again, I would appeal to Minister of State Nealon, who appreciates the problems of the west, to have a look at that scheme and to restore it to what it was when we left office.</P>
    <P>During the general election Fine Gael in their election manifesto promised to restore farm incomes to the 1978 level as soon as possible.  Now, six months later, because of the inflationary policies being pursued by the Government, the position of our farmers has deteriorated seriously. The Government cannot continue to ignore the very serious situation of our biggest industry.  Fianna Fáil's objective in Government, as soon as the crisis in <Col N="1525" /> agriculture became apparent, was to restore farm incomes and to take measures that were necessary to bring back confidence into this vital sector of the economy.  No fewer than six different packages of farm support measures where announced between August 1980 and June 1981 &mdash; evidence indeed of Fianna Fáil's absolute commitment to the farming community. In August last year, faced with a disastrous storage situation, Fianna Fáil introduced subsidies for first-time silage makers and for nitrogen users.  These emergency measures succeeded in taking farmers over the winter without breakdown.  In October 1980, we took action to relieve rates on farmers below £60 rateable valuation.  We also succeeded in obtaining foreign loans at attractive interest rates and in getting the co-operation of the banks and the lending institutions in restructuring loans to farmers experiencing difficulties.  There was also extra finance for livestock headage grants and for the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>In the January budget, further progress was made in removing or relieving the rates bill of the vast majority of farmers. Full tax relief on stock and the removal of the disease eradication levies were also provided.  In March 1981, we succeeded in negotiating one of the most favourable farm price rises since we joined the EEC, providing an average price increase of almost 14 per cent.  There was also a special aid package, worth £52 million. providing fertilisers and silage subsidies and doubling beef suckler grants.  In April 1981 we obtained final agreement to the western development package which would provide £300 million to improve the infrastructure of farming in the western region over the next ten years.  In May 1981, Fianna Fáil provided a subsidy for in-calf heifers, a nitrogen fertiliser subsidy and a silage making subsidy. At the same time we obtained agreement in principle to 5 per cent interest subsidy for developing farmers, an aid for land drainage which the present Minister succeeded in having ratified by the EEC Council of Ministers after he took office.</P>
    <P>From this brief summary of our record it can be seen that we worked unremittingly <Col N="1526" /> and hard to achieve a situation where a reasonable rise in farm incomes for 1981 could be expected.  I am convinced that this Government have not yet come to grips with the problems of agriculture. Indeed, they have taken actions which are directly detrimental to farm incomes.  High interest rates at present are crippling farmers and this is one of the main causes of their income problems. When Fianna Fáil were in office they took action to keep interest rates down to 14½ per cent.  They have now risen to almost 20 per cent under the present Government.</P>
    <P>The budget measures which were introduced last July put inflation up by 5 per cent and hit hard at many of the things which farmers depend upon.  The Minister this afternoon outlined what he has done since he took office and spoke of the money provided for agriculture.  If the Minister in his Estimate and subsequent Supplementary Estimate provided this money, in the budget last July he succeeded in taking £75 million out of our farmers' pockets.  That is what it amounts to.  The 5 per cent increase in value-added tax succeeded in taking £75 million out of farmers' pockets.  The Minister has not yet balanced that by putting back into agriculture what he took out in the July budget.  On the day the 5 per cent interest subsidy was announced by the Coalition, a general rise in interest rates of 2 per cent was announced and also a cut in land reclamation and other grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  This cut-back of 5 per cent in grants under the farm modernisation scheme, as far as I am concerned and as far as the farmers are concerned, is a most retrograde step.</P>
    <P>Over the years, farmers have been trying to develop their farms, to provide modern buildings in which to accommodate their stock for the winter months, to build silage slabs, concrete their yards and so on.  This in turn created jobs in other industries.  It created jobs in the builders' suppliers and so on.  It created jobs for small building contractors.  Now there is a complete standstill in this kind of activity.  Farmers are no longer interested <Col N="1527" /> in developing their farms or in providing modern type buildings which we were so anxious to see them provide over the past few years.  This is because of the cut-back of 5 per cent under this scheme. It is a very retrograde step and I sincerely regret to see it happening at this time when we should be trying to instil a little confidence into the agricultural industry and trying to help farmers to forget about the depression and get out and work their farms.  Unfortunately, that is not the situation at present.  The measures taken earlier this year have helped in a small way to improve farm incomes.  However, the fall in the volume of gross and net output represents a major setback to the contribution by this sector to the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the disparity between incomes in farming and average earnings in industry is greater than at any time during the past 20 years.  Indeed, it is in this context that the role of agriculture in the economy must be looked at afresh. Agriculture is an important sector in our economy, earning foreign exchange and contributing to employment and income generation in the rest of the economy. These contributions come through a number of channels.  One, the agriculture sector is a major net exporter and thereby contributes to easing the balance of payments constraint on Government policy; two, it provides raw material for the food manufacturing sector; three, it purchases raw materials, capital inputs and services from the manufacturing and commercial sectors; four, it also purchases consumer goods and services from these sectors. Between 1970 and 1978 gross agricultural output in value terms grew by 21.9 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The effect of a continuation of this trend from 1978 to 1981 would be an increase in value of net exports in 1979 from £179 million to £336 million, in 1980 from £348 million to £458 million and in 1981 from £600 million to £790 million. The extra gross output if the 1970-78 trend in gross output had continued would be £360 million in 1979, £594 million in 1980 and £1,025 million in 1981.  From these figures, it is clear that the moderation in the <Col N="1528" /> rate of growth in the value of gross output since 1978 has had a major impact on the balance of trade.  In 1981, if the trend in the growth of value of output had been maintained, net agricultural output would have been £600 million to £790 million higher.</P>
    <P>The fall in the growth of output has had serious repercussions for aggregate living standards.  We have between £600 million and £800 million left to spend on capital and consumer goods imports.  This is a very serious loss to the country and if that kind of money were available to the Government at the present time they would be very happy because it would help them to solve many of the problems they are faced with at present.  On-farm employment has been declining in all countries in recent years, regardless of on-farm growth in output.  The main contribution which agriculture could make to employment is in the food processing sector and the farm services and input sectors.</P>
    <P>Increased farm incomes also have an impact on employment and incomes in sectors which sell consumer goods and services to farmers, such as the retail trade, the house building and improvement trade.  Over the past decade the  employed in the food sector has not increased relative to the rate of agricultural output.  In fact, the number has declined from 46,200 in 1973 to 43,990 in 1981.  Perhaps this is due to an improvement in technology, or greater efficiency in that particular sector.</P>
    <P>The meat industry is an area where many jobs could be created.  There is a demand for vacpacked meat, particularly in Germany.  There is no reason why this could not be expanded still further in Germany and, indeed, in the other European countries.  There is a great demand there for that particular type of trade and it is something which the Department of Agriculture and Córas Tráchtála should explore and develop still further.  Of course, it is important to supply top quality meat and also to guarantee continuity of supply, because if this does not happen then the market could be lost for all time.</P>
    <P>There are many people, particularly in the meat trade, who would like to see all <Col N="1529" /> our meat and all our cattle going through the factories and processed there.  Certainly, I would not favour that kind of situation and I do not think anybody involved in the cattle trade or anybody involved in farming would like to see the factories get the monopoly of this business. We all know how they treated the farmers back in 1973 and 1974, when markets were bad and when they had a monopoly.  They were not too kind to the farmers during that depressed period.  It is important that we would have competition within the trade.  That is the way it is at present and that is the way it should remain.  There is no reason why both could not be developed side by side.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been made as regards the method of improving farmers' incomes.  First would be higher prices for farm products; second, lower prices for farm inputs; third, increased farm output; fourth, more efficient use of surplus inputs and other resources; fifth, lower taxes on farmers or on farming; sixth, direct payment to farmers related to their farming activities and seventh, income from non-farming sources including social welfare.  We know, because of the basic principles of the common agricultural policy, that it would not be permissible for the Government to subsidise directly the prices payable to Irish farmers for farm products.  Possibly these prices could be increased by a devaluation of the Irish green £, but we have heard the Minister this evening outline his objection to that course of action. However, it is one area at which perhaps another look could be taken.  There seems to be a volume of opinion in favour of doing that and I would sincerely ask the Minister and the Minister of State to have another look at that situation to see if anything could be done there to secure an increase for the farmers.</P>
    <P>Lower prices for inputs, of course, could be achieved by subsidy.  In 1980 the cost of farm materials and agriculture expenses, exclusive of rates, amounted to £930 million.  A ten per cent subsidy on all these materials would cost £93 million. It may not be possible to give an across the board subsidy but certainly fertilisers and feeding stuffs should be <Col N="1530" /> subsidised.  In 1980 the expenditure on these materials was £316 million and £166 million, respectively.  Together they accounted for over half the value of farm materials and expenses.  We know that in this particular year the price of fertilisers is well outside the reach of most farmers. The price of fertilisers at the present time is prohibitive and there is no way in which farmers will be able to use the amount of fertiliser that they would like to.  Unfortunately, this is going to lead to further problems.  There is a strong case to be made here for subsidising fertilisers.  Certainly I would like to see that happening. I would plead with the Minister and the Minister of State to introduce some kind of a subsidy scheme to help farmers to purchase those fertilisers that are so necessary at this time in order to help to increase their output on the farms.</P>
    <P>We could go on making many suggestions as to how farmers' incomes could be increased at this point in time. Another area that could be explored would be a general increase in the rate of headage grants.  In order to do that, possibly it would be necessary to extend the severely handicapped areas in the country in order to recoup some of the costs from the EEC.  This, I realise, perhaps more than anybody else, is not too easily done.  Perhaps in the present situation where the incomes of farmers have dropped by about 60 per cent in the past three years, there is a good case to be made for a further extension of those severely disadvantaged areas in order to bring them in under the headage payments and for a general increase in those headage grants.  It would help, in a small way, to eliminate the present hardships. We all know individual cases of hardships, I am sure that the Minister has many files on his desk dealing with the problems of over-borrowing and so on. It is unfortunate that that situation should arise at this time because it is some of our best farmers, some of the leaders in the industry, who are caught in this situation and, unfortunately, they are not convinced that the Government are doing enough to help them.</P>
    <P>I hope that this debate this evening will help to highlight some of the problems <Col N="1531" /> that exist in Irish agriculture and that perhaps some suggestion will come out of the debate that might help the Minister to tackle this very serious problem.  If agriculture, our major industry, is declining then the whole country is going down with it.  We do not want to see that situation arise.  We want to see a thriving agricultural sector.  We want to see farmers having the same incomes as their counterparts in industrial employment. Unfortunately, that is not the situation at the moment and farmers have had to do things in the past few months that are not very popular, but they were necessary in order to highlight the problems that exist within the industry at this time.  I hope that in the not too distant future we will see better days ahead for all those people and that we will see a light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  I was greatly disappointed at the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, who concluded his speech by saying that those are some of the things that the Government are doing to get us over our problem.  In actual fact, he did not outline anything.  A speech such as that is an opportunity for him to outline in detail to this House, as he had an opportunity earlier in the Dáil, his plans for agriculture. He came in with a great blare of trumpets and I thought that he would outline for us whatever plan he envisaged for agriculture.  Instead, he mentioned a few &mdash; and a very few &mdash; measures which were introduced, measures which were only helpful to a very small section.  He did not mention a farm plan.  He did not mention land policy.  When you are discussing a farm plan, you have to discuss the general land policy and land structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in their last years of office, spent a lot of time and brought forward a White Paper on land policy.  There is no doubt that, had they been returned at the last election, in all probability we would be discussing now the land policy, a land policy designed to ensure the continuation of many farmers in, especially, the western and north-western regions, <Col N="1532" /> giving subventions to persons on small acreage and putting an embargo on those in the very high acreage bracket.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention during the course of his speech the farm retirement scheme, something that was introduced in 1976.  At that time I can remember asking the Department to send me over application forms in the belief that that scheme would serve its purpose and that it would ensure that many farmers would get an opportunity either to retire on a permanent basis or lease the land on a leasing system.  Where you have something like 500 applications in as many years, all we can say is that it was a failure and that it is one thing that would certainly need to be restructured.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the farmers will agree that we must have a farm plan and specialise in various aspects in particular areas.  They will have to develop to survive. The Minister mentioned a few of the measures he outlined in the July budget and in a Supplementary Estimate. He mentioned a subsidy scheme for development farmers, but here, as Senator Hussey mentioned, in 12 western counties the percentage of development farmers as against the total number of farmers is very small.  Many of them would not qualify.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that the rate of value-added tax was reduced. Here again, he mentioned specifically that the benefit would be in the harvest period.  The harvest period does not concern people in the 12 western counties because, in the constituency I come from myself you have only 3 per cent of the total acreage in crops.  He mentioned an increase of rates in the sheep headage scheme.  There again, only selected areas of the country would benefit.</P>
    <P>In the supplementary budget, the Minister was duplicating the Fianna Fáil proposals.  He mentioned the extension of the silage making subsidy and the extension of the subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers.  But if you compare the measures introduced in the autumn of 1980 with the measures introduced in 1981, it certainly will show you the imbalance and <Col N="1533" /> how little has been done this year for the farmers.  At that time £40 million was provided in the autumn of 1980.  The Minister also mentioned this £70 in-calf subsidy and how he expected that it would ensure an increase in our national herd.  One of the most serious problems facing agriculture at the present is that of ensuring an increase in the national herd. The Minister did not mention that applicants who qualified are persons who had borrowed to purchase.  It is an interest subsidy and I take it that you would have to be a purchaser to qualify for it.  If that is the case, I can see a very serious situation arising: because of the disease problem at present, it is generally accepted that it is safer for any farmer to keep a closed herd of his own and upgrade his own breeding stock than to purchase in. I can see that danger in this £70 in-calf subsidy.  Certainly any subsidy and any input are to be welcomed.  I see a problem here in that farmers who would not normally purchase in will not qualify and that certainly would create an anomaly.</P>
    <P>When discussing farming, one does not wish to departmentalise it but one must realise that farming in the 12 western counties is completely different from farming in Munster and Leinster.  Senator Hussey mentioned the possibility of treating the 12 western counties as severely handicapped and this should be examined so that farmers there would qualify for cattle headage payments. Under the terms of EEC Directives 159 and 268, member states are authorised to introduce special aids and incentives to encourage better farming and raise farm income.  One of the purposes of EEC Directive 75-268 is to encourage the continuation of farming in the poor and more remote areas of the country to help maintain the level of population and the preservation of the environment.  Under that directive I would hope that the Minister would make a very strong case to have the 12 western counties classified as severely handicapped to qualify for the headage payments.  There is an opinion abroad at present that if the entire 26 counties were declared severely handicapped and so qualified for such grants, that would be the quickest way to <Col N="1534" /> improve our national herd.  The criteria laid down in order to be classified as severely handicapped is that there is less productive land unsuitable for cultivation and used mainly for pasture and also the average farm income is appreciably less than the national average and the diminishing level of population depends mainly on agriculture.  The western counties fit into any of those criteria.</P>
    <P>In Cavan-Monaghan, where I come from, less than 3 per cent of the land is cultivated.  The main features of that part of the country are the predominance of drumlin soils and hilly land where it is extremely difficult to operate farm machinery so that cattle and milk production are the lines of farming.  In this area we have the longest winter and the shortest grass-growing season in the State, and over 50 per cent of all farms are less than 30 acres.  Compared to the rest of the State this is a very high percentage.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the benefits of silage making.  The importance of conserving winter feed in this way cannot be too greatly emphasised.  I would hope that incentives would be given, not only this year as they were last year, but in years to come, to ensure that as many farmers as possible would get into silage making.</P>
    <P>The situation facing us at present is that there are low milk yields and the national average for cows is very low.  We did not have the expected increase in milk production.  This is causing problems for the producers and also for our co-operatives.  Here again they had programmes to ensure that there would be an increase in the gallonage.  If that does not materialise, the overall price of milk will suffer.  The co-operative movement should be pursued.  It has not developed in Ireland to the degree that was indicated in the early days.  Over the years the country gave many prominent men to the co-operative movement, Paddy the Cope, Maurice Plunkett and Father Finley. To a great extent it has limited itself to the management of marts and creameries and, recently, meat plants.  In a highly competitive world a fresh look at the potential of the co-operatives is <Col N="1535" /> needed; co-operative farming could be followed through in many areas.  Many of the member states in the EEC have developed the co-operative movement to great advantage.  In regard to the western package we are all greatly concerned that there was a reduction of £5 million in the amount allocated in the Supplementary Estimate and in regard to the western drainage scheme there was a reduction of £1 million.  It is of great concern that in an area where we had hoped for development funds are curtailed at this time.</P>
    <P>Included in these measures was the calf to beef system.  If we want to improve our method of production, especially in the beef sector, we have to ensure a regular in-flow of cattle to the factories.  The only way we can do that is by way of some type of cantract system.  There is much criticism in regard to the export of live animals.  Here again there has to be a counterbalance to ensure that the producer gets the best possible remuneration for his work.  Certainly there is great potential for labour in the meat industry. It is really sad that when so much money has been expended and the IDA have been so generous in providing funds for the development of the meat plants and equipment, especially the very expensive equipment in those bone halls, that more use is not being made of them.  There again the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, provided assistance and aid in 1980 to ensure that as much beef as possible would be deboned and go out in that state and would so create as much employment as possible.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of fertilisers. The drop in fertiliser usage could be serious.  After the last war when money was scarce, advisory services and the co-operatives played a great part in ensuring that fertilisers would be available to farmers at a fairly low cost.  I remember, when I was associated with a co-operative, delivering 8 per cent basic slag to farmers from the quays in Dublin when the boats came in, at £4. 10s. a ton &mdash; that was before decimalisation &mdash; so that the farmers could build up the fertility of the soil. Fertiliser prices increased with inflation generally.  When grant aid was provided <Col N="1536" /> for the fertiliser industry in this country, especially NET, we thought we would be getting a good quality fertiliser at reasonable prices.  But fertiliser prices have rocketed over the last few years and this could result in a drop in usage which would seriously affect fertility.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas which could be developed.  In the Dail, Deputies were concerned about the importation of potatoes.  In the matter of fruit and vegetables, the Department of Agriculture should examine very carefully the situation where we have massive imports of fruit and vegetables which in many cases we could produce here and for which we have ideal conditions of climate and soil.  Increasingly over the last few years, not alone in regard to early potatoes but in regard to the main crops, we have had to contend with severe competition from imports.  This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Martin O'Donoghue said that farming was in need of an IDA-style body.  Farming is certainly in need of some injection of funds to ensure that as many families as possible can stay on the land.  Agriculture is our major source of revenue, employment and income.  It should be developed with all possible speed in all areas possible. We should be aiming at the time when we will no longer be importing products which we could produce here, giving employment and reducing the dole queues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator T. Hussey emphasised the damage that has been done to the economy by the present crisis in agriculture.  I could not agree with him more.  In approving of the manner in which the Government are handling this crisis we, on this side of the House, are not in any way trying to diminish the problem, which is, indeed, really stark. Output is down 7 per cent since 1978 and the average family farm income in 1980 was £3,700, only about half of the industrial earnings in the same year when one makes allowances for the number of labour units involved in the farm.  About 55,000 farms, or 38 per cent according to the survey in 1980, had incomes from <Col N="1537" /> farming of under £2,000 or £38 per week. There is no doubt that that is a crisis of immense proportions.</P>
      <P>Apart from the low income problem which has been documented, many farmers face serious problems with their borrowings. ACOT estimated that 6,000 farmers cannot meet their interest payments, and a further 4,000 farmers cannot meet interest and repayments jointly.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt on this side of the House that there is an immense problem but we must recall that the present crisis had its beginnings in 1979.  It started when prices obtainable for agricultural output began to slow down while input prices continued to forge ahead.  That slowdown in agricultural output was easy to forecast in advance.  There were quite identifiable reasons for it which could have been and should have been known by the then Government.  One was that the EEC transitional payments had comt to an end in 1978, and the second was that the Government opted to join the EMS.  The whole point of the EMS was that it was a stable currency regime which would bring about the end of the green pound devaluations which had the effect of giving agriculture, farmers, significant price increases.  In 1979, it was incumbent on the Government to plan for an orderly transition to what was going to be a tighter profit margin situation.  Indeed, they should have been attempting to forestall the worst effects of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will remind the House what the response of the Government was in 1979. They were worse than Nero who fiddled while Rome burned; they poured petrol on the flames and aggravated the problem in agriculture.  In the 1979 budget they introduced a series of measures that were tailor-made precisely to put the squeeze on profits.  There was a resource tax of £3.50 per £ of PLV; there was a 2 per cent levy on commodity production; there was a disease levy of £3 per beast and a halfpenny per gallon of milk; there was a milk quality levy; and there was an inspection levy at factories.  All of these measures were unique in that their payment was not related to the profits that the farmer was able to earn.  They were related either to output or to land, and <Col N="1538" /> their net effect was to squeeze profit margins. The introduction of those measures was a very badly informed action of the Government, when it was easily recognisable that prices were going to squeeze profit margins in farming.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Government allowed inflation to run away in the domestic economy.  This was provoked by their tendency persistently to spend beyond the revenue they were willing to raise in taxation.  They built up a steamhead of demand in the economy when it was not necessary, that caused the domestic inflationary pressures.  They also caved in to pay demands repeatedly when they should have stood firm.  In fact, the recent report of the Committee on Costs and Competitiveness illustrated just how bad the performance in 1978 to 1980 was.  Irish hourly earnings rose by 22 per cent while the hourly earnings of Europeans, our competitors, grew by only 13 per cent per annum.  Those rising domestic costs here affected farmers first and foremost who had to pay high prices while they were stuck on low EEC prices. In short, in the two years 1979 and 1980, the farmers were harried and harassed by a series of measures by the then Government. While they were telling farmers to expand output they were, at the same time, making that expansion all the more difficult for them.</P>
    <P>In June of this year when the present Government came into power they found that not only was agriculture in a shattered position but there was a deficit in the Department of Agriculture's Estimate for existing schemes of £57 million. The outgoing Government had under-provided money for agriculture that was so badly needed and left it to the incoming Government to find revenue to meet that deficit.  The Government, as a token of their commitment to agriculture, not only made good this shortfall but launched a major programme, a three-pronged attack, in my view, on the present crisis in agriculture.  It has centred on the three areas of borrowings, encouraging more output and reducing input costs to farmers.  On borrowings, the Minister outlined the measures that are intended.  I will only briefly mention them <Col N="1539" /> here again.  There was the 5 per cent subsidy from the EEC scheme for farm modernisation work; there was a similar subsidy of 5 per cent for other farmers not included in the EEC scheme. Together these are open to about 90,000 farmers.  When one considers that the Foras Talúntais estimate of the number of farmers with borrowings is less than half of that figure, it can be seen that this is something that will really make a significant impact on farm borrowing problems. There is also a special package under negotiation at present with the banks which the Minister described which will be aimed particularly at the 6,000 farmers who have the serious problem of not being able to meet their interest payments.  As the Minister said, it would be a tragedy if those families were prevented from continuing in farming and having a decent living for their families.</P>
    <P>In the area of promoting output, the Minister also dwelt on some of the measures that have been brought forward. There are several.  There was a 14 per cent EIB money for livestock expansion and for ancillary buildings and so on for that livestock expansion; there was an extra 50,000 hectares in the western drainage scheme and the most recent £70 subsidy for additional calved heifers which was implemented between mid-1981 and mid-1982.  The Minister has indeed committed himself to seeking a continuation of this scheme and he hopes to bring the subsidy up to £100 as we had outlined in our programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of input costs, which again is the other side of the squeeze that has come on farmers' incomes, the Government have a very clear programme to bring down the costs to farmers.  The most important in financial terms is the abolition of rates on full-time farmers, which was a firm commitment in our election programme.  We will proceed with that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We have already cut the VAT on farm contractors from 10 per cent to 3 per cent and we have alleviated any of the indirect taxes in the budget, a budget that was brought in in July to make up for the <Col N="1540" /> shortfalls in the previous Government's provision for the spending programme. We have made good the damage that might have been done to farmers by those increases in direct taxes by raising the refund to 1½ per cent.  The Minister said today that he is confident that that is providing complete compensation for the extra tax that farmers might have borne. Together these proposals will, I reckon, put about £80 million into the agricultural economy in 1982 on top of what would have been there already.  This has been a really significant contribution by the Government in what has been perhaps the most difficult financial crisis that any Government has had to face.  It is a measure of the Government's commitment to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the present situation in agriculture as was described in a press conference earlier today by An Fóras Talúntais.  It is heartening to see that progress is being made in agriculture and that the agricultural sector is responding to the measures that we have brought in in a very short time.  An Foras Talúntais now reckon that, in 1981, farm incomes will grow by 20 per cent.  This will arrest the continuous decline in real incomes that occurred in agriculture in the past two years.  Certainly we are not happy with the low level they are at but at least the decline has been arrested.  It should be said that before the present Government came into office the predictions were that real incomes in agriculture would fall by 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>So we must appreciate that in a very short time the Government have succeeded in pulling around a predicted fall in farm incomes to a situation where that decline has been arrested.  An Foras Talúntais are predicting that, in 1982, output will grow by 3 per cent in agriculture across all enterprises.  They say that cow numbers will be up by 50,000.  These are very significant increases and it shows that in response to the measures, particularly the in-calf heifer scheme, cow numbers will be rising and output will be rising across the board.  An Foras Talúntais are also hoping and predicting that there will be a rise in farm profitability in 1982.  The underlying rate of <Col N="1541" /> inflation is coming down very dramatically. It is now estimated that in December 1981 to December 1982 the underlying rate of inflation will be down to about 11 per cent.  So farmers will be getting a significant easing in the rate of increase of their input costs.</P>
    <P>What happens to farm profitability will depend on what happens in Brussels this year at the price negotiations.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers are to be commended for the assiduous work they are doing at present to achieve major increases in prices.  Only yesterday the Taoiseach was in Paris discussing with President Mitterrand &mdash; who is likely to be our closest ally in seeking high price increases &mdash; the whole agricultural situation and seeking his support.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also been actively involved as has the Minister for Agriculture.  We are placing this as a very high priority as is evidenced by the amount of Government and Ministers' time that is being devoted to it.</P>
    <P>The Government are acutely aware of the importance of agriculture in the economy.  The present problems in the economy are much concerned with out ability to earn foreign exchange.  Agriculture is at present providing 35 per cent of our exports but even that figure underestimates its contribution, because agriculture has a very low import content.  If one looks at the value added on what we are exporting, agriculture's contribution is about 45 per cent of domestic value added.  It is a major contributor to the big problem facing the Government at present of servicing foreign borrowings and of providing enough foreign exchange to buy badly needed imports.</P>
    <P>Although the Government have taken excellent action to arrest the problem of the decline in agricultural incomes, they are far from complacent about the magnitude of the problem that still confronts Irish agriculture.  Senators today should turn their attention to the major longterm problems that will confront agriculture over the medium term.  The first job is to confront the threat to the Common Agricultural Policy that is coming from Britain and Germany.  The second thing raised by one of the speakers here is to <Col N="1542" /> tackle the problem of land structure here. The final one is to get farm development back on the rails after the shock of the last two years.  There is no doubt that in the present crisis, some of those who have been worst affected were those progressive farmers who took the chance and invested and now have serious problems. The Government are taking action to alleviate their problem but we must also attempt to get farm development back on the rails.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about each of those headings.  On the common agricultural policy and the threats to it, what I have noticed in recent weeks is that many farmers are understandably frustrated because we had to go hat in hand to the EEC and to negotiate with them to have approved national measures which we tried to introduce.  Farmers are disappointed about that.  They also have canvassed for a devaluation of the green £.  Although these are understandable frustrations on the part of farmers, we must resist devaluation at all costs.</P>
    <P>We must recall that agriculure exports about half of its produce.  Only half of it is consumed here.  We depend more than anyone on the common agricultural policy. The three pillars of that policy are a common price throughout the community, community preference, preference for community producers and the common external tariff and joint finance of the costs of the common agricultural policy. If we were to involve ourselves in national measures that were not sanctioned by Brussels or were to introduce unilateral devaluation of our currency which would be in breach of the common price, the pillar of the CAP, it would amount to Irish sabotage of a policy that we have the greatest interest in preserving. If we tried to compete with European countries where a very small proportion of the population is involved in agriculture in giving national support to our farm population we would be left seriously behind.  We would run the risk of driving ourselves back into the cheap food policy era which we suffered for 50 years under Britain.</P>
    <P>Ireland must defend the Common Agricultural Policy.  We should take <Col N="1543" /> every opportunity to make our case in the strongest possible way in defence of CAP.  Many antagonists of the common agricultural policy lose sight of the cost of this policy.  It costs about 3 per cent of European spending on food.  That is a derisory, small sum considering the amount of subsidies in other areas.</P>
    <P>We should also be making the point that although we tend to be a deficit country where intervention occurs frequently that is not to say that it is a national subsidy and that Ireland is getting the benefit of it.  The intervention system supports prices throughout Europe.  Politicians should be quick to point this out to foreigners who say that all the surplus is in Ireland.  We should also be making the point that the Germans and the British, by use of monetary compensatory amounts, are keeping prices high for their own farmers.  They are stimulating the over-production they are complaining about.  We should be pointing out that there is no common external tariff against cereal substitutes. We have a situation where producers in Europe can import very cheap substitutes for cereals without any tariff on them, which effectively by-pass the idea of the common agricultural policy.  They are able to engage in very intensive production of milk.</P>
    <P>It is crucial for us to defend the common agricultural policy and we should also be considering our long-term strategy in this area.  We cannot forever be seeking maximum price increases and resisting all forms of quota because there is a budget limit on the common agricultural policy&mdash;the 1 per cent VAT that is available to agricultural spending.  If we break through that barrier, there is a danger that the common agricultural policy will collapse.  We should, as the Minister indicated he was considering, present an Irish case for special consideration under any quota measures that are brought in.  It is clear that our output level in terms of output per acre or milk yield per cow is way below that in Europe.  It would be a better strategy for us to accept some form of quota, provided we could get special consideration for the backwardness of our agricultural <Col N="1544" /> policy compared with other European countries.  It would be a tragedy if all concessions to reform in the CAP were regarded as selling farmers down the river and if we accepted no change until the CAP crumbled about us and left us in a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>Land structure, as Senator Leonard said, is one of the major areas that we have to reform.  Many young people could be provided with jobs in farming. Today we passed a measure providing £80 million for youth employment outside agriculture and it is incumbent on us to consider how, by reform of land structure and increasing small farm size, we could encourage more young people to stay in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to two measures which will help to improve the availability of land to young people.  One is the two years suspension of stamp duty on land transfers to young farmers.  The other is a return to the 1975 real threshold for capital acquisitions tax for full-time farmers.  This would encourage people to hand over land to young people at a much earlier stage.  There is need to deal immediately with long-term leasing.  It is something that has been discussed for years and years and as yet there has been no concrete move on it.  The 11 month method of the conacre system is a serious impediment to the use of land particularly in tillage farming.  The movement to long-term leasing presents problems. There is the problem of preventing a rundown of property and the problem of compensating people for improvements that they made.  This is more difficult in the case of land than in the case of fixed property where it is easy to assess such things.  There is also the problem of the level of rent on the 11 month system. This is very high and it will be hard to get an acceptable lease at a payment that farmers could afford on a 12 year system. We should move forward with this and perhaps some form of a tax holiday, along the lines of the two year suspension of stamp duty, in respect of the rent for transfers from people over 55 to people under 25 with agricultural training who are willing to take up full time farming would be a  easure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> Senator Leonard mentioned the Fianna Fáil White Paper on land policy. I must be honest and say that I am sceptical about the tax subsidy proposal.  Only 3 per cent of the land comes on the agricultural market each year.  Even if one succeeded in significantly changing the direction of land through a tax and subsidy measure, it would take a long time before any significant contribution to land restructuring was made.  The other problem about the tax subsidy proposal is that in the present situation where there is a buyers' market in land, people are forced to sell land as a result of financial difficulties.  If the tax was brought in for non-farmers, who in the eastern part of the country buy up a lot of land, the net effect would be that farmers in difficulty would find that their land was unsaleable.  The tax subsidy area is not an area to be rushed into.  More should be done by way of the long-term lease which would not have a detrimental effect on farmers who were trying to sell in a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey said that since the Coalition Government came into office, interest rates have risen by 5½ per cent from 14½ per cent under the previous Government to 20 per cent.  I should like to know what figures he is quoting.  It is not my understanding that interest rates last June were anything like 14½ per cent. The whole thrust of the Government's policy is to try to reduce interest rates to farmers.  Another point which Senator Hussey made was that the July budget added 5 per cent to the cost of living.  The official figure is 3 per cent.  He then went on to say that £75 million was taken out of the pockets of farmers by that measure. The present level of family farm income is about £660 million.  Even 5 per cent of that does not come to anything like £75 million.  It comes to less than half that amount.  I draw his attention to the fact that in that budget the Government went out of their way to introduce VAT refunds and reductions in VAT on contractors, measures that were designed to ease the problems caused by the budget on family farms.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the problem of cutting the grant under the farm <Col N="1546" /> modernisation scheme.  I agree that that was an unfortunate thing to have to do. The Government are promoting in this difficult period a policy of consolidation. They are shifting their emphasis from investment in new buildings towards investment in extra stock, extra fertiliser, extra fodder and towards bringing down the interest costs to farmers on existing borrowings.  The Government will stand by that as their major priority at present. There are plenty of instances in my own county of grant-aided buildings which have been built in the past few years that farmers are not in a position to fill with stock.  The priority is to raise output and the production of fodder so that we can capitalise on the investment over the past few years.  I warmly support the motion before the House that the Government are tackling the problems of the agricultural sector in a very workmanlike manner in difficult times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  After a very spirited contribution from Senator Bruton who has set the tone of this debate at the proper level we have to look at the motion to which I am a joint signatory and at the amendment.  It is because of the wording of the amendment that one was forced to do research on the figures pertaining to agricultural incomes under the previous Government.  I shall put a few figures on the record so that we will be able to look at the realism behind this amendment.  Research was carried out into the incomes of farmers at the beginning of this year when the previous Government were still in power.  In the first six months their incomes dropped to the income levels of 1980.  As Senator Bruton said, that was in a period when direct action could have been taken not alone on the home front but in the European Community where we have allies.  We are very fortunate that all our members of the European Parliament, irrespective of which party they represent, are at one in the European Parliament in trying to ensure that the national interests are protected in any review that takes place on CAP as a result of the mandate of 30 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> It is time now for politicians of all sides, particularly those in Opposition, to stop making political capital out of the agricultural sector which has been going through a crisis period.  We should be realistic and act as a team at national level.  Farming organisations are forced to picket institutions to try to bring their plight to our attention.  We should also act as a team in Europe.  I compliment the Minister who will probably be proved by history to be one of the best ever Ministers for Agriculture.  The decisions made in relation to agriculture are made at a level at which the Minister, Deputy Dukes, is most capable.  It is a system which he has grown up with and worked with and I have great confidence that he will ensure that our national interests are protected.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about co-responsibility levies and super levies.  It was in other periods of office that the principle of co-responsibility levies was first accepted. Co-responsibility levies can be accepted if the nations contributing to the surplus are responsible for the usage of the fund in trying to ensure that surpluses are disposed of.  The co-responsibility levy, or as it is called in Europe, the fourth principle, is a levy above a certain target level for products.  When these targets are met or exceeded the producer is required to contribute a levy known as the co-responsibility levy.  In respect of Irish agricultural produce, whether it be cereal, beef or milk, the Irish farming organisations and marketing institutes have ensured that no milk lakes or butter mountains have been created by Irish producers who are a minute contributor to the total products in Europe.  When we negotiated our entry to the EEC, nobody in my party objected to the principle of joining the EEC, as Socialists we would be European in outlook, but we objected to the terms of entry.  Some of those terms of entry were not to our advantage and have proved so since then.  It must be emphasised that it was accepted by existing members that there would be plenty of opportunities for Irish farmers to expand production.  This was based on the natural advantage of our country to produce <Col N="1548" /> good quality grass with very little imported input.  The expansion in production has only barely taken off because the Irish farmer is still very far behind his EEC neighbours.  In settling any product target in which the words "co-responsibility levy&rdquo; should come into being, account should be taken of the legitimate right of Irish farmers to obtain yields similar to other EEC farmers and to do so without penalty.</P>
    <P>As regards the super levy I commend the Taoiseach for the initiative he has shown.  I hope that we will use our veto in the event of other member states insisting on a super levy.  I commend the Taoiseach's initiative in going to see the Socialist Premier of France, M. Mitter-and. Many French farmers are now bankrupt and the French realise that whatever help they can give the farmers will be through the common agricultural policy which is the only policy of any significance in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The proposals for change which have been outlined will be the subject of much debate.  I have no doubt that our Minister for Agriculture will ensure that our national interest will be protected.  Our agricultural output and employment are far higher than in any other Community country.  About 14 per cent of our output and 19 per cent of our employment are involved directly in agriculture.  The comparable figures for our European neighbours are 4 per cent of output and 8 per cent of employment.  An effective agricultural policy is more important to us than to any other member state.  Any Minister who represents us in Europe must ensure that any revision of the CAP will take these matters into consideration.</P>
    <P>Incomes have been dropping and this motion recognises that.  Abount 60 per cent of family farm incomes were less than £2,000 last year.  With all due respect that type of income and it has been documented and proven, is even below the subsistence level of those on social welfare payments.  We have a responsibility in this area.  Taking this year as a whole farm incomes were level with the inflation rate.  That leaves farmers no better <Col N="1549" /> off but certainly no worse off than they were in 1980.  In 1980 the figures were totally unacceptable to us on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>There are proposals and packages which have been negotiated and agreed at EEC and national levels.  The first one which the Minister mentioned is the EEC interest subsidy.  It is a pity that the number of applications from farmers who would benefit is extremely low.  If we operate the 5 per cent national subsidy scheme and there is an EEC refund involved in the first scheme, the Government will ask why farmers did not apply for the first scheme which can be supplemented from Europe.  We did some research into the numbers who have applied and they are particularly low.  It has been proved that many of these are in financial difficulties because they borrowed for productive purposes and were so advised by the ACOT advisory board. Those who improved their farms, restocked, and improved their buildings now find themselves, through input costs and increased interest charges in financial difficulties.  If that is the case there is absolutely no reason why they should not apply for the 5 per cent interest subsidy. If they do so they will ensure that we get an EEC refund.  Those who do not qualify under this scheme will qualify under the second scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why farmers have not applied is that there is a lack of privacy in offices where they want to discuss their problems.  The Minister of State should tell the farm development services automatically to advise each farmer as to what his requirements are, what his borrowing requirements are, what grants he has available to him and what his net deficit borrowings were so that without disclosing any private matter in an office which is not designed as a bank he could bring that information to a banking institution. That should be proof of whether a man is entitled to the 5 per cent subsidy sponsored by the European Community.  If we could tidy up that aspect more people would apply for this scheme for which funds are available from Europe.  This money is not being made available to people to increase livestock <Col N="1550" /> numbers and it is not available for the speculative buying of land which went on indiscriminately without any recourse to finance, earning capabilities per acre or anything else.  The money is available only for the purposes specified.</P>
    <P>We were disappointed when the scheme announced by the Government of a £100 supplement per cow to build up the breeding stock was turned down by the EEC.  That is a pity because that, for the first time in 12 months, had generated confidence.  There is destocking.  There has been a drastic reduction in the number of animals, particularly cow numbers. For the first time since we entered the EEC we have fewer animals and that situation is intolerable if we are to maintain farming as an important part of our economic development.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Community have agreed to pay £70 towards each additional animal in that category.  It is in the form of a subsidy for borrowing. That should be spelled out in greater detail.  We advocate that farmers should maintain and hold their breeding stock. If they have them on hands, having reared them to that stage, instead of being forced through economics to dispose of them they should get this money. They may have to borrow money to do something else if they are forced to retain these stocks but we want them to retain them.  I hope there will be confirmation from the Minister of State that that is how the scheme will be applied.  That is how the farmers want it to be applied and if it is applied in any other way it will not have the desired effect.  I would have the gravest reservations that it would be worthwhile if it were used just as another interest subsidy because it would be putting the farmers into the net of borrowings again.  That was not what the Government intended for this fund.</P>
    <P>The ACC are also operating the European Investment Agency money which is available to us. Having looked at the application form for that scheme, I see there are 42 financial questions to be answered.  Farmers are required under the scheme to submit accounts every three months.  I suggest to our Eurocrat <Col N="1551" /> friends that in designing a scheme, particularly a financial scheme to aid an industry which has been in difficulty, the maximum amount of red tape should be cut.  It is absolutely no value to the agriculture community if this kind of bureaucratic questionaire is to be completed by people who have not the facilities available to them to complete it.  The advantages under the scheme could be great if it were made easy.</P>
    <P>It is accepted in Europe by people in various parts of the Commission and by members of the cabinet of various Commissioners that money can be available for restructuring farms and development work.  Initially it was thought that this would not be the case.  If that is not possible we will have to give serious consideration to setting up some type of farming rescue agency, a type of Fóir Teoranta to be applied to agriculture as it is applied to industry and to move towards some common ground for a guaranteed farm income.  We should have a plan for farmers so that if they increase production there will be compensation for them.  Farmers need this kind of planning now because for too long there has been this stop-go policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Bruton referred to some penal taxes that were initiated.  My party who have always advocated that farmers should pay a fair share of taxation based on profits still maintain that stand.  Farmers maintain that stand now because they realise they do not have profits and therefore they have no worries about taxation. I have said publicly, within my own party and I say it here again today, that never again should farmers be subjected to indistriminate taxation, ignoring their ability to pay because this will be a disincentive to production.  If we do that we are on the road to disaster so far as agricultural development and agricultural production are concerned.</P>
    <P>I mention the disease eradication schemes because they have created some problems for farmers particularly with regard to maintaining breeding stocks. There are also other facets of the scheme that should be mentioned.  I am unhappy about and dissatisfied with the progress <Col N="1552" /> of the scheme of disease eradication.  In some areas there have been breakdowns because due recognition has not been given to the importance of eradicating disease, particularly tuberculosis.  There have been major breakdowns which created much hardship for farmers where they had to adopt a depopulation policy. In that situation farmers should be compensated adequately where they have absolutely no control over a rampant disease. Hardship funds must be applied from the beginning of a breakdown until the matter is completely cleared.  That is when the hardship funds should be applicable. I would like a commitment in the review of the budget and in the budget preparation to allocate money to carry out research into the cause of the breakdown. People would welcome this review into the epidemiology of tuberculosis and brucellosis, particularly tuberculosis, where we have made relatively little progress in spite of spending £100 million on the scheme.  Where the lack of compensation could put a farmer out of business his special case should be taken into consideration in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my disappointment about drainage work.  Drainage might not be specifically linked in Europe to the common agricultural policy as it is dealt with specifically under the regional policy.  There is no doubt that major river drainage that is required in this country would have direct beneficial effect on the farming community and would bring millions of acres of land back in to production. I visited the Commission and inquired about schemes which are relevant to my own area such as the River Suir and the Shannon and other such schemes.  I was disappointed that no application has ever been made by any previous Government to the European Community for money for these schemes in spite of the fact that there was money in the European sector to back them if we had the commitment at Government level to initiate a scheme.  That was not done in the past.  The Minister of State has made a submission on these grounds involving the drainage of our major rivers and there is a commitment by the European Community through the <Col N="1553" /> regional fund to assist river drainage.  I hope there will be an active interest taken by this Government in the whole policy of river drainage.  It would benefit agriculture, the unemployment situation and the Exchequer from PAYE and PRSI contributions.  The EEC grants are very high particularly for the western drainage area and this country could make money from the scheme.  They would break even at least on a major scheme like the River Suir where millions of acres of land would be brought into agricultural production again.</P>
    <P>The question of the live trade versus the factory is an emotive one particularly for me because the trade union movement is extremely concerned about the lack of employment in the beef industry. We realise that farmers' outlets and their markets must be protected and farmers must ensure that whatever market is available to them is the best possible market. No EEC institution should be instrumental in making it more advantageous for us to put live cattle on to a ship at the expense of jobs in our factories.  This problem was dealt with at a recent meeting between the Irish Farmers' Association, the trade union movement and the Irish Meat Exporters Association.  It was agreed that the supply to meat factories, which is continuing to decline, is due to the following reasons: the destocking of the national herd, particularly in 1980, not in the past three months, and the smuggling of approximately 130,000 cattle to Northern Ireland.  While the overall level of exports of live cattle has fallen, the increase in live exports to North Africa has increased by 30 per cent.  This increase in live cattle exports has reversed the progressive decline away from the export of live cattle towards beef exports which has characterised the industry in this country for the past decade. If one combines the legal and the illegal exports of live animals, the overall increase is something like 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The processing industry, in which I am worried about jobs for workers in factories, is working at only 33 per cent of its processing capacity.</P>
    <P>We will have to ensure that the EEC institutions do not make it more beneficial <Col N="1554" /> for farmers to sell cattle to Libya, irrespective of the balance of payments situation.  It is more important to process our national raw material in this country and to have much greater value added to the product when it goes abroad.  Intervention should be looked at from that point of view.  We should ensure that no such advantages can be gained by one section of the trade over another section. Some of the cattle barons have got very rich and some of the factory managers and privately-owned factories have made millions over the year.  I would not like to see the factories having the cream of the market because in 1974 they had very little regard for the farmer.  There will have to be at least a minimum guaranteed factory floor price for cattle in order to compete with the live trade.  Because of the massive unemployment in the processing industry a three-day week will probably become the norm in most of the factories by the end of this year and is extremely worrying that we are sitting back and taking no action in an area in which the European Community are contributors.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme which is part of the EEC overall common agricultural policy has considerable merit and it has benefited many farmers.  Since we entered Europe our total income under this heading is something like £1,700 million. That is a tremendous input from Europe through the common agricultural policy.  It is worrying to think that under the farm modernisation scheme 80 per cent of the applicants have failed to get in to the development category.  While that system obtains we are benefiting only a minute number of applicants.  They have managed because they are progressive or had farms big enough but many of the small family farms who are the life blood of this nation and the backbone of the country are unable to benefit under this scheme.  There must be some other interim scheme that would assist farmers in that category to increase production and stock numbers.  I do not mind how it is engineered in Europe or what heading it is put under.</P>
    <P>We had a farm incentive bonus scheme in the past and that was of considerable <Col N="1555" /> benefit.  The European Commission now are talking about direct income subsidies. With all due respect to the European Commissioners and everything else, the Irish family farmer and his farm worker are proud people.  They do not want hand-outs from Europe.  They will accept income subsidies if they are related to production.  If they are specifically channelled to productive areas, particularly to small farmers in disadvantaged areas such as the west of Ireland and indeed to some of the disadvantaged areas in the better off counties, they could help people to achieve a further stage in development. This would benefit people who have up to now been hearing about the millions of pounds coming through but which never got to the small man at the farm gate.</P>
    <P>The other item which has been touched on is the farm retirement scheme.  I was hoping in the beginning that this might prompt some farmers who were uneconomically trying to operate a farm to hand it over to the younger generation but it is a fact that the scheme as agreed in Europe is a complete and total flop.  It should be scrapped and we should start working on another scheme.  There should be a phased take-over of family farms and there should be incentives to do it instead of the stupid requirement that was written into the farm retirement scheme.  Only then will we make any inroads into the question of the handing down of farms by the older people in the industry who have not been able to keep pace with all the varying degrees of production. We have been educating our young people for this job and I hope money will be allocated for the continuing education of young farmers.  In the future we will have to ensure that if land becomes available it will be available only to young farmers who will be competent to work it in an efficient manner which will be of benefit to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have one other point for the Department of the Minister of State, that is in connection with costings for these various schemes.  They are a bone of contention for all of us.  The present costings are <Col N="1556" /> about two-and-a-half or three years behind present day costs.  We have discussed it with the Minister privately and we know he is looking at it.  We know that he has financial constraints upon him but there is no doubt that if we are to maintain any progress under these schemes all the costings for grant purposes will have to be updated to present day costings.  I do not accept that they should be work costings given by contractors in the area because if State funds are involved we must have some control over them but at least they should be 1981 prices for 1981 work and not 1979 prices.  Otherwise there will be no incentive whatsoever to avail of these grants if the amount of money farmers get will not even go towards the cost of some of the materials.</P>
    <P>My suggestions are intended to be constructive. We will never be satisfied in the agricultural sector while we are subjected to the restrictions that are placed on borrowings by the financial institutions because of the high interest charges. Pressures have been put on farmers by banking institutions and the farmers had to dispose of stock and land to meet their commitments.  That is why stock numbers have been dropping.  People have been forced to sell their stock.  The new Minister has realised that there are problems in production and income and is going about the matter in a constructive and efficient way.  I have confidence in the agricultural sector.  If there is any, hope for Ireland it is in her agriculture.  We should unite to ensure that we work together within the European Community to protect the national interest of our farmers.  We recognise that they are the most important sector of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I wish him every success.  I support the amendment. In the absence of the proposer of the amendment, Senator Tom Hussey, I want to correct some misunderstanding that Senator Bruton had in connection with the 5 per cent.  Senator Hussey said the inflation rate had increased by 5 per cent, not the interest rate.  As a result of that, 1 per cent is equal to £15 million <Col N="1557" /> and 5 per cent is equal to £75 million. Senator Hussey said that the 5 per cent increase would take £75 million out of farmers' pockets.</P>
      <P>There were a few other submissions by Senator Bruton in connection with the 14 per cent that I want to correct.  In March of this year Deputy MacSharry negotiated one of the most favourable price rises we had since we joined the EEC providing an average increase of almost 14 per cent.  There was a special package worth £52 million providing fertiliser and silage subsidies and doubling beef suckler grants.  Earlier in the January budget there was the removing of the rates bill on the vast majority of farmers, the full tax relief on stock and the removal of the disease eradication levy.  In October 1980 we had the relief of rates on smaller farmers below £60 valuation, foreign loans at attractive interest rates were obtained and bank co-operation was given in restructuring loans to farmers experiencing difficulties at that time.  Extra finance for livestock and headage grants and for the farm modernisation scheme was made available.  In April of this year the same Minister obtained final agreement for the western development package providing £300 million to improve the infrastructure of the farming community in the western region over a ten-year period.  In May of this year there was a subsidy for in-calf heifers, a nitrogen fertiliser subsidy, a silage-making subsidy and an increase in the boning allowance to meat factories.  There was agreement in principle to a 5 per cent interest subsidy for the development farmer and aid for land drainage.</P>

    <P>I want to compliment Senator Ferris on his contribution and the equitable submissions he made here this evening as regards both the motion and the amendment. Regardless of what side of the House we are on and whatever Minister may be making the case in Brussels we all know that the best deal possible must be gained for the Irish farmer.  We can have a cut at each other here across the floor, politically and otherwise, we can quote figures, we can blame the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, for not doing his job when in <Col N="1558" /> office and we in turn will probably blame the present Minister, Deputy Dukes, for the present situation.  Regardless of what way politically we may slant the position as regards the farming community, it behoves us to do whatever we think will bring the best benefits to the farming community as a whole.  That is our aim. I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon here this evening because he comes from the same background as I and he represents the same type of people.  When I see a Minister from the west listening to me I have no doubt he will understand our plight in the west. Only by living in that region can one realise the disadvantages suffered by the farming community.  I was surprised that Senator Ferris had such a knowledge of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister of State will understand quite well what I am about to say in connection with sheep subsidies. Up to this year sheep subsidy inspections took place in August and sheep subsidy grants were paid immediately when processing had finished and inspections were carried out.  Sheep subsidies have not been paid in the west to date.  There is a major confusion between the £9.50 and the £9.60.  People may smile at that but they are two female grants, one to the ewe and the other to the housewife. When I go to cumann meetings throughout my constituency and when I start to explain about the £9.50 and the £9.60, I can assure you that everybody is up in a heap when I am finished and there is confusion as to whether I am talking about the ewe subsidy or the housewife's £9.60 because neither of them has been paid to date although they were in the Fine Gael manifesto.  No doubt I will put some of the blame on the present Minister of State and on the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dukes.  The Minister for Finance must accept responsibility for the £9.60.  The reason for the delay in the payment of the ewe subsidy is that it is coupled with the cattle headage payment and a ceiling has been fixed for that. Generally the hill farmer has very little stock.  If he has ten live units of stock he would be regarded as a fairly substantial cattle man.  The Minister should have <Col N="1559" /> arranged some method to pay the sheep subsidy as usual.  I can assure you it would not exceed the ceiling of both the headage and sheep subsidies.  It would have been the right policy to pay the sheep subsidy, retain the cattle headage subsidy until after inspection and then assess the joint income.  To date neither the cattle headage subsidy nor the sheep subsidy has been paid to the people in the west. The payment would be very welcome to farmers at this time.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation grant has been reduced and that is something I feel very strongly about.  If I was in a position to do so I would increase grants for the housing of cattle in winter time in the west.  This would protect the land, it would ensure early grass in springtime and every animal would be on to good grazing in March, thereby giving early beef production.  The type of traditional feeding systems that we had in the past do not give any profit at all.  The slatted house is the most suitable system for the west and should be promoted, but unfortunately the grant has been reduced.  I and every agricultural adviser are advising small farmers in the west not to proceed with the slatted house because it is no longer profitable.  The 25 per cent grant is being further reduced and it is no longer profitable to build this type of housing.  The solution for the west of Ireland is to take the cattle off the land because of the varying soils and the wet climate in that area.  I would welcome any increase.  Any increase that the Minister can negotiate will be very welcome in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to speak briefly about the live export trade as against the dead meat trade.  Coras Beostoic agus Feola, The Irish Livestock and Meat Board, in their terms of reference include the promotion of live and dead meat exports.  Senator Ferris has an equitable view on this.  I felt he, a Labour Party Senator, might have had decided views on this before coming into the Seanad this evening.  I warn any Minister for Agriculture that on the day he puts an embargo on the export of live cattle the death knell to the farming community will sound.  You know what happened <Col N="1560" /> in 1974.  If you give the Irish fresh meat exporters a monoply of the trade the farming community will get nothing for their beef.  We have had experience ot that in the past and we are going to have it in the future.  You must have a balance between live and dead exports and, unless you have that balance, you will not have the increased prices or stability of prices for the farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope I will get an opportunity at some later date to give more details in connection with live and dead meat exports, because I feel that a major input of FEOGA grants has gone to the processing meat factories.  Most of our dead meat is being exported at present on the hook in fore and hind quarters and very little of it is processed in this country.  If we had a boning, pre-pack, vac-pac system here which would enable our processed meat to be sold in supermarkets all over Europe, then out meat plants could go into the processing industry and thus create employment in that sector.  This would be good for the cattle trade.  The meat plants have received considerable FEOGA grants to enable them to instal boning and processing facilities, but they have not gone into processing because they are getting remuneration and profits easily by sending meat out in fore and hind quarters and leaving the processing to our partners in Europe.  I challenge any fresh meat exporter to come before me on radio or television and I will give him the facts about the amount of money being poured into the Irish fresh meat exporters' factories for this type of processing that has never taken place.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up this motion. I do not know whether we will finish it tonight, but there are many more things I would like to say.  Senator Ferris mentioned the drainage question and said that no Department, Minister or official had made any submission to Europe to get additional money for river drainage. I am not certain how we arrived at the western drainage package or whether it was negotiated by the Department or the Minister.  Certain rivers in the arterial drainage district&mdash;one at the Minister's own back door&mdash;are being deprived of additional moneys for drainage.  Other <Col N="1561" /> major rivers that do not come under the Arterial Drainage Acts and are not the responsibility of the western drainage package should be drained in order to prevent flooding.  Grants for that could be negotiated in Europe.</P>
    <P>The west has not received any portion of that £300 million package that was negotiated.  I hope that in the not too distant future the people of the west of Ireland who are entitled to this £300 million will receive it that it will be seen to be spent in the area it was intended for.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity of speaking on this motion.  It will do good if it induces the Ministers and the people on both sides to review the position to date and try to come together as a body to make a contribution in Europe whereby the Irish farmer's lot will be improved as a result of the motion and the amendment combined.</P>

      <P>It is my pleasure to support the motion before the House. Having regard to the financial difficulties inherited by the present Government, one can only welcome the substantial increase in financial aid provided by this Government for the agricultural industry. The Opposition have tried to deceive the people into believing that the Government could solve the agricultural crisis. It has been developing over the last two years.  This amounts to nothing short of cynical political opportunism, misleading the farming community in an attempt to disguise the facts.  The last Government presided over a 50 per cent reduction in farm income since 1979.  The Government of the day saw fit to ignore public warnings of the detrimental effects of their policies on the agricultural community. They allowed the national herd during 1980 to be slaughtered off in our <Col N="1562" /> factories without taking any steps to prevent that.  They allowed the national breeding herd to be completely depleted and again took absolutely no steps to prevent that situation.</P>
      <P>I should not have to remind the Opposition that it was they who removed the fertiliser subsidies, imposed the 2 per cent levy on the farming community and left the farmers in 1979, many of whom bought dear stores and fed them for the summer, selling those cattle at the back end of that year and having to pay a 2 per cent levy on cattle which were losing money.  They imposed the resource tax, the disease levy and the cost of the 30-day test and they reduced the agricultural grant on rates from £75 to £45.  I heard one of the speakers from the opposite side of the House a few minutes ago pointing out that they removed those subsidies and expected to be congratulated about that after they had imposed them two years previously.  All of this was done to arrive at some target figure of taxation for the farming community at that time and to remove the benefits obtained from Europe as a result of the positive steps taken by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Mark Clinton, when he represented this country there.</P>
      <P>Agriculture has declined since 1979. Senator T. Hussey said that many farmers in the west of Ireland, with their wives and families, were living on an income of £1,000 per year.  Were the Opposition aware of this when they were in Government?</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 December 1981.</P>
