    <Title>Constitutional and Legislative Review: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved on Thursday, 8 October, 1981 by Senator G. Hussey:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with approval the views expressed by the Taoiseach in the course of an RTE radio interview on 27 September, 1981, on the desirability of creating within this island conditions favourable to unity through a reconciliation of its people and towards this end of undertaking in this State a Constitutional and legislative review.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;solemnly declares its support for the Constitution of Ireland and the assurance it contains for the dignity and freedom of the individual and the attainment of a true social order;</P>
    <P>repudiates the Taoiseach's deplorable and unfounded allegations of sectarianism in our laws and in the administration of our affairs;</P>
    <P>condemns the Taoiseach's divisive statements which have damaged the cause of a united Ireland based on reconciliation and a respect for the many different traditions in this island;</P>
    <P>re-affirms its conviction that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution express the unalterable aspiration of the great majority of the Irish people to the unity of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator E. Ryan)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concluding yesterday on a point concerning the difficulties created by the manner in which we decided to amend our Constitution at the time of our admission to the EEC.  In that regard I refer Members of the House to a publication by Basil Chubb entitled <i>The Constitution and Constitutional Change in Ireland,</i> published by the Institute of Public Administration, which I consider to be essential reading for anybody who is interested in the process which we are now undertaking.  Page 85 deals specifically with the point that I was dealing with yesterday, but takes a slightly different approach from mine.  I particularly refer to a note that a 1970 Government report &mdash; and the Government at that time, Senators will remember, was a Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; suggested that other like provisions in the Constitution would have to be considered in this regard.  Basil Chubb in his comment, made well after the amendment to the Constitution, said that this is still very much the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did mention that certain rights arose in Irish Constitutional law quite independently <Col N="307" /> of the Constitution itself and I referred the House to a book called <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by J.M. Kelly, published this year, and in particular to page 335.  The side note said</P>
    <P>Fundamental personal rights antecedent to Constitution, not derived from it.</P>
    <P>The quotation from Mr. Justice Walsh in the case of the State (Ryan) <i>versus</i> Lennon is as follows:</P>
    <P>In this country it falls finally upon the judges to interpret the Constitution and in doing so to determine, where necessary, the rights which are superior or antecedent to positive law....</P>
    <P>That is basically the point. Mr. Justice Walsh lists some rights, the right to marry being one, which are not specifically stated in the Constitution.  There is a list of other rights which have developed out of this, the McGee case being an example.</P>
    <P>In considering the possibility of a new Constitution, on the one hand we do not want to lose that reservoir of case law and, on the other hand, we should bear in mind the possibility that a development similar to that which has taken place in this country could take place in the EEC under the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, unless we narrowed the way in which the laws of that institution automatically find their way into our laws.</P>
    <P>I started out trying to identify the various things which could be properly considered in a constitutional review &mdash; a committee would be a good idea &mdash; with a continuing debate in public.  I want to refer to an area which is an emotive one, one on which there appears to be all-party commitment on the necessity for changing the Constitution.  It is extraordinary that during the whole course of this debate to which I have listened, nobody has referred to this.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last general election, the two major parties unequivocally&mdash;and the Labour Party with some slight hesitation with regard to the actual wording, <Col N="308" /> hesitation in which they were very wise &mdash;agreed that the prohibition on abortion should be inserted into our Constitution. That is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Fine Gael Party.  Somebody must determine the mechanism by which this happened.  It will have to be examined by lawyers and by parliamentary draftsmen to see what is the most appropriate amendment to our Constitution.  If for this reason alone it it not sensible for my friends in the Fianna Fáil Party to say that there is no need to review the Constitution at the present time.  We have all-party agreement on the necessity to do this.  We have agreement with the people who sponsored this proposed amendment that it could be, and should be, drawn up in different words from those proposed because they gave rise to some difficulty.  Whether or not this is a matter which should be included in our Constitution is not something which I propose to discuss today but there is all-party agreement on it.  Therefore, to suggest there is no area within the Constitution which is the subject of public debate, and on which there is all-party agreement that it should be the subject of public debate, is to fly in the face of reality.  As I said initially, there are areas in which all-party agreement has already been reached and this is one such area.</P>
    <P>There is also the need to examine Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. Much of the debate has centred around these Articles and, leaving aside the personal references to current and past party leaders on one side or the other, there seems to be a fairly clear distinction in the minds of the contributors to this debate between two different approaches.  Nobody said that Articles 2 and 3 would at no time in the future be the subject of a proper constitutional review.  The difference seems to be that a certain group of people think it is right that that review should take place in the context of an overall examination, an overall conference to discuss the unity of this country.</P>
    <P>While the point made by Senator Murphy was very well made, if we accept that a substantial majority of the people in the North are not anxious for unity the prospect <Col N="309" /> of such a conference taking place in our lifetime is remote.  Therefore, we should examine and consider whether there is anything which we can do which would help to create a climate, not renouncing all ambition for a united Ireland, but a climate which will advance the possibility of that coming about. Articles 2 and 3 have been widely considered by this House and I do not intend to spend much time considering them.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that there are inherent contradictions within Articles 2 and 3, particularly Article 3, where the Oireachtas and the Government seek to claim jurisdiction for their laws over the whole of the island of Ireland.  In the happy event of this island being reunited, this Oireachtas would cease to exist.  It might be replaced by another Oireachtas, but there would be a fundamental change in the composition of this House and of the other House if and when that happy event takes place.</P>
    <P>The logic of the authority by which a portion of the island which is the Twenty-six Counties seeks to legislate for the whole island&mdash;which we all agree is a desirable objective&mdash;is as bad as the logic which says that the Six Counties can legislate for themselves.  We are in a stand-off position here and we ought to recognise that we are.  The way in which we can do that is by redrafting Articles 2 and 3 to retain the aspiration for unity but to recognise that unity can only come about through all-Ireland institutions, that the authority of the people of Ireland is not vested in the people who happen to live in the Twenty-six Counties, but can only be vested in the people who live in the island as a whole.  I do not intend to pursue that matter further except to say that it is a proper matter for constitutional review at present.</P>
    <P>I did, facetiously, at the start of my contribution yesterday, refer to the various categories of people who hoped to benefit out of a review of the Constitution and unspoken in both what the Taoiseach said and in what many of the contributors to this debate, both inside and outside of this House, have said, has been the consideration of the position of Article 41.3.1º of the Constitution which deals <Col N="310" /> with marriage.  In that section the capacity to pass laws dissolving marriage is removed from the Oireachtas and the people have vetoed it.</P>
    <P>We had some complaints that people do not like the statement that the 1937 Constitution was based on a Roman Catholic dogmatic approach, but if one reads the Constitution from beginning to end it is very hard to avoid that fact.  It is well known that some of the Articles which deal with delicate matters like this were drafted by prominent churchmen at that time.  The fact that at that time the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church was the same as the dogma of the Protestant Church does not change the fact that it was primarily because it was the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church that such a provision was put into Article 41.3.2º.</P>
    <P>The basing of our fundamental law on Roman Catholic dogma is, in my opinion, no longer a rational basis for our laws. The time has long passed when the arguments for and against the inclusion or exclusion of a particular item in our Constitution should be based on the religious belief of the majority of the people.  Similarly &mdash; and this is where I find myself in some difficulty &mdash;it would be as wrong to import into the Constitution the dogmas and beliefs of other religions such as the dogmas of atheism, if you could imagine such a thing, or agnosticism, because there is no freedom in substituting one dogma for another.  There is no freedom in substituting the dogma of religious minorities for Roman Catholic dogma. We must, therefore, look at this problem not on the basis of the dogmatic teaching of any church or on the beliefs of any minority.  I do not accept the argument that because minorities exist and their beliefs permit them to remarry, that in itself is a rational explanation for making legislative provision for it.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for any series of laws to allow for the range of political beliefs which exist in any country, even in a country as uniform and as Christian as this country.  There are people here who are not Christians.  For example, we do not allow polygamy and there is no suggestion that we would.  It is a Christian <Col N="311" /> ethos which is in our Constitution, and it would be very difficult to find anyone who would argue against that <i>rationale.</i> The scale on which we have to balance this and other problems is not on the scale of whether or not they conform to Roman Catholic dogma but whether they are in accordance with the common good. In my belief the common good in a state is not an unchanging thing.  The common good changes.  What was the common good in 1937 would not necessarily be the common good today.</P>
    <P>We have to judge this issue &mdash; and I am addressing myself specifically to the issue of marriage &mdash; against the background of what is the common good.  The breakdown of marriage gives rise to a situation where there is a conflict of rights between the parties involved.  In marriage it appears to be only the husband and wife, but there can be other parties involved, such as the State who, because of the contract, gives substantial assistance and support to the institution of marriage, and can be said to have a vested interest in its success.  There can also be children and other dependants who also have a vested interest because of the lack of the capacity to divorce freely.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in 1937, because of the type of society that existed then, the balance of advantage clearly lay in not having divorce because the number of people who were inconvenienced and &ldquo;discriminated&rdquo; against was quite small. Even though the inclusion of this item interferred with the rights of those people who might need a divorce, I think its inclusion gave marriage a certain stability and was for the common good.  There is now a changed situation and we have to assess the position in 1981.  I do not intend to say what my opinion is at this time because I think it is a legitimate matter for debate.</P>
    <P>A great number of marriages broke down during that period and they are breaking down at the present time. Therefore, the balance of advantage in maintaining the prohibition on divorce may have shifted.  The responsibility in showing that the balance of advantage has shifted lies with those people who <Col N="312" /> seek to change the present law, and in my opinion they have not fulfilled that requirement so far, because they have got involved in an emotional argument concerning the individual case rather than comparing the volume of breakdowns of marriage with the extra stability which that sacred institution, under our law has given to our society.</P>
    <P>Arguments that marriage is a contract for life but if the parties to the contract want to break it they should be allowed to do so, do not count in civil law.  A person barely 21 years of age can make a most improvident contract which can affect him for the rest of his life.  He could make a contract to pay somebody £1,000, £10,000 or £100,000 a year, and the law will not come to his assistance unless he shows complete irresponsibility.  The law will insist that he follows that contract for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>We must now examine where the common good lies.  We must use neither the dogma of Rome nor what I would call the dogma of humanism, but the question needs to be answered now.  Anybody in touch with the ordinary people knows that that question is being raised.  We might have different views as to what the outcome of our examination would be, but it is unrealistic to suggest that the questioning is not taking place.  It would also be unrealistic of this House not to recognise that this is a legitimate area of concern for legislators and, therefore, a legitimate area for consideration by an all-party committee to review the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to refer to which is probably more controversial. I want to refer to it in a manner which is totally devoid of introducing the names or the personalities involved.  Members of this House will be aware that in September 1976 a problem arose concerning a conflict between the then Government and the then Taoiseach and the then President. The main participants in that conflict have now either retired or, are, as in one case unfortunately, deceased.  It is proper that at this stage we should examine in a cool calm way, free from the emotion of the individuals involved, whether or not the Constitution at that <Col N="313" /> time afforded to the President of Ireland the protection which that office is entitled to as a right, whether the President was adequately protected in his capacity to answer back by either directing the joint Houses of the Oireachtas or making an address to the nation.  On the other hand there is a point to be considered whether it is appropriate for a President to make his continuance in office conditional on a particular Minister, as in that case, resigning.  We must examine it in a totally free manner and not judge the issue one way or the other.  There was a crisis in the relationship between the Presidency and the Oireachtas and pretending that that crisis did not exist is not going to make it go away.  I appreciate that it is only five years since that happended. It is, nevertheless, appropriate, now that the people concerned have retired from active politics, or in one case is deceased, that we should reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution, it has been said many times, was a Constitution of its time.  It reflected the political and social mood of the people at that time.  It is right that we should examine the situation to see whether in 1981 that Constitution, amended as it has been in a number of ways, continues to reflect the political, social and moral mood of our country and whether it is in conformity with what is the common good.  We should preserve what is good in that Constitution and, consequently, there are large sections of that Constitution which should be unaltered.  We should make sure that any change which we make should only be a change for the better. In those circumstances &mdash; I do not want to take any more time because I know there is a list of speakers anxious to contribute to this debate &mdash; I decided to put on paper items which I would consider as being appropriate for consideration by a constitutional review body.  Before reading out that list I should like to add one which overnight came to my attention and which I did not intend to speak on. It relates to the problem arising in the United Kingdom where Irish citizens have votes and United Kingdom citizens in Ireland do not have votes.  That is a <Col N="314" /> constitutional matter and would require an amendment to the Constitution to give those people the facilities of voting here. The following matters would be appropriates for a constitutional review at this time.  To consider whether an amendment of Article 29.4.3 (3) &mdash; that is the EEC Amendment &mdash; is appropriate in the light of our experience as a member of the European Economic Community and to consider in particular whether it is possible &mdash; I may well be wrong in my suggestion &mdash; to use the various provisions of the Treaty of Rome that the power of the European Economic Community and the rights of individuals under that Treaty could be expanded by the European code as our personal rights were expanded and developed under Article 40.3 of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The next matter is to consider the point so ably made by Senator Robinson when she indicated the various ways in which the Constitution no longer affects the reality of the position.  She referred to Article 15.2, to Article 29, which I have already referred to, and to Article 34. These are claims that the Oireachtas has the sole authority to make the laws of the country and that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of constitutional matters, which, in my submission, is no longer correct.  The next point I consider appropriate for that constitutional committee is: how can the rights of the unborn child be best expressed in constitutional terms, if it is possible to do so, in view of the commitments given by the major political parties here to introduce such a review? Another matter to be considered is: what changes, if any, are needed in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?  Probably the most troublesome of all, because it is internal, is the question: does the common good in 1981 demand the lifting of the restriction of the right of the Oireachtas to legislate on divorce?  The next matter that should be considered is: what clarification, if any, is needed of the powers of the President to make statements to the House of the Oireachtas and or the media on matters of current political debate?</P>

      <P>I should like to mention <Col N="315" /> to the Senator that we should really be concerned with the motion, which asks us to look at the desirability of creating within the State conditions favourable to unity.  The Chair would hope that Members would in some way relate all their points to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that ruling, but a review of the Constitution in a general way is a necessary prerequisite to unity.  Therefore, it is important that we put our own house in order so that the face we present to our brethren in the North is one of a rational State of which they could be proud to be members.  In fact, I had reached the end of my list. They are the kind of things I would like considered by a committee reviewing the Constitution.  None of them is so separated from the concept of reconciliation with the people of this island as to put them outside the terms of Senator Hussey's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was most impressed by Senator McGuinness' and Senator Brendan Ryan's eloquent discourses on the first two days of this debate.  I would ask them to reconsider their stated intention of abstaining on the motion and to recognise that abstention on this motion is to vote against the possibility of change.  I ask them to recognise that voting positively for the motion would be signifying their willingness to take part in a public debate on the Constitution.  I further ask Fianna Fáil Members to consider the divisive and provocative nature of their amendment and to reconsider that matter.  I hope that they would recognise that the motion commits the Fianna Fáil Party to no change but only to consideration of the possibility of change.  That great political movement that Fianna Fáil has been in the past, and which was so eloquently described by Senator Murphy as incorporating in certain ways the whole nation, was in the past open to idealism. They, like us, are looking down at the party political mud, and at our feet which are firmly planted in it, and failing to look to the future with sufficiently open minds and hearts.  We must look to the future so that we can in a rational and unforced <Col N="316" /> way retain that which is good and change that which is bad.</P>
    <P>I would like to warn that if a political party as powerful as Fianna Fáil, who by and large command the support of about 25 per cent of the people and about 33 per cent of the voters as an absolute rock bottom minimum for almost any of their proposals, set their faces against all change or the possibility of change, they will be doing a disservice to the nation. In the long-term the absurdity of their position will mean that no progress will be made during that short-term, but frustration among the citizens will build up to such a state that in the long-term when the floodgates of constitutional reform and change open they will sweep aside both that which is good and that which is bad.</P>
    <P>In this spirit I would ask them to consider, not precisely the changes which I have recommended or the changes to which the Taoiseach has referred but their own contribution and to say in which area they would like to see the fundamental laws of this country changed so that we would make this country a more attractive place in which to rear our own children and in which to encourage the people of the North of Ireland to raise their children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. J. Harte Mr. J. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately held off speaking on this particular motion for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, I wanted to give my own new colleagues an opportunity to get the feel of the Seanad and, secondly, I wanted to hear what the Taoiseach had to say on this whole question.</P>
      <P>The matter of creating the conditions that will in some way assist in the whole question of unity is a very wide subject which calls not only for detailed research and discussion but also for cautious comment so as not to create any more fears in the minds of the Protestant people of the North.  There is a great depth of fear there, therefore the word &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; is used very deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing the means of assisting other initiatives being undertaken and being proposed, we believe compromise <Col N="317" /> is necessary to make those initiatives a success.  We must compromise intelligently to the extent that the compromise asked here will play a role in allaying somewhat the fears of the Protestant people in the North.  It certainly will not make them run across the Border to look for shelter in the South.  We are a very long way from that, but it will help in some way to allay fears, and coupled with the other initiatives on the table at the moment it is tremendously important that we think, not in terms of opposition but in terms of complement.</P>
    <P>The compromise asked of all of us in this Chamber in the motion is simply that we engage objectively in a debate which is a means and not an end in itself.  It is a means of reaching out for favourable conditions.  Nobody has really said what the favourable conditions might be. Nobody knows in the final analysis whether, in fact, we can create those favourable conditions.  But we can, as suggested in the motion, reach out for favourable conditions so that we can be of useful service to the other initiatives that are going on at present on the North. I speak of the Secretary of State, Mr. Prior, and of the Anglo-Irish talks also. We must not forget that the Attorney General has also been asked to have a look at the whole question of the Constitution. All those are initiatives.  If we are not seen to reach out to assist in some way in those initiatives, we can hardly claim to be serious about making a contribution towards favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>We are asked to have a look at the Constitution.  The motion asks us this on the clear understanding that where it is proven that deficiencies exist they cannot be remedied by discussion alone and that action must follow the discussions.  To me, as an ordinary working-class person, that is a simple proposition.  If any of the barristers, solicitiors, accountants, farmers, auctioneers, businesmen or company directors in this House put that proposition to me as a trade union official to try to get agreement from workers, some having a very low standard of education, I believe I would have no difficulty in getting agreement from those workers.  If for some reason I could not get agreement <Col N="318" /> from those workers on behalf of the professional people to whom I referred, they would be the first to denounce my people for being stubborn, unreasonable, etc.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make the accusation that anyone in this House is being stubborn, but I will lay the charge against the Opposition that they have either deliberately or accidentally confused ends with means.  Accordingly, judging from the terms of their amendment, they are behaving as if we were close to an end rather than searching out means to amend one aspect that may contribute to unity.  That is a very simple proposition and a very simple request.  They know, I know and everybody else in this House knows that there is an awful lot of travel to be done and an awful lot of ground to be covered between the means and the end.  The reason opposing Senators know this is that quite a few of them are experienced.  Some of them have just come into the House, but they have been active in politics for a long time.  So it is either accidental or due to confusion that they are failing to recognise that there is a lot of ground between the means and the end or, if they consider there are two extremes, that there is a lot of ground in between two extremes.</P>
    <P>It is not really in character for experienced politicians to take up an attitude of no compromise, and many of the Senators on the opposite side of this House are very experienced people.  The Fianna Fáil Senators are well aware that discussions initiated by their own leader are in progress.  I am speaking of the Anglo-Irish talks.  They know of the intentions of Mr. Prior with regard to the assembly.  They are fully conscious of the necessity to avoid adding to the deep apprehension of the Protestant people and they should be aware that in terms of doing anything to assist unity they must compromise.</P>
    <P>In any attempt at unity we must start by understanding the depth of the anxiety and insecurity of the Protestant people. We have to be very careful on that score. Those are not my words.  I did not see all of the programme <i>Today Tonight</i> yesterday evening, but those were the words of <Col N="319" /> Mr. Whitelaw, who has very substantial experience of political initiatives in the North.  Mr. Whitelaw believes that to start from any other base than understanding the depth of fear of the Protestant people is to live in a fools' paradise. Mr. Whitelaw went on to say that Protestants cannot be pushed in the wrong direction.  He then said that he was encouraged by the Taoiseach's thoughts, stressing that some contribution is needed, and he also praised the Anglo-Irish talks.  Mr. Whitelaw, who has great experience and whose initiatives were brought down not by political action but by strike action in the North, sees the necessity for initiatives and welcomes this initiative of the Taoiseach.  He sees it as heading in the right direction.  He never, at any stage during the programme, stressed that it was the end or that we were anywhere near the end, but that it was a sensible and constructive way to go about trying to move in a way that will not be too fast and will not frighten the Northern people but which, at the same time, will run alongside the other initiatives that are there.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for sudden action.  We know that this debate will go on for a long time and a lot of ground will have been covered before we finally come to the stage of having a referendum and in the course of that time I expect that a lot of fears of the people of the North will have been set at ease.  Mr. Whitelaw, who welcomes the Taoiseach's initiative, has to be listened to whether we like it or not.  He has been in the middle of the whole thing.  He has been involved in initiatives.  He cannot be ignored.  What pleases him most about this initiative is that we are not suggesting the setting up of institutions and are not embarking on a course of action that might antagonise any of the Protestants in the North.</P>
    <P>It may be argued by the Opposition that the Taoiseach's initiative will have no great influence on our Protestant friends in the North.  But that is not a reason for not trying to take an initiative. In deciding that point is it not obvious that we should consider that, whether it pleases them or not, it certainly will not <Col N="320" /> antagonise them?  Mr. Whitelaw, who knows a lot about it, has suggested that the type of initiative being taken will not antagonise the Protestants but will be welcomed by them.</P>
    <P>We also have the observations of churchmen and other people welcoming this initiative.  I see this motion as part of a contribution to the whole process of reconcilation.  I do not see it as a proposition that might in any way antagonise the Protestants in the North.  At this time our endeavours should be directed at trying to influence the people of the North.  But the amendment before the House at the moment will antagonise them when we should be trying to influence them.  This amendment is the Republican version of &ldquo;No Surrender&rdquo; and let us hold on to the <i>status quo.</i> It is an effort at opting out, not because they believe there is no middle ground but because the initiative came from Fine Gael.  If I am wrong and if Fianna Fáil are seriously concerned about Articles 2 and 3, they have no grounds for opting out because opting out of any portion of it is no reason for opting out of the whole lot.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 are not the only Articles involved.  We have heard some very good contributions from both sides of the House on other Articles of the Constitution. There is a lot to the question of creating conditions favourable to unity. Fianna Fáil, by opting out, are deliberately avoiding the possibility of searching out the advantages in this whole area. Because of that it seems that, even though Fianna Fáil may feel antagonistic, there are advantages to be gained by cooperation. If they were to co-operate in this debate, rather than putting down an amendment which deliberately seeks out the best way to concentrate on the disadvantages, they would get a lot out of it.  But they must avoid concentrating on the disadvantages.  The wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment leaves us open to the charge that we are not prepared to mobilise ourselves to tackle the tasks that are necessary to create conditions favourable to one aspect of the whole question of unity.</P>
    <P>We are all legislators but I say to the <Col N="321" /> Fianna Fáil legislators that it looks as if they are not prepared to display the type of leadership which would generate enthusiasm so that others on both sides of the Border can feed on it as part of the overall process.  We are not displaying conviction of desires.</P>
    <P>The question of creating favourable conditions for unity calls for a reaching out not only to our own people but to Protestant brothers and sisters in the North who need our guidance and who need to understand exactly what we are thinking in respect of what we can do to make the conditions more favourable. They need our leadership.  If the people in this Chamber do not make an effort to show that we are serious about giving guidance and leadership the people in the North will have another laugh at us and will become more entrenched in their views because they see initiatives going on in the North, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the <i>status quo</i> being maintained in the South which will be an impediment to the initiatives that are taking place and will be proceeded with at a later date in the North.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there are weaknesses in our approach to unity.  Even if we admit it, would that assist the Fianna Fáil people to come along and put down something more positive than an amendment that says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that holds on to the <i>status quo</i>? It does not look like it.  If we really want to convince people that there are weaknesses in our approach to unity and that we in this House, wish, through sensible debate, to build some sort of contempt for those weaknesses, we must seriously question where we are heading. After all, we adopt the &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; and the <i>status quo</i> mentality but we will not convince any thinking person that we are intent on unity when we are not prepared even to examine the feasibility of proposals aimed at trying for favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about one small but important aspect of what is needed and the Fianna Fáil Senators are not prepared to make that start in this area.  How can they finish something that they do not begin, that they refuse to make a start on?  The amendment is refusing to make <Col N="322" /> a start on this initiative not because everybody in Fianna Fáil disagrees with it&mdash;I will deal with that later.  In this House they are refusing to get down to cases despite the fact that they know a case exists, particularly in the light of the Anglo-Irish talks and Mr. Prior's proposals. If a case did not exist last week, it now exists in the light of Mr. Prior's proposed initiatives.</P>
    <P>We are all great people at suggesting that legislation does not go far enough and wanting to amend it to go further.  In this House, how often have those of us who are here longer than others stood up and said legislation does not go far enough and that it needs amending?  At the same time, when Fianna Fáil are asked to have a look at creating favourable conditions that might necessitate a review of the Constitution and some legislative programmes they make the argument by the very tone of their motion that all the legislation we have is correct and does not need reviewing.  If we put down amendments to it which are defeated and we are still not happy, Fianna Fáil can hardly argue that all the legislation is correct.  They refuse to accept that a legislative review is needed. The only thing I can assume on that basis is that the Fianna Fáil Senators now accept that all the existing legislation is perfect.  That is a preposterous suggestion. I do not believe the Fianna Fáil people believe that.</P>
    <P>This is too serious a business for us here in this House &mdash; let them have all the rows they like in the other House &mdash; where we are having the first opportunity to debate this, to put down a motion that pretends that the Opposition are being mistreated.  There is no crown of thorns being embedded in anyone's head.  It is a simple proposition that ordinary working-class people would be ready to come to terms with, yet there are professional men, experienced politicians and so on who are not prepared to come to terms with it.  It would be understandable if we were talking about an end in itself.</P>
    <P>We are talking about looking for cooperation in regard to the means to a possible end.  Maybe Fianna Fáil have some grounds for being antagonistic.  By <Col N="323" /> and large, the real argument seemed to come from the other side of the House on the basis that Articles 2 and 3 are not for sale or are not up for discussion, alteration or amendment.  If Articles 2 and 3 represent the objectionable part of the motion for them, if they feel it is embedded in the motion or that it is contained in the Taoiseach's talks on television or radio, it is not case for rejecting the lot.  Total rejection is not the way to amend &mdash; total rejection in the sense that it is a motion proposed by Fine Gael and, therefore, is not worthy of support. If Fianna Fáil embarked on some sort of initiative not to delete Articles 2 and 3 but possibly to suggest an alteration in the wording, I wonder would people in Fianna Fáil make the argument for total rejection?  I do not think so.  I say with all sincerity that it is possibly because Fianna Fáil have been in power longer than any other party and because Éamon de Valera was the initiator of the Constitution in 1937 they would prefer if they had taken some initiative in this direction.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have taken initiatives. Their own leader got the Anglo-Irish talks under way and I would like to give him credit for that.  The fact of the matter is that we are all involved in this problem. Governments change from time to time. We on this side of the House will, in fact, find ourselves one day having to deal with the whole question of supporting matters affecting the North.  Fianna Fáil may regard as antagonistic the Taoiseach's remarks regarding Articles 2 and 3 but I do not think the matter should be considered a closed door.  It was an expression by the leader of a party who has taken an initiative.  I do not for one moment accept that all the people in Fianna Fáil or all the Senators in this House would not be amenable to some rewording of Articles 2 and 3 rather than the argument &ldquo;not an inch, no surrender&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have tabled a new motion rather than an amendment to the Government's motion.  This has given them an opportunity to soft pedal not only on the question of constitutional change but on the desirability of creating conditions favourable to unity within this island.  In <Col N="324" /> doing that they are saying they are not in the business of assisting any effort at reconciliation, that is, any effort that is taken by anyone other than Fianna Fáil.  Let us be clear on that.  It was open to Fianna Fáil and to us in the past to submit amendments.  However, amendment does not always mean that you have to delete everything after the first word and then proceed to write a new motion.  If Fianna Fáil were not satisfied with the wording of the motion and if they considered it should be altered, they should have put down the appropriate amendment. If this had been done the debate would have been a much better debate, even though I accept that the debate has been of a high standard.  It would have helped us to go about this question in a much more purposeful way, particularly on Articles 2 and 3.  However, I believe that the matter of the wording of the motion is still open.</P>
    <P>In the motion before the House Fianna Fáil are being asked to accept that yesterday's time is gone.  It is gone forever. Senator O'Leary said that.  Here we are talking about efforts to be made tomorrow. Fianna Fáil are confusing yesterday's problems.  They are holding on to preconceived notions.  They are confusing tomorrow's efforts with yesterday's problems.  This is often a very dangerous course of action.  On many occasions they have made the plea to us not to dwell on yesterday's difficulties when we have to deal with other problems.</P>
    <P>I am not asking Fianna Fáil to surrender their strong political views.  They are entitled to hold their strong political views.  They are entitled to dig in on the question of review of the Constitution.  I merely speak of the need for acquiescence on this matter, not because I believe in acquiescence in every case but because of the great seriousness of the present situation.  The motion does not ask Fianna Fáil to surrender their political views, but on a matter of such importance they should not have rewritten the motion.  I have stated that I consider the question of the wording of the motion is still open and I ask Fianna Fáil to take advantage of that opportunity.  I ask them to do this at a time when the Secretary of <Col N="325" /> State for the North of Ireland is trying to get round the question of filling the political vacuum.  I am asking them to acquiesce because the Anglo-Irish talks are running alongside that particular initiative.</P>
    <P>Even though this may not be the most major contribution ever made on the North towards this question of unity, nevertheless it is a contribution.  In many circumstances we have to let go of our own particular feelings and subjugate in some sense some of our feelings in the interests of dealing with a healthy unit.  It may be a small contribution towards creating favourable conditions for unity, but it is a contribution and it will be a demonstration to the people in the North that we are prepared to accommodate each other in the South in a way that will enable us to pursue desirable goals.  In the final analysis it does not matter which party are in government.  When the question is on the table each of us needs the activity of the other in the most positive way possible.  If Fianna Fáil were back in power and the political vacuum in the North was close to being filled, they would be asking the Opposition for their co-operation and activity on a difficult and delicate question.</P>
    <P>I for one would be one of the people, and I am sure all my colleagues would share that with me, who would be only too ready and willing in the light of the whole history of the last 12 years to make serious efforts to facilitate Fianna Fáil, if they were the Government, if they asked for this initiative.</P>
    <P>The forming of good attitudes is also something we have got to take care of. Our willingness to adopt new methods must be demonstrated, because in the long run these things are the only way to ensure a healthy campaign that will make us in the Republic acceptable.  As people of goodwill, and I speak for the lot of us, we are in no way endeavouring to destroy the traditions of dignity and freedom of our Portestant friends in the North. When certain thoughts enter my mind I wish I was in some other Chamber where I would not have to modify my language. However, in the absence of the other Chamber, I will expose my thoughts <Col N="326" /> here: I suggest to my Fianna Fáil colleagues in the Seanad that it is time for them to stop the bellyaching.  It is time for us to do away with the catchcalls and slogans which have been displacing action.  Instead of reacting let us now act.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to act without surrendering our political strength.  We have been using the catchcries and slogans for too long as a substitute for action.  No matter how slight we may expect the gain to be not only from the debate but from the general reaction to the motion, let us go after it because we cannot afford the luxury of not drawing on our strengths.  We have been too busy trying to get at each other politically.</P>
    <P>Let us now get at our strengths.  Let us take strength from each other on this occasion.  If we do, I suggest we will go a long way to create favourable conditions for unity.  I have my own views about the Constitution.  So far I have not gone to town on that aspect of the debate because it is necessary to try to deal with the entire question of whether the Opposition amendment has a useful purpose in the context of the situation now being faced in the North.  That has to be dealt with at length.  I will make some points that perhaps my Fine Gael colleagues will not hold with, perhaps, in regard to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As members of institutions we must be seen to be doing something effective to accomplish our goals and objectives. Somebody must start leading the Seanad down the road to its purpose and from that point of view it is fitting that we should begin to find the task before us. As I have said several times, and I make no apology for repeating it, the task is to fill the political vacuum in the North, in the context of the Anglo-Irish talks on the North and the Attorney General's brief to look at the Constitution.  We must accept our task, which is to do everything possible to ensure that the dialogue on unity will serve its purpose as part of the whole.  If we are not prepared to talk in an effective way about parts of the whole we will not see the day when the whole will function as a unit.  From my experience of events throughout the world &mdash; I spent nine years in the company <Col N="327" /> of Northern Ireland Protestants and I have the experience of having been a trade union official for many years &mdash; I submit that advancment will not come from what I will describe as the beleaguered minority complex, particularly on the question of unity.  We must get rid of that complex but we cannot do so unless we tune in to the fundamentals.  Having tuned in to the fundamentals, our activity should enable us to go forward in a physio-mental campaign in active unity.</P>
    <P>I have lived with the beleagured minority complex for a long time.  I have often had to take on my own trade union members who expressed this beleaguered minority complex.  These people set themselves up as the true defenders of their traditions and Constitution.  They regard it as their job as the beleagured minority to defend the <i>status quo,</i> the attitude &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;.  That is not the attitude of most working class people.  As I have said, I have made numerous efforts to bring my people along from that type of mentality.  In the final analysis I get them to agree, wherever we can find common ground for agreement.  The attitude towards maintaining the <i>status quo</i> by our Protestant brothers and sisters is not the way to demonstrate that they are people of goodwill.</P>
    <P>Of course there are obstacles, but let us turn them into a challenge.  We have the challenge here and now, and if we apply ourselves to this oppurtunity instead of negatively defending the <i>status quo</i> we can do a very good service to the Irish nation, small though it may be.  Of course, mistakes may be made.  I do not ask Fianna Fáil people to take anything for granted, but I suggest they must help us to follow through in this debate and not be negative.  There has been enough dawdling, alibi-ing, excusing and pampering each other down through the years.  That is not a very good mentality. Once you take up an attitude like that, it is very hard to change it.  In this debate I do not think that attitude need be held rigidly.  I will make one or two observations on that later on.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have rightly claimed to be the people who originated new and bold <Col N="328" /> ideas, many of which were opposed by some of their own people who did not like them but who eventually came to terms with them.  Some people in their own party disliked what they were doing, but they went ahead, to the betterment of the nation.  They knew they had a difficult road to travel, but travel the road they did to the benefit of the Irish nation. There is a history of that in Fianna Fáil in some areas which I will mention later. Some Senators who are long-standing members of Fianna Fáil find it difficult to travel down this road which does not make any great demands on them or look for any commitment from them in the sense of surrendering some strongly held political view.  They should not look at half of the picture but try to act positively and see what is available.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at what is available arising out of this debate.  This may facilitate us in trying to reach a consensus on what action needs to be taken, to what degree, and how we should take that action.  That was the mentality of the Fianna Fáil Party when they took initiatives on bold and new ideas down through the years.  What is wrong with that now? Why are they remaining blind to facts which are distasteful to them?  Where are the new and bold ideas now?  Where are the people of the calibre of the Lemass era?  Mr. Lemass knew that people's minds were in a state of flux and that they could be influenced to break away from old beliefs and old allegiances.  If he had not believed that, if he had not worked to bring his people along with him, companies like Aer Lingus might not exist, and initiatives on the North, such as the cross-Border ventures by Captain O'Neill and himself, would never have been taken.</P>
    <P>It is time we stopped living with the luxury of complacency.  We must try to do something to create favourable conditions which would assist in achieving unity.  I cannot understand the failure of a republican party to show any desire to heighten the interest of the Irish people as a whole in creating favourable conditions for achieving unity.  If the Taoiseach had chosen to use very optimistic terms when taking this initiative, I would be the <Col N="329" /> first to take him to task, because I believe total optimists are extremists.  If the motion had been framed in a totally optimistic way, suggesting that unity had arrived or was about to arrive, that would suggest to me that we were debating an end rather than a means to an end.  I cannot take him to task because he has not approached it in that way.  His is a genuine effort to persuade people that the whole question needs to be looked at in the sense that laws which have been enacted may have antagonised some people.</P>
    <P>He was honest enough to say Articles 2 and 3 should not be in our Constitution because they antagonise the Protestant people of the North.  His belief that Articles 2 and 3 should not be in the Constitution may antagonise some Fianna Fáil people but, if the debate is treated with the seriousness it deserves, and not manoeuvred by an amendment which calls for the retention of the <i>status quo,</i> there is scope for discussion on Articles 2 and 3, despite the Taoiseach's view that they should be deleted from the Constitution. Nobody will thank Fianna Fáil for opting out of facing this challenge.  If they have strong feelings about Articles 2 and 3 being deleted, they should not opt out of the debate, but get into it and come to terms with it.  The will of the Irish people, in accordance with Articles 2 and 3, is to achieve a united Ireland by peaceful means.  Those Articles reflect the duly enacted will of the majority of our people, which, I understand, must be obeyed.  Otherwise there would be a violation of the Constitution.  There is no violation if, in open debate, you bring the public with you to the point where they are sufficiently educated and geared to make a decision as to whether a constitutional change is necessary.</P>
    <P>We are not violating the rights of the majority.  We are merely talking about what it might be possible to do.  When the people read this debate and have a total knowledge of what is meant by the motion, they will be in a position to say yea or nay.  There will be no overriding the duly enacted will of the majority.  In the meantime, while we allow this debate to develop and the dialogue to continue, <Col N="330" /> we should not manoeuvre cynically by a call for a campaign that suggests the retention of the <i>statuas quo,</i> when everybody knows that the <i>status quo</i> will not suffice.  We are here dealing with the question of change.  Perhaps it is not the best analogy in the world but I put it to the House.  In this world, in our homes and daily lives we have experienced an awful lot of change.  In many cases, particularly from my experience in dealing with trade unionists.  I found often the mentality that they did not mind change so long as it affected the other fellow.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since the majority fought tooth and nail against the steam engine, the power loom and every other improvement that was suggested. Even in those days people had to come to terms with the difficult and awkward circumstances with which they were presented.  People need a chance to come to terms here in Ireland.  We must give them a chance to come to terms with the final outcome of this debate.  We cannot do that if we dwell too long on wishful and futile hopes and dreams about what steps are necessary to come into harmony with our Protestant neighbours.  We need to be seen not only to be debating but to be heading towards a course of action that will facilitate them with an opportunity of saying yea or nay to favourable conditions for unity.  If the debate as it continues is allowed develop along desirable lines the House can rest assured that, even though nothing miraculous may emerge to influence by itself conditions of greater unity, then we will at least be in a position to say that in so far as it was our duty to do so we tried hard to create a real awareness that the <i>status quo</i> will not suffice and that the philosophy of &ldquo;No Surrender&rdquo; cannot apply in this part of the Republic.  As I see it there is a great distance between two extremes with an awful lot of middle ground in between.  If Opposition Senators believe that the Taoiseach's initiative was offensive or extreme, they have their opportunity in this debate to take him to task.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of the amendment. I concluded by saying that the Taoiseach had put right some of the <Col N="331" /> wrongs that people believed in regard to Tone.  We have allowed ourselves to split hairs in regard to the way words were mentioned.  We have even had an argument about the Taoiseach's reference to Mr. de Valera saying that a Protestant could not be employed, or some such words.  I do not remember the exact wording.  The Taoiseach, where he may have given offence, has pointed out that there was no offence meant.  It is as well to understand that there was no offence meant.  It was a pity, whether or not taken out of context by the Opposition, that it was found necessary to refer to Mr. de Valera and some Portestant worker.  I can tell a little story here.  In a certain firm in this country no Catholic on this side of the Border had ever become a manager or member of the board of directors until such time as Mr. de Valera, over a meal in a certain location, had a word with the top man there.  That practice was then changed and I lived to see many Catholics attain very high positions in that institution.  So much for remarks about Mr. de Valera.  It was unfortunate the way such remarks were introduced.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with the question of the Constitution.  As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned there is a desire to create in these islands conditions favourable to unity through reconciliation of its people.  There is the need also to have a constitutional review &mdash; that is Labour Party thinking &mdash; and, if not a review, a total abolition.  We are not alone in this view.  For example, Deputy Séamus Brennan, the former General Secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party, believes that a new draft Constitution should be drawn up by an all-party committee. Mr. Michael Mills quoted him on 15 October last in <i>The Irish Press</i> as so saying in an interview to <i>Southside</i> given the day before.  According to Mr. Michael Mills Deputy Séamus Brennan intends to make a major statement on this at the Fianna Fáil Youth Conference in Cork where he will be sharing the platform with the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  On the other hand, Deputy Martin O'Donoghue said on television <Col N="332" /> that not everybody in Fianna Fáil was totally opposed to a constitutional review.  It will be seen therefore that it is not merely Fine Gael and Labour but there are also a substantial number of important people in the Fianna Fáil Party who have come to a recognition of the need to examine the Constitution with a view to its redrafting or amendment in the interests of creating favourable conditions for unity.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Constitution if, for example, it was decided to delete subsections 2 and 3 of Article 41, legislation would have to follow because their removal would not satisfy the Labour Party people.  Neither would it satisfy the civil rights of the people affected because then there would not be any provision in law for people to re-marry or to have maintenance allowances or alimony fixed.  Neither would the rights of their children be taken care of automatically as a result of such deletion.  This being so, a deletion solves nothing in itself. Legislation will have to be enacted.</P>
    <P>I merely give that as an example on the assumption that people believe that to alter our Constitution by deletions here and there would be an effective way of creating conditions favourable for unity. I make that point to broaden the discussion because if one reads the motion what we mean by a legislative review is clear. Linked with the word &ldquo;Constitutional&rdquo;, it has to be taken to mean legislation necessary as a result of a constitutional review or amendment.  Then we ask what happens in areas where legislation can be improved substantially without reference to the need for constitutional amendment. To be clear, does the motion that legislation not only arising out of any constitutional review but which is presently in existence or is proposed to be introduced, would be subject to continuous review particularly on all matters conducive to unity in the South?</P>
    <P>I have taken this argument for my own benefit to see how serious we are and what steps will be taken to ensure not only dialogue but action arising out of that dialogue.  It was said earlier that it is not something that can be rushed into but at least we should be able to set a train of <Col N="333" /> activity in motion with some time limit set on it.  We should be able to do it in such a way that if there is a change of Government the new occupants will not be able to pull out of any deliberations and so on that may have emerged.  We should aim at getting a commitment that if we get agreement to go ahead on this we will hold on to it despite the fact that there may be a change of Government.</P>
    <P>The question of private property in Article 43 disturbs us in the Labour Party.  The Kenny Report has been in existence for a long time and in the meantime much speculation and exploitation have gone on.  Despite that, no clear desire has been expressed by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or anyone else to do something about it either by introducing legislation or giving effect to some of its contents.  Meanwhile thousands of people have lost the opportunity of being housed who, if effect had been given to the bulk of the aspects of that report, would now be housed.</P>
    <P>On reading Article 43.1.2º one sees that the State guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property.  Article 43.1 deals with the exercise of the rights acknowledged in the subsection preceding it.</P>
    <P>The exercise of the rights of private ownership of external goods and the right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property ought in civil society to be regulated by principles of social justice.  We are all familiar with the word &ldquo;ought&rdquo;&mdash; ought to behave well or ought to abide by the principles of social justice.  It is a chronically weak word particularly so since no administration ever gave thought to the weakness in the Constitution and, therefore, encouraged speculators, grafters and <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism because those people only understand the words &ldquo;you must&rdquo; and &ldquo;you shall not&rdquo;.  I am not naive enough to think that to use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; will keep people from breaching something.  It would have helped a great deal but it would not have been any tremendous impediment to speculators.  I am not sure if it would be possible to use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but that is what makes <Col N="334" /> the whole debate interesting and that is what makes it all worth exploring.</P>
    <P>By pointing out the difficulties that grow up as a result of the wording of constitutional Articles I hope Senators will grasp the significance of the point I made about &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to be regulated by the principles of social justice.  We give, on the one hand, total encouragement to passing no law attempting to abolish the right to private ownership and then trust to the goodwill of those who possess wealth to distribute it equitably.  In other words, we put the equitable distribution of wealth in the hands of people who are speculators and exploiters.  Let me make it clear in case there is any confusion. The Labour Party hold that since the wealth of society has been largely inherited from the past, every man, woman and child has a right to a share in it and, accordingly, it should be recognised as a basic human claim.  One of those claims must be the right to adequate housing, a reasonable standard of living and security of tenure.  Let us be clear on this.  We do not exclude the right to recognition of private property or of inheritance within limits, limits that take real care of the public interest, democratically settled. This is where we part from other people. It is only when the property claims come into conflict with the public interest that we take issue and action.</P>
    <P>Far from wishing to abolish private property, socialism actually desires that individuals should own more of it, and more than they have a chance of getting under capitalism.  We do not oppose inheritence of property provided it does not lead to a class living on unearned income instead of income from useful work.  As regards production, we recognise private property where it is the best way of providing useful resources for general benefit and on condition that it is not made a means for the exploitation of labour.  That is the way the Labour Party think and it should be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>We do not want to nationalise all industries and services but only those which would be for the general good because nobody has a right to misuse property that the community allows him to maintain. As far as we are concerned, industry <Col N="335" /> left in private hands must be subject to control on behalf of the people.  If they abuse that trust we will expect them to consider the question of whether they should be taken into public hands.  The trust is there.  I make those points in the context of dealing with Article 43, which I hope will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>We would also stress that in any constitutional review consideration must be given to the importance of the whole question of conformity with the requirements of public planning for the best available use of resources and production and for the fair treatment of those engaged in the various enterprises as well as the consumers.  The question of the creation of employment is one that must be uppermost in our minds.  Coupled with the other points made, we insist on those considerations in any redrafting of the Constitution with specific reference to Article 43.  If we are to be concerned only with amendments, we would expect those amendments to take care of the points we have raised here; but if we are to be concerned with a total review, we would want also to be totally involved on that and on the whole aspect of social justice.</P>
    <P>Article 40 represents another area in which the working-class people will have a problem.  The trade union movement experienced great difficulty some years ago when they were presented with a very difficult problem that has lasted for a very long time.  It arose out of the case of the Educational Company v. Fitzpatrick or, if you like, the Educational Company v. the Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks.  There are real problems to be solved in this area on that Article such as minority rights and the right of freedom of association.</P>
    <P>We have a very substantial number of trade unionists across the Border.  In the North of Ireland there is a very active trade union movement whose members will be keeping a close eye on how we treat certain Articles of the Constitution and on legislation in so far as it will affect them as working-class people.  Suggestions of divisiveness on religious or social grounds are never necessary or appropriate. In fairness to the Catholic Church, <Col N="336" /> when the Constitution was amended so as to remove the special position of that Church, they did not create any uproar. It is fair to say that the Protestant bishops of the day did not care whether that Article was deleted or left in.</P>
    <P>We went some way in our constitutional amendments of 1972 to remove those provisions.  The fact that the Constitution has been amended already means that it is open to further amendment. When we realise that the American Constitution is generally and regularly subjected to consideration for amendment, we should not have any fear in a small little island like this.  I do not think that the climate was any better as a result of the removal of the provision of the special position of the Catholic Church. Times are different now.  We are in a new situation in which there is a much better opportunity of creating a better climate and we have an obligation in this respect to look at the question of how we can deal with creating favourable conditions in this part of the island.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, for example, in the declaration on religious freedom, section 6, of Vatican II, we are told that governments should ensure that the equality of citizens before the law, which is itself an element of the common good, is never violated whether openly or otherwise, for religious reasons and that neither should there be discrimination among citizens.  We may take it that the ordinary punter in Belfast or Derry or elsewhere in the other part of the island was not impressed by that declaration or else that they did not know what was said in Vatican II.  In any case we have no way of gauging whether it went any way towards replacing fear with a bit of faith. The climate was not opportune at that time, and it is interesting to note that, even on this occasion with regard to divorce, the Catholic Church are not entering into the debate at this stage. Undoubtedly they will make their statements in their own time and in their own way.</P>
    <P>There is a change of heart not only on the question of initiatives in the North but on the part of the Catholic Church. Most of the people in the North are much <Col N="337" /> more aware now that it is becoming inevitable that the people in England, having made an investment in them by the protection they have given them over the years in providing the Army and so on, want a return.  In this sense many of the Protestant people perhaps will want to start moving in a constructive way towards facilitating those initiatives.  The initiatives were not brought down on the last occasion by political activity but by a strike.  We have now an opportunity of making a more significant response.</P>
    <P>The more I read the amendment to this motion, the more I am puzzled.  As reported in the <i>American Foreign Affairs Journal,</i> 1972, Mr. Jack Lynch, speaking on the Anglo-Irish problem, said that the 1937 Constitution as it stands is not suitable for a new Ireland, that the Constitution of a new Ireland would have to be a written one with a firm and explicit guarantee for the rights and liberties of all who live under it.  He said that he would tend to favour the view that these guarantees should relate to the individual citizen rather than to institutions as such and that Constitution makers should perhaps take a minimal approach, not to start from broad philosophical assumptions but instead to try to piece together an agreement on what is necessary for Government to function while ensuring rights and liberties to the individual.  He said this would go some way towards putting us into a favourable position for dialogue.</P>
    <P>There are factions in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, but on the occasions that Mr. Lynch made those statements they were welcomed by all of Fianna Fáil, so much so that the speeches in that period appeared in booklet form.  There was no dissenting voice in Fianna Fáil about the statement of the ex-Taoiseach when he spoke in America then.  That is indicative of the point I made earlier, that there are many important people in Fianna Fáil who really believe that the Constitution needs to be looked at.  They believe that that will go some way towards facilitating the creation of conditions favourable to the initiatives on the North.  The former General Secretary of Fianna Fáil, the former Taoiseach and <Col N="338" /> Deputy O'Donoghue all believe that some changes should take place.  The amendment contradicts not only the motion but also the thoughts of the ex-Taoiseach. In a lot of ways it may contradict some of the private thoughts of the present Taoiseach.  However, I will not dwell any further on that.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the contents of Article 41 were not in the Constitution of 1922 and were first introduced in 1937.  Article 41 goes further than the Church.  The Church laws now on the question of nullity and marriages being dissolved are much more advanced than those of the State.  The problem is that because of the State's attitude although nullity may be granted by the Church, the parties cannot re-marry.  Everyone knows that in such cases the Catholic Church permits re-marriage and I am not making any revelation when I say that. The dissolution of a marriage is represented only in one strain and as long as Article 41 remains as it is with the State prohibiting the dissolution of marriage we will have this crazy situation affecting a lot of people, not just on the basis of denying a civil right but also because they are going through cruel and difficult times.  I do not mind admitting that this matter came home to me through one of my children.  I understand the misery and suffering that people can be subjected to in those circumstances, particularly where it is allowed to drag on and no effective action is taken to alleviate it.  It is all right to say that somebody has compassion. Real compassion must be in an examination of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage so that the people affected, who have suffered so long, and the children of those marriages, may be given the fullest protection of the law and enabled to embark on a new life for themselves where they can gain some happiness. They are entitled to that as a basic civil right.  If it goes to the test of a referendum in this area and the referendum is defeated, so be it.  We can then no longer be accused of not having regard to the terrible strain put on families who find themselves in those circumstances. We can no longer be accused of not making an endeavour in that direction.  In the <Col N="339" /> process, despite the fact that the referendum might be beaten, we will have gained a lot of knowledge that we can bring to bear on dealing with this question of the family.  From that we will find a way to ease and make less acute the problems in those situations.</P>
    <P>A hard core in the North, particularly those who have seen their nearest and dearest gunned down maybe while standing behind the counter of a shop or looking at television, have no good reason to talk or think about the question of unity. Be that as it may, many people who have not suffered this problem and many who have suffered and have had this serious harm inflicted on them who would be glad and are willing to seek a way forward. We at this end of the country are the majority and if we are not seen to wish to create political initiatives which will facilitate them either to fill their own political vacuum in the North or to create conditions favourable to them if they want eventually to get round to the question of unity, then we will be doing an injustice to them.  We must tune in to minds that are in a state of flux.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that in the 1937 Constitution there was only a certain distance one could go to satisfy the minority; one could not go too far.  Now we need a central code of Articles that would be acceptable to North and South.  We should not in our arguments act in a mischievous manner or misrepresent ourselves as mischievous people, particularly when we are talking about altering, amending, or repairing the Constitution &mdash; whatever way you like to describe it. We should ensure that any approach we make is not done in a mischievous manner which would represent us as sectarian people.  There were arguments throughout the week that we were not a sectarian people.  I will be quite honest.  I do not know whether we are.  I wonder if the question of sectarianism really confines itself to whether a person of one religion is discriminated against as distinct from a person professing another religion.  If 75 per cent of the wealth of the country is owned by 5 per cent of the people, is that discrimination by the process of law <Col N="340" /> or is it just something that accidentally happened?  Are our laws or our Constitution discriminatory in this way?  If they are they affect many people.  Some sort of enactment or new Article is necessary to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>The Constitution will have to be framed, reviewed, altered or amended and put in simple language with principles and ideals which will influence and direct people.  The question of when we can enact a new Constitution also arises. Can we talk about a new Constitution in the sense that we want to create favourable conditions towards unity while the people whom we are trying to influence do not at present have an opportunity of voting on any alterations that may take place in the amendment?  It seems a little ridiculous to suggest that they might have a vote on it because in the final analysis if we did get around to the question of a united Ireland they would have a vote then.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that we are charged with the obligation on this side of the Border to make sure that the constitutional amendments will be acceptable to the people in the North, because at present they are not in a position to vote on them.  Therefore, we must make it simpler for them when the time to vote comes.  We must, in the Constitution, reflect all the values and meet the legitimate interests of all sections of the people.  I doubt if an examination of the Constitution would reveal that we behave in that way.  We need to make sure, in any reframing amendment or altering of the Constitution, that hearts and minds are guided towards unity on political, social and economic purposes.</P>
    <P>There have been many changes since our Constitution was adopted.  People in the North have their problems in the sense that the Northern Constitution recognises in a special way the Grand Lodge.  This is also a problem for people in the North, especially Catholics.  If we are seen to be taking the initiative here that will also be one of the areas which will be tackled on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I am not going into detailed argument about Article 3, but it says that our legislation <Col N="341" /> is binding on people in the North. While it is not necessary to delete that kind of thing perhaps it is necessary to have a look at its wording.  In this way Fianna Fáil could be facilitated.  I agree that it would be difficult to remove it <i>in toto</i>, but at the same time I could not accept it in its present form if we are speaking of creating conditions favourable to people for the purpose of unity. One cannot legislate for people over whom one has no control and say that they must accept it.  However, I will not go into that in great depth.</P>
    <P>People on the opposite side here have confused the means with the end.  The motion merely asks us to facilitate the creation of conditions which would be favourable to unity.  It does not claim to suggest it is an end in itself.  We are not dealing with the question of being totally Gaelic as was expressed by some of the Fianna Fáil people.  When the question of the Constitution comes up, even though the Taoiseach has talked about republicanism, if we are talking about a united Ireland in the final analysis we will not be writing a republican constitution, we will be writing an Irish constitution. Somebody may not agree but that is the reality.  Inevitably down here we will be writing a republican constitution, but if it comes to a referendum on unity we will be writing an Irish constitution and not a republican constitution.</P>
    <P>The question of unity has been bedeviling us for a very long time.  There has been enough suffering, hardship, distraction and economic disaster, particularly in the North of Ireland where one in five is unemployed, and where people live in fear.  It behoves us to practise the art of compromise.  I make that strong appeal to Fianna Fáil.  I believe the door is ajar and that we can do it.  Are they trying to suggest there are no problems on this side of the Border?  Are they trying to suggest that we have not legislated in a way that, for example, the bottom 20 per cent of the nation's households share only 4 per cent of the total income?  Do they believe that should continue?  Do they believe this is social justice?  Do they believe that people on this side of the Border should go to bed hungry when others have more <Col N="342" /> than enough to live on?  Do they believe there is an equitable distribution of wealth?  Do they believe that everything is perfect here?  I do not for one minute believe they do.</P>
    <P>They have an obligation to deprived people on this side of the Border in addition to deprived people on the other side of the Border to take this whole question of creating favourable conditions for unity more seriously, since they will get an opportunity by contributing to any constitutional review or change in any legislation that will come before the House.  That is something worth thinking about, because if they share my views that everything is not right in respect of the equitable distribution of wealth, in respect of the right of people to have houses, security of tenure etc., in respect of the right of the socially deprived to be treated fairly, then they must at least look at the Constitution in its total context and at the legislation the enactment of which they took part.  They must ask if they have a duty towards the socially deprived on both sides of the Border to create conditions favourable to unity which in its whole concept will help to bring about a better type of Ireland where privileged positions will be a thing of the past.  I make that plea.  I am sorry for going on so long, but we have a problem here that can be resolved.  The door is ajar.  It is not closed.  I do not totally agree with the tone of the Taoiseach's approach but support it in principle, will vote in favour of it and give any assistance possible towards its development along natural objective lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by referring to the final sentence of Senator Harte's speech.  He said in passing that he was not totally pleased with the tone of the Taoiseach's speech.  Very few of us Republicans are, indeed, happy with the Taoiseach's approach to Tone.  I will be dealing with that point later on but, first of all, want to come back, mentally and intellectually, to the motion before us and what it implies.  It is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go bhféachann Seanad Éireann go báúil ar na tuairimí a nocht an Taoiseach <Col N="343" /> san agallamh raidió a thug sé ar RTE an 27 Meán Fómhair, 1981, i dtaobh a inmhianaithe atá faoi dálaí a bhunú ar an oileán seo a rachadh chun fábhair don aontacht trína phobal a thabhairt chun muintearais agus athbhreithniú Bunreachtúil agus reachtúil a dhéanamh sa Stát seo chun na críche sin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Go bhféachann Seanad Éireann go báúil ar na tuairimí a nocht an Taoiseach&rdquo;. Pé sceal é, ní fhéachaim-se go báúil ar na tuairimí a nocht sé.  Ní dóigh liom go bhféachfadh aon phoblachtánach nó fíor-Éireannach go báúil ar na tuairimí sin.  Cad as go dtáinig na tuairimí?  Sílim féin gur fhás na tuairimí sin in aigne an Taoisigh tré mhí-thuiscint ar chuspoírí agus ar meón Tone agus Davis.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment, doubt the sincerity of the Taoiseach in what he said in that radio interview.  He believed what he said.  I missed the early part of his speech but when I turned on the radio at about 1.30 p.m. on that Sunday, I recognised the voice.  I was impressed, as anyone should be, by the tone of sincerity that seemed to be there.  He spoke apparently from his heart and as a man who was convinced he was doing what was right.  However, I was shocked when I saw, straight away, that he was basing his whole thesis on false premises.  If a person bases an argument on false premises, it is inevitable that the conclusions will be false and misleading and anything flowing from those conclusions must, of necessity, be foolish and ill-advised.</P>
    <P>If we look at the transcript, which I was very grateful to get, we see exactly what he said during that interview.  One may say that this was adjusted afterwards when the Taoiseach came into the House on 9 October and read a statement which retracted much of what he had said on the radio.  The notice we have here before us deals with the radio interview and of the two &mdash; his speech on the radio and the speech he made in this House on 9 October &mdash; the one he made on the radio was probably nearer to his heart.  He seemed to speak with conviction and most of us would agree &mdash; we have radio <Col N="344" /> and television long enough &mdash; that not alone <i>in vino</i> but also <i>in radio veritas.</i> On page 8 of the transcript, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Let us come back to the basic issue. I believe passionately in a united Ireland and I believe in a united Ireland based on the principles enunciated by Tone and Davis.  I came into politics for two reasons in 1965 because I had seen, over the previous decades, as I passed through my teens, twenties and thirties, this State developing along lines that Tone and Davis would have abhorred.</P>
    <P>I totally and absolutely reject that statement which arises from the fact that the Taoiseach, for whom everybody has great respect and who is a sincere man, does not appear to know Tone and Davis. I will not be so presumptuous as to suggest that he would start to read, study and understand Tone and Davis.  I hope he will, but to bring our minds back to the real Tone and the real Davis, I will read what I think was the basis of Tone's philosophy.</P>
    <P>Remember that Tone was only 35 years of age when he left this life.  He had gone through a lot.  He had an extraordinary upbringing.  He was under extraordinary influences.  He was a man of extraordinary intellect and intelligence and a very sincere man in what he said and did.  As we say colloquially, he made no bones about it.  Sometimes he is defamed as being a godless man.  He was nothing of the kind.  Time and time again in his diary, you will find very religious references and you will find his repeated use of God's name.  In his letters to his wife and to his mother, there is great compassion and Christianity written all over them.</P>
    <P>Pearse spoke very highly of him in that regard.  I quote from a copy of <i>The Wolfe Tone Annual 1948,</i> in which Pearse is quoted:</P>
    <P>He believed in God and never spoke or wrote a word that could be construed to show that he was not a Christian. It is plain from all he wrote, and especially in all he wrote privately to his wife, that he believed firmly in God and in Jesus Christ His Son.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> The basis of Tone's political philosophy was this &mdash; this is taken from his speech from the dock, with which I am sure everybody in this House is familiar.  Famous speeches from the dock are legion:</P>
    <P>From my earliest youth I have regarded the connection between Great Britain and Ireland as the curse of the Irish nation, and felt convinced that, whilst it lasted, this country could never be free or happy.  My mind has been confirmed in this opinion by the experience of every succeeding year and the conclusions which I have drawn from every fact before my eyes. In consequence, I was determined to employ all my powers which my individual efforts could move, in order to separate the two countries.</P>
    <P>In short, break the connection with England.</P>
    <P>I have laboured to create a people in Ireland by raising three millions of my countrymen to the rank of citizens.  I have laboured to abolish the infernal spirit of religious persecution by uniting the Catholics and Dissenters.  To the former I owe more than ever can be repaid.</P>
    <P>That was Tone's philosophy.  It is completely inadmissable and invalid for anybody at this time, in a Twenty-six County State, to suggest what Tone would or would not have said about what should or should not be done, because neither Tone nor Davis could possibly have conceived in their time anything but a physical island of Ireland with one State.  It was beyond their comprehension.  The Taoiseach's argument is totally invalid and must fall there.</P>
    <P>When I was talking about Tone and the charges often made against him of being totally irreligious, of being atheistic and so on, I should have said his best friend, Thomas Russell, the man from God knows where, was born near where I live.  He died when he was very young; I think he was about 42 years.  He was a man of deeply religious convictions.  He was a Protestant, a scholar, and his dying <Col N="346" /> wish was not granted before he was executed. He wanted to finish some religious writings he was pursuing.  He was Wolfe Tone's dearest and nearest friend.  If one reads Tone's diaries, one will see Tone's references to the very happy days he, his wife and children spent when Thomas Russell and his father came to visit them.</P>
    <P>Davis is much nearer to us.  I am sure everybody in this House has read and reread Davis' magnificent set of essays. Unfortunately, he only lived to the age of 31.  He died in Dublin; to everybody's consternation he slipped through their fingers.  I am sure everyone has sung his songs and the Taoiseach might take this suggestion, made in all good faith, that we do not hear half enough of Davis' songs on radio and television nowadays. His songs show a kindliness, a Christianity, a charity and a patriotism that we can all admire and which we should all emulate.  Davis puts it very nicely in one of his poems, <i>Celts and Saxons.</i> As regards the religious part he says:</P>
    <P>What matter that at different shrines.</P>
    <P>We pray unto one God&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The important part is &ldquo;We pray unto one God&rdquo;.  Remember Tone who spoke about Catholic, Protestant, Dissenter, said we could all come together under the common name of Irishmen, but we could all have our own religious beliefs.  That is a very important point in the times we are living in.</P>
    <P>Page 9 of the transcript reads:</P>
    <P>This State became, in the '30's particularly, '40's and '50's and indeed right through until recent times, a State that is not the non-sectarian State that they sought to establish, in which Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter would feel equally at home.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They&rdquo; refers to Tone and Davis.  I challenge anybody to say how they could possibly arrive at a conclusion that Tone's and Davis' ideal simply meant to have a State where there would be no religious practices of any kind.  I have already shown that it would be accepted that people of various religious denominations would have perfect liberty to practise <Col N="347" /> their faith, but for political purposes they would all be united under the common name of Irishmen.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>It has become the State imbued by the ethos of the majority of the people who live in this part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suppose that is not an unnatural phenomenon. In this part of Ireland we are 96 per cent Catholic, or having the label &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo;, and it is reasonable that there would be some reflection in our laws and institutions of the thinking of such an overwhelming majority.</P>
    <P>In the Six-County State, the Catholic population is about 35 per cent and little of their philosophy or thinking is reflected in the laws there.  They are not considered very much or are they taken into consideration at all?  One must consider that Britain, which rules the Six Counties, is one of the most sectarian States in Europe.  By definition, no Catholic could become King or Queen of Britain because by law the monarch is head of the established Church.  I do not think I can ever remember hearing of any British Prime Minister of the Catholic persuasion, whereas in our State, with about 96 per cent of our population Catholic, two of our most distinguished Presidents were of the Protestant faith &mdash; I refer to An Dochtúir Dubhghlas de hÍde and Erskine Childers.</P>
    <P>Something has gone wrong with the thinking of the Taoiseach.  If his thinking is based on false premises, his conclusions must be wrong also.  He berates the Constitution and finds fault with it repeatedly through his whole address.  He states:</P>
    <P>I saw this country being partitioned initially by the British who drew the line and established the Northern Ireland State, but also being partitioned by constitutions and laws being passed here which were alien to the people of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is true that the British drew the line.  It was very well thought out.  They got the biggest possible area where they could be sure of a majority forever more.  It was one of the most perfect jobs ever done <Col N="348" /> down through the centuries.  They still have the Unionist majority and they intend to keep it.  The whole problem as far as the Six County area is concerned is not essentially a question of religion at all; it is a question of power and privilege.</P>
    <P>Some of my best friends are Protestants. I meet them in many parts of this country and Europe.  We never had a disagreement and it never interfered with our friendship.  In that context I must praise from the bottom of my heart the excellent contribution made by Senator John Blennerhasset yesterday.  He spoke as a sincere, dedicated Protestant and Irishman, a sincere and dedicated Kerry Republican.  I know him for quite a time and it was only recently I learned that Senator Blennerhasset is a Protestant.  I did not know that.</P>
    <P>I would like to read the comments of a distinguished Protestant Bishop.  He is the Right Reverend Dr. Empey, Bishop of Limerick, Killaloe, Ardfert and Aghadoe. As reported in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 11 October, he stated:</P>
    <P>I happen to believe that on the whole we have a very fine Constitution which has served us well during the past 50 years and continues to do so.  I, for one, would be loath to use the emotive description of &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; in reference to it for in by far the greater part of it we find embodied in it principles which are shared by all Christians.</P>
    <P>That is a very important point.  It is a time for all Christians both South of the Border and North and in Britain, whatever small number of Christians we have left there, to advert to the fact that we hold very much in common.  The great enemy at the moment is not <i>per se</i> a Protestant or a Catholic &mdash; we are not inimical to anybody &mdash; it is the onslaught of the aetheistic attack on Christian institutions. There is a very strong lobby in every country trying to tear Christianity down.  In our part of the world a sort of an Anglo-Saxon consumerist philosophy is being urged on people through the media, agitators, lecturers and so-called philosophers.  There are also lobbies for <Col N="349" /> divorce courts, contraception, abortion and all the other evils that go with it.</P>
    <P>Dr. Empey also stated as follows:</P>
    <P>A further warning needs to be sounded.  If it is seen that changes in the Constitution are necessary I hope that these will be made because they are right and true and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers on the Government side were inclined to charge us here with a basic reluctance to tolerate any sort of change at all.  That charge is totally absurd.  We must have change as time goes on and changes have been made.  I distinctly remember speaking on Article 44 and pointing out that I was delighted to vote for a change there.  I also pointed out that it would not make the slightest difference to the thinking of the Unionists in the North, and I was right.  Any person who studies these matters and is honest about it knows quite well that if we were all to come together and march in a body with bands and banners to the Hill of Tara and publicly and solemnly burn every copy of our Constitution, it would not make one iota of difference to the thinking of Unionist diehards in the Six Counties.  They are not interested in the Constitution.  Those people are thinking of just two things &mdash; power and privilege. Steps were taken when the State was founded to make sure they would have that majority <i>in perpetuo</i> and they mean to keep it.</P>
    <P>Dr. Empey further stated:</P>
    <P>It would, I believe, be a sad mistake to use any change as a means of wooing the Northern Unionist.  That would be an insult to his intelligence and he will not be slow in seeing through it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's well-intentioned campaign or crusade is blocked already.</P>
    <P>In case anybody has any doubts about it, on the day the Taoiseach came to the House and spoke, on 9 October, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that a group had come from the Six Counties the day before and presented a detailed document &mdash; a 3,000 word document &mdash; called &ldquo;The Unionists' Case.&rdquo;  They had copies of it and they met the Taoiseach, the <Col N="350" /> Leader of the Opposition and, possibly, some others.  <i>The Irish Times</i> puts it in a nutshell in one short paragraph:</P>
    <P>In a detailed document the group added that it would be wrong to suggest that Northern Unionists would consent to unification even if changes were made.</P>
    <P>We should know now where we stand as far as the Northern Unionists are concerned. Let us be clear on one thing.  This is a dreadful mistake and we are all inclined to make it.  This false equation &mdash; this might not be the happiest way to describe an equation, an equation could not be false, but this one is &mdash; that Unionist equals Protestant or Protestant equals Unionist has no validity whatever; it is not true.  Any argument or suggestion made on that basis is bound to be harmful.</P>
    <P>Returning to the transcript, the Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>I believe this part of the country has slipped gradually into partitionist attitude, set up institutions which are satisfactory to the people down here, but could not be the basis on which any discussion could take place with Unionists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If and when the time comes, and please God it will come, when we will sit down at a table to hammer out a new Constitution then everything can be put on the table but if we are going to weaken our position already, if we going to the fair hoping to get the best price for our animal and disclose early on the lowest which we are prepared to take for the animal then we will get a very bad bargain in the end.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>I believe it is my job, now that I am in a position of leadership to try to lead our people to understand how it was we,...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We&rdquo; means you and I and all the rest of us.</P>
    <P>... who have divided this island;</P>
    <P>As we hear on the quiz shows, true or false, and I can hear everybody whispering inaudibly, false, totally false.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> The Taoiseach went on:</P>
    <P>I want to lead a crusade, a republican crusade...</P>
    <P>That is mentioned on the cover of the copy of the transcript I have and it is one of the first things I heard on Sunday, 27 September, when I turned on the radio. I began to wonder about this because not terribly long ago in my life time the word &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; was a dirty word.  I will not say any more on that because I have many memories that hurt when I think of the things that were said about us, republicans, and the things that were done.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to lead a crusade&rdquo; the Taoiseach said.  A crusade has always the connotation in my mind of activity or a campaign to do something praiseworthy. History shows that well-intentioned and all as the crusades were to free the Holy Land from the Turks, many of the crusaders did not live up to pious, Christian standards, but most of them did.  But always one thinks of something very good, but I am afraid the Taoiseach's excursion on these things and on these matters will not be very good.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>I want to lead a crusade, a republican crusade, to make this a genuine republic.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between a republic and a genuine republic?  We have been saturated with a lot of terminology since this debate started.  I noted a few &mdash; I will not comment on all of them because it would take too long, although it would be a fascinating exercise.  We have republic, republican, republicanism and we have a general republic; we have Protestants, Ulster Protestants and Southern Protestants.  What does a Protestant mean?  I would think of a Protestant &mdash; man or woman &mdash; as one who practises the Protestant faith and practices it as a Protestant should.  Basically, the Protestant believes in God and in Jesus Christ, the Sermon on the Mount, the Ten Commandments and all these things which we, basically, believe in ourselves.  We heard of the people of Britain, Unionists and this place called &ldquo;Ulster.&rdquo;  Ulster, for <Col N="352" /> me, was always made up of nine counties. We got the names off by heart when we were small and we never forgot them. Ulster is a convenient tag by certain British politicians for the Six Country state.</P>
    <P>Then we heard the very dangerous one, a pluralist society.  The understanding of many people who refer to a pluralist society seems to be a state where there is no religion of any kind.  That is not a pluralist society.  A pluralist society simply means a society where we have plurality of communities.  If it is to be a coherent state the needs &mdash; religious, social, economic, linguistic &mdash; of these communities will be seen to.  That is real pluralism in society.  Please God when we have a united country &mdash; God hardly created the island for any lesser purpose than that &mdash; we will have a pluralist society, and every creed will have to be taken care of.</P>
    <P>In the Six Counties 35 per cent of the people belong to what we would call our idea of an Irish nation, but they were never recognised as such.  They are not facilitated in any way either educationally, culturally or otherwise.  They have to conform with what is already there for the majority.  Here, thank God, every effort is made, and no stone is left unturned, to facilitate the religious, social practices and educational requirements of the Protestant community.  That is well understood.  I have never seen so far in my life any trace whatever of sectarianism.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to something which Senator Gemma Hussey said, while the Senator is in the House.  She was following on the lines of the Taoiseach's argument.  At column 21, volume 96 of the Seanad Official Report, she says:</P>
    <P>What areas of sectarianism or denominationalism spring to mind?  A person's name, the school he went to, where he works, where he lives, can often bracket him as different.  He is a Protestant; he is a Catholic; he is a Jew.  Barriers go up.</P>
    <P>I never found any barriers anywhere.  I was reared in a community where the majority of the people were Catholics. <Col N="353" /> We had quite a big sprinkling of Protestants, some very wealthy, some not quite so wealthy.  We had farmers, business people, shopkeepers, tradesmen and so on.  The local Protestant painter was the man who always painted our church and nobody else.  We usually dealt with Protestant shopkeepers.  When I was a little lad my father told me that for years they always had a Protestant on the local team.  Later on during my own hurling and football days I can recall the happy hours we spent when I played centre half back and on my right, invariably, was a local Protestant farmer.  Nobody questioned whether he was a dissenter or a Protestant, a Jew or a Mohammedan, as long as he hit the ball in the right direction at the right time and as long as the match was won.  There were no barriers of any kind.  For that reason I would be inclined to take the Senator to task, if I may, although I know she said what she did in all sincerity.</P>
    <P>She asks:</P>
    <P>Has the Gaelic Athletic Association, that powerful, noble and historic body, fallen into the trap &mdash; so easy and so widespread &mdash; of confusing Irishness with membership of one church?</P>
    <P>Certainly in my lifetime I never came across any instance of it.  The same thing applied &mdash; and this is a very personal matter here again &mdash; to the statement:</P>
    <P>Why are the community's national schools still divided along religious lines?</P>
    <P>I have been teaching for the best part of my life, well over 40 years, and the vast majority of the children in the various schools I taught in, three or four during my whole lifetime, were Catholics.  We had Protestants and they were as dear to us as the Catholic children we had under our care.  We gave them every facility.  If they wanted to attend religious worship or anything of that nature, we did everything possible to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have had people of various religions coming from abroad to settle in the parish, some from the United States and some from Britain, for the simple reason that they were so disenchanted <Col N="354" /> with the type of life they were trying to rear their children in.  They came to Ireland for sanctuary.  We worked in accordance with what the parents wished us to do.  We facilitated the children in every way and they were happy and contented children.  The parents often came along and told us how glad they were they had made the change because they were now living in a civilised community where there was no taint of persecution and where every one of the children could live in safety.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey also mentioned the Irish language.  She asks,</P>
    <P>Has the Irish language been used as a lever against Protestants unwilling to study it?</P>
    <P>Not that I ever heard of.  Some of our finest scholars in the language, some of our finest speakers, belong to the Protestant faith.  I will not detain the House by going through all these points.  I could answer most of them.  The only one I am not familiar with is the point:</P>
    <P>Why has there not been a proliferation of the Dalkey and Bray-type school projects?</P>
    <P>I do not know what these are, but I think I may be right in saying that we are into multi-denominational schools or something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the reason for the non-proliferation of these is that the people did not want them.  Normally Protestants want to send their children to Protestant schools, if they are available, and Catholics like to send their children to Catholic schools.  There is nothing at all wrong with that.  Again we have the Catholic, Protestant, Dissenter.  Politically we can all unite under the common name of Irishmen.  A point which apparently was forgotten in the Taoiseach's thinking is that we were a persecuted people down through the centuries.  By the grace of God we managed to survive the persecutions of the Penal Laws.  As a persecuted people having gone through all that, I have always felt that we go out <Col N="355" /> of our way to accommodate people of various religious beliefs.  We have always done that and, please God, we will always continue to do so.</P>
      <P>As time is moving on, I come to the final stages of my address.  We come to what I think is the unkindest cut of all.  It is the Taoiseach's statement:</P>
      <P>If I were a northern protestant today, I cannot see how I could be attracted to getting involved with a State, which is itself sectarian,...</P>
      <P>That, to my mind, is a dreadful sentiment to put on paper or to enunciate in a radio address.  It is as much as telling the Northern Unionists &ldquo;Stay where you are, have nothing to do with us down here.&rdquo; I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>Let me say a short word now about Articles 2 and 3.  Early on in his radio address that day the Taoiseach spoke very clearly in regard to his attitude to Articles 2 and 3.  Article 2 is simply a statement of fact.  In regard to Article 3, some people find fault with the language in it.  I have examined both the English text and the basic Irish text and possibly the wording could be changed without doing any harm.  It was suggested some years ago that it could be changed to meet the requirements of mining concerns or some such thing.  I want to come now to what the Taoiseach said about it. He said:</P>
      <P>I was asked the question by the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in an interview, as to whether I thought Articles 2 and 3 should or should not be in the Constitution, and I said honestly, as I have always said when asked that question, they should not be.</P>
      <P>Articles 2 and 3, according to the Taoiseach, should not be in our Constitution. In other words, he does not accept that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.  That certainly is an alarming admission.  Somebody may say to me &ldquo;You have been speaking for some time.  Have you any suggestions to make?&rdquo; I have, and they will be very short and to the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> Britain should recognise the traditional Irish nation in the Six-County area, the 35 per cent of the population who are in communion with us.  We must not forget those people.  Certainly, if we were to take Articles 2 and 3 out of the Constitution, it would be the final act of betrayal of these people.  As well as that, it would weaken our position if our case comes before international courts at any time. It would mean that we would surrender our claim to be who we are and what we are.  Britain should recognise the Irish nation and see that they can live as a community within that.  If they want a state there, let it be a pluralist state in the real sense, and through legislation these 35 per cent should get the rights they are entitled to, socially, educationally and economically.</P>
    <P>On our side we should make use of every opportunity to impress on the Ulster Unionists &mdash; I am not talking about Protestants now &mdash; that the only place in which they can achieve their full potential is in a Thirty-two county state. Then they will have a real voice and they can make a real contribution.  Senator Seán O'Leary was right when he said last night that very few of them know about our Constitution.  Perhaps one good thing could come out of this debate; perhaps they would read our Constitution.  In fact, perhaps a lot more of our own people should read our Constitution, too.</P>
    <P>There are two things that would contribute most to a lasting solution.  First, Britain should withdraw this guarantee. As long as that is there the Unionists are in a strong position to last there forever more, away beyond our time and our children's time.  If that guarantee were gone I could see the beginning of the fall of the Walls of Jericho.  Second, there should be an undertaking to withdraw the British Army from the North at the earliest possible opportunity and to see that financial aid would be given to the Six-County area which might in some way help to put right the terrible wrongs inflicted on the unfortunate people there, Unionists and Nationalists, because they have all been conditioned by the demogogues and by the political dinosaurs that bellow around the place into believing <Col N="357" /> that they hate each other.  They have been brutalised on both sides.</P>
    <P>I will read an extract here which will be of interest to everybody.  It was written some years ago.  Presently I will give the name of the writer and the name of book from which I quote:</P>
    <P>So long as there are British troops in Ireland so long will the Orangemen hold out.  While they can look to Britain they will not turn towards the South.  They are not giving up their ascendancy without a struggle.  Any Irishman who creates and supports division amongst us is standing in the way of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the following page it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>With the British gone the Orangeman loses that support which alone made him strong enough to keep his position of domination and isolation. Without British support he becomes what he is, one of a minority in the Irish Nation.  His rights are the same as those of every Irishman.  He has no rights other than those.</P>
    <P>The name of the book is <i>The Path To Freedom</i>, published by the Mercier Press of Cork and the writer was Michael Collins.</P>
    <P>May God grant that the day will come when we will have an understanding, when we can meet our Protestant friends, no matter where we go, in safety &mdash; Protestants of all denominations.  May God speed the day when the Unionist will realise what he is doing and where he is going.  He is going nowhere.  I do not know of any state in the history of the world where there is anything comparable with Six-Counties' Unionism.  I am afraid that this crusade initiated by the Taoiseach &mdash; crusade or campaign call it what you will &mdash; is not doing anything to bring that day a minute sooner.  I had hopes that it would come in the near future &mdash; the day when the political dinosaurs of the North would lie down and pass away quietly to mark the end of what, politically or archaeologically, one could call the Triassic political Period of the Six-Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout this debate we have had more than 20 contributions. Indeed, many of them have been stimulating.  I feel somewhat like the dog who has come to his twentieth lamppost. There is not a lot left.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome warmly the opening of a debate on the laws and Constitution of the country to create conditions favourable to a united Ireland.  At long last it has been recognised that we have a mature and educated population in this island, the Catholic population, which does not need its firmly-held personal beliefs bolstered by statements or legal provisions that can be construed by some as inspired by the rulings of one church.  At long last it also recognises that the aspiration to Irish unity must be taken seriously.  All of the parties in this House believe that the path to unity must be by peaceful reconciliation.  If so, we are drawn directly on to creating an atmosphere in our part of the island which will not make Unionists recoil from the building of closer links with us.  The retention of provisions which are interpreted, or even misinterpreted, as the case may be, as a veiled threat of coercion cannot create such an atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the suggestion in the amendment that this debate has damaged the cause of reconciliation.  I could understand the view that it will not persuade Unionists of the desirability of a united Ireland.  I have no illusions that it will have any immediate effect.  However, I share the Taoiseach's vision that this debate is worthwhile for our own community and, by displaying some understanding of Northern Protestant feeling and Northern Unionist feeling, it will also in time be worthwhile towards unity.  Perhaps, if not immediately, the younger people in the North, the younger Protestants and Unionists, will recognise this gesture.  If anything has damaged the cause of reconciliation it was the claims, reported in the newspapers, by the Opposition that Northern Unionists would continue ruthlessly to exploit their strong political position to assure their superiority.  They were saying that, no matter what changes the Taoiseach and <Col N="359" /> his allies made in the South, Northern Unionists would not want to join a united Ireland.  Those sort of statements are counter-productive.  The whole Northern Unionist community is being tarred with one brush of vexatious opposition.  Yet at the very same time, it is affirmed that we believe that the only way the present divided state of this island should be modified is with the consent of a substantial section of that same Northern Unionist community.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to review the laws and Constitution to create conditions favourable to unity.  The scope of that review can be interpreted in the broad sense of making Ireland a more just, compassionate and tolerant society, or in the narrower sense it revolves on whether we should leave statements in our Constitution that can misrepresent our views about the divided state of this island.</P>
    <P>It seems that all sides in this House are agreed on three points.  They are that there is a deep aspiration in the South to see the unity of this island.  The second point on which there is agreement is that that unity can only and should only be brought with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland, not necessarily the agreement of every vexatious opponent but the agreement of a majority in Northern Ireland.  The third point that people in the South are agreed on is that we have a special concern for the welfare of the Catholic community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The disagreement in this debate seems to centre on whether the existing Constitution misrepresents these three views. To my mind that question can be resolved in a fairly dispassionate way.  The accusations of sell-out and of national abasement that have been thrown about outside this House are offensive.  It is my belief that the Constitution should state these three principles directly and unambiguously in place of Articles 2 and 3 which I think most people have interpreted as trying to say that.</P>
    <P>I think the intent of the review of the Constitution has been misrepresented by the Opposition.  They stated that Articles 2 and 3 are &ldquo;the simple expression of our national aspiration to unity&rdquo; and to <Col N="360" /> remove them would be to say that we have no interest in unity.  Again, they stated that &ldquo;to start abandoning national aspirations and ideals piecemeal in advance of some new political settlement was fruitless.&rdquo;  It must be perfectly clear that this side of the House does not intend to abandon national aspirations piecemeal or indeed in any other fashion, but we believe that a political settlement will not be reached until there is a movement from entrenched positions.  The first move must come from the South, the largest community involved.  As Senator Dooge said in his speech, if we are to wait to be the last to move there is nothing surer than that nobody will make a move.</P>
    <P>I believe that Articles 2 and 3 are far more than the simple expression of our aspirations.  Article 2 is more than just a statement of geography, as Senator Cranitch seems to indicate.  If that is all it was, it would have no purpose in the Constitution. It contains the suggestion, that is more explicit in Article 3, that the scope of jurisdiction of the Oireachtas is over the Thirty-two Counties.  In a democratic society there cannot be a claim of right to jurisdiction without representation of the people for whom jurisdiction is claimed.  The people of the North were never consulted about the adoption of this claim in our Constitution and they are not represented.  Leaving this Article in its present form is a denial of the democratic rights of individuals and, worse still, is open to be interpreted as a veiled threat of some sort of coercion.</P>
    <P>Article 3 goes on to state that the laws are to be framed just with regard to the Twenty-six Counties.  In that context it is scarcely surprising that some of the laws so framed would be inappropriate to a larger united Ireland.  Indeed the Article seems to block even tentative moves towards confederation by its apparent insistence on separate legislation for separate jurisdictions.  I welcome this debate because I believe now we have a chance to give real expression in our laws to our aspiration to unity.  The day for clinging to some dusty inscription as the form of expression of that aspiration is now long gone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Turning now to the broader interpretation of the constitutional review, it has been said in this House, and I would agree, that the 1937 Constitution is a product of its time.  It contains many provisions that are outmoded and indeed there is a sort of a philosophy running through it that I do not think would be shared by most people in this country now.  For instance, in the area of work, there is a clear suggestion that work on the land is in some way superior.  There is also a clear suggestion that it is wrong for mothers to have jobs outside the home.  On the other side there is no statement of the principle of equal pay for equal work.  Again, in the sphere of the family, there is a strong emphasis on the role of mothers in the home but not on the role of fathers.  Under these constitutional provisions on the family it has been allowed to remain in the law that the domicile of a woman in a marriage is the same as that of her husband.  There has been such emphasis on the authority of the family that we have allowed the situation to persist that illegitimacy is still recognised in the law and that up to a recent time adoption of legitimate children was prevented.  The other point in the area of the family is that there is no recognition in any form of the fact that marriages can become irretrievably broken down.  Even in cases where the Catholic Church recognises it, the State continues to regard re-marriage in those cases as bigamy and the children illegitimate.</P>
    <P>The Constitution could well do with a review.  We should distinguish three sections in it: the Preamble which would set out a sort of a philosophy of the things that we would like to see, a basic description of the institutions of the State, and a statement of a Bill of Rights.</P>
    <P>For the Preamble, a statement of philosophy, I think there will be a recurrent need for updating it.  It should be separated and be more easily amended than in the case of the more basic institutions of the State.  In the context of promoting reconciliation towards unity, one appropriate statement in such a Preamble would be that there should be no religious <Col N="362" /> intolerance in our institutions or indeed in our behaviour.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan said that such discrimination is not widespread in our laws and he may be right in that.  However, I think there are significant remnants of religious intolerance in other areas of our lives and in the minds of ordinary people. The thing that brings it to the surface are the issues of mixed marriages and the other question of retaining separate education.  I believe that those things have not produced reconciliation in this country and I believe that a statement in the Constitution of a general nature would lead people towards a more tolerant attitude.</P>
    <P>As regards the Bill of Rights, there is one fundamental right in the American Constitution that has not found its way into ours.  That is Article 9 of their Bill of Rights in which they state:</P>
    <P>The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</P>
    <P>In the United States this Article has protected encroachment on individual rights and it has also allowed new rights that were not formerly enshrined in the Constitution to be added by way of amendment. The situation in this country is different.  Legal provisions have grown up that are offensive to individual rights, such provisions as those I have described before, namely the provisions on domicile of the wife, on illegitimacy and on bigamy.  Those sort of things have stemmed from the fact that the Bill of Rights in the original Constitution has been regarded as sacrosanct without the possibility of addition or amendment.</P>
    <P>No rights have been added except with very difficult procedures for amendment. New rights have not been added that have emerged as unimportant with the passage of time, such as those referring to children and to women.  It would be useful if such an Article like that in the American Constitution was put into ours not only for the reasons I have mentioned, that it would protect rights and that it would allow us to add new statements, <Col N="363" /> but it is also important that a Constitution would tip the rights perpetually towards the protection of the individual rather than groups who are well able to defend themselves, whereas the individual needs the Constitution to stand up for his rights.</P>
    <P>On the question of adding to the Bill of Rights, it should be possible without the full cumbersome method of referendum. It is easy to foresee a day when we will want to add rights regarding privacy against computerised dossiers that can be drawn up on people, and I would not like to think that we would have to wait for a referendum before that could be done. There should be simpler ways, such as passing a measure through both Houses with a substantial majority, or passing a measure by two separate Parliaments.  It would be better to have that sort of flexibility in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I was disheartened to hear Senator Eoin Ryan express what I regarded as some deeply conservative views.  Not only did he deny that any changes were necessary in the Constitution but he went much further and suggested that even if changes were worthwhile it would be folly for fear of interfering with the clarifications and interpretations that have grown up around the Constitution.  In regard to Articles 2 and 3, he said that if Fianna Fáil also were to espouse such reforms extremists would brand all parties as traitors to the nation and would be able to strike a chord with many Irish people.  I disagree that such points should hold sway in our attitude to the Constitution reforms because they would seem to condemn us eternally to providing reforms which would come too few and too late.</P>
    <P>For good or ill, like people living in one house, we, the several communities who live on the island, will have to live together in peace.  It is not good enough that the community in the South, the strongest group, should bolt the door firmly against reform and insist that the only moves should come from Britain, much like a householder should be looking for the police to come in to prevent his own family from creating a disturbance. <Col N="364" /> That does not work in the family context and I do not think it will work in the national family.  We must be prepared to make some moves first.</P>
    <P>I am confident that such moves will be met with a generous response from Northern Unionists and that we will be able to build up some forms of practical co-operation, leading ultimtely to some political settlement.  Even if there will not be such generous response, it will then be plain to all the world where the intransigence lay.  I do not believe there is any deception in taking this attitude because, as Senator Quinn pointed out, we in the South need a settlement: we are not trying to deceive or cajole or trick Unionists into a united Ireland.  We need them and it is our duty to use what pressures we can to achieve this if we keep in mind the point that we will not have unity without the consent of the majority.  Now is the time to make these moves, because for the first time in many years there seems to be a ray of hope in the North that progress is being made.</P>

      <P>As a fledgling Member, so to speak, perhaps I should bide my time, hasten slowly, which is the wise advice handed to new members of many assemblies.  However, I am conscious that this is a highly important debate in which each Member should give his or her opinion.  I have enjoyed hearing the viewpoints of Members of all sides and the debate so far has been most instructive. I should like to remind Members of the terms of the motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with approval the views expressed by the Taoiseach in the course of an RTE radio interview on 27 September, 1981, on the desirability of creating within this island conditions favourable to unity through a reconciliation of its people and towards this end of undertaking in this State a Constitutional and legislative review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech here last Friday I detected a considerable softening, a watering down, of what the Taoiseach originally said.  For the purposes of this debate I intend to speak to what we are being <Col N="365" /> asked to address ourselves to by the motion.  I regret that I cannot give a blanket approval to what the Taoiseach said in his radio interview because I found parts of his statement then as particularly divisive.  He said many things but, <i>inter alia</i>, he said:</P>
    <P>I believe it is my job, now that I am in a position of leadership, to try to lead our people to understand how it was we, who have divided this island; it is the changes we have made in our laws that have differentiated us and made our State unacceptable to a part of the Irish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He added that we have played a part in creating &ldquo;this partitionist State&rdquo;.  I categorically refute that statement.  Unfortunately, this island has been partitioned three times: it was partitioned at the Treaty signing, it was partitioned again at the non-event of the Boundary Commission, and again, and reinforced in that partition, when the late John A. Costello repealed the External Relations Act in 1948-49.  I do not wish to be harking back, invoking unpleasant ghosts, but it is necessary to put this point on record.  The Taoiseach has told us that he wants to lead a Republican crusade, specifically, as he said in the radio interview, to change Articles 2, 3 and 41.</P>
    <P>There is not a mandate for such a crusade, no groundswell, no desire, implicit or explicit.  We will be told that a true leader leads from the front and that we are in some way isolationist by appearing to hang back, but in this case we do not want to be led on this journey, this safari. There is no promised land at the end of it.  Are we being asked to change in order to cajole, or for the sake of change?  If they are the reasons they are erroneous. I regard this crusade as a nameless odyssey. It is somewhat like Don Quixote who many years ago tilted at windmills.  This alleged crusade is just that.</P>
    <P>In that infamous radio interview we were sold short.  There are many business people in this House but which businessman would go into the market place to try to sell a product by short changing? We were sold short.  We do not wish to take an inflated view of ourselves but I <Col N="366" /> am afraid that we, the nation as a whole, were denigrated in that interview.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I noticed that in his Seanad speech last Friday &mdash; I heard some of it; unfortunately I had to leave during it, but I read it over in the past couple of days &mdash; the Taoiseach softened his tone and sentiments considerably.  We are debating the radio interview in which he used words like &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;partitionist&rdquo;, and many others in a castigating, finger-wagging sort of way, and in what I would consider a very feckless fashion altogether.  I should like to put this question to my fellow Senators and, through the Chair, to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Why must we abandon all our aspirations?&rdquo; If we abandon Articles 2 and 3 we are giving a legitimacy to Partition which nobody in this House, I would imagine, would wish to do.</P>
    <P>We are all historians, I suppose, in our own way.  In my other life I am a historian. I was interested last week to hear Senator James Dooge when he reached back in history and spoke of how the great disparity in background and environment between Davitt and Parnell had not hindered them in setting up what was regarded over 100 years ago as the great, new departure.  Indeed, Davitt, Devoy, the doughty Fenian &mdash; we must not leave him out of it &mdash; and Parnell did forge a new departure.  A year later the Kilmainham Treaty came and with it there was thundered this new departure. Later Davitt was to regard the Kilmainham Treaty as &ldquo;the great sell-out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is very trite, indeed, to say that history repeats itself, but it does.  We all know enough about history to know that. I hope this departure will not come to the same epilogue.  I regard Articles 2 and 3 as our collective national aspirations. They are not threats, not claims, but expressions of the unalterable aspiration of the great majority of Irish people.  By deleting or altering our legitimate aspiration as expressed in these two Articles, we are replacing what is a natural expectation and a legitimate expectation with a very sterile aridity.  I agreed with the Taoiseach last Friday when he said &mdash; and he quoted Senator Murphy &mdash; that we are now making and living history. <Col N="367" /> Again as we all know, history is not all &ldquo;old, unhappy, far-off things, and battles long ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>History is very much in the present, and we are making it.  I certainly do not want to go down in history as somebody who agreed to the deletion of Articles 2 and 3 from Bunreacht na hÉireann.  This crusade has been hailed as something of a magic talisman, the key that would unlock all doors.  If we accept this motion, if we go along this path, we are locking the door forever on a united Ireland.  We are not embarking on the broad highway which will lead to consensus, but we are embarking on what would be a forked, divisive path.  I suggest to all Senators that this is not the road to unity.</P>
    <P>When he spoke last week Senator Murphy quoted Arthur Griffith who asked: &ldquo;Is there never to be a living present, only a dead past and a prophetic future?&rdquo; We cannot forget the past, and we are as we are today because of what went before us.  To throw out everything we have held dear for the sake of change, for the sake of cajolery, because it might be <i>avant garde</i> to what to change, is utterly and completely wrong.  I totally reject the assumptions &mdash; some of them have been arrogant and some of them have been made in a quieter manner &mdash; that somehow Senators on this side of the House are being pushed into a corner with a label hung around our necks saying &ldquo;No surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not an inch&rdquo;.  I cannot see how this can be reconciled with the actions of the former Taoiseach, the present leader of this party, Deputy Charles Haughey, during his leadership of the Government, and the many initiatives which have been taken over the past four years which have brought about a greater rapprochement between the communities.</P>
    <P>We have the economic realities.  We have the hope for a gas link.  We have the Derry-Dublin air link.  We have the cross-Border studies which have been initiated.  We had the event last December of the Premier of England, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, coming to Dublin and discussing with the then Taoiseach events of momentous importance, which have <Col N="368" /> now led to the Anglo-Irish talks which, in my opinion, will lead to far greater things.  I cannot accept the labels &ldquo;No surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not an inch&rdquo; when initiatives such as those I have mentioned have been taken, particularly the December initiative by the then Government.</P>
    <P>We are being pushed into this corner and it has become increasingly trendy to say the Fianna Fáil Party are the party of no surrender.  I want to refute that and I want to refute the claim that, because this so-called crusade has been initiated, somehow the people who have taken that initiative are to be praised particularly. We feel we are in a corner and others are prancing around and saying: &ldquo;Oh, what a good boy am I.&rdquo;  We say we reject the motion before the House today which, remember, notes with approval the radio interview of September 27.  I cannot note it with approval and, therefore, I cannot support this motion.  I support the amendment to the motion tabled by Senator E. Ryan and Senator W. Ryan and I say clearly and unequivocally from this side of the House.  &ldquo;Leave Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution alone.  They are the legitimate aspiration of everybody in this House &mdash; national unity.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Like myself, Senator O'Rourke is new to this House but I suspect she is a very wily and experienced politician.  I should like to correct one point before I commence on my own remarks.  She conveyed the impression, I am sure for political reasons, that the motion before us is that Seanad Éireann notes with approval the views expressed by the Taoiseach in the course of an RTE radio interview on 27 September 1981.  In fact, that is not the motion before us and it is certainly not the one I will be voting for later.  The substance of the one I will be voting on is that Seanad Éireann notes with approval the views expressed by the Taoiseach on the desirability of creating within this island conditions favourable to unity, and so on.  That should go on the record, although it has been said before by my colleagues, Senator Carroll, and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, it seems to me that we could have begun this debate on the <Col N="369" /> Constitution in a better way.  I regret some of the things said in the course of that radio interview, but I am pleased that the Taoiseach, in the course of his contribution to the House, clarified his views on a number of matters.  That was an important set of clarifications which we all welcomed.  I certainly have no difficulty with the motion before us.  The Labour Party have believed since the mid-Sixties that the 1937 Constitution was in need of fundamental review, and we have said so on frequent occasions since.  Indeed, during the mid-sixties the belief that there was a need to review the Constitution was widespread right across all of the three parties represented in the House.  That was not unexpected because the 1937 Constitution is a highly detailed Constitution by international standards. It is also very time specific.  It derives from a particular period and era in Irish politics, as other people have said.  The suggestion that a review should take place during the mid-sixties came primarily, I suspect, from the then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, and seems to me to have been linked to two things: one, the fact that political development in the North was taking place and two, that relationships between North and South were being re-evaluated.  In that context it obviously made sense to examine our Constitution.  But I think also, the feeling then was that we needed to have a look at the Constitution for ourselves. It seems to me now that both still apply.</P>
    <P>Fourteen years ago, when the Constitutional Review Committee produced their report, they identified 26 aspects of the Constitution which, at least arguably, should be looked at again.  These covered all aspects of the Constitution, not merely Article 3, but the institutions of State themselves and the section concerned with fundamental rights.  It seems quite incredible that, after the passage of so much time, with so much blood under the bridge in Northern Ireland, with further political modernisation in the South, it is now possible for the Opposition party to say they do not believe in the requirement to review the Constitution again, having agreed to do so 14 years ago.</P>
    <P>I find the Fianna Fáil position &mdash; and <Col N="370" /> I do not wish to heighten the debate by engaging in party political crossfire on this issue &mdash; both confusing and confused. Their first response to the Taoiseach's radio broadcast was that in essence this proposition was entirely useless, that essentially it was an attempt to divert the populace from the adverse economic conditions prevailing in the country.  I do not believe that anything short of a nuclear attack would divert the populace away from the adverse economic conditions facing the country.  I do not believe that that is what the Taoiseach had in mind, because he is on record over a long number of years on the question of constitutional reform.  It seems to me that he was being consistent in calling for it now that he is Head of Government.  That initial response from the Opposition party on the day of the broadcast was hasty.  Certainly, it does not have any credibility as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Since then we have had a series of responses from them and they differ. Senator E. Ryan, the Leader of the Opposition party in this House, said during the initial day of the debate that he did not believe there was any necessity for any amendment of the Constitution at present.  Without wishing to personalise matters, this was not the view of Senator E. Ryan in 1967, when he was a member of the Constitutional Review Committee.  Nor was it his view in 1977 in an interview reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, when he said the time had come to have divorce legislation here.  Indeed, it was not his view two days later when in a radio interview he seemed &mdash; and I am glad to say it &mdash; to shift his ground somewhat and to admit that there was at least the possibility of a requirement to examine Article 3 and other matters in the present Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan holds yet a different position.  In a television debate the evening after this Seanad debate began he seemed to admit &mdash; certainly as far as I could ascertain from watching it &mdash; that there was need for constitutional reform but that this should not take place until we reach the point at which we are around the table negotiating the question of national unity &mdash; a third position, as it <Col N="371" /> were, a different position from the others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin O'Donoghue was in yet a different position.  He contends that there is a need for constitutional review but that this is not the appropriate time. He does not go on to say, as did Deputy Brian Lenihan, that the right time is while we are negotiating in regard to national unity.  He says simply: this is not the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séamus Brennan has a different view still.  He says: Let us have an all-party committee now; let us examine the matter and come up with some proposals. There seems to be some dispute as to whether he will actually say this next weekend as was indicated in the <i>South-side</i> paper on Thursday.  But that seems to be his view as far as I can ascertain.</P>
    <P>From what I have been able to glean we have a whole series of different positions coming from the Fianna Fáil Party on this question.  The question really is: why is there all this confusion among them?  I think such confusion derives from two things: one, the natural instinct of Oppositions to oppose, which is, I suspect, all too prevelant here, not just now but over the years.  There is then perhaps a more fundamental thing which seems to me to be expressed most clearly by the present leader of the Opposition party, Deputy Haughey, that is to say, that this is the Chief's, Mr. de Valera's, Constitution and that nobody except Fianna Fáil has a right to touch it, a right to talk about changing it.  I think that is the basis of their position.  I believe that nobody would change the Constitution more quickly than Fianna Fáil if the appropriate opportunity existed in the future.  But they will oppose any attempt by anybody else to come to grips with this question.</P>
    <P>I have not attempted to raise the tone of this debate in that fashion for any party political advantage.  But it is important that we try to come to grips with why it is that Fianna Fáil now refuse to move on this question when they were prepared to do so 14 years ago and when there are clear signs that some of them at least are prepared to move on it now if only they could break their way out of this historical <Col N="372" /> ownership notion they have with regard to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt about the need for a fundamental review of the Constitution for various reasons.  It was put in an extraordinarily eloquent fashion by Senator John A. Murphy here &mdash; I think it was said perhaps too harshly by the Taoiseach in his radio interview but nonetheless there was substance to it &mdash; that it is essentially a confessional Constitution. It is a Constitution which derived its core values from a particular denominational set of values.  I do not believe now, in the last part of the century, that there is any place for a confessional Constitution or a Constitution which derives its values from a confessional set of ideas.  We have got to the point now, in terms of our political modernisation, where we can opt for a genuinely republican Constitution devoid of confessional overtones.  Probably that would be the view of the majority of the people of this State were the question put to them.  That is one reason why we should examine it.  Let us see if we can get to the point where we do have a genuine republican secular Constitution which reflects the way in which the people think in the country and certainly the way in which the rising generation of younger people think.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need also to examine some aspects of the section on fundamental rights.  We should put an end to the state of national emergency we have continued to prolong by regulation since 1939 because it creates the possibility of abuse of the civil law.  This case has been well documented elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The time has come also to examine the section concerning divorce.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the civil law is a long way behind Roman Catholic ecclesiastical law on the matter.  However, leaving that aside, the reality is that we must get to a point now when we provide legal recognition of the fact that marriages break down.  Even though we may not like that fact, it is a reality and a social problem.  For many individuals it is a major crisis.  We have a duty to respond by at least creating the option for a serious discussion of the matter and <Col N="373" /> that means taking the prohibition on dissolution of marriage out of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is true also, in regard to the section concerning fundamental rights, that the rights of parents and children are somewhat out of balance.  There is a serious case to be made from the point of view of the welfare of children for looking at that section of the Constitution which would appear to subjugate children's rights unduly to the rights of parents, although obviously both have rights.  The question is to get the balance right and that is something which has been clearly outlined by Senator Bruton.</P>
    <P>We must do something about section 43, which concerns private property.  The section is reflective of the particularly conservative ideology which was understandable at the time, although the Labour Party and the Labour movement generally opposed that section when it was enacted in 1937.  As regards balancing the right of the individual to private property with the exigencies of the common good, the balance has gone in the wrong direction.  There is clear evidence from Supreme Court decisions, particularly in relation to rents, that the wider interpretation of the exigencies of the common good which was part of Supreme Court judgments in an earlier period has now been narrowed down to the point where the common good is at risk.</P>
    <P>Therefore, these seem to be indications of a need to review the situation not just in relation to Northern Ireland but because it is something we should do for ourselves.</P>
    <P>The time has come to have a look at Articles 2 and 3.  We must retain the aspiration to unity in whatever new format we come up with.  That is deeply held by all of us in the Twenty-six counties. There is no merit in retaining the empty formula we have now.  In particular because it impacts on politics within Northern Ireland, it seems to make the possibility of political progress there more difficult.  I do not know where the debate goes from here.  We will vote today.  I hope that Fianna Fáil &mdash; and there are signs of reconsideration in that party &mdash; will be prepared to take part in <Col N="374" /> an all-party committee and to have a look at the question objectively, not just in the hope that we might be able to contribute to political development in Northern Ireland but because it is essential for us here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak as a Senator from rural Ireland.  My views go far beyond the confines of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should like to make a statement on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party to deny a press report which appeared in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> which would suggest that the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Haughey, is in any way moderating the party's position with regard to the Taoiseach's constitutional campaign or that he had any discussion with the Taoiseach about it.  As Deputy Haughey stated last night and also in Ennis last Sunday, he considers this campaign to be unnecessary, futile and divisive and sees it as undermining the national position.  It is also &mdash; this is the point Deputy Haughey was making in Cootehill, County Cavan, last night &mdash; a diversion from the economic mess which the Government have created in less than four months.  That is the end of the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the minds of the ordinary people the Taoiseach has embarked on a campaign of vilifying everything that we as a country have stood for and whatever small gains we as a nation have obtained.  A few weeks ago the Taoiseach told us that we were on the verge of financial bankruptcy. He also told us that if Fianna Fáil had been returned to power there would have been no money to pay the Garda, the Army, civil servants or to pay out in social welfare and so on.  The question I should like to ask the Taoiseach is: if the money was not there with Fianna Fáil where did he get it?  Certainly he did not get it from his penal budget in July because the money from that has not come in yet.  The money was there to pay those people.  The Taoiseach tells us that not alone are we financially bankrupt but we are also spiritually and politically bankrupt.  The reason that this motion has been tabled at this time is to distract the attention of the people, and in particular of his own supporters and some of <Col N="375" /> his backbenchers who were very disappointed when they were not put on the front bench.  This is an effort to distract the people from the price increases we have had since the new Government took office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would the Liam Cosgrave element of Fine Gael agree that he is the greatest Taoiseach since the late Seán Lemass? All that we have ever stood for &mdash; a separate Irish nationality, a true democratic order for the first time in Irish history, the right to live our lives according to the values and beliefs that most of us hold dear &mdash; has been, both implicitly and explicitly, rejected by the Taoiseach. If I were to pick out two of his statements in which he has deeply wounded our national pride, they are that Ireland is a sectarian State and that it is we who have partitioned Ireland.  Senator Hussey, in a broadcast, said that the GAA were a sectarian organisation.</P>

      <P>As regards the statement that is we who partitioned Ireland, a young Protestant friend of mine who carried out a quick opinion poll among people of his belief found that not one of them was willing to endorse the statement that Ireland was a sectarian state. As my local newspaper put it, the people of Tipperary are not prepared to shed their values and beliefs in order to placate the implacable.  Would it serve any useful purpose for them to do so?  The time to accommodate the Unionists is when they are prepared to accommodate us.  If the Taoiseach does not believe me, let him contact his party in Tipperary, and perhaps the Labour Party there also, and see whether they will support divorce and a sectarian state in order to impress the Molyneaux and the Paisleyites of this world.</P>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's view, it is we who have partitioned Ireland.  When he says &ldquo;we&rdquo; I do not know whom he really means, whether he means Fianna Fáil or not.  History speaks for itself.  First, we had the Treaty.  Who signed the Treaty? Who caused the Civil War as a result of the Treaty?  Then in 1925 the boundary was set up which established the Twenty-six counties.  There was then a Fine Gael Government in office and they agreed to that boundary.  In 1949 they were in power again and they brought in the Republic of Ireland Act which cemented the Border and made it more difficult for us ever to bring about unity with the North.  Now in 1981 Fine Gael are in power again and they seem to be adopting the very same attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Must we now tell our people that all we ever said about Partition was a grave mistake, that Craig, Carson and so on were right, that the Irish people have no right to any say in how the Six Counties are governed, that these are to remain British territory as of right as long as the <Col N="377" /> Unionists choose?  I hold that a Taoiseach who attacks the Constitution and rejects our traditions has no right to remain a leader of the Irish people.  We, in the Fianna Fáil Party, are proud of our Constitution, proud of our State, proud of our greatest leader, Éamon de Valera. The Unionists are entitled to their traditions and they need not conflict with ours. We do not wish to impose our traditions on them any more than they want to impose theirs on us.  We have got to find a framework in which both can live together in peace and harmony.  If we drop the claim that the national territory is the whole island of Ireland we are undermining the whole basis of the case for Irish unity.  The Taoiseach thinks that he can hasten unity by abandoning the claim to it.  How naive is he?  Or is he simply providing a smokescreen behind which Fine Gael, the partitionist party, can retreat from the goal of Irish unity forever?  The Taoiseach spoke of Tone and Davis.  He did not mention Emmet who happened to be around at the same time as they were.  Perhaps he is now convinced that Emmet's epitaph will never be written.  From the way the Taoiseach is proceeding it looks as if he will surpass even the late John Redmond who was prepared to accept a temporary exclusion of the Six Counties.  Now the Taoiseach is prepared to accept the exclusion for ever.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil, whether it is fashionable or popular, will not abandon the traditions of republicanism for convenience sake or for temporary advantage. We are a party on which the people of Ireland can always rely to express their deepest beliefs and aspirations.  We stand fast by the Constitution and by the democratic order we have built up down through the years.  We believe that what we have achieved so far can be a basis for future progress including progress towards the ultimate goal of this party, that is, the unity of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As the twenty-fourth speaker in this debate, there is always the danger of repetition.  At times during this wide-ranging debate I felt that I was closer to a history seminar than to my <Col N="378" /> first occasion in Seanad Éireann.  Indeed, the last speakers on the Opposition benches have ranged down the pathways and byways of our history with views, perhaps, with which professional historians might not always agree.</P>
      <P>As somebody who works at history for a living, I intend to stay far away from history and to base my remarks very much on the here and now.  At this stage in the debate, and in the debate which is taking place nationally, it is clear that the Taoiseach was right to raise this issue at this time.  The response from open-minded and fair-minded people has been overwhelmingly positive.  Already in this House, for example, we have seen two of the most respected and independent-minded people in our national community, Senator Whitaker and Senator Murphy, welcome the opportunity which this debate gives to discuss some of our more fundamental questions.  We have seen the welcome from the Northern Unionists who came down here last week and we have seen the very positive response internationally.  The international press have given this iniative of the Taoiseach a positive welcome.  <i>The Economist</i>, for example, has seen it as one of the most positive things to have come out of this country in the past eight or ten dismal years.  <i>The Economist</i>, has described what the Taoiseach has done as an act of courage bordering on folly, given the precarious majority the Taoiseach has in the other House.  Or, to paraphrase Senator Murphy: it may be magnificent, but is it politics?  I say it is both magnificent and it is politics &mdash; politics, the art of the possible.  Every possible avenue open to us to further the process of reconciliation to make this a more fair and just society must be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those on the Opposition benches will see very soon that the positive response has not been from small elite groups in politics, in the media and elsewhere, but from the ordinary people.  As one who works with young people, I have found their response to be enthusiastic and positive.  I believe that the opinion polls to be published shortly will show very clearly that the judgment of the Taoiseach has been well founded, that the <Col N="379" /> response has been generous.  Yet the charge has been made by speaker after speaker, and especially by the last speaker, Senator Ryan, that what the Taoiseach has done has been ill-timed, diversionary, divisive.  The charge of ill timing is very easy to answer, coming as it does at the first sign of genuine political movement in Northern Ireland in many years, coming at the end of the hunger strike, after ten deaths inside the walls and after 60 or 70 people had been slaughtered outside during those terrible months.  It is coming at a period when, for the first time since William Whitelaw, Northern Ireland now has an independent, tough-minded Secretary of State, somebody who has a vested interest in seeing movement and progress and has the political will and courage to see it through.  Under Mr. Prior we are about to see movement in Northern Ireland. He is going to ensure that.</P>
    <P>Is there to be no fresh thinking down here now when there is the beginning of real political movement in the North? The timing of this initiative is correct and right.  The charge made by virtually every speaker in the Opposition that the debate is diversionary, that the Government want to take the country's mind off the present economic mess really cannot be taken seriously.  It itself is a major diversion.  This Government, who have been fighting so resolutely since last July to restore order to the public finances, to halt the economic drift and the financial anarchy which characterised the performance of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach, have no need to seek a diversion. If anything, no Government could, and perhaps should focus the full spotlight exclusively on the economic and financial mess they inherited, the worst mess inherited by any Government in our 60 years of independence.  There may be some on this side who will say that we should do that and make sure that the blame is placed squarely where it belongs We could do that, but that type of emphasis would be foreign to the leadership which the Taoiseach wants to give and is giving to the people at this most difficult time.  So, diversion it is not.  It is not our <Col N="380" /> record of neglect and failure which is up for judgment but that of the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>The third charge made is that the debate is divisive.  I would admit that there is some truth in this, but it is divisive only because what the Taoiseach has set out to do has been blatantly and cynically misrepresented.  This motion calls for a review of the present Constitution, a critical, open analysis of our Constitution and how it has worked over the past 40 years.  It requires that we ask ourselves if parts of it are outdated and whether parts of it contradict or even defeat the intentions of those who framed it.  Does it hinder and frustrate the very qualities and aims it seeks to protect?  Is it, as it professes to be, genuinely a Constitution for the 32 counties of Ireland?  Does it embody an ethos which is offensive to some of our people and which makes unity and better relations that much more difficult?  These are the questions asked in this review and we may find when these questions are answered that our Constitution has done very well indeed and that there is no great case for change.  We may find that the dangers of changing are greater than the advantages to be got from such change.</P>
    <P>One must always be careful, cautious and conservative when it comes to questions of constitutional change.  All of these answers may be positive.  Let us not forget what has not been mentioned very much in this debate, especially from the Opposition benches, that the final verdict in all of this rests not with us here or in the other House but with the sovereign people.  Therefore, there is no question of hi-jacking Mr. de Valera's Constitution. There is no question, as has been suggested, that the principles of nationality are about to be abandoned or betrayed.  All of that is misrepresentation which totally, perhaps on purpose, misses the point of this motion.  It is a question of us as a people asking ourselves some fundamental questions about ourselves and the ways in which our sense of national identity can be embodied in our fundamental laws, about how our long-held and cherished aspirations to unity <Col N="381" /> can best be expressed in this present generation.</P>
    <P>It is a question of asking ourselves, too, whether in this highly important and central matter we have learned anything at all from the events of the last 12 terrible years of death and destruction. Are we to say to ourselves that no new ideas or thinking or understanding exist after all that has happened over these 12 years?  Surely one of the few positive outcrops of the trouble in Northern Ireland was that it forced a serious fundamental re-examination of some of the basic questions of nationality, some of the basic problems and prospects of Irish unity.  Late in the day &mdash; but not too late, we hope &mdash; scholars, politicians, civil servants and indeed groups of ordinary concerned people throughout the country have turned their minds to the fundamental underlying aspects of the Northern problem.  Some of this new thinking led to Sunningdale, still the great missed chance of the past decade. We have seem some of this new thinking in writings by Members of the Oireachtas, in the Taoiseach's own book <i>Towards a New Ireland</i>, in the writings of Senator Murphy and most recently in an extremely thoughtful, provocative and highly important article by Senator Whitaker published recently in <i>The Round Table.</i> All of these are just some examples of the outcrop of thinking and writing of a critical, scientifically based examination of the problem of Northern Ireland and the problems of Irish unity. Is all of this work, research and thinking to be treated now as irrelevant?  Surely this is the time to bring together as much of this insight and thinking as is possible as we, the people, ask ourselves some fundamental questions.</P>
    <P>It is for all of these reasons that the decision of Fianna Fáil not to join in the debate is so disappointing.  For once I will invoke history.  On this question history will be harsh in its judgment of the Fianna Fáil action, especially when the rejection of Fianna Fáil is couched in language of vehemence and intransigence, digging up the intransigent slogans of an earlier and, most of us had hoped, well forgotten era. This rejection in some cases &mdash; not in this <Col N="382" /> House &mdash; was couched in terms close to personal abuse combined with an arrogant questioning of the motives and sincerity of those who dared to raise fundamental and deeply patriotic questions. Some of the more recent speeches in this House are redolent of what Mr. John Healy of <i>The Irish Times</i> in another age used to call &ldquo;the old foolishness&rdquo;, with its anti-partitionist sloganeering which passed for thought and masked the political poverty of earlier approaches to any resolution of the Northern problem.  I might mention that Mr. Healy is not immune from this bug, as is evident from some of his more recent writings.  However I am sure that the approach adopted here today and last week and in the speech in Ennis last Sunday must be deeply shocking to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, flying as it does in the face of his efforts to bring his party and public opinion to a deeper and more responsible understanding of the nature of the Northern problem.  It must be especially difficult for those in Fianna Fáil who showed such courage against the bully-boys, especially outside the political process, during the difficult days of the seventies, for those who showed courage and fresh thinking in the face of hostility often vehement throughout the seventies, to see the party paint themselves into this corner of intransigence.  Many people in Fianna Fáil obviously are not happy with the strident and immoderate response of Deputy Haughey.  Some have spoken outside the House; some, we are told, will speak outside the House in the coming days.  There must be many inside and outside Fianna Fáil who are wondering what the party have to fear from open debate and discussion on national first principles, especially at this time when the possibility of real political movement in the North is more positive, more imminent than at any time in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>In this spirit I ask those people on the Opposition benches who showed courage and originality in more difficult days to let their voices be heard once again to give support to the process which the Taoiseach began in his interview on RTE.  I <Col N="383" /> assure them there is still time for those who feel this way to cross the floor of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>As many of the previous speakers have said, the present Constitution has served the Irish people well for over 40 years.  It is the foundation on which our democratic institutions are built and under it the basic human rights of every citizen are guaranteed.  Over the years many successful legal actions have been taken under the Constitution by individual citizens who felt that their rights were threatened or were being denied.  This fact, more than anything else, has copperfastened the confidence of ordinary Irish men and women in our present Constitution.  Now, however, for the first time since 1937, we are witnessing a concerted effort to undermine that confidence and denigrate not alone the Constitution but those who are associated with its framing and its enactment and those who would seek to defend it.</P>
      <P>There seems to be some differences of opinion and uncertainty on the part of those who seek constitutional change. The Taoiseach, in his radio interview, appeared to favour replacing the existing Constitution with a completely new document. Some of his supporters are in agreement with this approach.  It would appear, however, that there are others, including the Minister-Designate for Foreign Affairs, Senator Dooge, and some members of the Labour Party, who would prefer to amend or delete certain Articles of the existing Constitution.  Articles 2, 3, 41 and 43 are the Articles which have been mentioned most frequently.  The major justification which has been put forward for seeking to change or delete these Articles or to replace the whole Constitution is that to do so would promote the cause of Irish unity.</P>
      <P>One would have to be very naive to accept that the replacement of the existing Constitution would advance the cause of unity one iota.  The opponents of unity who want to criticise our Constitution and our way of life will always be able to identify some aspects of both which they will claim to find objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> The Taoiseach's attitude in his radio interview to Articles 2 and 3 was that these Articles should be got rid of completely. In his address to this House on Friday, 9 October, he appeared to have modified his views somewhat.  He talked of reframing Articles 2 and 3.  Could it be that the feedback he received from his own party supporters in the interim was responsible for this change?  To my own knowledge, many Fine Gael and Labour supporters were appalled to learn that the Taoiseach personally favoured the deletion of Articles 2 and 3.  It looks as if the unfavourable reaction which his interview generated within his own party has caused him to rethink his position in relation to these two Articles.</P>
    <P>For the vast majority of Irish people, these two Articles, separately and together, represent the aspiration to unity which they have always held and which they will continue to hold until that unity is finally achieved.  We all recognise that Articles 2 and 3 are objectionable to those who are opposed to the concept of Irish unity.  But how could any serious minded person argue that a reframed version of these Articles, which embody the same aspiration, would be any more acceptable to those people than the existing Articles are?  To delete these two Articles, as the Taoiseach suggested, would be to legitimise the Northern Ireland state and give it a status and recognition never afforded to it by the vast majority of Irish people.  Let us always remember that it was the British, in collusion with the Unionists, who partitioned Ireland, thereby enabling a section of the community in a portion of this island to claim that portion of the island as theirs.  The vast majority of Irish people have never, and never will, recognise as legitimate the state thus created, but that is what they will be asked to do if they are asked to delete Articles 2 and 3 or adopt a new Constitution which does not give expression to the national aspiration to unity.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 are not obstacles to unity.  The greatest single obstacle to unity is the British Government guarantee to the Unionist majority in the North and, until that guarantee is dismantled, <Col N="385" /> real and genuine progress towards unity can never be achieved.  This can only come about as a result of direct negotiation and agreement between the two sovereign states involved.  If, however, we were to abandon Articles 2 and 3, we would be abandoning our claim to be involved in any negotiations towards this end since we would have abrogated our role in the matter.</P>
    <P>To speak at this stage of a new Constitution in the context of Irish unity is premature.  It has always been recognised that when that day comes &mdash; and please God it will come sooner rather than later &mdash; detailed arrangements will have to be negotiated and agreed between all the political representatives involved and everything will be on the table for discussion and negotiation.  For us to try at this stage to produce a Constitution which would be acceptable to all concerned in an Irish unity context would be the ultimate in presumption.</P>
    <P>In order to advance his case for change the Taoiseach, in his radio interview, denigrated not alone the Constitution but also Irish society with his allegation of sectarianism.  He now appears to have modified that allegation also, probably as a result of the cold winds that blew within his own party.  However, he has provided the enemies of Irish unity with what they probably regard as invaluable ammunition and his belated substitution of the word &lsquo;confessional&rsquo; for &lsquo;sectarian&rsquo; will not erase the damage of the original allegation. To quote a translation by a namesake of his own:</P>
    <P>The Moving Finger writes; and having writ,</P>
    <P>moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.</P>
    <P>This assault on the Constitution which has been launched by the Taoiseach in my view, can have two serious effects: firstly, there is a danger that it will undermine, to some degree, the very institutions which have their basis in the Constitution and which we have always sought to defend and protect.  Secondly, it will open up deep divisions among the <Col N="386" /> Irish people and indeed it has done so already.</P>
    <P>When the leader of Fianna Fáil spoke out against changing the Constitution I believe he was articulating the deeply-held view of the vast majority of Irish people.  The verbal attacks which have been made on him &mdash; not in this House but outside it &mdash; and on all those who seek to support and defend the present Constitution will not do much to promote the harmony and reconciliation to which the Taoiseach claims to be committed.</P>
    <P>I believe that this so-called great debate has gone on long enough.  It is not serving and it has not served the best interests of the people of this nation.  If the Taoiseach feels so strongly that Articles 2 and 3 should be removed or deleted from the Constitution or that divorce should be introduced or that the right to private property should be abolished or that the whole Constitution should be replaced, let him take the necessary steps to put these matters to the people in a referendum and let the people decide. For God's sake let us stop tearing ourselves apart in this futile and divisive debate which, as other speakers have said, is nothing more than a smokescreen to divert attention from the disastrous economic policies being pursued by the Government.</P>

      <P>Some of us feel that this debate is only beginning and, contrary to what the last speaker said, we hope that the contributions in this House are merely the start of what will become a great national debate.</P>
      <P>In rising to support this motion I would like to voice my complete support for the courageous, far-sighted and statesmanlike approach of the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in his comments on the RTE radio interview of 27 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that a fresh approach to the divisions within our nation is now called for because we have seen, and experienced only too clearly, the bankruptcy of civil war politics.  I, as one of the newly-elected Senators, would like very much to distance myself from these divisions.  We have witnessed the failure of triumphalism, of both Northern <Col N="387" /> Unionist and Southern Nationalist, in our body politic.  It has led us to our present impasse and it is taking us precisely nowhere.  I, therefore, wholeheartedly support this fresh approach initiated by the Taoiseach, and call on the Opposition to unite with us in promoting reconciliation with our Northern fellow countrymen by exploring this new avenue.  If we are divided among ourselves on this issue in this House, how can we possibly strive towards unity and promote it as a goal? To me, somewhere there is a credibility gap.</P>
    <P>The Constitution of a country is an expression of the aims and the aspirations of its people.  We, the Irish people, aspire towards a united Ireland.  In the eighties we must redefine the ways in which we intend to achieve that unity and how this cherished aspiration of ours should be pursued.  The Constitution of 1937 reflected the aims and aspirations of our people at that time.  It has been amended by the people on several occasions since its inception and it has been challenged in the courts, thus reflecting changes in the needs of our community and the evolving social and political ethos.  The Constitution exists to serve the people and, from time to time, it must be altered in order to subserve those needs.</P>
    <P>In the RTE interview the Taoiseach stated unequivocally that he believed Articles 2 and 3 should not be in the Constitution.  If in 1981 one accepts that these Articles inhibit unity &mdash; and I accept that they do, because they enunciate a territorial claim which is offensive and indeed, anathema to the Unionists &mdash; then surely they should be reviewed in the light of present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan, in a recent RTE television programme <i>Today Tonight</i>, claimed that Article 2 was simply a statement of our national aspiration and not a territorial claim.  I would not agree but, if it is Fianna Fáil thinking that Article 2 should state our aspirations only, then let us rephrase it to do just this.  The holding of an aspiration is one thing, the achievement of it calls for positive endeavour, political foresight and, above all, national sensitivity.  We <Col N="388" /> have just witnessed the assassination of a statesman who crossed the divide against tremendous opposition, which resulted in the isolation of his country within the Arab world.  I am, of course, referring to the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt.  In so doing he defied established entrenched positions and stretched out the olive branch.  If he could find it in his heart to do this and to make such a courageous move, surely we can learn from his example.</P>
    <P>There must be a new way forward. Existing stances have not been productive and we have consistently failed to persuade the Northern Unionists that they have anything to gain by uniting with us.  In fact, since Partition we have been at no stage near unity.  Are we to continue along the same path, or do we explore new avenues?  History has shown us that resistance to change leads to violence. This is what happened in Northern Ireland.  If we in the South are not willing to change, we too must be at risk.  Violence thrives in a political vacuum, as we have sadly witnessed.  Indeed, we in the South have been fortunate in that the violence that has claimed so many lives in so many families has not had the same severe impact in our community.  We have a clear duty to take whatever measures are necessary to promote peace and stability.  It must be obvious that present postures are not contributing towards that obligation.</P>
    <P>I have been saddened by the Fianna Fáil contribution to this debate.  Their attitude leaves no room for compromise, reconciliation or bridge building.  I sense that narrow political considerations are paramount with them and regret that this should inhibit a full, free, frank and open debate.  The attitude of making concessions in the context of a round table negotiation, as enunciated by Deputy Brian Lenihan, is a hostile one to adopt, to my mind.  Where is the much-flaunted flexibility which Fianna Fáil were quick to demand from other quarters recently? This immature partisan approach is Fianna Fáil dogma, and it is fear of a new approach which is impeding progress in this most important area.</P>
    <P>We have a tradition in Irish society of <Col N="389" /> leaving thorny decisions to be made by extra-political institutions.  In recent years many important advances in social and moral areas have been made and decided by the courts.  If we, the politicians, in whom the people have placed their trust, do not make progress on the subject of Northern Ireland, outside agencies may very well abrogate that right to themselves.  Let us control the destiny of this island and not have it decided upon by those whom we have not elected to represent us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and other speakers have indicated that in the context of this motion the term &ldquo;a confessional state&rdquo; was more appropriate than the term originally used &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;.  Many speakers made mention of the fact that we have had two Protestant Presidents of this State.  That they should allude to this fact is indicative of the narrowness of our outlook.  These men should be remembered for their calibre and for their outstanding personal qualities and not be placed on some specious denominational weighing scales to appease the national conscience.  Statements of denominational allegiance do not have a valid place in the political arena.  In most countries, these have expression on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from the tops of minarets, before the arks of the covenant and in front of high altars.  One would hope that they would bring out the best in people during the rest of the week.  They should not have a place in political deliberations.</P>
    <P>The confessional nature of this island, North and South, is rooted in history. Some contributors to the debate have most ably instanced examples of this. Many incidents occurred at the foundation of the State, when attitudes were more polarised and entrenched.  Today a more subtle form exists and this has also been referred to by many speakers in the debate.  It is my earnest hope that we will move towards a pluralist society, characterised by all that is good in the variety of religious and humanitarian beliefs of all our people.  To this end, I urge that the motion to review the Constitution be adopted.</P>
    <Col N="390" />

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with the other speakers in congratulating the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach on their appointments?  The Leas-Chathaoirleach has gone into the Cathaoirleach's seat, so it is just a reversal of two important places.  I believe the two men are quite ably fitted to deal with anything that might arise in this Chamber for the period of this Seanad.</P>
      <P>As regards the motion before the House, I am not in a position to treat it with the measure of seriousness one might expect it to be treated with.  In the first instance, the method adopted in bringing about the motion was wrong. Any constitutional change or any referenda for a constitutional change must come from the other House.  A Bill must be introduced and it must come before the Dáil, in the first instance, and then to the Seanad.  It must pass both Houses but this has not happened in this case.  That is why I doubt the sincerity behind the moving of the motion.</P>
      <P>If it is being moved as a talking point, this is the place where we will possibly get greater oratory in connection with any policy document or, indeed, any aspect of legislation that might be going through.  It will get the real fine-combing in this Chamber.  Under the Constitution there is provision for five vocational sets of people to be elected to the Seanad and that is an indication that this is a Chamber where the teasing and the adding or deletion of words in legislation get a fairly good hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if there was any sincerity behind moving this motion, and if it was going to be pursued &mdash; I do not believe it is going to be pursued any further than this evening's debate &mdash; it would be realised, that this is not the place and this is not the time.  When one wishes to change legislation or, indeed, to introduce a Bill one generally does it on the demands of the people that as a parliamentarian one is representing but as yet there has been no demand for a change in our Constitution from the Irish people here.  Neither has there been any request from the people on the other side of the Border. They have not at any time requested a change in our Constitution, much less <Col N="391" /> Articles 2, 3 or 41.  There is no demand and there has not been any demand. Indeed, we have gone through a very traumatic period in the Six-Counties over the last 11 years.  No politician, statesman or churchman on either side of the Border, through the media or television broadcasts, over the last 11 years since the troubles broke out in Northern Ireland has made any demand &mdash; it has never been mentioned and I defy contradiction on this &mdash; for a change except one.  He was a Member of this House and he has now left us.  He was former Senator Conor Cruise-O'Brien and he was the only one who suggested that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution should be changed or looked at.  Since we joined the EEC one would think that our membership of the Community would demand a change in our Constitution but the EEC, or the laws of the EEC, have not demanded a change.  For that reason I cannot see why at this time there should be any mention of a change.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that a revision of the Constitution may not be necessary in the future but there will be a time and a place when the Irish people will be the only people who will have the real say in changing in a referendum any Article of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I believe our Constitution has served us well up to now.  I admire our Constitution which was adopted in almost every constituency.  I wonder if there is any significance in the fact that it was turned down in the constituency of the Leader of this House, who moved this motion. Whether that is a good or a bad omen I do not know, but it was turned down in Wicklow and in one other constituency in 1937 when a referendum was put to the Irish people.  Since the Irish people adopted that Constitution we have had a few Constitutional referenda.  We have not had an ordinary referendum in the lifetime of this State, and there is a difference. That is why I indicated that this motion should have gone before the other House first.  However, our Constitution has stood the test of time.  It was drafted by the legal brains of the country at that time.  Indeed, the drafting of any <Col N="392" /> constitution would have to come from a legal commission who would tease out what would be at that time the requirement of the people it was geared to.  Later parliamentarians would do their teasing on it.</P>
    <P>In 1937 the Constitution was legally teased out, and teased out by the parliamentarians before the Irish people adopted it.  It has served us reasonably well and I do not think anybody was denied the rights that he or she was entitled to under the Constitution in this State, or indeed the wrongs.  It is there also for the wrongs.  It is there so that the people on this island will be safeguarded and protected, that they will be able to live under the Northern State.  We have many many legislative powers under the Constitution, which has worked very well since 1937.  It was only found wanting on a few occasions.  The last referendum was on adoption and another small amendment went with it.  Only 28 per cent of the Irish people voted when there was that constitutional referendum on adoption and on the membership of this House.  That was not a controversial issue.</P>
    <P>There was some reference to sectarianism. I would suggest that the people showed beyond all doubt that there is no sectarianism here by the fact that they elected two Presidents from the minority side.  The great majority of people on this side of the Border are Roman Catholics but nevertheless we elected to the highest office of this State Dubhglás de hIde and the late Erskine Childers.  It is a tribute to the Irish people that in our games, in our parliament, in our county councils and in all the activities of our State there has never been a question of sectarianism. Senator Cranitch mentioned that he did not feel a Roman Catholic would become King or Queen or Prime Minister of Great Britain because their Constitution would not allow it.</P>
    <P>It might also be well to remember that Ghana, when gaining independence chose our Constitution <i>in toto</i> and adopted it as their Constitution.  Having looked at constitutions all over the international sphere they felt that the Irish Constitution was best suited to their <Col N="393" /> people and adopted it in full.  It was regarded internationally as a Constitution that gave equal and free rights to all people within the State.  For that reason I do not see why it should be tampered with.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the type of republicianism that the Taoiseach may have in mind.  He is speaking as Taoiseach and I believe he is sincere in what he is saying and he is entitled to put his views.  I do not believe the timing is right and I do not think we have had up to now what might be regarded as a &ldquo;jaundiced&rdquo; republicanism that may need some tonic at this time to give it a more modern-day look.  The people who were responsible for giving us our freedom would regard this State today as their Republic and the type of Republic they would like to have lived in and see on this island.</P>
    <P>I believe in a united Ireland and I hope I will see it in my time.  Only then would I accept that the Constitution we have today might have to be amended or tampered with in some way.  In the context of a united Ireland we would have to bring in legislation for the whole State and draft a new Constitution to meet the requirements of a 32-county Irish Republic. Only then would we need to tamper with any Articles within the Constitution.  We have legislation to deal with other matters. We would have the copperfastening of Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution in a 32-county Irish Republic and we would possibly require constitutional change and a complete review of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>To give the people a say in the changing of the Constitution would demand a big capital input at this time.  Our economy is not sufficiently geared and we have not a balance of capital for this type of unnecessary squandering.  It would cost a considerable amount to hold a referendum on the Constitution.  There is no sincerity in bringing up the matter at this time.  It is only a motion before the House, a talking point, and I believe at the end of the day it will be shelved for some time to come.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we are not completely against the revision of the Constitution but we are definitely against <Col N="394" /> tampering with it at the moment.  A time will come when it will have to be looked at and we will then sit down in harmony with the people of this island to make our contribution towards a revision of that Constitution.  We feel the timing is wrong and for that reason we cannot go along with the crusade of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertFausset" hpid="Mr. Fausset Mr. Fausset">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fausset</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation to this House of the openness of the debate on this motion. To me it is very welcome that matters such as have been raised can be debated so freely and so openly.  As a southern Protestant living close to the Border, religion and human rights are subjects which are seldom discussed and are considered topics which are best left out of conversation.  During this debate I am mainly an observer.  I, and many like me, often watched what way the whole island was going, and as I listened, I felt as though a fresh breeze was stirring and we could look forward to more cheerful times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The religious minority is often spoken of as if it was the only minority in the State.  We have many minorities ranging from millionaires to homeless people.  If we consider under 50 per cent being a minority, and a majority as 50 per cent plus, there are many sections of our people who can be placed in both of these categories.  One has to belong to a minority to know what it really means.  There is strength in numbers and with that feeling of strength comes confidence, security and even an independence showing in the individual.  This independence stems from a knowledge that there is power behind that individual which can be used if necessary.  The opposite to the statement that there is strength in numbers must be that there is weakness in lack of numbers and from that comes feelings, perhaps unfounded, of frustration, helplessness and perhaps even fear. A small minority knows that it is completely dependent on the goodwill of the majority for its peaceful life and general well being.  If a minority is well-off it is not noticed but if it is poor then it is really noticeable.  It is when one belongs to a weak minority that the pinch is felt.  This <Col N="395" /> is brought home to me each Sunday as I pass the Roman Catholic church on my way to morning service.  I am not implying that I feel any element whatsoever of oppression on me as an individual but when I see that small sea of cars and then pass on to where there are only eight or nine cars it is hard to look at it realistically and to believe that one is one of the people of the State and not think of oneself as one of the minority.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy touched on these fears when he said that Protestant people thanked him for speaking on their behalf. What he did not seem to realise was that he, Senator Murphy, was speaking from the side with the power and could say what was right and what he felt without fear of reprisal.  Senator Murphy raised another point when he said that members of minority churches do not take sufficient interest in the workings of the State. I can assure the House that their interest is as great as that of any other group but that they have become disheartened and feel their views do not count and are not considered important.  At parish level they are very much to the fore.  They play their part in running functions.  They work on show committees and are involved in charity fund-raising, organising outings for schoolchildren and old people.  Many of them act on health boards and quite a number are representatives on county councils.  At higher levels, perhaps we could be better, but it is an uphill struggle and most give up and leave the field to the majority.</P>
    <P>I listened to the interview with the Taoiseach on the radio with an open mind because I am not a person who knows much about history or a person who looks back.  I look to the future and this is what we should be doing.  The motion states:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with approval the views expressed by the Taoiseach in the course of an RTE radio interview .... on the desirability of creating within this island conditions favourable to unity through a reconciliation of its people and towards this end of undertaking in this State a constitutional and legislative review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> The Taoiseach on that Sunday morning &mdash; and I listened with an open mind &mdash; spoke, as Senator Cranitch said, passionately as a man who believed that it was his duty in life to make this country a better place.  He mentioned Tone and Davis.  Those people mean very little to me.  But the impression in my mind of those people is that they were people whose main goal in life was to leave this island a better place when they left it.  We should all have that same aim in life, to leave this island a better place.  The Protestant minority of the South has as great an aspiration towards the unity of this island as any other citizen of this Republic.</P>
    <P>I understand unity to be a joining together.  The Taoiseach's message that came across to me was that in his opinion we should have a new look at the Constitution and if we found anything wrong with it we should try to change it in such a way as to draw our people together both North and South.  Our Constitution was last reviewed, I understand, in 1937. But can what was around in 1937, doing a job properly in 1937, be said to be still in as good a condition today?  It is a marvellous tribute if it is and does not need to be looked at.  There is nothing else I know of that would not need to be looked at if it was that old, and this is the reason why I heartily support the Taoiseach's view that we should do all that is possible to draw the people of the two ends of this island together.</P>

      <P>Before commenting on the motion I should like to congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach on being elected and also Senator Gemma Hussey on her appointment as Leader of the House.  She might not be too pleased at some things that I might have to say subsequently.  Seanad Éireann is asked to note with approval the views expressed by the Taoiseach in the course of an RTE radio interview on 27 September 1981 on the desirability of creating within this island conditions favourable to unity through reconciliation of its people and towards this end undertaking in this State a constitutional and legislative review.  The Taoiseach <Col N="397" /> hopes that the views he expressed in that interview will be approved by the Seanad and also it is hoped that his views will get approval right across the country.  I doubt if he will receive such approval and support. The views expressed by some Members of this House who are anxious that this motion or that the Taoiseach's views get such approval are to me most surprising.</P>
      <P>Senator Gemma Hussey gave some examples of sectarianism in this part of Ireland.  One on which I would like to comment was when she said that the Gaelic Athletic Association, that powerful, noble and historic body, had fallen into a trap, the so easy and so widespread way of confusing Irishness with membership of one Church.

      <P>Does the Senator mean that the GAA should abandon their traditions? Should the GAA abandon the promotion of Irish language, cultures or our native games?  Is she saying that non-Catholics are not welcome in the GAA?  I have been a member of the GAA all my life and have held important offices in that body.  I was chairman of my own county board for 12 years and during that term my county had the good fortune of winning an all-Ireland senior hurling championship.  When we were organising the necessary festivities to celebrate the occasion, as well as inviting the Catholic bishop we invited the Protestant bishop.  They both attended the function.  The Protestant bishop wrote subsequently to the secretary of the county board thanking him for the invitation and said how he enjoyed the occasion. He wrote that letter in the Irish language.  I am a bit confused over the statement of Senator Hussey about confusing Irishness with membership of one Church because I know the GAA are non-sectarian, a non-political body and Irishness is not of one Church.  It is of all Churches as can be proved by this Protestant bishop writing a letter in acknowledgement <Col N="398" /> of an invitation in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that when this country was very divided through the scars of the civil war, the GAA, more than any other voluntary organisation, played a very important part in uniting Ireland at that particular time.  When brother fought against brother they brought them together again by their ideals. This created a spirit of unity among all Irishmen.  I am sure in future the GAA will play an equally important part in creating unity throughout the 32 counties. I was disappointed that the Taoiseach snubbed the invitation of the GAA to attend the all-Ireland hurling final this year &mdash; one of Ireland's greatest traditional games.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his interview said he hoped to re-create the conception of republicanism in Ireland, a genuine and true republicanism which we had inherited from the past.  He said he hoped he could do that and that it would be one of his major objectives.  He said that he had to spend a lot of time concentrating on the economy.  He said: &ldquo;We have to tackle the problems of poverty which are so appalling in this country and which have been so neglected in the past.&rdquo;  Whatever about the problems of poverty being neglected in the past they are definitely being neglected in this period of emergency budgets, or whatever budgets you might like to call them that have been introduced since this Government took office.  They are the cause of increasing inflation.  Those in the greatest need get only a paltry increase.</P>
      <P>I was speaking to a widow yesterday who was refused free electricity and a living alone allowance.  That woman has only £29 per week.  I know that Senator Brendan Ryan spoke at length on poverty and I agree with what he said.  Would this £29 per week widow woo the Northern Protestant widows to join our State? These are the problems which must be tackled first.  We must ensure that the poor and needy have decent living conditions. I feel these things are more essential than abandoning our traditions to woo the Northern Protestants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard said the Unionist <Col N="399" /> people in Northern Ireland will welcome everything in this motion.  I do not believe the Unionists or the Nationalists in Northern Ireland will welcome everything in this motion.  Senator Howard said this motion will receive support right across the country.  How does he say this? Does he know that the Right Reverend Lorcan Empey, Bishop of Limerick, Killaloe, Ardfert and Aghadoe last weekend, when addressing a Church of Ireland senate meeting in Tralee, County Kerry, when he was referring to the Taoiseach's recent speeches on the Constitution, said &ldquo;Let us make no mistake about it, a reassessment of our Constitution is a very grave matter indeed and needs to be approached with the utmost care.  These are the fundamental principles that we will be talking about in time to come and every aspect of any proposed change will need to be examined minutely with the greatest care, honesty and sincerity.  I happen to believe that, on the whole, we have a fine Constitution which has served us well during the past 50 years and continues to do so.&rdquo;  This is one of the many indications that this motion is not receiving the support the Taoiseach and Senator Howard expected it would get.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his interview stated that when he examined the books and the economy he was shocked.  When queried as to when he saw the report on the talks on Northern Ireland between the last Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher he said that because of the confidential nature of these talks he could not comment.  I am sure that after examining these records he was surprised to see the progress made by his predecessor, Deputy Haughey, towards achieving unity.  It is a pity that the electorate did not allow him to continue his good work.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach thinks that a change in the Constitution is necessary to prove that this country is non-sectarian.  I do not feel a change in the Constitution is necessary to prove that this country is non-sectarian.  This country is non-sectarian, which has been proved by Ireland electing a Protestant President of Ireland on two occasions.  Fianna Fáil have had Protestant Ministers in many portfolios. <Col N="400" /> It is indeed surprising &mdash; perhaps it was done deliberately to ensure that this crusade of the Taoiseach would get the support he wishes it to get &mdash; that the Taoiseach when appointing Ministers &mdash; he had 30 of them to appoint &mdash; did not appoint a Protestant Minister.  There were two elected Protestant TDs in his party.  One of them has served this House well since 1969 and is living adjacent to the Northern community.  I feel the Taoiseach erred in this respect by not appointing that man, who had vast experience of public administration and has been a public representative continuously since he was first elected.  He was a front-bench spokesman when Fine Gael were in opposition.</P>
    <P>I believe in unity and I will strive to achieve unity, but I think that unity can be achieved without our abandoning the traditions that have ensured our identity as a nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my voice in support of this motion.  I welcome the motion and the statement of the Taoiseach because of its clarity and its unambiguity. It is a courageous attempt to ventilate our too often blinkered and shuttered thinking.  I welcome it for what most people see it to be, a sincere and genuine attempt to get us to examine, analyse and reappraise who we are, what we are and where we are going.  Even if there is not a constitutional and legislative review at executive level because of the total intransigence and illogical inflexibility of the Opposition, nevertheless things will not be quite the same again.  Whether the Opposition like it or not, the people of the country have begun their own constitutional review as a result of the stimulus supplied by the Taoiseach in his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I am heartened by the response of the press at national and provincial level despite the few isolated instances quoted in this House.  I am further encouraged by the generally favourable reaction of the people.  However, I am aghast at the ostrich-like posture of the Opposition, at their narrow, rigid inflexibility and their unwillingness to <Col N="401" /> participate in or to sanction the exercise of holding up a mirror to ourselves.  It can only be construed as a fear on their part that the mirror will reflect too many unpalatable things.</P>
    <P>All the Taoiseach seeks is a reappraisal, a re-examination, a review. What is so shattering about the prospect of such self-examination?  What are we running away from?  If people are so convinced that every tenet of our Constitution is so perfect, what have they to fear from an in-depth, critical analysis?  Our Constitution should reflect the sum total of who we are and of what we believe.  It should enshrine our ideals, our beliefs and our values and it should protect individuals in society.  I believe it should do so from conception to the grave.  After 44 years not alone might it be desirable to review the Constitution but I believe it incumbent on us to do so.  As we are the individual products of evolution, so also our society evolves as do our collective aims and aspirations and they bring with them the consequent constitutional obligation to accommodate and reflect these changes.</P>
    <P>I do not quibble one iota with the genuinely-felt apprehensions of people. Just as members of the Roman Catholic Church faced the prospect of change in Vatican I and Vatican II with a certain amount of foreboding, people should be sustained in the knowledge that the Church emerged from these great Councils, enlightened, renewed and reinvigorated. Under the guiding hand of Pope John XXIII, the last of these great Councils introduced changes that were hitherto unimaginable.  Centuries old traditions, customs and beliefs were overturned as the Church deleted, added, changed, modified and generally equipped itself to confront the second half of the Twentieth Century.  If there was one word in particular that was reborn with a meaning out of Vatican II it was the word &lsquo;ecumenism&rsquo;.  This word should permeate our discussions and one we should always take into account.  We should show a willingness to listen to, to appreciate and to accommodate sincerely held ideals, beliefs and aims of all the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> I can only assume that certain people have adopted an inflexible and intransigent stand on this point for political reasons only.  The Taoiseach has asked for a review and a reappraisal of the Constitution. I am tempted to think that those who masquerade as the great proponents of unity in this country are the very people who have a vested interest in keeping the country divided.  One million Protestants participating in a united Ireland would leave a certain political party in opposition <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús cómhgáirdeas a ghabháil leatsa ar do thoghadh mar Chathaoirleach ar an Seanad.  Is cuimhin liom go maith an chéad uair a chuir mé aithne ort sa Teach seo.  Tig liom a rá go bhfuilimid sách mór le na chéile ó shoin i leith, agus ta súil agam gur mar sin a bhéas sé amach anseo.</P>
      <P>The motion put down on behalf of the Government and on which this debate is now concluding does not specifically refer to Article 2 or Article 3 of the Constitution and I think, advisedly and deliberately it abstained from concentrating on these two Articles.  However, this side of the debate &mdash; which of course is important &mdash; has been concentrated on by the Opposition, who it now turns out have changed their minds about Article 3 since 1966 and 1967 when an all-party committee was set up by the late Mr. Lemass. He was ultimately a member of that committee; and it contained such luminous names as Deputy Colley, Senator Eoin Ryan, Deputy David Andrews, Deputy Molloy and the then Deputy O'Kennedy. That committee felt able, without dissent from the other two parties represented in these Houses then as now, to recommend the substitution for Article 3 of a quite different and more pacific and realistic formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there has been a mad scramble to get away from that position.  In the course of this debate nobody wants to know what that committee recommended.  The reason given is that a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since 1967. Indeed it has, and a lot of blood too.  The arguments that were valid then for behaving <Col N="403" /> realistically towards the people with whom, in maudlin moments, we describe ourselves as having links of sundered brotherhood, are twice as valid now.</P>
    <P>I have been away for the best part of a month on three foreign trade promotions and when I came home a few days ago I was asked to take part in this debate.  At that very short notice I had to catch up with the details of discussion that had begun while I was away, and which naturally I had not followed, and I must apologise to Senators that I have not been able to study and give thorough attention to their views, although I have tried to read in the time available the two published daily reports.</P>
    <P>I must acknowledge that there is some force in many of the individual points made from the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  In particular, I admit the force of two of the points and I hope nobody will make a meal of this admission.  I quite agree &mdash; I have often said it myself &mdash; that we were beaten around the head for many years about Article 44.2, and when the Irish people by an overwhelming majority, and with the support of all three political parties represented here, did away with that we got small thanks for it. The matter was never discussed again.  I do not think any tribute worth a damn was ever paid to the people for doing something that, once upon a time, many of them would have considered their own religious affiliation would have made impossible.  We got no thanks for that.</P>
    <P>I admit the force of the point made by the other side that, quite likely, we would not get much thanks in this instance either.  That is to say, we would not get any thanks from the people who are in the business of, and whose political livelihood depends on keeping us at arms' length.  But let us not go about this matter as though the test of its sanity or insanity is merely if it is going to win plaudits from Mr. Paisley, who, I personally believe, carries more blame than any other individual on this island for what has overtaken it in the past 12 years; from his deputy, Mr. Robinson, or from other persons of the same cast of mind; because their stock in trade is to keep people <Col N="404" /> hating each other.  It is pointless to judge the course of action we are going to take or whether it is going to win their approval.  They would be out of business if we succeeded with what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>I also admit the point made by Senator Eoin Ryan that in regard to Article 3 there is the serious danger that if Fianna Fáil decided to support a move to amend that Article along lines similar to those which they appeared to have been happy with in 1967, we might easily find ourselves in a situation in which the three democratic parties represented in these Houses would lose the referendum, and even if we did not lose it it could easily be that the forces of violence and their touts, and those who make excuses for them and who palliate their crimes, would take over the leadership of what, when the votes had been counted, would turn out to be a couple of hundred thousand citizens of the Republic.  I admit the validity of the Senator's point.  There were other individual points in Fianna Fáil speeches which I have read which I take seriously.</P>
    <P>At the same time I emphasise that the Taoiseach did not suggest, either in his radio interview or subsequently, any immediate rush to amend Article 3, or any other part of the Constitution.  I have read the transcript of his radio interview, and it seems to me clear that he went out of his way to discountenance any such impression, to disclaim it.  He said there is no point in rushing into a referendum that would be lost.  That is my view.  It is my view even on a matter as concrete as the divorce item, on which I must admit &mdash; I hope the House will not regard this as ducking the issue &mdash; I personally find it very hard to make up my mind: I see the force of the arguments on both sides and I would be in a dilemma personally about how to vote on Article 41 if an amendment to it was proposed.</P>
    <P>I am sure of one thing, though, and that is that a Government, whether we or the gentlemen over there provide it, ought not to be in the business of running referenda just for the hell of it.  If we have reason to suppose &mdash; there are many ways to discover these things nowadays <Col N="405" /> through opinion polls and so forth &mdash; that a referendum had not a chance of being carried, then it is a breach of a Government's duty to waste the time and money of the people having it.  I believe that is part of what the Taoiseach had in mind when he specifically disclaimed any intention to rush to the country with a proposal to amend Article 3.  What I have understood him to mean ever since I first met him, which is now nearly 20 years ago, is that he wants to try to bring the people with him &mdash; whether by referendum now or in 12 months time or 12 years time will not matter to him if he succeeds in the long run.  He wants to bring the people with him to realise that we have been going about Northern Ireland and its problems in the wrong way, and about the all-Ireland problem in the wrong way, that we have done things that were foolish, and that we have left undone things it would have been wise to have done.</P>
    <P>Anybody who supposes that the Taoiseach's opinions on this subject are newly  that they are a case of fás in aon oícne, has not paid any attention to the man ever since he came into public notice through his writings and his speeches. That has always been his opinion, very strongly held, and although &mdash; because this party does not consist of lead soldiers all turned out to exactly the same specifications &mdash; there are points on which I disagree with him and many of my other colleagues, this is one on which I am absolutely at one with him.</P>
    <P>We have not gone about the all-Ireland question in the right way and it is high time we began to look at what we have been doing and ask ourselves which parts of our programme make sense, and which parts do not, except for our own petty parochial purposes.</P>
    <P>In case I have missed something in this debate, which is possible because of the rush I have had, I should like to point out a deleterious effect which Article 3 in its present form has had, quite apart from the question of whether the Unionists would be impressed at our deleting it.  It is the bearing it has had on the Sunningdale Agreement and its fate in 1974.</P>
    <P>In 1973 the clouds briefly parted towards the end of the year when, for the <Col N="406" /> first time in history, the representatives of a sovereign Dublin Government and the representatives not only of the majority in the North, but of the majority of that majority, as well as those of the British Government &mdash; I believe they were marginal to this whole question which must be settled between Irishmen &mdash; got together around a table and worked out a scheme, a road along which this country might reach unity and happiness. Although afterwards attempts were made by people like Deputy Lenihan to belittle the effects of Sunningdale &mdash; he described it as a lot of ballyhoo &mdash; at the time his leader, Deputy Lynch, was glad to claim credit for, as he put it, having paved the way to it.  No one grudged him the credit for having done something along those lines.</P>
    <P>At the time it looked as if that might give us a chance.  It went wrong for many reasons, and I think the National Coalition Government for whom I worked must bear some of the responsibility, not for any reason for which we need to be ashamed but perhaps through a certain inexperience.  Perhaps through a misunderstanding of the toughness of Loyalist sentiment, we allowed Mr. Faulkner to make misjudgments.  We allowed him to agree to things which, if we had had more experience, we ought to have known he could never sell at home.  We allowed him to depart for Belfast with a package which, when it was taken to pieces, examined, misrepresented and turned into a set of scarecrows by Mr. Paisley and his followers, caused Mr. Faulkner's more chicken-hearted supporters to drop away from him, one by one, until he was no longer able to say that he presided over a majority of the majority.  From that to the end of the road was visibly only a short distance.</P>
    <P>Others played a part.  The IRA, who are unwilling that anybody should have any happiness or peace in Ireland except on their terms &mdash; sooner than accept which I would rather emigrate &mdash; played a part.  The IRA declared their intention to wreck Sunningdale.  They would not give it a chance of any kind.  Far from stepping down their violence they stepped it up.  Even a moderate Unionist, <Col N="407" /> even a tentative kind of man who might say to himself, &ldquo;I am an Orangeman, I am a Unionist, that is the way my instinct goes, but we must settle this thing some time and I am willing to give this a chance&rdquo;, would have said to himself, &ldquo;If Sunningdale meant there would be less violence, that our children would have a future to look forward to in their own country, I might have given it a chance and gone along with it, but when I see that all it means is more bombs, more savagery, why should I not then listen to what Mr. Paisley has been telling me: he is the man who has the rights of it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there was our domestic problem, our domestic mí-ádh, the raven croaking on our national battlements, Mr. Kevin Boland, who was not content that the representatives of the Irish people, freely elected by them, both North and South, should try something new.  He had to put in his own pennyworth.  I believe he did it sincerely thinking he was striking a blow for Caitlín Ní hUallacháin, instead of which he was only holding up the day of Irish peace and reconciliation.  He launched an action in our courts which claimed a declaration that the Government had stepped outside their Constitutional powers by signing the Sunningdale Agreement inasmuch as it conflicted with the plain words of Article 3.  The courts took the view that the Sunningdale declaration was only a statement of political intent by the Government representing a <i>de facto</i> view of a <i>de facto</i> position and that it did not and could not override or qualify in any way the claim which Article 3 contained.</P>
    <P>In the cold letter of the law, the courts were right.  They dismissed Mr. Boland's action, but in doing so &mdash; they could not avoid doing so for the reasons I have tried to explain in a few words &mdash; they pulled the rug even further and faster from under the Sunningdale possibility, because they immediately enabled the Unionists, who were not interested in the small print of our Constitution &mdash; no matter what way they would read it the extreme ones would not be interested &mdash; to say: &ldquo;Now you see how much the Sunningdale Agreement is worth.  The <Col N="408" /> Republic's Government and its assertions and declarations are belittled, and taken to be not worth the paper they are written on, by their own Supreme Court.&rdquo;  That was an unfair gloss on what the Supreme Court did and what the High Court had done; but that was the construction put on it.  For that extra weakening and undermining of the Sunningdale accord, we have to thank the sincerity, grossly misdirected sincerity of Mr. Boland, who brings perverted understanding almost to the level of genius, and demonstrated it in a nationally damaging manner on that occasion as he seldom had done before.</P>
    <P>With that kind of precedent before us, I would have been hastening to say: &ldquo;Look, if this thing is going to mean that the Government here can never move, that we can never come to terms with anyone in this State except with this thing hanging over us which will limit us by the letter of the cold law which kills the generous spirit which infused and informed everything the Government here did and which I believe was genuinely shared and understood and appreciated by the then Opposition; if that Article is going to hamper a government and leave the Boland millstone hanging over us, ready to drop at all times in the future, surely that is enough reason to look at it again without bothering whether it impresses any Unionist if we change it.&rdquo;  It hampers this Government's own manoeuvring and negotiating room.  If there is ever a Fianna Fáil Government here again it will hamper theirs too, sooner or later.</P>
    <P>I have gone as far as I can go in admitting the validity of some of the Fianna Fáil points expressed.  I cannot understand their anxiety to run away from what they appeared to be willing to accept in 1967, although it would seem to me that 14 years later the necessity for something like that is a good deal more compelling. The reaction of some of their speakers &mdash; notably Senator Lanigan who was kind enough yesterday to invite me specifically to look at his speech, which I promptly did &mdash; borders on panic.  Senator Lanigan, in order to belittle what the Taoiseach said on radio, actually went to the length of taking down the late Deputy <Col N="409" /> Frank MacDermot's book on Wolfe Tone and quoting it for the purpose of showing that Wolfe Tone was a shoneen and a time-server.  He said at column 111 of that day's debate, 9 October:</P>
    <P>Yet we are going on a crusade following a man of that nature.</P>
    <P>Maybe there are not too many fixed points on the Irish political horizon, but I always thought that the close association of the Fianna Fáil Party and Wolfe Tone was one of them.  I thought their only regret, to adapt a phrase of Seán O Casey's, was that they could not have their breakfast, dinner and tea in Bodenstown, so close they were to the spirit of Wolfe Tone and so rigid did they feel the rule exercised over them by him from the grave to be.  But now that the Taoiseach has, not with any intention to wrong-foot them, because I do not think he has that much cuteness in him, but with the intention of expressing his own view of what a Republic is all about, appeared to be occupying some of this sacred territory, Senator Lanigan finds himself constrained by the conditioned response of the political tribe he belongs to, to take a lumbering leap backwards away from this holy ground.  Where is he now?  Where is Senator Lanigan and his party now <i>vis-á-vis</i> Wolfe Tone?  I am not old enough to remember those days, but if anyone who is even familiar from books with the history of the 1920s and the 1930s could realise what has happened here in the last couple of days with Senator Lanigan, could find a Fianna Fáil Senator quoting Frank MacDermot on Wolfe Tone, he would find the exquisite ludicrousness of that beyond belief.</P>
    <P>I will have a word or two to say, if I have time, about a more serious thing which underlies that kind of conditioned response when I am coming to the end of my remarks.  I do not want to attribute this to any member of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; I know there is not any lady or gentleman over there who would be like this &mdash; but what I always feel about that kind of sentiment coming from that side of the House is that it is part of a kind of continue in which it is not easy to draw <Col N="410" /> the line between the various colours of the spectrum as they fade one into the other &mdash; between that kind of view and the kind of view &mdash; I am not imputing this to anybody over there &mdash; of fearful crudity which one finds expressed by persons outside the Fianna Fáil Party if you like, sometimes persons in America.  When I was in America last month I was shown by our excellent Consul-General in Boston, a lady who has had to endure a great deal of insult and difficulty at the hands of emigrant patriots, and their grandchildren or great-grandchildren in some cases, a file of newspaper cuttings which she had made so that the Department here could form an impression of the way the Massachussetts Press were reacting to events in Ireland.  You could not believe the crudity of some of these Hibernian suggestions.  A common one was that the Unionists in the North should be simply told to pack their bags and go back to where they came from.</P>
    <P>I know the Unionists in the North of Ireland have been here as a result of a plantation, as a result of a confiscation, genocide and injustice.  I have no illusions about the conditions in which the plantation first arose.  But to expect a man in Lurgan or in Portadown with a Protestant background and a Protestant name and tradition to apologise for his presence there in 1981 is not compatible with sanity. You might as well expect an Irishman living in Manhattan Island to feel guilty because he is occupying land from which the Indians were extruded forcibly at about the same period of history.  I do not notice too much shame, or anxiety to pack up and go back to their own country, on the part of any of them; I do not notice that any Indian or any descendant of the Red Indians is insane enough to suggest it.  No, that degree of insanity is reserved for the descendants of our own dear people &mdash; those of them who do not have to live with the problem.</P>
    <P>There are tribal feelings at work here. It is all very well for people to think that a Dublin-based politician like myself or any other politician can easily talk because he is far away from the events that cause these tribal feelings.  I hope the House does not think this is an admission <Col N="411" /> that it can make little of, but even I have a tribal feeling about the events of the 17th century.  If I could, by pulling a lever, reverse these events I would pull that lever.  If I could, by pulling a lever, replay and this time win the Battle of the Boyne for what I see as my side &mdash; I beg Senator Faussets's pardon for putting it like that &mdash; I would do so.  I would go back further; if I could reverse the Battle of Kinsale I would do that also.  That was the really decisive one, because the loss of that battle led to the destruction of a civilisation which, had events gone otherwise, might have left the European family with a distinctive, perhaps brilliantly distinctive, and interesting civilisation on its western shores which has now disappeared, or as good as disappeared. For that reason &mdash; the instinct of the gardener who, even if it is only that, is sorry to see the disappearance of a species &mdash; if only for that simple reason, I would reverse that battle if I could; but I cannot do it, and none of us can do it, and we have to live with the results of the 17th century and the results of the succeeding centuries and make the best of them.  If we are going to be civilised people, we will have to live with one another and bear with one another.  That has to be said in regard to this whole island, and not merely to the people who are next door neighbours or people who live down the road.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we should also try to see how much benefit we have derived from the course events have taken.  I want to put a point of view before the House &mdash; again I hope you will not think me eccentric in doing so.  I said that if I could I would reverse the Battle of the Boyne; but I want to say now that in generosity and in honesty we must admit &mdash; we, the people living here in this Republic in 1981 &mdash; that the outcome of the Battle of the Boyne has had great advantages for us too.  All the entire range of civil liberties which we take for granted, the freedom of the press, the freedom to be in political opposition without endangering one's life, the freedom to organise, the freedom to associate, the freedom to speak one's mind <Col N="412" /> about the King's Ministers, or about the Taoiseach and his Government, those were all freedoms which were denied by King James II and all who fought for him. They were freedoms which were established by King William III and those who came after him in his tradition.</P>
    <P>I do not forget the Penal Laws or the misery through which this country was put for a further 250 years.  I do not forget them; but it has to be acknowledged that, had that battle turned out otherwise, we might have struggled on for some time longer with a native nobility, and with a Catholic monarch, but at the end of the day the result, both on this island and on the island next door, might have been less happy.  We might have been slower to reach a condition of political independence and slower to reach a condition of full civil liberty.  Accordingly, we ought to admit, much though it may stick in our tribal instincts and gullet to do so that when the Orangeman sings in &ldquo;The Old Orange Flute&rdquo; about</P>
    <P>Forsaking the old cause</P>
    <P>That gave us our freedom, religion and laws</P>
    <P>that same cause gave us a good part, a fair old slice of our freedom and our laws too.  It is ungenerous of us not to admit it.  In making a point like that, I am sure I have been guilty of hyperbole.  I can see Senator Murphy looking at me with an expression on his face which I cannot easily interpret&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may be that I have cut corners in trying to make that point.  If so I will accept correction from him very gladly.  I think it right that, even though one labours under a tribal feeling of one's own, one should try to make the best of and see what benefit one has derived from the victory 300 years ago of another tribe or those who supported them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In trying to make peace between ourselves on this island we have done nothing like enough.  I hear the Fianna Fáil Senators talking &mdash; and I do not think they are alone in this degree of culpability &mdash; about our &ldquo;aspirations&rdquo; which we will <Col N="413" /> not abandon.  What are they doing about our aspirations?  What have they ever done about them?  Indeed it might be said apart from some things about which I do not want to be boasting: what have the other parties in this country done about them?  People who say that we are sticking to Article 3, the rest of our traditions and so on and our &ldquo;aspirations&rdquo; for Irish unity &mdash; even though we never give up an hour's sleep to consider how it might be achieved realistically &mdash; are like a man who is a heavy drinker but puts up a Pioneer pin and hopes that that will be accepted as a substitute for sobriety.  It is not a substitute for a policy on the North merely to talk about one's aspirations. Above all it is not a substitute for a policy to talk about aspirations plus a point of view which involves outsiders.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that the policy of the last Government placed far too heavy an emphasis on twisting the arm of the British to do something about it.  The British created the problem, they tolerated it, they bear a very heavy responsibility for taking no interest in it.  I am quite clear about that.  But they cannot make a solution stick against the will of a local majority. They could not do it in 1974 when &mdash; I forgot to mention that, incidentally because it was of course one of the major causes of the Sunningdale collapse &mdash; they failed to put down the Ulster Workers' Council strike.  They backed away then, and they will always back away from a confrontation of those dimensions on their doorstep.  There is one lot of people only who can make a solution here stick finally: that is us and the people with whom we have to share this island. Everybody else certainly can help in marginal ways.  Certainly they can refrain from making the situation worse, but they cannot alone fix it.  We must ascertain what gestures we can make or what can be made in our name that will ease this situation.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera was mentioned a few times in the course of this debate.  Naturally the House will not be surprised to know &mdash; and I hope nobody will be offended if I say it now; I shall mention him later in a different context &mdash; that my own judgment of him is that his net contribution <Col N="414" /> to Ireland was one of far more harm than good.  But I will acknowledge that in the course of a long political existence he must be credited with one very striking gesture in regard to the North of Ireland &mdash; an impulsive, emotional gesture, an absolutely correct one, and one I believe had far more effect and has always been said to have had far more effect than any number of speeches.  That was, when as Taoiseach in 1941, he ordered the Dublin, Drogheda and Dundalk fire brigades to Belfast to help put out the fires caused by the German blitz. We should be looking for more ways of imitating that spirit and instinct. Speeches will not do it for us nor will any given number of fire brigades.  I would be inviting the House's laughter and contempt were I to suggest that there was any certainty that we will ever do it anyway. But progress can be made along those lines and in my view will never be made along any other lines.</P>
    <P>It does not lie with the State alone, although as I conclude I shall have something to say about a concrete step which is being taken today which I hope will have a positive effect in the North.  There are others who could make a contribution to this.  Here what I say I am saying with diffidence.  Politicians always take it amiss, or say they take it amiss, if bishops tell them what to do.  Accordingly it is only fair to expect that bishops will not enjoy being lectured by politicians. Therefore I hope that if what I have to say now appears offensive, presumptuous, or indeed ignorant, as it may very well be, I will be pardoned for it.  It is often said &mdash; and since I do not live there I do not know whether it is true but it is said so persistently and by people I have no reason to disbelieve I feel there may be something in it &mdash; that the biggest, single obstacle to reconciliation in and with the North of Ireland is the Catholic marriage law.  The Catholic marriage law, in practice at diocese level, has been greatly relaxed from the days of, let us say, the celebrated Tilsen case here in 1950.  I do not know the details of practice in each diocese.  But I do know that in general the law has been relaxed.  In public perception it still stops short of being <Col N="415" /> fair to Protestants or to non-Catholic Christians.  I realise that the question of salvation of the soul and its association with a particular church is one on which nobody here can pronounce.  I am not pronouncing on it.  All I want to do is to record that there have been times in the history of the church, both here and elsewhere, in which a more, to the Protestant eye, equitable formula &mdash; certainly a rough and ready one, but a more equitable one &mdash; was applied.  In this country at the turn of the century and before, if I am not mistaken, there was a rough and ready rule which the church was willing, even in those more authoritarian days, to tolerate whereby the boys of a marriage followed their father and the girls their mother.  That is a rough and ready rule. I do not mention it as being anything other than that.  A similar rule operated, presumably for the same reasons of confessional intention, in the sprawling Austro-Hungarian Empire at about the same date and, for all I know, may have operated elsewhere also.  I have three sons and two daughters.  I am a Catholic &mdash; perhaps not much of a one &mdash; but I can well imagine that if my wife were Protestant she would be unhappy to see my daughters going to church with her on Sunday, to a church other than that which their brothers were attending.  But I think her unhappiness would be far greater had she to go to church without any of her children.  Although the rule is a crude one &mdash; and I do not think anything better of it than that can be said &mdash; it has at least a crude equity about it.  While I do not advocate its introduction here again, the bishops &mdash; perhaps they may be already doing this &mdash; might look at the problems which we have to face at political level and see whether the somewhat altered perception of God and religion which the second half of the 20th century has brought with it, a somewhat less totalitarian one on all sides, might be applied to this field also in such a way as to remove this grievance.  It is one of the chief sticks with which Mr. Paisley beats us.</P>
    <P>He points to the tiny Protestant population in the South.  He does not of course <Col N="416" /> say what is the truth: that the big decline in the Protestant population has not been taking place at the same pace over the years.  The big decline took place in the years immediately following the setting up of the State, when people who were essentially first generation English, civil servants and so on, and saw no future for themselves here, went back to England. They had somewhere to go to, their people had not been gone from England and Scotland for 300 years.</P>
    <P>The decline which has since taken place in the Protestant population, I hope Protestants will believe, is a grievous sight to us all.  I feel for Senator Fausset and I believe very many Catholics will feel for him when he describes that situation of a shrinking population &mdash; perhaps it is not shrinking in his county.  It is tough on people, whatever their background or history in this country, who are Irish and have no other nationality to claim.  They are our brothers and must live and work with us.  It is tough on them when they dwindle away through the operation of a law which even Catholics may feel to be harsh.</P>
    <P>Another important item is the ignorance which prevails in the North in regard to the material conditions of the Republic.  I am going to offer a couple of figures to the House, not in any triumphalist or provocative sense and not in order to annoy anybody of a Unionist persuasion, in case any such person ever reads these words.  I believe that there is a kind of rooted inherited tribal persuasion on the Unionist side that this Republic is inherently more backward than the North, that we have not made as many strides because of our Catholic and Gaelic background.  I am leaving out of the comparison the fact that what we have in this State we have had to make for ourselves, and pay for with our own pennies, until recently when we started using other people's.  Even recently when we have been using foreign, borrowed pennies, it is our own credit we have been pledging and nobody else's; whereas in Northern Ireland they have had the benefit of a share in the revenue of a very much larger and richer State whose contribution in the current financial year is <Col N="417" /> estimated by the officials whom I consulted at £1.4 billion in one year.  Naturally, they will have better motorways, social services and facilities of many kinds than we have.  I do not begrudge them that, and neither do I belittle their own native achievements which are considerable. I do not belittle those things.  I do not belittle the latter and I do not begrudge them the former, but I ask them in fairness &mdash; this is a point to which our efforts should be directed towards making it understood in the North &mdash; and in candour to bear in mind what has happened in this State.</P>
    <P>When we became independent, when this House first sat, there was virtually no industry in the country except the industry in the North of Ireland.  There were a couple of beer and boot factories here, and a biscuit factory, but that was about the size of it.  We had Pierces of Wexford and one or two more like them, but that was, by and large, the size of it.  In the North they had virtually everything that there was in the way of industry.  I have not been able to get the comparative figures in the time available to me for the early twenties, but if I had them Members may be sure that the gap would be even more impressive.  However, I have the figures for 1950.  In 1950 the proportion of people in the North of Ireland engaged in industry was 44 per cent as against 24 per cent with us.  They had almost two industrial workers to our one.  In 1980 the percentage is exactly the same on both sides of the Border, 32 per cent on each side.  That is an enormous achievement to have done by ourselves, by our own legislation and by our own grants which it was hard enough to collect the money for.</P>
    <P>In regard to the share of gross domestic product per head of the population which is a crude index of wealth generally accepted, in 1950 &mdash; as I said if I could go 30 years further back still the disparity would be even more marked &mdash; the share per head of the population in the North was £154 a year and here it was only £112. In 1978 those figures changed to £1,948 in the North to £1,747 here.  The percentage of the Republic's wealth compared to the North has increased in those <Col N="418" /> 28 years from 73 per cent to 90 per cent; and it is only 90 per cent and not more because in this State families are bigger, there are more people, children under working age, who are not working and for that reason there is a larger dependency rate and when one uses that population figure divided into the gross domestic product, naturally one ends up with a smaller end result.</P>
    <P>If one relates the figure to the work force this is how it comes out: in 1950 the gross domestic product divided by the work force showed us as only having 71 per cent of the wealth per worker of the North.  In 1978 that figure had advanced to 106 per cent.  The share of gross domestic product per worker in 1978 was six percentage points ahead of the North; and we had no imperial exchequer bailing us out or pulling us along to do that.  I say that in no triumphalist sense.  I hope the whole tone of my remarks will prove to the House that I do not mean it that way, but I do mean that we should be aiming to bring them down here and show them what we have got, let them understand that although there are, of course, differences which can be related to their membership of a larger richer state, we have made comparatively far bigger strides far faster.  I do not ignore also the very adverse impact which the troubles of the last 12 years had on their economy. They have been destructive to their economy in a terrible degree.  I do not neglect that, and I have not forgotten that they blame us in part for that; but they have been destructive to our economy too.  Our tourism has suffered; our industrial investment has suffered; our revenue has suffered because of the enormous investment in security which the Northern Ireland situation imposes upon us.  Although I believe and accept that they have suffered far more, we have not been without our sufferings on that front either.  If we could eliminate ignorance and bring before their eyes the truth of what is going on in this State, warts and all, we would be going a long way towards breaking down the Border.</P>
    <P>I advocated to the last Coalition Government and I am trying to interest my colleagues again in the suggestion that we <Col N="419" /> should take space in Northern newspapers, buy pages of newspapers and employ people who are properly trained to present a publicity case to explain to the people up there what is going on down here, tell them the bad things as well as the good, do not try to brainwash them, tell them the truth about here; but the truth at least they should be told.</P>
    <P>The second last thing I wish to say is that it often seems to me that there is a beam in our own eye when we talk about national unity.  We suffer in the Republic &mdash; I am saying this, so to speak, under a flag of truce which I know my tribal obligations will oblige me to lower as soon as I sit down &mdash; we have here in this Republic what the late Donogh O'Malley would have described as an &ldquo;insidious form of partition on our own doorstep&rdquo;.  In a few weeks, on 6 December, it will be exactly 60 years since the Treaty was signed.  That Treaty gave rise to the Provisional Government which drafted the Constitution under which the Irish State came into being, from which the present Republic has evolved.  On the other hand, it provided the political dissension which led to the civil war, and to the political conditions which leave the ladies and gentlemen on that side of the House where they are, and us over here.  I am speaking about the Fine Gael party over here.  That might be a normal political course and a healthy one in a country where, as matters then turned out, each party represented a section which had a serious economic or social interest to pursue which was in competition with that supported by the other side, or where there was a serious difference of political philosophy separating them.  But is that the case here?  Not in my experience or judgment.</P>
    <P>We are often said to be the party of the big farmers.  I could not see that in Kildare the time we did not have a seat down there in 1977.  I could not see it in Longford/Westmeath when the Minister, Deputy Pat Cooney, lost his seat.  No shortage of big farmers there; but there was not enough of them to put in two Fine Gael TDs.  No shortage of big farmers in north Tipperary where we were also left without a seat in 1977.  My experience, <Col N="420" /> broadly speaking &mdash; we can argue and chop straws about a few percentage points &mdash; is that right down through society the two big parties here are supported by much the same kind of people in much the same proportion.  We tend to develop tribal feelings, but not one which rests on a history of racial confiscation or genocide or anything of that kind; tribal feelings supported by nothing more solid than an allegience to a football team; and it leads to terrible results.  As I said a few weeks ago in a speech in Claremorris, it leads to us outbidding one another, trying to outdo one another with cheap promises, stuffing things down people's throats, paid for out of their pockets not our of ours; paid for, perhaps, by money which even they have not got, which has to be borrowed from foreigners and will be paid back with bitter tears by their children and grandchildren, for things they did not want and perhaps should never have been given or offered, just for the sake of electoral gains.  On the Northern front it obliges us to try to outbid one another and outdo one another in protestations of nationhood which are not experienced with any depth a few seconds later.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing which led Senator Lanigan to take his elephantine leap backwards on the question of the acceptability of Wolfe Tone as an honorary founder member of his party here a few days ago.  That is the kind of thing which led him to give that ludicrous quotation from Frank MacDermot.  It is not because he believes or has any strong convictions about Frank MacDermot or Wolfe Tone; but just to leave the little village ditch between us.  We have had enough in 60 years of this bickering, of muckraking each other, of trying to outdo one another with the people's money and with sentiments which even we do not sincerely feel most of the time.</P>
    <P>Although I had my own reasons for joining my party &mdash; I still have them, I still think them valid &mdash; I did it largely because of a personal regard for the late President Cosgrave who incorporated in himself virtually every quality that I would seek in a public man.  But I do not deny and could not deny &mdash; no honest <Col N="421" /> person would &mdash; the qualities of the late Éamon de Valera either.  I have already given my overall judgment on him, but I admit and respect his dignity, his personal simplicity and his devotion to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I recall that in 1973 he invited the newly incoming Government and the Parliamentary Secretaries to dinner in Áras an Uachtaráin, and I recall that, after dinner, he rose to his feet, although he was well over 90 &mdash; not long before he died &mdash; and addressed us in a fatherly way, an absolutely non-partisan way, and urged us to be loyal to one another and to the Government of which the members of the Government there present were members, rather than to the two individual parties to which they belonged. Everyone at the table found that a moving experience and when I got home &mdash; as often happened to me when I got home from here in those days, particularly after dealing with the two Fianna Fáil whips whom I came to hold in great affection and respect, Paddy Lalor and Sean Browne &mdash; I asked myself &ldquo;What is keeping us apart?  Could we not call off the civil war and stop the muckraking and bickering, and see whether the national unity which achieved such enormous amounts for this country before 1921 could be re-established?&rdquo; I know that the constraints of ordinary political existence oblige me, as they may oblige anybody who in the secret of his heart feels the same way about this, to continue along the political lines which he originally adopted; but I think it a pity that we should be lecturing the Protestant people on the North about how near they are to us and how much they have in common with us, when people who are next-door neighbours and have everything in common, including ideology about many national and social and economic issues, cannot agree in such a way that the people will benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I want to end by announcing something to the House which is a small thing.  I do not advance it as more than that.  I have been working on it since immediately after I became a member of the Government at the beginning of July.  On 6 July I asked my Department to consider <Col N="422" /> whether as a gesture towards the North of Ireland within the ambit of the tourism brief which I hold, but not for the purpose of tourist promotion, we might construct some scheme which would have the effect of inducing Northern people to come here and get to know us better, warts and all.</P>
    <P>I would like to praise in the highest terms the extraordinary degree of speed and co-operation and eagerness I got from the officials in the Department on this matter and from all other Departments and from the Government whom I then consulted about it.  I would like to acknowledge in particular the personal commitment and enthusiasm of the Taoiseach for what I am trying to do.  What we eventually found was possible, among a lot of other suggestions which for one reason or another turned out to be impracticable, is a very modest package of unique concessions which will be special to the North of Ireland and which, for the reason of their being special, I hope no one will interpret as being merely concealed attempts to bolster the tourist industry; because if they were that, I could have generalised them and extended them to all visitors from everywhere. That is not being done.  These are special concessionary arrangements, very modest ones I agree, for North of Ireland residents; and although my tourism hat entitled me to construct this special package and will entitle me to oversee it, it is not for the purpose &mdash; I want to make that absolutely clear &mdash; of crude tourist promotion that I am putting them forward or that I was first inspired to try to arrange such a thing.</P>
    <P>I am going to paraphrase in the couple of minutes left to me a short announcement that I am going to make officially as soon as I sit down.  There are four proposals which I have which the Government have approved in principle.  I want to emphasise that some work will need to be done in order to make them manageable from the administrative point of view, and that nobody must expect to find them in operation next Monday morning.  They will not be; but the four proposals to which I have got the Government's agreement in principle are <Col N="423" /> as follows: first of all, we propose that Bord Fáilte will introduce a system of free accommodation vouchers of limited value &mdash; I do not mean that all accommodation will be covered &mdash; for Northern Ireland residents based on a minimum period stay in approved accommodation &mdash; that is to try to exclude the possibility of abuse &mdash; as a token contribution to the cost of their stay.  It will only be a token, and I do not advance it as more than that. It is intended as a gesture being made in what are for us financially very hard times.  I hope that will be understood.  I hope that it will not either be misrepresented as a bagatelle too contemptible to have deserved consideration on the one hand, or as a mere device to boost our tourist revenue on the other.  It is neither of these things.  It is merely intended as a gesture of welcome.  It is a gesture which will go some distance towards buying a first meal here or buying a first few rounds of drink.  It is a gesture of welcome, and of the hope that, when they are here, people who otherwise may not have come will get to know us, get to know the truth about us.  I do not mind if they get to know the bad things that are true about us.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister for Education in the context of my suggestions is going to extend the Youth Incentive Scheme to Northern Ireland youth and sports groups who may wish to visit the Republic. Thirdly, the scheme of free travel for the elderly operated by the Minister for Social Welfare is to be extended to Northern Ireland residents travelling in the Republic who meet the conditions of the scheme.  Fourthly, the scheme of free travel for the disabled, operated by the same Minister, is also to be extended to Northern Ireland residents travelling in <Col N="424" /> the Republic who meet the conditions of these schemes.</P>
    <P>That is a very modest package.  I wish that in the time we have had, and with the number of brains available to me, eager and brilliant though these were, we could have thought of more.  I want to say genuinely to any Senator on either side of the House that I would be delighted to get further suggestions, provided that they are ones with which we could financially live, are administratively workable and do not open the door to abuse or to impossibilities of one kind or another or to misrepresentation.  The Government would be only too anxious to extend this very modest scheme.  I ought further to say perhaps that, like any other Government scheme, this one will be reviewed and perhaps re-adjusted after an appropriate time and in the light of experience.  For example, it may be found that with the limited amount of money available to us we have not really succeeded with one part of these ideas in attracting enough people to make a difference and that we would make more impact by transferring that amount of money to some other part of the scheme. I want to make it clear from the outset that we reserve for ourselves the possibility of re-adjusting that package.  But what I would most like to do is to add to it, if the Government can financially do that.  If Members on either side of the House can help me on this I will be glad to accept their suggestions.  If the suggestions should come from the Fianna Fáil side of the House, I would gladly acknowledge them as having that source.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the honour of its attention and I recommend the motion put forward in the Government's name for the House's support.</P>
