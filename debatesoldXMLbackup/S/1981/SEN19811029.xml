      <P>I should like on behalf of us all to congratulate Senator Dooge on his appointment to the Government. Not only is it constitutionally correct that Members of this House can or should be Cabinet members but it is a positive honour to all Senators that one of our Members should be so elevated.  I am sure I speak for all of us when I say that we wish him well in his very demanding position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to be associated with Senator Hussey in congratulating Senator Dooge on his appointment as Minister.  It is a great privilege for this House that we now have a Member of this House in the Cabinet. It is not the first time that this has happened. I have known Senator Dooge for many years.  I served with him when he was here as Cathaoirleach.  If he is as good and fair as a Minister as he was as Cathaoirleach, we need have no worries.</P>

      <P>I join with the Leader of the House in congratulating our esteemed colleague, Senator Dooge, on his elevation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  I served with him when he was Cathaoirleach of this House and I have no doubt whatsoever that he will make a most excellent Minister for Foreign Affairs.  As Minister-designate he performed extremely well and I have no worries for the future of that Department.</P>

      <P>I join in the welcome for the appointment of Senator Dooge as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I had not, like other Members here, the privilege of serving with him when he was Cathaoirleach of this House but I have always heard he was one of the best to hold that office.  Certainly to judge by the one speech he has made in this House since we assembled, we will be worthily represented by him and I feel sure that he will be most successful as a Minister.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  It is proposed to take item No. 3 at 7 o'clock until the adjournment of the House at 8.30 p.m. I should like to refer to the taking of Private Members' motions.  In the last Seanad we had arrangements which were generally considered satisfactory regarding the taking of Private Members' motions.  Those arrangements were incorporated in a resolution agreed to by the House.  I suggest that the Whips and Independent Senators should consider this matter so that we could put similar arrangements into effect as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As regards item No. 3, we have had no information about this. We do not know what it entails.  Therefore, we feel it should not be concluded tonight.  The Minister should address us tonight and then it should be adjourned until we have an opportunity of knowing what it is all about.</P>

      <P>In light of the fact that we did not meet last week and we do not have great pressure of business, did the Leader of the House consider discussing the fact that this is world disarmament week and discussing the biggest threat that exists to our existence?  We ought to address ourselves to these problems and I wonder did the Leader of the House consider our discussing it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express a reservation about going ahead at any rate, apart from initiating a debate, on item No. 3, until we have heard or seen and had an opportunity of considering some elaboration and explanation of the Government's intention.  At the moment, as far as I can research it, the intention consists merely of one sentence in the joint government programme which is a repetition verbatim of a single sentence in the Fine Gael Party pre-election programme. It would be unreasonable to expect us to catch all this in flight without having an opportunity to study it, as we would have in the normal course if this <Col N="433" /> were preceded by a published statement by the Government, whether Green Paper, White Paper, Bill or explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the Labour Party are not anxious to carry on the debate for an hourand-a-half here today after the Minister has introduced item No. 3.  I see the point Senators Whitaker and W. Ryan are making.  It is a very important and broad subject.  For a Government motion it has come at us fairly quickly.  It would only be fair that the Minister should give us his views about it and that further debate should cease there.  The debate should be adjourned and could be renewed next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader of the House in a position to inform us now as to when the enabling motions establishing the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and the Committee on Development Co-operation will go on the Order Paper?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. G. Hussey Mrs. G. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. G. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to Senator Willie Ryan's and Senator Whitaker's remarks on item No. 3.  There was no intention of concluding a debate on this item this evening.  There would be no objection to having the Minister make his statement and adjourning the debate then and resuming it next week.  That seems to be the general feeling.  We would like to accommodate the Senators' feelings in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator B. Ryan's remarks about world disarmament week, I take his point that that is an extremely important area. I suggest that the Senator might consider the question of Private Members' motion or other machinery for putting down a motion for us to discuss such a matter. On the item raised by Senator Quinn, I have been pursuing extremely actively the question of having the motions for these Joint Committees put before us.  I understand that they are very near completion. The composition of the committees <Col N="434" /> has been under discussion and I am told that very shortly we will have these motions before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for guarantee by the Minister for Finance of approved borrowing and leasing by Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited.</P>
      <P>The company were set up by my predecessor under the Companies Acts in April 1981, in furtherance of the policy of privatisation of investment in infrastructural services.  The primary function of the company is to obtain from the private sector, either by borrowing or leasing, up to £100 million of the £221.8 million required for the telecommunications development programme in 1981 and such other sums as might be required in subsequent years to finance telecommunications development.  The company expect to meet or almost meet the target figure for 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The raising of money by the company would be greatly facilitated if approved <Col N="435" /> borrowing or leasing arrangements they propose to enter into could be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance may issue such guarantees only if he is statutorily empowered to do so.  No such statutory authority exists in the case of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited.</P>
    <P>The present short Bill is designed to correct this.  Sections 6 and 7 provide statutory authority for the Minister for Finance to guarantee approved borrowing and leasing by the company and provide that borrowing and leasing by the company will require the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Posts and Telegraphs. There is nothing unusual in these provisions.  In the case of the vast majority of State-sponsored bodies there are legislative provisions of this kind.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 15 are standard for most Bills.  They deal with definitions of terms used in the Bill and short title of the Bill. Section 14 provides that the costs of administering the Bill will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may take up shares in the company, under section 2; dispose of shares as he thinks fit, under section 3; exercise the normal rights of a shareholder, under section 4; and he must pay any dividends received into the Exchequer in accordance with section 5. Any alteration in the memorandum and articles of association is subject to ministerial consent under section 8.  The company are prohibited under section 9 from issuing shares in the company except with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for submission of audited annual accounts and a report by the company which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Section 11 contains the usual prohibition on Members of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities from being directors of the company or working for the company while they are Members.  In order to preclude any Exchequer subvention for the <Col N="436" /> company section 12 requires the company to meet their costs from their operations.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 13 provides for exemption from stamp duty in the case of property vested in the company.</P>
    <P>Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. will operate as an independent entity under this Bill as enacted until a State-sponsored body for telecommunications is set up under legislation, the draft of which I expect to introduce in the Oireachtas during this session.  This draft legislation will provide that the ownership of Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. will be vested in Bord Telecom Éireann &mdash; the new telecommunications company which will then be responsible for arrangements necessary in connection with the financing of development of telecommunications services.  Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. will probably retain their separate identity and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bord Telecom Éireann but this would be a matter primarily for decision by the board of the new company.  The draft legislation setting up Bord Telecom Éireann will also apply to any subsidiaries of Bord Telecom Éireann.  It will accordingly provide for repeal of this Bill, if enacted.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill at a very early date is necessary if Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. are to complete negotiations for the raising of almost £100 million in sufficient time to help to finance the 1981 telecommunications development programme.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to appear to inhibit Senators in any contributions they may wish to make to the debate, I would be grateful if they would agree to leave over until another time general issues related to the telecommunications service.  The service was considered in detail when the Telecommunications Capital Bill, 1981 was before the Seanad earlier in the year. A further opportunity to debate policy and development plans for telecommunications will be available when the Bill dealing with reorganisation of the postal and telecommunications services is being <Col N="437" /> considered.  As I mentioned earlier, I expect to introduce that Bill during the current session.</P>
    <P>I ask for the co-operation of Senators in ensuring a speedy passage for this short Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend a warm welcome to the Minister to the Seanad.  This is his first occasion here since his appointment as Minister. When he was a Member of the Seanad he was a highly competent and respected Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I extend a warm welcome to this Bill. It underlines the policy of privatisation of investment, as the Minister said in his statement, in infrastructural services. This approach provides the key to the telecommunications development programme and will provide a continuity of funds for that development.  The Bill furthermore will ease the demands on the Public Capital Programme for funds. Telecommunications are obviously vital for economic and social development. Various business surveys which have been undertaken have underlined that an inefficient telecommunication service is one of the major obstacles to our industrial development.  The bulk of our overseas industrial investment comes from the United States where they have a superb telecommunications system.  As I understand it, foreign investors attach great importance to a highly efficient telecommunications system in making their investment decisions.  Therefore, in terms of job creation and development generally, this Bill fits appropriately into a programme of progress.</P>
      <P>The approach marks a new departure. It is an example of combining public and private investment for economic and social advancement in a pragmatic and sensible fashion.  I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blennerhassett</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister in bringing this Bill before us at a very early stage and I congratulate him also in coming to this House.  He was <Col N="438" /> here during the past four years as Leader of Opposition and we welcome him here today as Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>We are asked today to sanction up to £100 million to be made available to the company who were set up in April 1981. No doubt this money is needed to develop telecommunications in 1981. Telecommunications are very important. It is important that we have this system running very smoothly because in these times our telecommunications system must be in top gear.  This is not the place or time to discuss the service generally. It is right and proper that we give this Bill a smooth run and have the money sanctioned, financed by the Exchequer and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the Bill and I should like to abide by the Minister's request and confine my observations purely to the financial aspects which are dealt with in this legislation. There are some points on which I should like some further information.  I see that the Minister &mdash; perhaps in the light of his experience on the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies &mdash; has built a wall for himself against any claims that might be put forward for heavy State subscription to the capital of this company. He has set a limit of £100 which will not break anybody.  One must ask oneself if that represents a conversion by the Minister to the viewpoint which I expressed here that the Joint Committee had misdirected themselves in listening so much to the arguments put forward by very hard-pressed State-sponsored bodies about the equity-debt ratio.  One after another they came before the Joint Committee and argued that they should be treated like private companies and that it should be accepted that a 50:50 ratio of equity to debt was the right thing for them.  They did so not because they were able to establish that they were on all fours with private companies that were doing well, but simply because they regarded the burden of interest they had to pay on their borrowings as being monstrous <Col N="439" /> and inequitable and they wanted to shift it to the Exchequer.  In other words, they wanted to put a much better face on their accounts and performance than was justified in fact.</P>
      <P>I welcome, therefore, the restriction self-imposed by the Minister on the amount of money that the State can invest in the shares of this State-sponsored body.  The authorised capital of the body is not mentioned anywhere in this legislation.  I do not know how large it is, how much private investors, if they were so minded, could invest in shares in this undertaking.  There is no mention of any limit on authorised capital.  The only thing that is said is in section 9:</P>
      <P>An issue of shares of the company shall not be made unless the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, has authorised the issue.</P>
      <P>That means that the so-called &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; is on the face of it taking a very limited form.  It is apparently not envisaged that privatisation will involve subscription of shares or any participation in the profit or loss-making capacity of this enterprise.  I know that losses, at least as far as words and statute can so provide, are provided against by the restriction the Minister emphaised, the provision that they must cover the costs of their operations.  If in fact, private subscription of capital is to be limited to the provision of loans and to leasing arrangements, and if in fact these have to be guaranteed by the Minister in order to attract them, one is entitled to ask what is the particular benefit of &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery a moment ago mentioned the attraction of private money into this particular form of State enterprise as if that was going to bring a net benefit to the State Capital Programme. He knows as well as I do that there is a limited pool of savings.  If some of the stream is attracted into this particular enterprise, then it is going to be all the more difficult for the State to raise it for other parts of the State Capital Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am really bound to ask whether there <Col N="440" /> is any particular advantage in providing by this special legislation for a means by which the private sector can subscribe to State-guaranteed loans?  They can do that without any legislation.  They can do it anonymously.  What is the advantage of doing it in this form?  In what way does it bring anything into the Exchequer that could not be got in another way?  I have to ask that because, if the ideal of privatisation is to have any real success, there must be access for the private investor to something more than he can get anonymously by subscribing to a national loan or taking up Government paper.  Can the Minister, or will he, give them any share in the good fortune of this enterprise and if so in what way?  Telecommunications has a good reputation for paying its way and that is being shored up by the provision in this Bill that it must do so.  But is the State going to do more than that? Is it prepared to offer any incentive to the private investor to treat this as if it were an attractive investment offering prospects of return over and above those offered by the ordinary national loan or State investment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Coming from the town of Athlone where the Minister resides I feel that I should contribute to the Bill.  Not that what either the Minister or I have to say will make front page news on our local paper because it is not that type of Bill.  For that reason I am glad that the Bill's passage will be a very tame one.  I would like to take this opportunity, as other Senators have, of welcoming the Minister on his first session in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Bill is concerned it represents a new approach to the innovation by the previous Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to ensure the long-term financing of this important programme. I am wondering whether, since the company are wholly State owned they could not proceed in the same way as other companies, such as Irish Steel, and not have to be ratified by the Oireachtas. That is something on which the Minister might comment.  I believe that this five-year <Col N="441" /> development programme is important to the future of our country.  The Minister and officials in Posts and Telegraphs would have to welcome any additional funds into the system.  That is what this Bill will do.  It will now be a mixture of State owned and private owned, and this should be seen to be very desirable. All levels will benefit from this provision &mdash; county, regional and national.</P>
    <P>Firms such as Ericsson in the town of Athlone, Telectron and many others in this field of telecommunications will benefit in a practical way from this Bill.  It is in all our interests that this legislation is passed and the money provided so that we can get on with this important work for the future development of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the Minister.  He is obviously quite fond of this House.  He has been here as a Minister, he has returned as a Senator and now he has come back again as a Minister but we welcome him under any hat that he wishes to wear.  I hope he wears his present hat for some time.</P>
      <P>There are some fundamental provisions in this Bill that we would like to have discussed on Committee Stage.  It is obvious that this is just an enabling Bill. It enables the Minister to do certain things arising out of legislation that was put through the Houses of the Oireachtas by his predecessor.  It is impossible at a time like this to unscramble a scrambled egg, so to speak, but we may have some reservations about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise the importance of telecommunications as a fundamental part of our infrastructure particularly for industrial development and through the workings of the IDA in trying to ensure that industrialists can see in Ireland an opportunity for investment.  Telecommunications is a vital part of that.  I will abide by the Minister's request not to go into the whole area of the provision or lack of provision in the country under successive Governments, of a proper telecommunications infrastructure.  However, I would like to put on the record of the House <Col N="442" /> our party's realisation that telecommunications are very important.  Telecommunications should not be hived off to anybody outside the realms of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government to ensure that there is a proper telecommunications service.  We welcome monetary assistance from anybody for this purpose.  Both we and the previous Government have had to borrow a lot of money to run essential services.  On principle I have no objections to the private sector.  They have been given, as Senator Whitaker said, a guarantee, as if this was a loan to the Government, to ensure that there is a proper telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I would not have any worries with the existing Minister under subsection (5) regarding his holding the shares of this company for as long as he sees fit and to sell such shares after consultation with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. The proceeds of such sales are to be paid into the Exchequer.  I would hate to think that having passed an enabling Bill like this that a Minister would then dispose of all the country's interests in this company and pass them to some private speculator who could then make a lot of money. After all, this is one of the State sectors which is capable of making money.  It has made money in the past and is capable, with a proper infrastructure and proper development along the lines outlined by the Minister in his opening speech, of making money in the future.  I should not like this or any Government to be instrumental in handing over the functions of an organ of the State to the private sector when the commitment to the development of industry is the responsibility of the Government.  They should maintain the power and the link over all the infrastructure that goes into the provision of all aspects of infrastructure in this country. Telecommunications are no exception.</P>
    <P>I accept that we will have an opportunity of speaking about this when the Minister brings before us his further legislation about the semi-State body for telecommunications.  He has promised us that this draft will be introduced to the <Col N="443" /> Oireachtas during this session and that then it could accordingly provide for the repeal of this Bill.  Under those terms we would agree to the passing of the Bill today enabling the Minister to carry out the functions envisaged under the Bill which was passed in April 1981.</P>

      <P>I should like to speak briefly on this Bill and also welcome the Minister.  I come from a rural area where we still have local exchanges and where one must get three different operators in order to make a call.  This Bill is very necessary in view of the fact that we are trying to attract industry to the country. The first question potential industrialists ask is how adequate is the telecommunications system in the area.  Business is lost through bad telecommunications services.  This is why all exchanges should be automatic in the near future.  I should like to compliment the former Minister for his foresight in realising the need for a service like this.  Down through the years we have been criticised for our telephone services.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Whitaker's remarks about it being financed from the private sector, the success at the end of all this is that the service will be fully automatic by 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak largely because of a certain sense of confusion that may have arisen partly because of the use of a particular word by the Minister and certainly because of the contribution of Senator Hillery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the former Governor of the Central Bank and former Secretary of the Department of Finance set the record straight in technical terms and with the clarity he commands.  There is nothing private about a State guarantee that gives to any prospective investor absolute copperfast gilt-edged security to any proposed capital that they would venture into this area.  I would suggest respectfully to the Minister, purely in the context of what is essentially a financial enabling measure, that the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;<Col N="444" /> is a jargon word borrowed from the doctrinaire rite in England and used with a certain degree of public relations skill by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>As Senator Whitaker pointed out, it means nothing in terms of how the English language dictionary might describe it.  There is nothing private about raising capital in this form and underwriting it with a guarantee which the Minister is now seeking the consent of this House to turn into law.</P>
    <P>I believe also that we are being graded with the false suggestion that in some way a State company might be financially risky and that the attraction of private capital is an attractive alternative to the endemic loss-making activity of a State company.  There is ample evidence to suggest, not just in this country but in many other countries, that a modern, efficient telecommunications system is self-supporting and self-financing provided that the politicians allow a proper market pricing system to operate and not succumb to the kind of pressures that forces the financial controller or director of such a telecommunications company to reduce the prices below the level of the cost of servicing the capital that has been borrowed.</P>
    <P>I share with Senator Whitaker his concern for the fact that there is a limited pool of available capital and I would hope that embodies initially in enabling legislation confirmation of a package of borrowing that is ready to be taken up. The Minister might indicate what other potential sources of untapped capital, as distinct from a banking consortium or groups of foreign or domestic investors, both public and private, could be available if this State and this House are going to underwrite the sort of guarantee that we are being asked to underwrite.  In particular I should like to make reference to the possible role of pension funds in funding some of the capital infrastructure of the telecommunications industry.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, in conclusion, that the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; is a diversionary word, as Senator Whitaker has more <Col N="445" /> amply and more accurately pointed out. It is a misnomer and it should be removed from future references by the Minister to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Bill I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to say that I welcome this Bill.  It is important if we are to secure the continuance of this five-year programme and it is important, too, that this contribution would be made available to the private sector.  This programme should not be impeded in any way by any financial restraint.  During the past number of years when this programme was mooted there was a structure set up and there was recruitment into the service of very many young school leavers who will be in a position to contribute in the field of technology over the next number of years.</P>
      <P>This programme has given hope to areas far from the city, in constituencies such as my own where many of the towns still have not got STD or direct dialling. We have found over the years that in some instances it is practically impossible to attract any major industry because we have not got the proper telephone and telex systems.  There was a new ray of hope in this regard during the past number of years.  We have the change in approach in dealing with applications and I hope this will continue.  There may be friction in areas where applications are not taken strictly in rotation but I hope that the present system will continue and that there will be no reversal to the type of leapfrogging that occurred from area to area in the past merely in order to adhere to the strict rotation principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £100 shares were imposed when the company were set up by the former Minister, Deputy Reynolds.  It is very important to have long-term planning and also long-term financing, in such a massive programme rather than have the finance available on a year to year basis. It was typical of the man who set up this five-year programme, Deputy Reynolds, that he approached it not from a political viewpoint but from a successful businessman's viewpoint.  This will be very <Col N="446" /> obvious in the years to come.  I hope that road that he choose to travel at that time will also be travelled by the present Minister. It will be of terrific benefit to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on this Bill which I welcome. It is, as the Minister has stated, to enable the Minister under its terms to underwrite, to guarantee the private investments which are sought under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the mix of public and private funds in the telecommunications development because it has been a sector of public life in this country which has been starved for capital for a very long time. Unitl recently we have had one of the worst telecommunications systems of any developed country in the world.  There are still immense problems.  For that reason I welcome this pragmatic approach without getting into any philosophical argument about the private or the public nature of it.  It is not private participation, as Senator Whitaker pointed out, in terms of private involvement in management or anything like that but it seems to me very sensible to seek investment from private sources.  The effect of that investment, if it is forthcoming, will be to supplement very substantially the State investment in the system.</P>
      <P>In a country which is starving for development funds and where there is certainly a limited pool of capital available to the Government of the day, if one can supplement funding by the State by private funding, then one can fairly dramatically step up the level of investment in any facility.  If at this time it is possible from private sources to have an investment of up to £100 million out of a total of £222 million, it is obviously going to gear us for a much more substantial level of development than would otherwise be the case, having regard to the competition for State funds from so many public sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guaranteeing by the Minister of the borrowing is merely a statutory business which is quite similar, I understand, to what happens in many of the semi-State companies.  In terms of this telecommunication <Col N="447" /> development I appreciate the work that is being done and the substantial level of investment which has been going into the service during the past seven or eight years or so.  Having said that, there are still major problems. We still have a large proportion of this country operating on manual exchanges. We still have simple problems like those of us who have to work in the city, for example, phoning our county which is on manual exchanges.  We have the very bothersome business of trying to get an operator to answer a telephone in Dublin.  This is a major problem.  One can dial 10 in this city at great length without getting assistance.  It means going to the supervisor at some stages to request that we are put through.  This should not be happening.  I do not know if this is any part of major infrastructural investment because I think we are talking about personnel in this instance and about a sufficient number of people manning the manual exchanges in order to provide one with the courtesy of a reply. The service is much better in smaller towns than it is in Dublin in regard to dialling 10.  This is something that we should try to remedy.  I understand that later in this session we will be having a more substantial debate on this area of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to this House. It was my pleasure to serve through the four years of the last Government under his Whip which was unrelenting but I am glad to see him here as Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as an instance of the Minister's determination to press ahead with the programme he has in mind and press ahead with the Government programme in general in this very important area.  He has said that he will provide us with an opportunity to talk about the details of the system at a later stage.  I welcome that very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the main purpose of this Bill, so far as I can understand it, is to provide essential moneys so that the <Col N="448" /> work can be pressed ahead with at the earliest date possible but I should like to express some concern about the question of privatisation which has been mentioned already by Senator Quinn and by Senator Whitaker.  Senator Quinn explained to us that this is a problem of the use of the English language.  The word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; is one of those words that has come into the English language and which has a specific meaning. It means, to many people, a transfer of public resources, public organisations, public interests to private interests. Whereas we understand clearly that this Bill is an enabling Bill in order to provide moneys so that work can be proceeded with at present, I should like to put on record my concern that the policy of privatisation of investment in infrastructural services as mentioned here is something which has to a certain extent crept up on us without our discussing it in any great detail or discussing the basic principles which are at issue.  It seems to me to raise the important question as to the role of the public sector &mdash; the question of semi-State bodies, the whole question of the division between the private sector and the public sector and the basic philosophy which we should have in mind when we are approaching these matters. This seems to be a financial Bill.  I hope we will have an opportunity later on to discuss this type of matter in greater detail.  We should not proceed without great care into an area in which we start whittling away at the whole structure of semi-State bodies which have, by and large, served this country well and which to many of us might be preferable as a matter of principle to a total, with Senator Quinn's permission, privatisation of what goes on in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Those on the other side of the House seem to consider this to be an occasion where they can tell us about the very fine Minister they had.  I am sure he is an excellent man.  This Bill is tidying up a legislative procedure which should have been undertaken when this company was established.  The obvious deficiency is that the Minister did not <Col N="449" /> have the authority to guarantee on foot of the borrowings of that company which obviously would present a considerable problem when the paid-up share capital of the company was only £100.</P>
      <P>The question of the amount of money which it is intended should come from private sources this year has been dealt with by Senator Whitaker.  All this Bill is doing and all this company has been doing so far is to depress the amount of Government borrowing so that a good face could be put on the budget last year. That is the reality of it.  It has nothing at all to do with privatisation or the ownership of the telecommunications network of the company by anybody other than the State.  It is merely a method whereby, instead of the Minister borrowing the money, he got a company to borrow it.  Therefore it did not count as Government borrowing.  It came under the heading of public sector borrowing.  Basically this is only a method of raising public money.  I would be very worried if I felt that the Minister was not going to own all the shares in this company in the immediate future.  Obviously the Minister is going to own the shares in this company in the immediate future.  The life of this Bill will be very short anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will confirm that when he will be guaranteeing sums up to £350 million &mdash; the actual amount will probably be considerably less than that &mdash; he will be in total control of the company and while he will be able to sell the company eventually, obviously he would not sell the company while still continuing to give the guarantee.  That is the confusion which has arisen with regard to the Bill &mdash; that the power which the Minister will have and the way in which he is going to exercise that power are two different matters.  I presume the Minister is going to retain the 100 per cent ownership of the company as long as the guarantee exists.  If you are genuinely getting into the area of divesting the State of ownership of some of the needs of telecommunications, there is no reason in the wide world why the other shareholders should not equally guarantee whatever venture was agreed upon in this House <Col N="450" /> and by the Government at that time.  It is worthy of note that we on this side of the House do not feel committed in principle to that long-term objective at this stage.  Certainly we will discuss it.</P>
    <P>I have a technical problem with regard to section 8 of the Bill.  That is an unwelcome development in that it overrules the provisions of the Companies Acts of 1963 and 1977.  It seeks to make a law that the change of the memorandum and articles of association of this company cannot be done except with the consent of the Minister for Finance and, where appropriate, the Minister for the Public Service.  This problem may not arise, but anybody doing business with that company in the immediate future would not be aware of this.  There would be no mechanism by which he would be aware that this restriction was placed on the activities of that company which is an ordinary company registered under the 1963 Companies Act.  If, as any prudent borrower would, he looked at the document files in the Companies office he would not find any note there of this restriction on any change in the memorandum and articles of association.  The Minister should consider making a change in the memorandum and articles of association and writing in the provision of this section so that those people who are doing business for the company would be aware that this restriction exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>In lending my support to this enabling legislation I will echo a lot of what my colleague Senator O'Connell said.  I respect the Minister's request that we do not engage in any broad discussion on the whole telecommunications service at this time.  This is not the time when we should be spreading our wings on the topic but I welcome the assurance in the Minister's speech that we will get the opportunity to delve into that in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative that we support this Bill at this stage so that the necessary moneys are made available or can be secured to enable the programme for 1981 to be put in hand.  Of itself that <Col N="451" /> would generate a certain activity in the economy which can contribute at this stage to employment development.  Now more than ever we need some encouragement in that field and that is one of the main reasons why I lend my support at this stage to this enabling legislation.</P>
    <P>I am influenced also by the statement of the Minister that Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited will operate as an independent entity under the Bill until a State-sponsored body for telecommunications is set up under legislation. The Minister went on to state that he hoped to do this during the current session. When that legislation comes before this House and the Dáil we will have the opportunity to debate in some depth the whole question of privatisation irrespective of how that is to be interpreted.  As an original nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I have to say that the ICTU view with a jaundiced eye any handing over of the public service to the private sector in a manner which would enable that service to become a plaything or a pawn in the power of the vested interest group who might hold the community to ransom at any time for a specific purpose.  When you talk about the telecommunications service you are talking about a very important element of our whole social, cultural, political and economic set-up.  I am lending my support to it but I hope that when we get the proposed legislation before us dealing with the setting up of the new State-sponsored body we will be able to delve into this question much more deeply and express more clearly our reservations, whatever they may be, about the functions of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited as a subsidiary of that new State-sponsored body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their cooperation with my request for a rather confined debate which I appreciate.  I am sure they understand my reason for that request now, having regard to the serious matters which were touched on in <Col N="452" /> the course of the debate, any one of which could give rise to a separate debate.  As far as I can I will take up the points made.  Some of these points could be the proper subject for a separate debate by this House.  For example, what is the role of the semi-State body?  Are they to be isolated to a commercial end or are they to have a social end?  How are they to be financed, and so on?</P>
      <P>First, I thank Senators who welcomed me here.  We had a pleasant time here in the last four years and no doubt the present House will have an equally pleasant time for the next four or five years.  I look forward to coming back here reasonably quickly.  I corrected Senator Hillery wrongly when I said it was not my first time here.  I had the unique experience in the last House of being present both as a Member and in a ministerial capacity. That was what confused me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing the Bill I should perhaps have given its context in greater detail and so clarified the position for some Senators.  Senator O'Leary has put his finger on the reason for this Bill.  The reason essentially is that the private company who were set up could not do what they were set up to do legally because they could not give a guarantee for the money.  Only a nominal capital of £100 was provided in the company.  Without a ministerial guarantee nobody would lend the type of money that they were seeking, but where was the power of the Minister to give that guarantee?  Some legal debate took place on this matter.  Differing legal views emerged and the stronger view has been preferred eventually and has resulted in this Bill here today.  Not even a letter of comfort could be given without having the statutory power, in other words the power from the Oireachtas. That is as it should be.  The company were set up in pursuance of a policy set out in the public capital programme for 1981 which used the happier form in the English language than the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;, which is a piece of shorthand not entirely suitable and which has the overtones to which Senator Quinn referred.  The public capital programme used the term &ldquo;private sector participation&rdquo;<Col N="453" /> which is much more active and is what this is all about.</P>
    <P>The intention was that funds which might not be available directly to the Exchequer could be tapped for investment in infrastructural matters such as the telephone service.  I take the point that there is just the one pool of money in the country but there are different streams within that pool.  It does not follow that this money could be as easily available or easily get-atable if it was all to be got in the orthodox way.  People for reasons of their own might not want to invest in gilts at a particular time.  Funds under the control of a person might be available in some other way.  It is to provide for this diversification of investment that it was felt, and properly, that a different type of approach should be made. We all know that in the private sector people who are managing large funds like to be able to diversify them.  We could argue as to whether the diversification is merely nominal but I think I will be able to show that in this case it will be a real diversification because we are providing here an opportunity for the start of direct investment of some of these funds into an infrastructural service.</P>
    <P>As I indicated this Bill is only a temporary measure until such time as the new Bord Telecom is set up.  An Bord Telecom will be an independent State-sponsored body.  They will be a company the shareholding of which will be owned by the State, and all their assets will consequently belong to the State.  They will be entitled to go independently to this company when they set it up as a subsidiary if that is the way they want to operate.</P>
    <P>They will have autonomy in that regard to go direct to the private sector and say &ldquo;These are our plans for development in this area of telecommunications; it is a good investment vehicle and would you be interested in lending us money?&rdquo; It is hoped that the private sector will agree, and the indications are that funds will be available for investment in telecommunications. Experience abroad indicates that it is an attractive scene for investment funds.  What we are doing here is <Col N="454" /> starting on that process.  I take the point that once the Minister is giving a guarantee there is merely a semantic difference at this stage.  Nevertheless, it is a difference and the beginning of a different form of seeking investment in the public area.</P>
    <P>I have explained why it is necessary to come before the House and look for the Minister's guarantee.  The fact that it has been given willy-nilly brings the matter into the realm of the public capital programme, though in terms of crude statistics some benefit may be achieved by having the matter done this way.  I would like to reassure Senators that this is a temporary measure to take advantage of funds which are available and which are needed urgently to continue the high level of investment taking place on the telecommunications development scene. It would be a pity if these funds were not to be available when they are there or if anything is done that might suggest that this is an uncertain scene, that technical difficulties may crop up and it is not worth the bother, because many investments are available for these funds possibly on a much simpler basis.  We would not want to queer the pitch for this new development, and we are anxious to be able to take up the funds that are now readily available for the reason of reassuring the investors that it is a good scene.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is also the very practical reason that we need this money in order to complete this year's investment programme.  The amount to be invested is £221.8 million, an immense sum.  As Senators have universally recognised, investment in this area is important to the future development of the country.  The competition for industries from abroad is becoming more intense.  We must be in a competitive position and one thing that will enable us to sell Ireland as a location for these foreign industries is, of course, good telecommunications.  It is a very important investment area which we must continue to attend to and that is the importance of being able to take up these funds that are available.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker raised the question <Col N="455" /> of capital and wondered whether I was converted.  If he reads some of the minutes of the proceedings of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies he will see that I made the point from time to time to people who were complaining about their equity position that it was as broad as it was long in so far as the Exchequer was concerned.  I have no particular commercial ideology in this regard, but the one way we can test objectively the success of a State-sponsored company is to give them commercial criteria and look at their bottom line.  Some of these companies have a social role and if that can be identified they should be paid separately for that.  If we give them a commercial mandate and look at the bottom line we have to set them up according to proper commercial standards and normal commercial practice. That implies having a proper debt-equity ratio; otherwise they can take shelter for trading inefficiencies and point to the high increase that their loan capital has accumulated.  However, this is opening a whole new area on which I would welcome a debate here at some time.</P>
    <P>In relation to another point raised by Senator Whitaker as to the taking up of capital in this company by the private sector, that is not intended and it is not intended that the capital will ever be increased to enable this.  It is purely a company to obtain loans, and that is the intention.  The loans will, of course, be investments by the lenders in the telecommunications service.  How the new Bord Telecom do this will be a matter for themselves, but I assure the House that they will have no power to sell off any part of their equity to any private investor. The House will see the provisions for the retention of the monopoly and so on when the main Bill comes before the House in due course.  The board will be empowered to go to the private sector to borrow money and to have whatever leasing and other financial arrangements they want with their lenders, but the beneficial ownership will remain in the State as the main shareholder.  I want to reassure the House about that.  Senator Ferris <Col N="456" /> expressed worries in that regard.  I do not think anyone will want to take shares in this company having regard to the problem that would be incurred and the fact that it is guaranteed by the Minister.  The Minister will hardly sell his guarantee along with the shares.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked what other sources of capital could be touched.  He mentioned for example pension funds.  It is very likely that pension funds and those managing them would be interested in telecommunications as a scene to invest some of their funds.  The Minister for the Environment with his hopes for his new housing agency will be looking to those funds also.  Therefore, ample opportunities for diversification will be offered to the managers of various investment funds.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell and Senator Carroll were also worried about hiving off to the private sector.  I assure them that that is not intended, that An Bord Telecom will be a State company with the shares owned by the State.  There is no question of allowing the role of semi-State companies to be diminished for any ideological or policy reasons.  If they turned out to be commercially inept, had not been given an opportunity to prove themselves commercially or it happened that they were not capable of fulfilling that role, then obviously, as a matter of practicality, one would have to look at it, but that would not happen for any change of policy with regard to the role of the semi-State bodies.  They are well-established as part of the Irish economic and political structure and they will be retained unless some consideration such as I have referred to arises.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary does not like the provision in the Bill that changes cannot be made in the memorandum and articles without the consent of the Minister.  It is not a good argument to say that has been the case in every such Bill relating to this, but it would be an unusual person who would go to the company's office and see articles of association and memorandum littered with references to the Minister for Finance and not have warning bells ringing if he was proposing to do anything <Col N="457" /> commercially with the company that might be affected by changes in the memorandum or articles.  I cannot conceive how that could arise, having regard to the share capital and the provisions for the ownership of the share capital.  It is right that the Minister should retain those powers as this is a State company and that any changes made in the mandate of the company through the memorandum would have to be subject to his sanction.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Staunton's contribution, I do not want to open up the debate on the actual operation of the telecommunications scene but he did touch on this point.  In fairness to the personnel concerned, I will have to take him up on it.  He referred to the difficulties of getting an answer when you dial 10 in the city and compared it unfavourably with the position in the country and he was inclined to blame the personnel for this.  It is not the fault of the personnel or is it lack of personnel.  It is a factor due to the present unsatisfactory state of the telephone service generally, but a state of dissatisfaction which is improving rapidly and I am hopeful that in six or nine months there will be a clear public perception of improvement.  The operator whom one is trying to get on 10 has also to use the same system to get the phone calls down the country that are being asked for.  He or she is experiencing delay and that compounds the delay back to the person who has dialled 10.  It is not the fault of the personnel and it is not the result of not having enough personnel.  I must say that in fairness to them.  They do a good job and retain remarkably patient composure having regard to the attitude of people who eventually get them after dialling for a long time.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard can be assured that the most efficient manner possible of dealing with telephone applications will be implemented and organised and there will be no change.  A coherent programme of orderly development will be the policy.  He paid tribute to my predecessor and I join him in that, but I will not confine it to my immediate predecessor. I will also include the Minister before that&mdash;Deputy Faulkner&mdash;and to be absolutely <Col N="458" /> fair, and the record will bear this out, the first major improvement and investment in the telecommunications service was made when ex-Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  That is a matter of record which is very often overlooked.  A glance at the Estimates for the Department for the years in question will show the graph going up, dipping and then coming up again.  I recommend Senators to look at that sometimes and keep the whole thing in perspective.</P>
    <P>I have covered the points raised, though not in the depth to which Senators might like them to be dealt with because the questions raised encompass serious implications and weighty issues.  I assure Senators, in concluding, that there will be no hiving off of ownership to the private sector.  It will not be privatisation but private sector participation.  If I used that term instead of &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; in my opening speech we might have avoided some of the worries that Senators expressed.  When An Bord Telecom are set up and they go after money through the medium of this subsidiary company, Senator Whitaker will be convinced at that stage that it will be genuine private sector participation.  I have to take the point that he makes now, nevertheless that does not diminish the fact that it is the thin end of the wedge towards starting this new development.  To that extent this is an important and useful Bill.</P>
    <P>I also want to thank my fellow townsman, Senator Fallon, for his good wishes and share with him the wish that this investment will continue and be of benefit to the well-known industry in our town.</P>

      <P>This section gives the Minister an opportunity of clarifying a little further one cause of the worries some of us expressed a few moments ago on Second Stage.  This section provides that the Minister for Finance may not take up by subscription shares to an amount exceeding £100.  Is that the authorised maximum capital of the company?  That is not stated anywhere and because of that, when one comes to section 9, one does not know what to make of it.  Is section 9 merely saying that the issue of shares, which again is being tied up by the consent of two Ministers, is limited to that £100 or can it be any amount of money?  That was a cause of worry to many of us on Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I can clarify that for the Senator. The company are defined in the definition section as Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited and the capital is £100 divided by 100 shares at £1 each. Again the confusion has risen because we are doing here something that possibly might have been done the first day.</P>

The explanatory memorandum in paragraph 2 says that the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for guarantee by the Minister for Finance of approved borrowing and leasing by the company.  Perhaps the Minister could reassure us on this technical point.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of capital punishment is repugnant to most people, including myself.  Compelling arguments can be made for either the retention or abolition of the death penalty in certain circumstances.  I share the view that at this point in time it would be entirely inappropriate to abolish capital punishment for the murder of gardaí and prison officers in the course of their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the desirability of abolishing capital punishment, but only when the present levels of organised crime and subversive activity have been greatly reduced.  It is true that capital punishment has been or is being removed from the Statute Books of most west European countries.  The Minister in his opening address pointed out that France recently enacted legislation abolishing the death penalty.  As we are all aware, the position in Ireland is that capital punishment has not been carried out since 1954.  Could I, in turn, point out to the Minister that we are not now discussing the abolition of current practice, as was the case in France up to recently, but rather the question of removing from the Statute Book the most emphatic denunciation of the community at large of those who would murder gardaí and prison officers.  It is a matter for the deepest regret that several unarmed gardaí have been murdered in the course of their duty over the past decade.  It may prove relatively easy to <Col N="461" /> remove capital punishment from the Statute Book, but, even in the event of a further major deterioration in the levels of crime and subversive activity, it may prove very difficult to reverse the situation and to re-enact what it is now proposed to abolish.</P>
    <P>Violent robbery and kidnapping are facts of life in Ireland today.  Governments have a continuing obligation to tackle and to intensify their efforts against crime and lawlessness.  Who can say that organised crime and subversive activity will not increase to a point where capital punishment will be needed to defend the community?  If this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas, the option to exercise the most severe penalty which the community has at its disposal in its own defence will be gone.  It is true that if we retain the death penalty we will be out of line with most west European democracies.  It is also true that we have particular problems in Ireland, especially in relation to the North.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer briefly to the Garda Síochána, that splendid unarmed force of men and women.  Indeed it seems to me that one of the most valuable features of our democracy is the fact that the police force are unarmed, and long may it remain so.  Capital punishment constitutes the additional protection under law for our unarmed police force.  There is the obvious danger that the abolition of capital punishment may lead to the eventual arming of the Garda.  That would be a step backwards and a severe blow to our democratic practices.  In effect it would give the police the right to execute people in the course of their duty.  I believe this is a course which neither the police nor the community wish to see develop.</P>
    <P>For my own part I have not detected a public demand for the abolition of capital punishment.  With organised crime and subversive activity on the increase, there is no convincing case at this time for the Oireachtas to abolish the death penalty, especially since the record shows that it would be used only in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a measure of the difficulty of the central issue of this Bill that even members of the Government, apparently, should be divided about it and that the major party in Government, should be under pressure to allow their members not to vote for it if this would violate their conscience or their good judgment.  As an Independent Senator, I am entirely free to take either a positive or a negative attitude.  I approach the consideration of this measure with a very strong commitment to law and order, with admiration for the efficiency and courage of the Garda Síochána, and with every disposition to support and protect them in their efforts to bring criminals to justice.  I have considered carefully the arguments against the Bill advanced in a letter from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and I have explained my position to them as I now propose to do to the House.</P>
      <P>If the 1964 Act were in fact being rigorously applied, and those convicted of capital murder were without exception being executed, I would hesitate to change the law on the presumption that it was acting as a deterrent even though I could not prove this.  I would feel it was too plausible a presumption to be lightly discarded.  But when the Executive is evidently not disposed to apply the law &mdash; and that has been the case for nearly 30 years &mdash; even in the vicious and violent conditions of recent times, I cannot see that an empty threat of execution can really be a deterrent.  A deterrent not exercised must cease to be a deterrent.  I see, therefore, no point whatever in postponing the removal of such an empty deterrent from the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must disagree with Senator Hillery's approach.  I regard the Statute Book as something that contains laws intended to be enforced and not just a collection of warnings or desires of society.  Frankly, I do not understand the viewpoint of those who oppose this Bill simply on the basis that this is not the right time to abolish the death penalty.  Unless they are optimistic enough to believe that <Col N="463" /> there will be a withering away of organised crimes of violence within a few years &mdash; and certainly I am not optimistic on that score &mdash; surely the attitude &ldquo;abolish, but not now&rdquo; is no more than a euphemism for indecision and evasion, particularly if those who take this line are not determined to enforce the death penalty in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Are they not also overlooking the pressure that would be exerted on Governments to exercise the prerogative of mercy, that is, to transform a sentence of death into one of life imprisonment? Whether it is today, or at some grimmer time in the future, I cannot see that Governments are likely to insist in all cases on the death penalty being enforced, and that would be the case even if there were some more expeditious and less grizzly manner than hanging.  Would there not be heart-searching among members of any Government before sending a young woman, say, or, perhaps, an only son to death?</P>
    <P>No criminal, therefore, could be convinced that execution would follow inevitably on his or her conviction for a cappital murder and I would go so far as to say that, even if there were an absolute certainty of capital punishment, one could not be sure that this would deter many of the callous and hardened criminal types now all too numerous in our society.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, it seems that the reluctance of successive Governments to enforce the 1964 Act reflects a basic and widespread change of attitude on the part of our citizens towards capital punishment. There is, undoubtedly, general abhorrence and condemnation of the murder of gardaí in the execution of their duty.  Paradoxically, however, and I think mercifully, the spread of detestable crimes of violence has in some way engendered greater sensitivity in many people towards even the judicial taking of life.  If this can be seen as a reaction to the contempt for life shown by so many ruthless and mindless criminals today, it is a welcome sign that civilisation will survive.  It is also consistent with Christian <Col N="464" /> principles that evil should be absorbed by non-violence rather than returned to its perpetrators.  I suggest that the turning away from the death penalty among many of our citizens, which is reflected indeed in this Bill, should be seen in this light rather than in any sense as detracting from the support or protection our society wishes to give to the forces of law and order, including gardaí and prison officers particularly.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made, and it was echoed in Senator Hillery's contribution, that, if the deterrent of the death penalty is removed, the Garda Síochána will have to become more of an armed force and that what has been, in my view, mistermed &ldquo;summary execution&rdquo; of criminals will then take place.  Summary execution implies deliberate and unwarranted killing by security forces.  This is not what happens if, in an exchange of fire, armed criminals or even innocent bystanders are killed.  Senator Hillery spoke as if the Garda Síochána were entirely an unarmed force at present, which is not the case.  I have been forced very reluctantly to the view that, in today's conditions, a police force can carry out its public duty only if it contains contingents which carry effective arms and are trained and allowed to use them, if necessary, against armed criminals, whatever the consequences.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Minister &mdash; perhaps inadvertently but certainly incautiously &mdash; in his Second Reading speech used exaggerated language when he spoke of his intention to: &ldquo;remove completely the right of the State to inflict death on any person for whatever reason in the future&rdquo;.  He was obviously overlooking contingencies, not only such as those I have just described, but of armed rebellion or war or any other serious threat to the existence of the State.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have given I cannot believe that the moth-balled 1964 provisions constitute a more effective deterrent to murder or a stronger protection for the Garda Síochána than a long term of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>On one point in the Bill I would like <Col N="465" /> further explanation.  While, obviously, the sentence substituted for the death penalty for section 3 convictions must be extremely severe, I am not convinced that the Government is right in so rigidly debarring itself from exercising any clemency, even in the most exceptional cases.  In any case this rigidity is in marked contrast with the open-ended approach to the extent of the remission that may be granted under prison rules for good conduct.  This remission, I gather, is one-third of the sentence at present.  Presumably it could be less or more in the future.  Is the Minister satisfied that provision need not be made for some oversight of these rules, at least in relation to the section 3 convictions, oversight by the Government and the Oireachtas?  At the moment, I do not know who decides what the remission should be, who makes these prison rules or what oversight anybody has over them.</P>
    <P>I have confined my remarks strictly to the content of the Bill but I would like to conclude by saying that, in the general area of criminal justice and protection of society, fresh thought needs to be given urgently to the means by which, if at all possible, the number of serious crimes committed may be reduced and, where they are committed, the likelihood of apprehension and conviction may be increased.  The disproportion at present between the growing number of crimes committed and the small number of criminals brought to justice is much too great. The dice seem to be loaded in favour of the criminal.  Law abiding citizens are entitled to live and go about their business and pleasure without being molested, intimidated or murdered, and we must see to it that this entitlement is preserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In many respects what I have to say will probably reflect, in the language of a younger generation, the same sentiments as Senator Whitaker expressed.  There is a problem of violence in Irish society, both political and nonpolitical. Because of the continuing violence of the paramilitary organisations, <Col N="466" /> we now tend to tolerate on some occasions a level of violence from the security forces, both North and South, that would not have been tolerated in the past.  I have never understood how the violence of a young deprived child in Seán McDermott Street is not understandable and the violence of a garda under severe provocation in Merrion Road is understandable. Violence is always wrong and anybody who overreacts and behaves violently ought to be criticised and condemned by society, irrespective of the provocation.  I say that as one who has some experience of violence from the work I have been involved in and I will mention that later.  There are various ways of responding to the problem of serious violence.  It is regrettable that the tradition of non-violence is not a bigger part of our history and that the role of non-violence in the period of Daniel O'Connell in particular, when he resolutely refused to contemplate in any circumstances, the use of armed force to achieve his political ends, has been omitted from the analysis of our history and has not played a bigger role.</P>
      <P>Gandhi managed to liberate 600 million people by the use of non-violence. Political leaders worry and are concerned implicitly, even if they do not realise it, with non-violence because the trouble with a society which is dedicated to non-violence is that you have to develop a high level of consciousness among people about the power and the worth of non-violence. It is not something you can whip up and exploit emotionally as can be done with slogans about nationalism and war. Politicians and political leaders are often afraid of violence and this is by way of an introduction to what I want to address to one of the problems of violence in society, which is, the apparent willingness of some societies at some times to use violence to protect that society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some day I hope to talk about this on the military level but today I want to talk about it on the individual level of the sort of penalties society chooses to use to deal with murder and violent crime.  There has been some discussion on the deterrent value of capital punishment and some <Col N="467" /> people surprised me by saying that, if it could be proved to them that capital punishment had a deterrent value, they would revise their views on the abolition of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>I would like to make my own position perfectly clear.  Capital punishment is immoral and degrades a society which chooses to operate it.  It is morally wrong for any society to take to itself the right to meet terror with terror.  That is my position; other people are entitled to their opinions.  I doubt its deterrent value but I will discuss that later.  Capital punishment is wrong in itself.</P>
    <P>I ought to make something clear because one of the emotional arguments, an understandable one, that has been used in this debate is the need to protect the police force.  I have no desire to suggest that our police force should have to meet armed violence without proper protection from our society.  I do not know how many Members of this House have had to deal with violence and, to an extent, with armed violence I am not claiming to be unique in this and I am not trying to make myself out to be anything like a saint in spite of kind words that are occasionaly said about me by well intentioned people in the media.  I am a very ordinary person in my private life.  Anybody who is involved with the Simon Community experiences violence on an individual level and sometimes on a collective level.  I have had to deal with a person who had a carving knife stuck in his belt and who wanted to stab the person who stood behind me.  I also had to deal with people armed with bicycle chains who were directing them at me, with people carrying knives and people who used violence, not for political reasons but because of their own disturbed and distorted natures.  I do not believe that that would justify me in using excessive violence to deal with that person. Anybody in the organisation with which I am associated who overreacted to violence would cease to be a member of the organisation.  I do not believe that the gardaí are the only people who sometimes have to deal with violence and that <Col N="468" /> they are the only ones who have to deal with people who are criminally dangerous. I believe, passionately, that there is another way to deal with most of the violence in our society and I will talk about the residual problem later on.</P>
    <P>I want to talk, in that context, about the whole question of deterrents to crime.  If the deterrent is out of proportion to the crime, in general that will deter people.  I have no doubt that in relatively recent days when castration was often the penalty for rape in the United States, that was, to some extent, a deterrent because the penalty was out of proportion.  In some of the Middle Eastern countries where amputation of a hand has been returned as a penalty for theft, that is a deterrent.  Does the deterrent factor make those penalties conceivable in our society?  If it does not, I fail to see how the concept of taking a life as a penalty for a life could ever be thought of as a deterrent.  A deterrent can be wrong in itself and what is wrong in itself cannot be justified by its deterrent value.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of work done around the world would suggest that the locking up of people in prison has no real deterrent effect, other than the fact that some people who would otherwise commit crimes are locked up for six months, nine months, or a year.  There is no real evidence to suggest that criminals of any category will be deterred by penalties. That is my experience and I know a fair number of people with criminal records. The deterrent that bothers people is the fact that they might be caught.  If they think they will not be caught, they will not think about the possible penalty. Whether it is three, six, nine, 12 months, two years or life imprisonment, when people are contemplating murder these things do not deter most of them.  I am not just talking about petty thievery, but about serious crimes, crimes of violence and, indeed, murder.  The one person I know who has been convicted of murder could just as easily have murdered a policeman as the person he murdered.  It was in a squabble, he was drunk, and he was convicted of murder.  If the victim had been a uniformed policeman, then <Col N="469" /> we would be talking about capital punishment. It could just as easily still be a policeman or a prison officer, because this fellow is violently inclined.  I fail to see why, if he happened to kill a policeman or a prison officer rather than an innocent bystander, we should distinguish between those two crimes.</P>
    <P>There is another way to deal with crimes, prisoners and prison.  Some of the experiences of the Simon Community with whom I work on a very local and individual level have suggested that many people who are condemned as habitual criminals are not really as dangerous or harmful to society as people would imagine. I would like to mention a man who is closely associated with Mother Teresa of Calcutta but who is rarely talked about to the same extent &mdash; a man called Jean Vanier.  One of the reasons why Jean Vanier is not so popular is that a lot of the work he does, apart from working with mentally handicapped people, is done with prisoners, and usually not petty criminals but long-term murderers, rapists and such people.  He describes those as the wounded of society.</P>
    <P>It would help us if we were to try to develop the compassion in our society which sees people as wounded.  Although I detest the activities of the Provisional IRA and other paramilitaries and what they stand for, I still believe that they are the product of one of the most wounded urban societies that western Europe has ever known.  That needs to be said and reiterated.  What they do is appalling and scandalous, but they are the wounded products of a wounded society.  There is a great need, in the light of the appalling crimes that people like these commit, for a society which claims to be civilised, and motivated by Christian principles, to keep that value of compassion and understanding very much alive in any debate on how to deal with the problem.  Otherwise, if we are talking purely about punitive methods, we are talking not about protecting society but about getting our own back.  We are talking, effectively, about meeting terror with terror.  That is immoral and wrong and it degrades our <Col N="470" /> society far more than the activities of those organisations.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the two kinds of murder that I have already mentioned. I have no idea why this severe penalty was instituted, other than in answer to an effective garda lobby, as they are entitled to lobby on this issue. Life imprisonment technically means life imprisonment.  The fact that the compassionate and perfectly justifiable practice has been to make life imprisonment mean roughly seven to ten years does not mean that anybody who is sentenced to life imprisonment is going to serve anything less than life, unless there is a good reason to believe that he will not commit a crime again.  I do not understand why we should sentence somebody to a totally barbaric sentence of 40 years in prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in one of the purple patches in his speech, quoted an Australian reference to the destroying of life. Are we to substitute a slow destroying of life for a speedy destroying of life?  That is what we are doing if we lock somebody up for 40 years, irrespective of mitigating circumstances and the context in which the crime was committed.  Just because certain crimes are committed, we lock them up for 40 years.  That is, effectively, destroying a life.  I am ashamed of a Government which substitutes a mandatory penalty like that, linked in with provisions to make it difficult for it to be repealed.  That is slowly, instead of speedily, destroying life.  It brings into question what Government see as the function of imprisonment.  Are we locking up these criminals to deter other people, to prevent crime or to get our own back?  I suspect, in a lot of the talk about the less pleasant crimes, particularly the politically motivated crimes and things that are done in the name of political attainment, and often, too, for criminal purposes, many people are motivated by the desire to get their own back.  If there is any hint of vengeance in the proposal for a sentence of 40 years, then, again, it degrades us and humiliates our society.  I do not understand the provisions for that.</P>
    <P>Prison, I used to believe, had a rehabilitative <Col N="471" /> purpose.  I do not know whether that is still the philosophy of the Department of Justice but I understood prison was primarily seen as an attempt to rehabilitate. How can you rehabilitate somebody if you are going to lock him up for 40 years?  How are the two objectives reconcilable?  I do not understand the restriction on repeal.  Neither do I understand the extraordinary anomaly where, in Northern Ireland, a Government that many Members of this House would regard as hostile to the interests of the Irish people or as less than sympathetic, can allow 50 per cent remission for the sort of crimes that are specially listed in this Bill, whereas in our society the maximum remission we will allow is 25 per cent.  For instance, some people who were sentenced for the Miami Showband murder who got 35 years will be out, at the very most, in 17½ years.  We will lock up their counterparts for 30 years.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting aspects of sex discrimination is that women get more remission than men.  I wonder will the Leader of the House raise that form of discrimination in the appropriate areas. I do not understand what we are going to do with these long-term prisoners or where we will put them.  Will we put them in the Curragh so that we will have another 40 years of visiting committee reports recommending that the Curragh be closed down?  Are we going to put them in Portlaoise Prison where <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Mayfair</i> are acceptable reading material for the prisoners but <i>Bunreacht na hÉireann</i> is not, because it is a security risk?  I would like to know where we will put them, what we will do with them, how we will occupy them.  Is there any thought on this, or is it simply a bit of shadow-boxing, knowing full well that the Government will recommend, under the Constitution, that these people should be given special remission and have their sentences commuted in the future?  Are we putting something in here which means nothing and is just there to satisfy the gardaí?  I do not like that sort of legislation.  If they mean it, it is scandalous and if they do not mean it, it is <Col N="472" /> equally scandalous and should have been left out.  I will not support that section of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Life imprisonment is a satisfactory sentence, if there can be such a contradictory association of words.  There is no such thing as a satisfactory sentence.  I do not believe that the prison system works but if we must have a penalty which is proportionate to the crime, the present philosophy on life imprisonment is quite adequate.  Capital punishment is fundamentally wrong and if we are going to talk about imprisonment we ought to talk at some future stage about what we propose to do with people who are in prison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments on the Bill which is before us. This legislation has recently attracted more attention than when it was first initiated in this House.  That is not because of an interest in whether or not this legislation is passed but owing to the involvement of the Garda Síochána in the matter and the question of whether or not one particular person in our ranks will vote in favour of it.  This interest submerges the genuine underlying reasons for enacting progressive legislation like this and it is a pity that that was fundamentally what the Press were interested in.  This Bill is to repeal the 1964 Act which has been referred to by previous speakers.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the 1964 Bill has not in any way acted as a deterrent to violent crimes leading to murder or treason.  In recent years the records show increasing numbers of violent crimes involving the tragic deaths of gardaí in the course of their duty.  The Garda Representative Body have been in touch with me and, obviously, with all the other Senators. They have made their views known to us. They have expressed their reservations about the abolition of the death penalty. They admit that the idea of capital punishment is repugnant to most people, not least to members of the Garda Síochána. They say that many people are happy to rely on the humanitarian arguments in favour of its abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> Senator B. Ryan in his contribution has given the most excellent reason on humanitarian grounds for the abolition of capital punishment.  In spite of having a most excellent relationship with the Garda Síochána and an admiration for all they stand for and the work they do, I do not share their view that the 1964 Act which we are abolishing has in any way acted as a deterrent or as a protection for this unarmed law enforcement body of ours of which we all are so proud.  I would say seriously to the Garda Síochána that if a law is not seen to be put into practice, as this law has not been, then that law becomes in my opinion a bad law.  I cannot agree at this point in time that the removal of this legislation or its postponement will in any way increase the number of murders.  I do not hold the view that keeping the Act on the Statute Book in case things worsen will act as a deterrent to the people who carry out these atrocious crimes.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is an increasing number of robberies in towns and villages, unheard of happenings, totally alien to Irish people and their belief in fair play. There have been robberies, acts of violence and kidnappings of law abiding citizens, industrial and otherwise, which could have ended up as possible capital murders and still the existing legislation has not acted as the slightest deterrent.</P>
    <P>The fact, as Senator B. Ryan says, that the death penalty is there has not stopped these people.  Their own belief is that they may, in fact, be able to get away with these crimes unnoticed.  When the public are subjected to this kind of violence, whether it be kidnapping or bank robbery, the public react to it.  At times we over-react with total resentment of the conditions to which people are subjected in these situations.  Our existing court procedures are capable of dealing with these thugs, if they can be brought to justice.  I appeal to members of the public who over-react that they should in every way possible assist the gardaí to ensure that the people who commit these serious crimes are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>Senator B. Ryan referred to section 4 <Col N="474" /> of the Bill which lays down a very strict penalty for persons found guilty of treason or capital murder.  I am open to debating whether it is too severe, or not severe enough, whether we, as a legislative body, should stipulate the number of years imprisonment, or whether this should be a matter for the judge in that court at that time, depending on the circumstances. Believing, as we do, that murder is murder is murder, in the words of a wellknown State person, surely if we have a procedure of court hearings, circumstances could possibly alter cases, so that a mandatory period of imprisonment might not be desirable.  I will probably make a decision as to whether section 4 should be amended so as to leave the actual severity of the penalty to the judge.</P>
    <P>Senator B. Ryan also dealt with the fundamental right to life, which he described as a moral right.  I subscribe to that philosophy.  Nobody, whether an individual or the State, has the right to take a life.  Individuals do not have the right deliberately to take a life for any reason, whether the life is unborn or born.  The State should not have the right to take a life for a life as a penalty.  That is why present public opinion would not permit hanging, even though we have that legislation.  We now have the situation when a judge passes sentence that the Government are faced with advising the President, because of public opinion, that a life sentence be substituted for hanging.</P>
    <P>This is progressive legislation which, unlike others, requires very little monetary outlay and which accords with the removal of corporal punishment from our schools.  We must realise, if we are serious, that for many years our children have been subjected to violent punishment in schools and to a violent society which, in turn, breeds further violence. Any move towards preventive legislation to remove these types of violence from the lives of our children and our people must be welcomed.  It is fit and proper that we, as a progressive nation, should follow in the footsteps of other countries throughout the world and in Europe, of <Col N="475" /> whose Community we are a member. Ireland's name should be added to the long list of European countries which have abolished capital punishment.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties speaking for that Council, Amnesty International and the Prisoners' Rights Association, welcome this decision because it is progressive and in line with other countries. They welcomed the unanimous reaffirmation in 1978 and 1980 of the Conference of European Ministers of Justice, in which the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, represented this country, of its support for the abolition of capital punishment.  The Council of Europe, likewise, have passed similar motions and also the United Nations.  We are just following along the road of progressive legislation, which should be welcomed by all Members of the House.  I do not accept the arguments that it is not opportune now but might be in the future, or that keeping the 1964 Act on the Statute Book may act as a deterrent, or that we may never be able to reintroduce it.  I welcome this Bill which accords with the longstanding policy of my party. Voting for it creates no problems for us, of conscience, or the Whip or otherwise. The Minister, in presenting it, gives us on this side of the House an opportunity to subscribe totally to the views expressed by him in his introduction of the Bill.  I hope for its speedy passage through this House and through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice <Col N="476" /> Act, 1964 abolished capital punishment for all but the crimes listed in section 3 of the Bill.  That move to reduce the number of offences to which the death penalty would apply was very welcome at the time because the vast majority of the people abhorred the very idea of capital punishment.  However, in 1964 it was considered advisable to retain capital punishment for a small number of very serious crimes.  These include the murder of gardaí and prison officers in the course of their duty.  This Bill now proposes to abolish capital punishment completely. My view is that this is not the appropriate time to bring forward such a proposal.  In 1964 it was considered advisable to retain capital punishment in the cases to which I have referred at a time when the country was not faced with many of the problems which face it today.  Nobody can deny that there has been a considerable escalation of violent crimes and of subversive activity since 1964 and all the indications are that we will be faced with this situation for some time to come.</P>
      <P>We have an unarmed police force whose members daily confront criminals who seem to be becoming more organised and more ruthless by the day.  At the moment, capital punishment is the only additional protection afforded by the law to this unarmed force.  It is the only deterrent to those who would murder members of the Garda.  The degree to which it will deter murders of gardaí is a matter of opinion, but the members of the force themselves consider that it is an effective deterrent and that it gives them additional protection in the performance of their duties.  We must recognise the legitimate claim of the gardaí to every additional protection the law can give them. To abolish capital punishment at this stage would have a serious demoralising effect on the gardaí at a time when the job they do never involved more risks. Consequently, I oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa seasamh chun cúnamh leis an mBille seo um Cheartas Coiriúil.  The more I listen to this debate, the more I wonder what the real opposition to it is.  I would like to <Col N="477" /> thank Senator B. Ryan for, at least, putting forward some semblance of opposition to parts of the Bill because the general opposition to the Bill does not make sense.  We are told, on the one hand, that the time is not right to introduce this Bill and are reminded of the lawless state of the country.  Yet, it is not too long since members of that very same party were in power and had a wonderful opportunity of showing their belief in the death penalty by imposing it for crimes which were committed during their reign.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned lest the custodians of the peace in this State, the gardaí, no longer find themselves in a safe and secure position and I speak as the son of a garda.  As such, I had to examine this Bill very closely.  I had to look for opposing points of view, which were very hard to find.  The case put forward for the abolition of the death penalty made me secure in the knowledge that this Bill would make life for our gardaí better and more secure.  This Bill originated from a belief in the sacredness of life and the growing opposition of responsible governments throughout the world to the taking of life, either by the State or by anyone else.  I found it very hard to believe that we are the only country in western Europe where the death penalty survives.  I also found it hard to believe, in reading through the case made in support of the Bill, that at a recent meeting of the European Parliament delegates from this country, from all political parties, agreed with a resolution expressing a strong desire that the death penalty be abolished throughout the Community.  I found it hard to believe that the Council of Europe, which includes members of the Fianna Fáil Party, had adopted a recommendation that the European Convention on Human Rights should be amended to outlaw the use of the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has come about 17 years after the 1964 Bill.  At that time it was deemed proper to leave the death penalty in the Bill for certain acts because it was felt it might be a deterrent to would-be assassins. Looking back over the last 17 years, <Col N="478" /> and this case has been made by a number of people, there is absolutely no evidence to show that that inclusion in the 1964 Bill has done anything to deter criminals from taking on the police force as they saw fit.  Over the last few years successive Governments did not see fit to implement this penalty for the simple reason that there was a growing awareness of the sacredness of life and a need to keep faith in real life and not to adopt the policy so prevalent in years gone by of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</P>
    <P>When this Government came to power last summer this was one of the problems they had to face up to.  They did not cast it aside as was fashionable with other problems in other spheres of administration over the last few years.  They brought forward this Bill with a determination to ensure that the security of the State would be strengthened and that the position in which gardaí found themselves in relation to the implementation of the 1964 Bill would be improved.</P>
    <P>At present there is no desire on the part of the Government to implement the death penalty.  Neither was there during the term of the last Government.  A Bill was necessary to provide a proper guarantee for the security of this State.  I looked at this Bill and saw provision for a term of 40 years minimum sentence with, of course, a remission of ten years which would leave a net 30 years imprisonment. This is a fitting penalty for a crime committed against a custodian of the peace.  If Senator W. Ryan were present I would have to take issue with him for suggesting that the gardaí should not be put on a separate pedestal in relation to the problem we are dealing with.  I would also have to take issue with him regarding his ideas about pampering criminals.  Hardened criminals will not take pampering and they do not deserve it.  The Government, in the interests of the common good, are entitled to protect society against violent acts.</P>
    <P>This Bill has one other very good feature. It negatives the power of the Minister for Justice to grant parole under the 1916 Act and the power under section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 to remit <Col N="479" /> fully the sentence.  This Bill imposes very strict conditions on Ministers for Justice. This Bill is a severe one, more severe than the legislation which exists at present. It is indicative of the will of the Government to uphold the institutions of the State and to protect those who defend these institutions by providing severe punishment for those who would seek to undermine or overthrow them.  The Bill recognises the special position of the police and prison officers who are at risk from violent criminals.  It is sad to remark that while the Fianna Fáil stance may be a sincere one &mdash; I am not doubting it &mdash; it is becoming blatantly obvious that their opposition to the Bill has political connotations. They are obviously exploiting whatever little differences there are between Fine Gael and Labour in Government and between members of the Fine Gael Party.  I assure them that this divide and conquer approach, which they inherited from of all people the English will not work.</P>
    <P>It well suits the mentality of some Fianna Fáil devotees &mdash; present company excepted &mdash; who might find the terms of the Bill too repressive.  I should like to take issue publicly with a remark which was made in Ennis at a recent ceremony when the name of Michael Collins was used to justify violence.  I shudder to think of the possible effect utterances like that could have on an immature unstable youth.  Mar fhocail scoir molaim an Bille agus iarraim oraibh é a ghlacadh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the feeling the Minster expressed in his Second Stage speech that the death penalty is simply wrong and as such should be abolished. However, opposition to this Bill from such groups as the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors should make us look a little more deeply into the reasons for and against retaining the death penalty. Those of us who like myself support the Bill and wish to see the death penalty removed from our Statute Book, should make sure that we are doing so for reasons which are both logical and humane. In general the main argument brought <Col N="480" /> forward both in public and in the debates in this House, is the deterrent element in the death penalty.  In some sense, we can view the punishment of any crime for what might be described as the utilitarian point of view &mdash; does the punishment in fact act as a deterrent which will prevent the criminal from committing this crime? This is the way in which a lot of people speaking in this House have looked at the death penalty &mdash; is it important to have it because it will deter someone from murdering a member of the Garda Síochána or from committing the other crimes listed in the 1964 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage I will try to deal with the question of whether the death penalty as it stands under the 1964 Act and under the present practice in Ireland in fact deters people.  Before doing that we ought to look a little more deeply into the reasons for having a death penalty or for not having a death penalty and for the ways in which we punish crime.  I would submit that these reasons are not quite so simple as might have been thought from the kind of deterrent effect element that is being bought into most of the speeches here.  It seems to me that while most people in this country and indeed outside it in this sort of debate, and also in the kind of debates that went on in the British House of Commons and in the House of Lords at the time of the abolition of the death penalty there, talk in terms of the utilitarian deterrent effects of punishment, sometimes their real feelings, if they looked into them, are based far more in the area of retribution for crime or of revenge, to use the more emotionally-loaded word.  We cannot see the deterrent argument in a pure form if we think about how crimes are committed or not committed.  Can we say that our sole motive is to set a punishment which will deter the intending criminal? Senator Whitaker touched on this a little in this speech, too, but if we take this argument to its logical conclusion there is no reason why we should not use, say, torture as a punishment for parking offences. This would certainly deter the average person who leaves his car at a meter for too long.  There would be no <Col N="481" /> logical reason why we should not punish the innocent to deter the guilty, why we should not, for instance, execute the family of the criminal rather than the criminal himself on the grounds that such an action might very well deter people from committing crime even more than a threat to themselves.  This is the pure utilitarian deterrent argument.</P>
    <P>Any Senator and any person in this country will say that to act in this way would not only be ludicrous but would be morally wrong.  They would be right in saying this but the logic of this argument about whether it is morally wrong or not does not lie in deterrent but in the deeply-held feeling which most of us have that only the guilty person should be punished. We rightly insist that we should punish only a person who has broken the law and in serious cases that we should only punish them when they possess what is called <i>mens rea</i> or what Gladstone, the legal commentator, called the vicious will &mdash; in the old phrase where they had malice aforethought.  We have undoubtedly on our Statute Book a number of offences which are called strict liability for which you are punished even if you have no evil intention, the type of offence for which they will punish you for, say, selling adulterated milk regardless of whether you realised or not that the milk was adulterated.  We accept these provisions as being necessary for administration but I do not think we would accept them in any situation where a serious crime was involved.  We insist that the person must be blameworthy before he is punished.  Therefore, even the kind of argument that is made by people who rely on deterrents does contain an element of retribution and I would define retribution as trying to match the past evil of misconduct with the pain of suffering.  We ought to be clear about this and ask ourselves when considering the death penalty if we are really justified as a society in exacting the ultimate in retribution, which is, a life for a life.  We should face up the the fact that this is really one of the basic reasons why we are doing it, not just because we think it deters criminals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> There is very often mentioned by people who write on the theory of punishment of criminals a third element in the idea of punishment and that is the public reprobation by society of the crime, the showing of public horror by the community as a whole at the crime that has been committed.  Here I must say that attention is drawn to this factor in the letter which was sent to us all by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and indeed in some ways I am more impressed by this argument than by the deterrent argument.  If we think about it, why do we want to show our disapproval? Surely we want to show our disapproval because we want to stop the crime from happening or from happening again, and this brings us back into the deterrent area.  Certainly any of us would wish to show tremendous disapproval of the kind of crimes that are envisaged in the 1964 Act and none of us wants to feel that the gardaí, in particular, are being threatened by the removal of the death penalty but I do not feel that we need to retain this penalty to show our disapproval of this kind of crime.  At the time of fairly recent murders of members of the Garda it was very clear indeed that the public disapproved and regarded with loathing the crime of shooting these men. Nevertheless it was also clear when the culprits were brought to justice that there was not a widespread public demand that they should be executed.  The previous Government were correct in not carrying out the sentence of execution at that time.</P>
    <P>To go back to the deterrent element: if we do look at the death penalty as a deterrent we must commit ourselves to looking at the evidence as to whether it is a deterrent.  This kind of evidence can be what I might describe as exterior evidence, that is, the evidence of statistics as to what has happened in other countries where they either abolished the death penalty or retained it or reintroduced it after it had been abolished.  One of the major sources &mdash; now perhaps somewhat out of date but nevertheless a very comprehensive source of research &mdash; was the report of the Royal Commission <Col N="483" /> on Capital Punishment in Britain but that report and in common with it almost all research into the statistical evidence would show that, as the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, the research is somewhat inconclusive.  The one thing that can be said is that there is no clear evidence in any of the figures that the abolition of capital punishment did lead to an increase in this type of crime or that the reintroduction of capital punishment in States which had abolished it and then reintroduced it ever led to a fall in that type of crime.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in comparing figures of one State with another because there are very big differences in societies as to what type of murders are committed. To compare the kind of murders that are committed in the United States with the kind of murders that are committed here or in Britain or in other western European countries is not a very helpful exercise and to compare the figures from the different countries does not really help us very much.  However, one can see in certain areas where you take a number of States together, say, four States of the United States like North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Nebraska &mdash; these States are fairly alike in character &mdash; their crime rates and the type of crimes committed are fairly alike and yet where Nebraska retained capital punishment but did not use it very often, where North Dakota abolished it and South Dakota abolished it and then restored it later there was virtually no difference in any of these States as to the rate of murder. That is fairly valid evidence that very little difference is made in the deterrent effect, whether you have capital punishment of whether you have not.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is a kind of interior evidence that all of us feel in ourselves.  The fear of death is one of the greatest fears the human being can have. Therefore, we tend to argue from that that if we retain capital punishment it will undoubtedly deter people from committing a crime.  In that context, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I will quote briefly from a very famous judge, <Col N="484" /> Mr. Justice James Fitzjames Stephen, who referred to this.  He had great faith in capital punishment and said that no other punishment deterred men so effectually from committing crime as did the punishment of death.  This proposition is difficult to prove simply because it is in itself more obvious than any proof can make it.  It is possible to display ingenuity in arguing against it, but that is all.  The whole experience of mankind is in the other direction.  The threat of instant death has always been resorted to when there was an absolute necessity for producing some results.  No one goes to certain inevitable death except by compulsion. Put the matter the other way &mdash; was there ever yet a criminal who when sentenced to death and brought out to die would refuse the offer of a commutation of his sentence for the severest secondary punishment?  Surely not, and why?  It can only be because all that a man has he will give for his life.  In any secondary punishment, however terrible, there is hope, but death is death and its terrors cannot be described more forcibly.</P>
    <P>This sounds like an extremely forcible argument for the deterrent effect on the person of the death penalty.  If we look at the reality, that is not what life is like. The judge here was thinking of a criminal who inevitably is going to be executed going out to his execution, whilst we are thinking in deterrent terms of a criminal who is contemplating a crime and who has quite a considerable chance of escaping detection or, at least, in the way in which many criminals' minds work, continually hopes that he will escape detection. Many criminals have very illogical ways of thinking in this.  It appears to me that it is a completely different situation to say that it will deter somebody who has plenty of chances that he may get off and in the event of his being caught, also has a very good chance that he will not in fact be executed.</P>
    <P>As Senator Whitaker has said, to have a deterrent effect this death penalty must be carried out in order to deter, and it has not been carried out.  If we think that we are going to deter a criminal and above all perhaps someone who commits <Col N="485" /> a crime from what he thinks of as political motives, we surely must deter that person by our actions in our carrying out the death sentence rather than in simply having it in the Statute Book and not using it.  It has been fairly well accepted over the years by both the public and Members of the Oireachtas that even where the death sentence is passed by the judge it will not in fact be used.  The Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Haughey, said in September that the death penalty was to all intents and purposes gone, and he was quite right in saying so.  How then can we argue that it continues to be a deterrent?</P>
    <P>I am completely in favour of protecting the institutions of the State and above all the ordinary gardaí in any way we can, but I cannot see that we are protecting them by a theoretical penalty whose deterrent effect is in any case doubtful and which is not in fact used.  As far as killings which are carried out from political motives are concerned, this sort of deterrent is quite irrelevant.  Such people see themselves engaged in a war situation. They accept the risk of death, and even if executions are carried out, there is the risk that this will create an atmosphere of martyrdom about the person who is executed.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred at length to the 40 year penalty and this is a matter about which I feel fairly strongly but I would prefer to deal with it in greater detail on Committee Stage.  Now, I can only say that, while I appreciate the need for heavy sentences, these mandatory sentences are so long that if they were carried out they could result only in the total destruction psychologically speaking of the person concerned.  My information from sources close to prison officers is that it is the experience of prison officers that where criminals have been kept confined for very long periods of time they become psychologically disturbed and may become dangerous to prison officers.  They may attack them suddenly out of sheer psychological disturbance. We should look into this a bit further before we decide to keep a man 40 or even 30 years in prison.  Human <Col N="486" /> beings psychologically are not able to stand up to this length of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>To return to the main point of the Bill &mdash; the abolition of capital punishment &mdash; one of the major questions is on whom is the onus of proof?  Who has to prove whether it should be abolished?  Do those seeking to abolish it have to prove that it is not useful or do those who are seeking to retain it have to prove that it is useful to retain it?  On a continent or in groupings of countries where the death penalty is almost universally abolished and clearly disapproved of by international bodies, the onus of proof lies strictly on the shoulders of those who wish to retain the penalty.</P>
    <P>I conclude by supporting the Bill in its general terms and supporting the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems incredible that in 1981 we should be discussing the wisdom or otherwise of taking somebody who is at this stage defenceless out of a prison cell and propelling him with all the awesome power of the State into eternity.  During this debate words like execution, capital punishment and so on have never brought home the real horror of that system of killing people.  Right around the world there is ample evidence that this is one of the most barbaric acts that can be committed by any so-called civilised state.  The evidence available is contained in a book by a man whom I would consider to be one of the foremost experts on capital punishment, the former official hangman, Albert Pierpoint and also in a report of a committee reporting to the House of Lords appointed by Lord Cross.  In both the book and the report the full barbarity of hanging is revealed.  There is no great change between the hanging system in the past and the hanging system now.  It is still done by a man using a rope over a trap-door.  What system are we asking other people to introduce?  Whom are we to appoint as hangman?  Who is going to get up on a scaffold and pinion a man's hands behind his back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mistakes that were made at various <Col N="487" /> hangings are detailed in Lord Cross's report.  A convict hanged in Newgate caught his leg against the edge of the pit and the execution could not be completed until his legs had been secured.  Since then it has been usual to pinion the legs as well as the arms.  At a hanging in Durham the rope broke, the drop being too long, and it was half an hour before the convict was executed.  The sheriff was warned to use more care in future.  At a hanging in Leeds the rope broke and there was some little time before the execution could be carried out.  The sheriff, reminded by the Secretary of State of his responsibility in the matter, attributed the action to over-testing by prison officials. The rope, however, was found to be weak, worn and quite unsuitable. Thereafter suitable ropes were stocked at Newgate and other prisons.  In another case, the convict's toes touched the floor of the pit and the drop was not sufficient to cause his death.  These are horrific examples and this is the system we want to retain.  Robert Upton, hanged at Oxford, was nearly decapitated, the neck being unusually long.  The coroner and the jury exonerated the executioner.  This is the system that civilised men in a civilised State want to retain.  It is absolutely incredible that people can argue for its retention.</P>
    <P>I give credit to the present Leader of the Opposition because he introduced the Criminal Justice Act of 1963 and abolished capital punishment for 99.9 per cent of murder offences.  In 1981 it is a shame than this barbaric Act has not been removed from the Statute Book.  In the Official Report of 6 November 1963 Deputy Haughey, who was Minister for Justice at the time, said with regard to murder of members of the Garda, it must be borne in mind that the police are unarmed and have a special claim to whatever additional protection the law can give them by providing the deterrent of the death penalty against the violent criminals they have often to contend with.  During that debate Deputy Haughey accepted the view that the death penalty was not a deterrent to the crime of murder yet he insisted on retaining <Col N="488" /> this section, perhaps because of the strong Garda lobby which, in many cases, is understandable.  He went on to say he was sure the situation would evolve whereby we could remove that .1 per cent which is the subject of the Bill.  It is now 14 years since then and we must have evolved very slowly if we can still pretend that hanging people by the neck, sometimes most inefficiently, is a deterrent. Somebody who is politically motivated is not deterred by anybody or anything. One of the mistakes the American Government made in their involvement in Vietnam was to believe that if they burnt enough Viet Cong the fighting would stop.  There is no evidence to support the case that hanging would prevent political murders.  What prevents political murders is the rate of detection.  I cannot understand how arguments can be made in 1981 in favour of keeping this barbaric system in operation.  I have no doubt that if any attempt was made to hang any person in this State for any reason we would have thousands and thousands of people out in the streets protesting. The general population are far more enlightened than their legislators.</P>

      <P>This Bill seeks merely to give expression to the reality of the situation. Support the Bill and arm the guards.  Is that the Minister's idea of reality? Who advised him that the death penalty was not a deterrent to the criminal? If we had no violence no person taking a gun in cold blood, putting a bullet in it to use on our guards or army, I would have no trouble in breaking party lines to support the Bill to abolish capital punishment. The last Senator on the Government side of the House went into details about the rope, the mistakes, the fellow's leg being caught and so on.  I will not go into details of putting the bullet in the gun, and how long it takes for a guard to die when a bullet lodges in his brain.  If capital punishment is taken off our Statute Book now and if we have a spate of murders in the immediate future, which is possible, how long will it take to get it back on the Statute Book again to <Col N="489" /> deal with these criminals and to stop murders?</P>
      <P>With remission 40 years could be reduced to 20 or 15 years.  Recently a prisoner convicted of murder was released after serving eight years.  I cannot say who it was but the Minister can check on who I am speaking about or I will tell him.  The training of a garda takes about 30 weeks.  There are two short periods of maybe two days with a gun or revolver.  An army man who has to use a gun has three months of concentrated training with that revolver or rifle before he is considered fit to use it.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by symbolic declaration inherited in this Bill?  I appreciate that I do not understand all the terminology used in Bills so perhaps the Minister of State would clarify that for me.  Why did the Government release the Littlejohns after serving between six to eight years instead of their 14 to 15 years?  Who advised the Minister to bring in this Bill here and in the other House at this time?  His idea of who the experts are differs dramatically from mine.  He presumes the experts are in his Department, whereas I think they are the ordinary gardaí on the beat and the ordinary soldier.  The Government did not take the advice of whom I deem to be the experts and whose advice should have been listened to.  We should arm the Garda.  It is no secret to any of us in public life that in small towns where three gardaí are armed and their colleagues are not, they do not like the idea of serving together, and they are their colleagues and friends.  It is a very important and human point.  Do we have to do away with capital punishment now because France has done it or because Belgium is going to do it or has done it.  I am not sure which.  Let us decide for ourselves when we should do away with it.  I am not saying this, as some Government members said, because the boss told us to oppose it for political reasons or otherwise. I sincerely believe&mdash;and there are colleagues of mine who know that when I say something I mean it&mdash;that it is not the time to remove the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> Senator McGuinness did not think it relevant to quote shoot-outs in other countries as against what happens here with a gun, but it is relevant.  The New York police had 2,000 shoot-outs in the last two years and six people were shot dead by police in Denmark in the last 12 months.  Let it be quite clear here tonight and whenever we vote, that voting for this Bill means letting down every guard on the beat and I am not saying that to get the guards' votes the next time.  They will not have an opportunity to vote for me, because I intend to stay here.</P>
    <P>I am putting it on the record that everyone should support the stand we are genuinely taking&mdash;not because my leader told me to say it here this evening, sometimes I do not listen to him anyway.  I accuse the Government Senators of being guilty of letting down the man on the beat in every constituency and the man out in the city streets tonight.  Two, three, four, seven or nine gardaí are shot dead and then there is all the crying and sympathy for the widows and the children and the State cars are bumper-to-bumper at the funerals.  But when we are asked to bring in legislation for the protection of these men, what do we do?  Are we protecting them?  Not at all, let more of them be shot and let the State cars go to the next funeral and be bumper-to-bumper again. The same Ministers may not be in the next cars, but I will leave that for another time.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If ever there is a time to abandon the deterrent effect of capital punishment this is not it.  We deserve this measure of protection which the State now affords to us.&rdquo;  This was stated by Jack Marrinan in the <i>Garda Review.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will finish quickly, and my friends on the other side would have preferred had I not stood up at all, but that is my style. In the case of army personnel being found guilty of treason, or of helping the enemy, or mutiny in a war situation, even after court-martial and even after being <Col N="491" /> subjected to military law, is a member let off after a few years' sentence?  I do not quite understand that part of the Bill. The Army point of view should be mentioned because perhaps I am concentrating too much on the Garda.  We have been told that capital punishment has been done away with by eight countries, but we have not been told that it has not been done away with by six nations. Everyone is clear on my stand with regard to the Bill.</P>

      <P>All of us would accept the sincerity of the last speaker's remarks.  In many ways it helps to underline the fact that this is a subject which arouses very great emotion and touches upon some of our deepest feelings.  Many people are now very concerned about what is called, in the cliché, the rising tide of violence.  They are concerned that the streets in a city like this, unlike previously, seem to be no longer safe for people to go about their ordinary business. They are concerned about a situation in which violence seems to be tolerated by all of us to a large extent, as was not the case some time ago.  There are certain classes of people who in particular feel very threatened by this violence.  For example, elderly people, in many cases living alone, are vulnerable in the areas in which they happen to live.  They find themselves surrounded by a society which seems to a large extent to be indifferent to their fears and to their basic insecurities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this island over the last ten years it is certainly a fact that respect for human life has diminished to a very substantial extent.  When we look at the outside of the paper, almost every day &mdash; certainly every week &mdash; at some point on the front page we see an inch or two inches telling of the killing of some guardian of the peace in this island.  Under these circumstances there are many people who feel that in some way this Bill and the thinking behind it threaten the security of not just society but in particular of the guardians of law and order, the guardians of peace. Certainly, most of us here must be sensitive <Col N="492" /> to and very conscious of the representations made to us by the properly constituted representative associations of those who are involved in this kind of work every day of their lives and who face a situation in which they may at any time be threatened with loss of life, loss of limb, or a permanent disability of some kind.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I think it is a little unfair of Senator Honan to suggest that we on this side of the House are either indifferent to or ignorant of the dangers and difficulties which face the guardians of our society and of law and order.  This is not so.  I am very glad that she mentioned the case of the man who was released after eight years, the question of remission and the question of what is the situation of someone who commits what is now called a capital murder and will, I understand, be called a section 3 murder when this Bill is passed.  As the law and the practice seem to stand, there is little doubt that somebody can go out and murder a garda or some of the people named under this section and that he can do this knowing he will be out within eight, nine or ten years.  This seems to be the position at present.  As I understand it, one of the purposes of the Bill is, in fact, to deal precisely and specifically with this problem. I can say definitely that had such a provision not been in the Bill I would have had some reservations about it.</P>
    <P>In that respect too I should like to suggest to the Minister &mdash; possibly the debate on this Bill is the time to consider it &mdash; that he should consider some kind of amendment to the legal situation so that a person will know if he is setting about a course of action which will put him in a situation where he may commit murder, that he will not be released and walking the streets with a grin on his face after eight or nine years. The Minister should consider such an amendment.  It may not be technically possible to do this in this Bill but people would welcome it if there was protection not just for the guardians of peace, who must get priority in this matter, but for anybody who is facing the possibility of <Col N="493" /> murder.  As one speaker said, murder is murder is murder.</P>
    <P>One point that is important is that in proceeding with the Bill at this time we are considering abolishing something which has not happened for some considerable time and is unlikely, thank God, to happen in the near future even if the law remains unchanged.  One of the major arguments put forward for the retention of capital punishment is the deterrent effect.  That is the kind of argument in which one could easily get involved in statistics from various countries or, as Senator McGuinness did very effectively, take certain States of the United States and carry out an elaborate statistical exercise to demonstrate whether capital punishment has a deterrent effect.  We should ask ourselves who is likely to be deterred by the threat of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>There are many categories in which murder or homicide has been placed. Penologists and others have argued about this and have split the categories into sub-categories but if we look at the question in a common sense way we will see that there are three basic types of murder. One is the kind of murder which takes place in what one might call a state of passion, a situation in which murder is not a deliberate target of the action undertaken but results from a situation of passion, stress or whatever it might be and in which there had not been a decision by the person concerned deliberately to choose a situation in which murder could take place or, alternatively, had deliberately planned a murder.  The second category might be where a person has criminal intent, where a criminal, or a group of criminals, plan or conspire to commit what they know to be a crime and in the course of their preparations and arrangements take certain actions which they know could lead at the very least, to grevious bodily harm or to loss of life on the part of those they intend to interfere with.</P>
    <P>The third category affects us and many countries at present and it is one that we are not likely to see an end to in the immediate future.  I am talking about <Col N="494" /> murder committed with political intent or committed in circumstances where the objective is political.  The point has been well made in cases like this.  In the context of this country &mdash; Members opposite might note that when I say &ldquo;this country&rdquo; I mean this island &mdash; where there are people who as a result of a decision of their own, a decision of their will, set about a process which they know will lead to their own death, where they embark upon a course of actions which will lead directly to their own death and they choose such a course, it is ludicrous to suggest that people in such a frame of mind will be deterred by something which is a great deal less unpleasant, a great deal less uncomfortable and to which in their minds a great deal more kudos would attach, namely, execution by the forces of a State which they would regard as a mockery and a form of imposition.</P>
    <P>When we talk about that situation we must remember what our history is.  Our history is simply one in which for a long time the final accolade or honour which could be paid to any one of us was to be hanged.  There is hardly any Member who has not in various circumstances, possibly connected with premises authorised by the Constitution, attempted to sing a certain song which involves a hanging.  I refer to the hanging of Kevin Barry.  We must be realistic about this.  There are our traditions and what we have behind us.  We have not eliminated from our young people, and many of those who are not so young, the concept that it is honourable to be hanged for one's country's sake.  As long as we have people like that those people will not be deterred by hanging.  They would welcome it, if they had the chance.  Worse still, the godfathers, those who plan their activities, the people who lead and organise them, would be delighted with such a situation because they would be able to say that any person executed in those circumstances would take his place among the honourable martyrs of our past.  Possibly many colleagues who made a tour of this country during last summer will have noticed in many of the small towns, which <Col N="495" /> have been referred to during the course of this debate, monuments and memorials where the ultimate date is not 1916 or 1921, where there is no ultimate date at all, there is just a hyphen.  When we are talking about execution and capital punishment we are talking about some people who will not be deterred by that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>We must remember the history of extreme violence.  Those of us who had the privilege of growing up in this city will remember when we could walk the streets without fear of attack or mugging at quite a late hour.  There is certainly a rising tide of violence not just in this city but in other cities and towns in other parts of the country.  If we go back further in history to the nineteenth century we find that this country was then in a state of endemic violence.  Some may bring forth political, social or economic reasons for this but we are part of a country where the whole history has been one of violence.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the educational system and the fact that in many of our schools it has been the tradition that violence is inflicted by teachers upon pupils.  There are many people, possibly some people here, who would argue that they were better for having had violence inflicted upon them at some stage by their pastors and masters.  The point has been made that this tradition of violence in our schools and society has to a very large extent innured us to the whole concept of violence and the solution of problems by violence.</P>
    <P>When we come to the concept of the solution of problems by violence we come again to something which is central to our purpose here, to a theme which we must at all times keep in our minds.  We live in a world faced by massive problems of one kind or another; we live in a country faced by massive problems; but in such a situation, where there is such a complex of problems which seem to be intractable and not to respond to reason, research or technology, there is a massive pressure throughout the world and in this country too to reach a solution to those problems <Col N="496" /> by violence, to bring to those problems the concept that violence is the ultimate, the right and the desirable solution.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why we should support this Bill and why I ask Members on the other side and also people who may not be committed politically, to consider this situation as rationally as possible is that we have a duty, as representatives in an institution of constitutional democracy, to prove and support the concept that problems can be solved by men and women sitting around a table and trying to approach them with their intellects and their minds and not permitting their emotions to rule on all occasions.  In this case we must try to give a headline to the young people of this country in particular who are confused and uncertain about the future.  We must give a headline to those sections of the people who have been virtually brainwashed and conditioned into believing that violence is the only solution to their problems, that it is possible to solve problems by non-violent means.</P>
    <P>One must be realistic about the possibility of rehabilitation.  There have always been and must be people who are involved in crime of one kind or another whom it would be difficult to rehabilitate and convert from those courses.  We know that is so but that does not absolve us from the responsibility of trying to grapple with this.  Part of a process which is central to human history is the attempt by human beings to make their life more humane, to try to bring to their problems not the gut reaction of the cave man or woman but a philosophy that has progressed a little bit further.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to methods of execution.  It is relevant that we should consider methods of execution coldly. Senator Toddy Byrne referred to the fact that his father was a garda.  My father was a member of a police force in another country and as part of his responsibilities he had to witness executions.  He was not a squeamish man or a man who was afraid of many things but his reaction was a very simple one.  He said that if people who advocated capital punishment had <Col N="497" /> to witness a hanging, their attitude would be very different.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner gave some graphic examples but his description of hanging was in fact a very bowdlerized version of what happens to the human body in those circumstances.  I am sufficiently old fashioned and conservative to accept the idea that when ladies are present one does not talk about certain things.  But I would advise Members to try to find out for themselves precisely what happens to the human body when that human body is hanged by the neck until it be dead. One of the least unpleasant things that happens is that if the weighing and the testing of the rope that goes on beforehand is not done in sufficiently accurate a fashion the guts fall out; they burst out of the body in the process.  There are other things that happen further down the body which I do not intend to describe in detail here.  Hanging is not a very civilised way of dealing with a problem.</P>
    <P>Some may argue that hanging is a barbaric relic of medieval times.  Reference has been made to torture.  It is argued that we should have a different method of execution, some more scientific method, gas, for example.  Maybe we might use cyclon B which was very efficient. It dealt with 6,000,000 Jews, gypsies, Poles and various other unwanted people.  Maybe we will use electricity or something like that.</P>
    <P>We should approach this matter in a rational way.  I do not intend to go into emotional details about methods of execution. Purely from an intellectual point of view, purely from a point of view of reason, it is difficult for me to agrue logically that we have the right to take the life of another person in this way.  It is not self-defence to plan in a cold-blooded, methodical way how we would deprive another human being of his or her life.  I do not see how the final termination of a life can be justified by any Christian.  Some Members may recollect the part of the play, Hamlet, by William Shakespeare in which Hamlet contemplates with some delight and with some pleasure the possibility of terminating the <Col N="498" /> life of Claudius &mdash; I think it was &mdash; prior to Claudius being in a state of grace or prepared for the next world so that he could plunge him into the eternal sufferings that that would involve.  There is a certain finality about taking somebody's life.  For us in this House, as upholders of what we hope one day will be a more civilised way of life, to support the termination of life in this way is bordering on the obscene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as we all realise, is in many ways an emotive, controversial Bill.  It sets out to abolish capital punishment for the murder of gardaí and prison officers in the course of their duty.  Let me say at the outset that the Minister and other Members and the Garda themselves are opposed to the taking of life whether it be by the State or by anybody else.  Capital punishment is repugnant to most people.  We have heard and we have read that many other states have abolished the death penalty and we are one of the last of the EEC countries not to abolish it.</P>
      <P>But many people would like to ask if all the legislation from the EEC is to the liking and the betterment of the Irish people.  That is a question many people would ask and I would ask it again here now.  I do not know why this Bill is being introduced at this time.  We know of the Coalition agreement, which is their business. We know that two very powerful Independent Members of the Dáil are very keen on this Bill.  But I found in the recent general election campaign &mdash; and I canvassed extensively &mdash; that there was no popular demand for this Bill.  We know that in April, 1980 the Assembly of the Council of Europe recommended the abolition of the death penalty for all but wartime offences.  One could argue and debate this recommendation.  Many would say that we are in a wartime situation.  War is not declared but it is suggested that there is, in some way, a war going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to Kevin Barry.  There is no comparison between the scene of Kevin Barry when he was hanged and what we are now talking about.  That would be my view <Col N="499" /> and I think it would be the view of most people here.  Many groups have welcomed this Bill &mdash; Amnesty International, The Irish Council for Civil Liberties &mdash; all very important groups.  The most important group in this whole exercise is the Garda.  We cannot ignore this fact.  They are the men in the firing line; they are the men in the front line; they are the men who are protecting society against organised criminals.  They must be listened to.  Down the years successive Governments and successive Ministers for Justice have pleaded with us to help the Garda in every way we can.  We must help to build their morale and must look after them in every possible way so that they will give the right service that a police force should give to the people of Ireland.  Yet in this important issue we are ignoring them.  We are not recognising their statement.  This is not right.  I do not think it is fair.  The death penalty is a clear deterrent.  We know that sentences were commuted in the past and it might happen again in the future if the death penalty were retained.  We should leave the legislation as it is because retention of the death penalty means that the criminal does not know what will happen.  For him it is an unknown quantity.  Who knows but that maybe in a few years there would be committed a crime so atrocious that there would be a cry from the people for a hanging.  The crime could be so terrible as to immediately warrant a more serious sentence than a jail sentence. That could happen.  If for example, there had been a murder last week or this week similar to what happened in County Roscommon, the murder of Gardaí Morley and Byrne, or what happened in Wexford, would we be discussing this Bill today?  I do not think we would because the mood of the people would be that we should not discuss it in that kind of scenario. In this country there are subversive criminals and the ordinary domestic and gangster-robber type, all of whom use the gun and, indeed, the use of the gun is a serious tragedy in Irish society.  I would suggest that these people are not carrying guns to play cowboys and Indians. If they are challenged, they will <Col N="500" /> shoot the garda.  They will shoot at anybody to get away.</P>
    <P>By abolishing the death penalty we are making things much more difficult for the Garda.  The fight against crime is extremely difficult.  We should give the Garda all the support they require.  If we pass this Bill it could well be argued that we could have a 75 per cent or 80 per cent armed force and that we could have summary executions.  We could have shoot-outs in the streets in towns in Ireland. These things have been said and many people agree that they are a real possibility. People have asked who would do the hanging.  Pierpoint has been mentioned as not being around now, which we all know.  If we had a gruesome situation, if we had a killing, there might be many people who would do the job if they were offered it.</P>
    <P>Talk about the gruesomeness of hanging, as outlined by two Senators, is terrible and is not nice to listen to.  As Senator Honan rightly asked, what about the poor garda whose brains are blown out? What about the heartbreak to his family? What about his children?  A young garda may be doing a great deal of work for youth, or to eliminate crime, or to help the community.  What happens if his brains are blown out by some criminal? Is that not a gruesome situation too?  We seem to be having all the sympathy for the poor devil who has committed the crime.  We are getting very soft.  Far too much emphasis has been placed on the criminal, on how nice a guy he really is and ignoring the fact that he has shot a first class member of our community.  If we remove this legislation from the Statute Book it will never be put back.  I say we should leave it alone and commute the death sentence if we have to.  Every case should be examined carefully on its merits.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have not got a perfect society.  If we had, we would all be saying: &ldquo;Take it away.  We do not want it&rdquo;.  That is not the situation.  We cannot ignore the strong views of the Garda. Their morale must be maintained at all times to enable them to do a good job, which they are doing for the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Jim Mitchell, to introduce this important reforming measure. It is encouraging, indeed, that at a time of grave economic and social problems, time has been found for discussion of the profound moral issues raised by the death penalty.  In approaching this reforming measure it is necessary to examine the background to the abolition of capital punishment.  In fact, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties kindly supplied all Senators with the most cogent briefing document. I know I echo the sentiments of many Senators when I express our gratitude to them for this.</P>
      <P>It is important to examine the background to the abolition of capital punishment. The Criminal Justice Act, 1964, introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Charles Haughey, abolished capital punishment for all but the crimes listed in section 3 of this Bill.  In 1978 and 1980, the Conference of European Ministers for Justice, Ireland being represented by Deputy Gerry Collins, unanimously affirmed its support for the abolition of capital punishment.  In April 1980, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe recommended the abolition of the death penalty for all but wartime offences.  In November 1980, the European Parliament requested member countries to suspend capital punishment pending a debate in the Parliament.  In May 1981, the European Parliament voted in favour of abolition, and recommended that member states amend their legislation accordingly.  Since 1971, the General Assembly of the United Nations has supported the resolution several times for &ldquo;the progressive reduction of the number of offences punishable with the death penalty in view of the desirability of abolishing this penalty in all countries&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the many countries in Europe which have abolished the death penalty.  I should like to name those countries: Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Iceland, Italy, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, <Col N="502" /> Sweden and Switzerland.  As a progressive people we too should be enumerated in this list.  I very much hope that we will be, not in any spirit of following the mob, but because what we propose to do by passing this Bill is a logical sequence of the steps taken in 1964.</P>
    <P>Opposition to violence and the taking of life must include opposition to the ultimate violence of judicial killing by the State.  I am opposed to violence believing with Ghandiji that &ldquo;non-violence is infinitely superior to violence; forgiveness is more manly than punishment&rdquo;.  Non-violence is the law of our species, as violence is the law of the brute.  The spirit lies dormant in the brute.  He knows no law but that of physical might.  The dignity of man requires obedience to a higher law, to the strength of the spirit.</P>
    <P>As a woman and a mother, as one who has conceived life, borne life, nourished life and sustained life, I cannot approve of or condone the taking of life in my name by our State.  Capital punishment as a form of retribution is unworthy of a democratic and Christian society.  The Bill before us today is a completion of the task engaged upon in 1964 when the Criminal Justice Act was passed.  It is a logical follow-through to all the persuasive arguments put forward at that time.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the present position. Any individual intent on murder, or involuntarily involved in the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána, or a prison officer, knows full well, when he stands in the dock and hears the sentence passed, that he will face a lengthy prison sentence, but that he will not hang.  We have not used the death penalty in this State since 1954.  In fact, I have a very clear recollection as a small girl of the day on which that death sentence was carried out.  I remember very clearly &mdash; I lived in Dublin at the time &mdash; that amongst the children with whom I played there was a certain pall of gloom.  As the time approached &mdash; the hour of execution had been mentioned very carefully in the newspapers &mdash; we were very much aware of it.  We consulted watches.  We thought about it very carefully.  We prayed when that moment came.  I do not think that in <Col N="503" /> any way we supported or condoned what had taken place.  I remember quite vividly the shock and horror of that moment.</P>
    <P>I do not want my children or anybody's children to live through judicial murder carried out in the name of the citizens of this State.  It is evident to me that if something has not been carried out since 1954 that it has become obsolete.  It is an obsolete measure on our Statute Book and, as such, should be removed.  It is therefore no longer a deterrent.  The law as it stands could be interpreted as weakening the position of the Garda and prison officers in this regard and in some way rendering them even more vulnerable. At this point I should like to state categorically and unequivocally that I value and hold in the highest regard the role and function of the Garda Síochána as guardians of our peace and the role and function of prison officers.  Senator Fallon referred to the fact that the Garda perhaps have an objective view or that their view should be given particular significance. I am not for one moment saying that it should be overlooked but I am saying that perhaps it is not the most objective view of the situation and that decisions in relation to this Bill and any other should be taken objectively, calmly and in a detached way, of course consulting those directly involved.  But I would feel it is not in the interests of this State that decisions like this should be taken solely by those directly involved.</P>
    <P>I want the present anomalous position resolved and the provisions of the Bill implemented so as to afford the Garda and prison officers the fullest possible protection under the law.  As matters stand they have a purely nominal protection of which hardened criminals and subversive elements are aware.  They perform the vital task of protecting all of us without the necessary support this Bill offers.  In purely practical terms we have a problem of providing an experienced, practised and skilful hangman.  The notion that, in the heat of the moment, an inexperienced and inexpert citizen, in order to wreak vengeance, would take over that task and assume the authority of hangman is totally repellent to me. <Col N="504" /> There are there overtures and tones of mob violence no responsible public representative in this House could even consider.</P>
    <P>I have ascertained that we would need to go as far away as South Africa to provide ourselves with a competent practitioner in the art of hanging.  Imagine the furore it would create here had we the temerity to embark on that course of action.  If a rugby tour could cause such a storm can one imagine the excitement when we went to Dublin Airport to meet the hangman, escort him from the aeroplane, conduct him to the prison where the execution was to take place.  I say to fellow Senators that we would be a laughing stock amongst the nations of the world.  Lest Senators be in any doubt as to the experience of this mythical hangman from South Africa they might like to know that South Africa accounts for half of the world's known judicial executions. In 1979 a total of 133 people were hanged.  By mid-July 1981 69 people had already been executed and it is a gruesome statistic from that country that since 1974 the number of executions has trebled. Arguments about capital punishment being a deterrent are made a nonsense of by those figures.  I would remind Senators that in South Africa there is a problem of political and civil unrest which makes our situation here seem somewhat more manageable.</P>
    <P>Many voices of leaders of opinion have been raised in support of total abolition. They have been detailed by other speakers who contributed to this debate.  I should like to add my voice as a woman, as a mother and as a Senator in full support of the total abolition of capital punishment and in support also of the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty and privilege to add a few words in support of the Bill before us.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on having brought the Bill before us, not as Senator Fallon would have us believe, that we would have to initiate Government Bills as a result of popular demand.  If such were the case we would have had Bills thrown over the gate the last couple of evenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> Many people have spoken in support of the abolition of capital punishment over the years.  Many reputable and credible organisations have lent their support to its abolition.  On the other hand there have been people and organisations who have argued in favour of its retention. Most notable of these and the most recently vocal are those of the Garda authorities.  Everybody must recognise their right to their view on this matter as they appear to be the people directly in the firing line, as it were, if the House will pardon the pun.</P>
    <P>I want to use whatever influence I have to ensure that this Bill succeeds in its objective, that is the abolition of what I see as the State legalising murder.  It may be a very raw and crude way of expressing it but that is what it is to me.</P>
    <P>It was as a result of the demands made throughout the years that in 1964 the Criminal Justice Bill was brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  On that occasion the Bill went a long way in satisfying most people's demands.  People still voicing opposition to this proposed Bill were then, and here I quote from Senator Eoin Ryan's contribution to the debate on that occasion when he said that he was disappointed that the Bill then introduced did not provide for the complete abolition of the death penalty.  I suggest that Senator Eoin Ryan has the opportunity now to bring an end to his protracted disappointment of 17 years, that he is afforded an opportunity now to bring that disappointment to an end and support the Bill before the House.  I suppose it would be too much to ask that he do so the next time this goes to a vote in the House because, alas, he said recently that that is not the line he is to take.  He said that the time is not yet right.</P>

Are we once more allowing the buck to be passed for another decade or more and the issue to be evaded in a cowardly fashion, which is what I believe it would be?  Past indecision and its consequences are to be noted today.  I take up the point made by Senator Fallon in his contribution to the debate when he said we are now in a wartime situation. Such statements give too much importance to the dastardly deeds of the IRA who are now elevated to the position of creating a warlike situation within part of this country.</P>
      <P>Many people have strong views on capital punishment.  To me and to all who believe in the dignity of life, this Bill is a great source of pride.  I believe in equality of justice.  I cannot and do not want to see a distinction made between a member of the Garda Síochána and any man or woman on the street.  To me each life is sacred and to take any life is murder.  The taking of life by the State or by anyone else is wrong and, for that reason, I give my full support to the Bill.</P>
      <P>When we look at our history we can see that many of our patriots were done to death by capital punishment.  We shrivelled at the very thought and we denounced, and rightly so, the people and the governments who legally authorised those deeds.  Are we now to excuse ourselves for that very same deed, saying that the time is not right?  For some people calling the murder of a garda or a prison officer a political murder is a way out.  It avoids the real issue but I do not accept it as a way out.  Many people also label it a crisis of conscience and use that as a way out.  Far too often this indecision has left us with legislation such as this on our Statute Book.  I hope that the legislation initiated by the Government will remove this indecision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that the present violence has to be eliminated before we take any move to remove capital punishment is a sign of weakness.  It has been offered as an argument by the other side of the <Col N="507" /> House in support of the retention of capital punishment.  We hope that all crime will be reduced or eliminated from our society but, at the same time, to suggest that we retain this legislation as a method of achieving a utopian situation is wrong. I hope as a follow-up to this legislation that the Garda will be given the necessary equipment &mdash; I do not mean guns; we should be very proud of the fact that we have to a large degree an unarmed force and I hope that we retain it &mdash; as well as the know-how and training to ensure that much of the crime now rampant in our society will be dealt with and the perpetrators brought to justice.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána may say they are unprotected now but I fail to see how the retention on the Statute Book of a law that has not been used for more than 17 years can protect them in any way.  During the years it has been the duty of the Government to seek a reprieve from the President in any instance where the death penalty was passed.  We are bringing our laws into disrepute because it has now become a duty of every Government to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the death penalty is a deterrent but I do not think that is the case.  Most of the people who commit murder under this law are fanatical criminals and in that they are a law unto themselves.  I do not think it has made much difference to them that they have murdered nine gardaí during the years. They are fanatical in what they do and they would have carried out their crime whether the death penalty had been in operation or not.</P>
    <P>It is not a natural progression in the event of the abolition of capital punishment that we should arm the gardaí as an alternative.  Emotions run high when we read about &mdash; and some people witness &mdash; the murder of members of the force. That is quite natural in circumstances of great tragedy and loss.  However, to carry out the death penalty on the apprehended culprit would be a continuation of the maxim &ldquo;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&rdquo;.  I do not subscribe to that maxim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The retention of capital punishment is said to be a deterrent but in recent times it has not been a deterrent here or north of the Border.  If we leave these things as they are &mdash; which seems to be the attitude of the other side of the House &mdash; we are bringing the whole judicial system into disrepute.  To be forced to continue in this way of seeking a reprieve for those who have been convicted of capital offences will lessen respect for the law and for the courts.  I do not believe the death penalty is a deterrent.  What we have substituted in its place &mdash; a 40-year maximum sentence &mdash; in its own way is as much a deterrent as was the death penalty, for those who want to look at it in a different light.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator B. Ryan on the three categories for which he wants the penalty of 40 years.  We cannot glorify the people who have been found guilty and sentenced to death.  We have to treat them by rehabilitating them.  The present prison system can adequately take care of that issue.  As it stands there is no guarantee that the people so convicted may not be released from prison in a very short time, much to the dissatisfaction and abhorrance of the population at large.  I support without reservation the fact that we are to change the law about the taking of life and I ask the House to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MiriamKearney" hpid="Miss Kearney Miss Kearney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kearney</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my approval to this Bill and welcome in the clearest possible terms the measures it contains.  Much has been said already on this matter and, if possible, I do not want to repeat what has been said.</P>
      <P>It is of extreme importance that we recognise the fundamental matter raised by this measure.  This Bill seeks to deprive the State of its authority to deprive a human being of his or her right to life.  The right to life is perhaps the foremost of all human rights and nobody has the right in any circumstances to deliberately deprive another human being of that most sacred of all human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it strange that there should be division on this question.  If this Bill had sought to affirm our commitment to the <Col N="509" /> right to life of the human foetus there would have been unanimity on the question. Surely it is totally illogical and inconsistent that our commitment to the right to life before birth is in no doubt but we do not have a similar commitment to the right to life after birth, and we feel it is a matter on which it is appropriate to play party politics.</P>
    <P>It has been argued in defence of capital punishment that if somebody has deprived another human being of his right to life that person has forfeited his own right to exist.  Leave aside for a moment the possibility of mistaken identity and presume that in any given case it is possible to assume a particular accused did murder an individual, was acting of his own free will and was not suffering from a mental disorder.  Let us examine this argument.  Depriving the accused of his own life is not going to restore the life of the victim or relieve the sufferings of his family.  In my view it is simply an act of vindictiveness and retribution by the State.  It is based on the principle of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, a principle which runs totally contrary to the tenets of Christianity on which our society is based.  The use of violence against violence is an admission that in certain circumstances violence is a justifiable means to an end, not an admission, I believe, which can be made by anybody who claims to be a democrat.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else in this House I appreciate the very special role played by members of the Garda Síochána and prison officers.  I am aware of the dangers they face in their daily lives and recognise their need for special protection.  I am also aware that they have opposed this Bill.  With the greatest respect for their views and understanding the situation, I believe that in imposing this measure they are not acting in their own best interests.  The prison law does not adequately protect the Garda and prison officers.  The events of the last ten years and the increase in the number of acts of violence committed against members of the police and security forces have shown that the existence of capital punishment is no protection and is not an effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> The present law provides for an ultimate sanction which it is recognised will never be exercised and other sanctions which are exercised but are inadequate either for the protection of society or as an effective deterrent.  This legislation by its provisions of a mandatory minimum sentence strengthens not weakens the position of the Garda and the prison officers.</P>
    <P>Even if it could be proved that capital punishment was an effective deterrent that is not an argument for its retention. The right to human life is an absolute and immutable right which cannot be altered by time or circumstance.  The suggestion that now is not the time to introduce such a measure is quite untenable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  It is opportune that this Bill should first be brought before this House early in the session where hopefully it will receive mature consideration with a minimum of influence of party politics.  That is the spirit in which all Members have approached this measure.  It is unfortunate that we find ourselves divided on party lines.  It may be that at the end of the day a division will be forced, in which case the device of imposing the Whip, for the purpose of ensuring that legislation which is essential for the day-to-day running of the State is passed, will be abused. If the Whip is used by one side it is very hard for the other side not to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a category of legislation we have been notoriously slow in considering, that is, legislation of a social nature which affects the ethos of our society rather than the day-to-day running of the Government.  This should be a matter for the individual conscience and judgement of our legislators rather than a matter which should be enforced through party discipline.  Such an enlightened approach to parliamentary democracy presupposes that that point of view is shared by virtually all the groups present in the legislature. If they do not share that view, one does not have an enlightened discussion of the legislation and cannot exercise freedom of judgement in social matters. The effect of this is that socially desirable legislation is repressed and a feeling of <Col N="511" /> bitterness creeps into the relationship between the legislators in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a pity that we cannot approach this Bill with that view.  It is no boast for any political party to say they never had a free vote.  It is something to be ashamed of.  We should try our best to overcome the natural prejudices that exist and seek to bring a more enlightened approach to the consideration of topics like this.</P>
    <P>I find myself in some disagreement with the Minister in the tone of the introductory speech.  I must make it quite clear that I support the Bill and will vote for it.  If there were a free vote I would have no hesitation in supporting it.  However, I do not find myself in intellectual agreement with him in saying that the State never has the right to take life. The right to life, like any other right, is a limited right.  It is dependent on the circumstances.  Very few people would say if I were threatening the life of a perfectly innocent person that some third individual would not be justified in intervening and if necessary killing me to prevent me threatening the life of the innocent person.  We tend to see rights as being absolute and liberals and conservatives both use this when it suits them.  It is so fundamental that of course only in the gravest of circumstances, which I have defined as meaning that the life of the person involved is immediately and gravely threatened, would it be possible to justify the taking of the life of one individual by another in the State.</P>
    <P>My support for the Bill arises by reason of the fact that we can only deal with a situation, not in some hypothetical way, but as it exists today.  We must ask ourselves whether the lives of the citizens of this country are immediately and gravely threatened by the actions of some particular identifiable individuals who are at present covered by the legislation which allows for the implementation of the death penalty.  Measured by that criterion I do not think we can say that.  First of all there is a lapse of time between the actual crime and sentence and the carrying out of that sentence.  Leaving aside for the <Col N="512" /> moment the philosophical argument about the death penalty, there is the grave problem that the law naturally moves slowly.  If a person is murdered and somebody is arrested for that murder, a book of evidence is prepared, a trial takes place; inevitably if there is a conviction there is an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and usually in a capital case there will be some grounds for an appeal to the Supreme Court.  Now the time taken to execute the due process of law could take between one and two years.  At that stage we would be seeking to execute a person for a crime committed one or two years ago.  It appears to me that the reaction of the State at that stage is not to a situation that meets the criteria I have set down that justify the taking of life.  Having gone through judicial process for two years, and the alternative of 40 years or thirty or twenty years in jail being available, it is ridiculous to say that the person is gravely and immediately threatening the life of citizens. In my opinion it is not proper that a person who has been held in custody for a year or two years should be executed in a cold blooded and deliberate act by the State.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Government's intention to establish an Independent Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the newly elected and appointed Senators on their becoming Members of this House.  It is a Chamber with which I am not unfamiliar.  I spent some eight pleasant and informative years becoming versed in the arts of parliamentary politics within this House and this has stood me in good stead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions made in the Seanad are very often overlooked in the glare of <Col N="513" /> publicity sometimes extended to the other Chamber.  I should like to commend the quality of very many of the debates in the Seanad that I have either read or heard over the past twelve years. I have no doubt that this present Seanad will similarly make its contribution to Irish public life and I would like to congratulate those Members who are here for the first time and to suggest that the business of this House should not be taken lightly.  This House has a very important contribution to make to parliamentary procedure.  I am very pleased and honoured to have the opportunity to come back to speak in this House as Minister.  In the &ldquo;Programme for Government, 1981-1986&rdquo; there are a series of commitments given with regard to education. Several of these commitments have already been implemented or are in the course of being implemented.  These include the promise to increase substantially the higher education grants scheme which was introduced immediately the Government came into office and the promise to give priority to all aspects of adult and continuing education, where a commission to draw up a national development plan has been set up to report by October 1982.  In addition, the Government have indicated their firm intention to abolish corporal punishment in schools.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government towards educational development has been clearly demonstrated by their designation of education as one of a small number of priority areas for investment and development.  The proof of this commitment has been seen in the specific exclusion of teachers from the general embargo on recruitment in the public service, and in the appointment of 300 additional primary school teachers to enable the pupil-teacher ratio to be reduced.</P>
    <P>Among the other commitments given in the &ldquo;Programme for Government&rdquo; there is a proposal to establish an Independent Curriculum and Examinations Board.  The programme states:</P>
    <P>The Government will establish an Independent Curriculum and Examinations <Col N="514" /> Board, the terms of reference of which will include school assessment to supplement the exam system.</P>
    <P>The present Examination System will be reformed to reduce the pressure on students caused by the Leaving Certificate Examination.  The present points system for entry to university, while being fair and unbiased, is distorting second level education and having an adverse educational effect on school curricula.  To overcome this problem the Government will give urgent consideration in consultation with third level institutions to the introduction of a National Matriculation Examination.</P>
    <P>This examination would be used as a basis for entering third level education and would be designed to be quite independent of the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>This evening's debate marks an important step towards the implementation of the proposal to establish the Independent Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
    <P>There are strong reasons why such a commitment was given.  The examination system has been playing an increasingly dominant role in post-primary schools.  It is important that the role and function of examinations should be subject to the most rigorous scrutiny and review.</P>
    <P>Our system of examinations has remained largely unchanged since their beginnings with the Intermediate Act of 1878, although modified by the Intermediate Education (Amendment) Act of 1924 which introduced the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that examinations exert an enormous influence on schools and on the ways in which teachers organise their programmes.  Examinations which are intended primarily as instruments for measuring certain aspects of student achievements, and therefore as an adjunct to the curriculum, have for over a century been allowed to dominate our second-level education, so that those aspects of curriculum which are not examinable or readily amenable to examination tend to lack status and often receive insufficient attention in schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The question now to be faced by all concerned in education is whether we are happy with the powerful part that is played by examinations.  I believe it is now time for a wide-scale debate on this issue.  I hope that in this House this evening we are seeing the start of such a debate which will now be taken up within educational forums throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Many parents and teachers have become increasingly alarmed in recent times by the pressures which examinations impose on young people.  I, too, am extremely unhappy with the growth of these pressures in recent years.  In the run-up period before the intermediate certificate or leaving certificate examinations many homes are all too conscious of the tensions and anxieties which build up, often to grave detrimental effect on the emotional and physical health of young people.  This is a serious situation. In the rush for high grades and for university points are we not making a terrible sacrifice in allowing such a position to go unchecked?</P>
    <P>The proposal is to establish a board which will have responsibility for both curricula and examinations.  The relationship between the examination system and the curriculum is very close.  To a considerable extent the examination determines the curriculum.  This is not as it should be.  Through the design of the curriculum the teachers in a school should be able to plan an educational course which will be relevant to the needs of the children whom they know.  If, however, they are following a course which has been laid down in the form of an examination syllabus, into which they can make no input, that course may prove quite irrelevant to the needs of the pupils.</P>
    <P>A curriculum which might be relevant in, say, Dublin, may not be at all relevant in many parts of rural Ireland, or even in other urban centres.  This suggests a need for flexibility in curriculum design &mdash; a flexibility which must also be found in the examinations by means of which student mastery of that curriculum is assessed.</P>
    <P>Another weakness of the examination system which is often criticised is the <Col N="516" /> once-off nature of the exercise.  Too much depends on performance in one given day, regardless of physical or mental well-being or of countless other individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is suggested that continuous assessment is the answer to this problem, whereby the performance of a student over the course of a whole school year can be taken into account and then assessment does not depend solely on one day's efforts.  Though this alternative may appear attractive there are difficulties and dangers here too.  How objective can teachers be about such assessment? How can we standardise the scoring systems which would be used so as to allow for the comparing of results in one school with those in the next?  Would continuous assessment impose more pressure on students rather than less?  Would it demand too much of teachers and leave them subject to too much pressure from some parents who, perhaps understandably, might wish to exert considerable influence on the allocation of marks or grades?</P>
    <P>These kinds of questions indicate just how complex these issues are and how difficult it is to arrive at a system which will be truly equitable.  These are the kinds of questions to which an independent board would have to address themselves.</P>
    <P>For all their faults the existing examinations have several good features.  They are generally regarded as being valid, reasonably reliable and equitably administered. They should not be lightly cast aside until there is convincing evidence available that alternative systems are going to be substantially better.</P>
    <P>Questions about the best kind of examination system can only be answered when we have cleared our minds about the purpose which examinations should serve.  I suppose we can fairly readily agree that the main purpose of examinations is to assess the extent to which students can perform within the general range of subjects contained within the curriculum.  This then brings us back to the question of the purposes the curriculum should serve that is, why is it that <Col N="517" /> children go to school and what do we hope they will get from it?</P>
    <P>There are various traditions in Irish education, each with its own aims and objectives and underlying set of values and expectations.  Sometimes there is a distinction between a general liberal tradition which fosters the personal development of mind and spirit and which emphasises the more intellectual and academic aspects of education, and another tradition which takes a more utilitarian view and which emphasises the more vocational and skill-oriented aspects.</P>
    <P>Does education prepare children for life, for the world to be encountered outside school, for the world of work, for the creative use of leisure time, for the responsibility of living in the community? If these things are important &mdash; and I believe that they are &mdash; are they reflected in the assessment procedures we use when we certify that children have attained a certain standard in, say, mathematics or history or in some language? What in fact does the written examination assess?  Is it just a measure of factual recall which favours the quick thinker and the good memory?</P>
    <P>I do not have the answers to these questions, although I have my own ideas about many of them.  What is important, however, is that such matters should be debated and the answers which we agree will need to find reflection in the system which we then institute in the schools.</P>
    <P>I now wish to consider three questions:</P>
    <P>(a)  Why do we need an Independent Curriculum and Examinations Board?</P>
    <P>(b)  How should such a board be constituted?</P>
    <P>(c)  What should such a board be asked to do?</P>
    <P>In answer to the first question I suggest that the establishment of an independent board at the present time would have several advantages:</P>
    <P>1.  It would enable a fresh look to be taken at the role of schools, the courses on offer and the systems of assessment to be used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> 2.  It would allow for wider participation in the decision making process affecting the curriculum offered in schools and the forms of examination used.  In particular it should allow for a greater input from teachers and other professional educators into the design of courses and assessment systems.</P>
    <P>3.  It should allow for a close look to be taken at the role of the school inspector.  At present a very large amount of inspectors' time is spent dealing with the operation of the examination system.  Though inspectors must always be closely involved in such work, if there were a new partnership between teachers and the inspectorate in the operation of an examinations board, the inspectors should then be able to spend more of their time in schools in an advisory and supportive capacity and in exercising their inspectorial function of monitoring standards. I believe that this would be of benefit both to schools and to the inspectorate itself.</P>
    <P>What then of the second question: how should such a board be constituted?  This is a question on which I would be keen to hear the views of Members of this House and of all other interest groups.  There is clearly a major job to be done by this board, one which will require considerable expertise.  It is important, therefore, that the very best people are chosen and that the right kind of professional experience is tapped.  The membership of the board must be broadly representative of the many interest groups, yet whether the representation would be determined by direct ministerial appointment or by nomination of the interest groups is a matter for discussion at this stage. Obviously the Department of Education must be directly involved.  So too must the teachers.  As already stated, a major degree of say must be given to those with direct day to day experience of the classroom.</P>
    <P>In the composition of the board close attention must be given to representation for what may be termed the &lsquo;consumer&rsquo; interests.  I think not only of those <Col N="519" /> engaged in colleges of further and higher education but also of those who will be the employers of the school leavers and who will use the results of examinations to select people for the various job openings and professional outlets.  I would suggest that in the past insufficient attention has been paid to asking employers what skills they would like to see the schools develop in our young people, and whose assessment as part of the formal examination system they would wish to see included in their mechanisms for recruitment.</P>
    <P>I am not going to attempt to suggest at this stage an exhaustive list of groups which should be represented on the Curriculum and Examinations Board, partly because this can often lead to emotive reactions resulting from the exclusion from a list of some particular group, but also because I do not think it would be helpful to get too definitive about this aspect at present.</P>
    <P>Of greater importance just now is to consider the third question &mdash; namely what the board should be asked to do. One of the complex issues to be teased out is the relationship which would exist between the Department of Education and the Minister on the one hand and the Curriculum and Examinations Board on the other.  In matters of curriculum, final overall responsibility must necessarily rest with the Minister of the day but this need not interfere unduly with the independent nature of the board.  In many ways there could be considerable advantages to be gained by distancing the Minister from the minutiae of detail in the operation of the examinations.  The Department's main link with the board would presumably be via the inspectorate, perhaps primarily through those associated with the curriculum unit.  This unit was established in 1977.  It is staffed by members of the Department's inspectorate under a steering committee consisting of senior administrative and professional officers of the Department. It spans both primary and post primary education.  The following broad aims were identified for the work of this unit:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> 1.  to develop a conceptual framework for curriculum by analysis and evaluation of the existing curriculum and, as an ancillary process, to construct and evaluate alternative models;</P>
    <P>2.  to establish norms of attainment; to identify and account for deviation from those norms and to propose appropriate action;</P>
    <P>3.  to evaluate curriculum innovation both in relation to individual disciplines or subjects and to wider areas and, where necessary, to propose initiatives in curriculum development.</P>
    <P>This unit has operated to date with personnel drawn part-time from responsibilities in other areas.  I hope to strengthen this unit in the future and see it as having an important function in relation to the Curriculum and Examination Board.</P>
    <P>To return to the terms of reference to be given to the new board.  Again I do not wish to be too prescriptive at this stage but I would make the following suggestion.  I believe there is a case for considerable reform of the examinations used in the junior cycle.  At present we have the day vocational group certificate examination, usually referred to as the group certificate, and the intermediate certificate examination.  The latter examination was the subject of a major study by a committee set up by a former Minister which issued an interim report in 1973 and a final report two years later.  I should mention in passing that the interim report included a suggestion for the establishment of an Independent Examinations Board.  The final report, which is known as the ICE Report, proposed major changes in the format of the assessment procedures used at the end of the junior cycle.  The committee also set up a research project known as PEEP, the Public Examinations Evaluation Project, which undertook research in new forms of examining in the areas of history and mathematics &mdash; a system involving direct teacher participation. The report of this project was submitted to my predecessor earlier this year.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern to me that the <Col N="521" /> work done by these committees has never received the kind of publicity it deserves.</P>
    <P>Without necessarily implying acceptance of the specific proposals put forward, I believe that the ideas advanced in the ICE report and in the PEEP report should become the subject of widespread debate in educational circles.  Such reports should not be submitted and then left to gather dust on shelves.</P>
    <P>There was also a committee set up by the last Minister to consider the problems associated with transfer from the primary to the post primary school.  This committee reported last June and their findings are also highly relevant to the question of the future structure of curriculum and examinations at post primary level.</P>
    <P>The Curriculum and Examinations Board might consider the establishment of a new intermediate-type examination to be available to all students who complete a junior cycle post primary course and which would be open to any citizen who had already left school.  The certificate would be a guarantee that one had mastered the basic essentials of education.</P>
    <P>I would envisage that this new examination should replace and in some sense combine the existing group certificate and intermediate certificate examinations. It would need to be a broad enough examination to encompass the range of ability levels &mdash; perhaps offering examinations at higher, ordinary and basic levels. It should also be flexible enough to enable schools to engage in programmes of curriculum innovation, subject to specific control limits imposed and monitored by the board.  We have had, in recent years, the benefit of considerable experience gained from the curriculum projects undertaken by the curriculum centres in Shannon &mdash; the SESP Programme &mdash; and in Dublin &mdash; programmes developed in humanities, integrated science and outdoor pursuits organised by the unit run by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and based in Trinity College.  The future of such centres is currently under review in my Department.</P>
    <P>At senior cycle level there is a great need for the board to look closely at the <Col N="522" /> leaving certificate examination.  The role of this examination has changed in recent years.  Originally it was an examination, primarily academic in content, which was taken by that minority of students who stayed to the end of post primary education or who went beyond it to university. However, since free post primary education was introduced in 1967 and since all second level schools adopted common curricula a far greater number of students now take the examination.  This means that we should now call in question the suitability of the examination for all the students who take it.</P>
    <P>The weakness of the leaving certificate at present is that it is expected to serve too many purposes and to perform too many roles.  The major contradiction exists in that it purports to be a measure of general education and, at the same time, is used as a selection instrument for entry to higher education and to many forms of training and employment.  There is a sense in which, in trying to do too many things, it does none of them well. University and other third level teachers frequently complain about the standards of entrants, while employers complain about what they consider the irrelevance of such course content.  Teachers claim that syllabi are unduly influenced by third level requirements; and the widespread demand for experimental programmes such as transition year, pre-employment and career foundation courses suggests that schools are normally compelled to omit from their curricula elements that they consider necessary for young people at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Curriculum and Examinations Board explore ways in which the leaving certificate examination could be extended in scope.  I should like to see a way found in which credit can be given for courses followed in the area of general education alongside the existing syllabi.  I think, for example, of courses in media education, health education, consumer education even political education.</P>
    <P>Civics has been a subject which has been treated less than seriously in too many cases.  It is a subject which should offer great scope to the teacher to help <Col N="523" /> young people to become more aware of the many influences within society which affect them and of the way in which State and political institutions exist to serve the needs of the people.  I should like to see a much greater emphasis placed on the development of this subject.  I do not understand why it has been largely restricted to junior cycle classes.  It seems to me that students at an older age will appreciate more readily the significance of many of the issues which can be included.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the leaving certificate is offered in the various subjects at both higher and ordinary level.  We should look at this division and see whether the basis of that division is correct.  In essence the lower level syllabus is a shortened version of the higher one.  The question might be asked as to whether those taking the ordinary level need a different kind of course altogether.</P>
    <P>Another major issue to be faced is that concerning the use of leaving certificate as a basis for selection for higher education. Here is where one finds the greatest pressure on students.  However as there will always be more people seeking places in certain competitive faculties than can be accommodated there must be some selection procedure used.  For all its weaknesses I am satisfied that no equitable and acceptable alternative has yet been found.  The question can be asked: should this pressure of selection be removed from the leaving certificate as such?  The Government programme offers a suggestion for consideration that a new examination, a national matriculation examination, might be introduced to be taken one year after leaving certificate and that this examination should be taken by those proceeding to degree courses and be used as the competitive examination for entry to such courses.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to have the views of this House about the merits or otherwise of such a proposal.  I would also be keen to gauge the reaction of people at large.  I hope that all those interested in education will make their views on this subject known.</P>
    <P>There is one point to bear in mind <Col N="524" /> when considering the idea of an additional examination.  Such a development might mean a downgrading of the leaving certificate which over the years has achieved a certain general recognition and international standing.  It is important to safeguard the interests of those who currently hold the certificate and who would not wish to see its perceived value lessened.  The value of any certificate depends on its standing in society at large.</P>
    <P>I have so far talked mainly about the examination system in the second level school.  I would like to make brief reference at this point to primary schools.  It is some years now since the old primary certificate was abolished and the new curriculum was introduced.  I hope that the Curriculum and Examinations Board will have as part of their brief an ongoing review of the curriculum of the primary school, in particular as regards its alignment with the curriculum at post primary level.  It is important that we view the education of our young people as a continuous process throughout all the years spent at school.</P>
    <P>At the same time we must ensure that our assessment systems are designed in such a way as to be diagnostic &mdash; particularly to ensure that those who have reading difficulties, for instance, are identified in time.  I understand that it is estimated that some 100,000 people have gone through the formal educational system without reaching a basic level of functional literacy.  This is a terrible indictment of the system and is a situation which we must solve as a matter of the greatest urgency.  This is why I stress so strongly the part played by assessment procedures in detecting those who are missing out while there is still time to take the appropriate remedial action. Teaching and assessment are inextricably linked.  This is true at all levels within the system.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this topic which must also be mentioned.  That is the question of training and retraining of teachers.  The kind of changes which are needed in the curriculum examinations require a commitment to in-service education and teacher development.  There <Col N="525" /> is a departmental committee currently looking at the whole question of in-service courses.  The matter of initial training courses must also be raised and I propose to undertake a review of the existing provision in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the debate which is being initiated here today I hope that there will be a full participation by all groups who have an interest in the issues which I have been discussing.  We must face seriously the question of whether schools are being sufficiently responsive to the needs of our time.  There is a need for a greater emphasis in the curriculum on practical training by means of subjects such as woodwork, metalwork and in art and crafts and technical drawing.  It is a matter of considerable concern to me that we have a crisis of teacher supply in these areas which will make if difficult for us to meet the expansion needs.  I found on arriving in the Department that I had inherited a situation of serious under-provision in training teachers of such disciplines.  This problem has arisen for two major reasons:</P>
    <P>(i)  the introduction of four and three years courses of training in Thomond College, as against the <Col N="526" /> two and three years previously by way of Department courses, with the consequent loss on one year's output.  This will create a short-term difficulty which is unfortunately impossible to correct at this stage.</P>
    <P>(ii)  the increase in demand from schools for provisions for the teaching of such subjects.  This is a welcome development but it will take time to make the necessary adjustments in numbers in training in order to meet the increased needs.</P>
    <P>We have many traditions to be proud of in Irish education and we have a very firm base on which to build.  Yet the time is appropriate to ensure that our school curricula keep pace with changes in society at large.  It is my firm conviction that the establishment of an Independent Curriculum and Examinations Board will be an important step towards this end.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Thursday, 5 November 1981.</P>
