      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 6 in that order.  In regard to No. 2, it is proposed that it be taken after No. 5.  In regard to No. 6 the normal time that would be taken for this motion is an hour-and-a-half, but I have been asked to suggest to the House that we have a debate for three hours.  The length of time which each speaker may take will be the same as on a Private Member's motion.</P>

      <P>I would like to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to add item No. 11 which is the Domicile Bill, 1980.  This Bill was tabled by me on behalf of the Labour group on 19 November last and, on 17 December, before the House adjourned for Christmas, I indicated to the Leader of the House that I would be looking for an early debate on Second Stage on the general principles of that Bill this year.  When the House reconvened as late as 18 February I again raised this Bill on the Order of Business and I indicated that, had it not been for the tragic and unforeseen circumstances of the Stardust fire and the need to discuss the terms of reference of the tribunal, I would have been pressing for a debate on that day.  The Leader of the House, in reply, said that he would examine the matter and be in a position to let me know at the next meeting of the Seanad, which I think most of us felt would be the <Col N="1038" /> following Wednesday.  In fact, we met to discuss the terms of reference of the tribunal on 19 February and then we adjourned <i>sine die.</i>  I opposed that adjournment <i>sine die</i> and asked that we might meet the following Wednesday to discuss the Domicile Bill.  This is an extremely important measure.  I do not have to emphasise &mdash; I have done so already a number of times on the Order of Business in this House &mdash; that it is seeking to remove a basic discrimination against all married women in the country.</P>

      <P>All right, a Chathaoirleach.  I have sufficiently given the reasons for it.  But I am now forced to seek to amend the Order of Business to add item No. 11 to it today because this is only the third sitting day of this House since Christmas and we are on 11 March. We do not know when we will meet again.  We could adjourn <i>sine die</i> again and I think it is now necessary to have this item ordered and, if necessary &mdash; and I certainly would be quite prepared to do this and I hope all my female colleagues on both sides of this House at least would be prepared to &mdash; meet tomorrow and take the Second Stage of this Bill.  I feel it is necessary to order it today and therefore I propose this amendment to the Order of Business in order to take item No. 11 and have a Second Stage debate on the Domicile Bill which I am prepared for and which the Minister has had ample opportunity to discuss with his officials and on which to form a view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second the proposal for an amendment to the Order of Business.  This is a legislative Chamber and if the Government are not going to bring forward legislation then when a Member of the House brings forward legislation an opportunity to debate it should be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal because the Bill has been a long time tabled.  It is very important legislation which would remove great hardship.  It <Col N="1039" /> has been there a long time and it is about time the debate took place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest an amendment to the Order of Business so as to include item No. 23 which is a motion in the name of myself and Senator Catherine McGuinness, &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to declare unequivocally that Ireland will not join a military pact.&rdquo;  In a letter to him some days ago I asked Senator Ryan to consider this.  Let me point out that if one looks at the records of the House over the last year or so, in the matter of motions &mdash; I mean the kind of motions of independent, wide-ranging public interest and not those which are enjoined on us by way of approving Ministerial orders, or the kind of canonically enjoined motions such as are illustrated by No. 6 today &mdash; it will be found that it has been a long time since we had a motion in the names of Independents and the Opposition parties in the House have had quite a field day in this matter.</P>
      <P>For that reason alone, I think it is in order to suggest that No. 23 should be included, though it is admittedly away down the list numerically.  But beyond that, I suggest that this is an urgent and topical motion; it is in the forefront of the public mind; it concerns the kind of identity we want to have in the modern world, and it is the kind of subject which is entirely appropriate for the Seanad to discuss without, perhaps, some of the party commitment which understandably obtains in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that Dáil Éireann is discussing a similar motion is no reason why we should not consider it conjointly.  In fact, it would be highly appropriate that both Houses of the Oireachtas should consider this pressing topic.  It would enhance the <Col N="1040" /> image of this House.  I would regard the Government's refusal to consider it as highly suspect.  So, I propose an amendment in the Order of Business to include item No. 23.</P>

      <P>In regard to motion No. 23, it is the very last motion on the Order Paper and I certainly cannot give any undertaking that it will be taken for some time.  I will certainly bear it in mind.  In regard to No. 11 this has been mentioned to me on a few occasions.  The position is that the Minister for Justice would be very anxious to take part in that debate and to express a view on the Bill.  He has informed me that the Law Reform Commission are about to produce a report on the question of domicile and he is not anxious to discuss this Bill until he sees that report.  Having regard to that report he will then be in a position to make up his mind about this Bill and if he is not satisfied with this Bill, he will almost certainly be introducing a Bill of his own. For that reason I cannot agree to the Bill being taken for the present at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, in 1977 the Law Reform Commission in their first report specifically said that their consideration of the domicile issue should not hold up this Bill, should not hold up the removal of the dependent domicile and I can give the Leader of the House the extract from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The order complies with an EEC directive harmonising the starting date for summer time in 1981 and 1982 in EEC member states.  The principal effect of the order will be that standard &mdash; summer &mdash; time will begin on 29 March in 1981 and on 28 March in 1982, that is one week later than it would have under our present law.  A minor consequence will be that the time of change from summer time to winter time and <i>vice versa</i> will be at 1 a.m.  Greenwich mean time, rather than 2 a.m.  The proposed change from 2 a.m. to 1 a.m. in respect of the ending of summer time in 1981 and 1982 is not prescribed in the directive but this change brings us into line with European Practice.  The British authorities have made a similar change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission considers that the harmonisation of summer time periods would improve the efficiency of transport, communications, commerce and contacts generally between the countries concerned.  Discussions with a view to standardising the &ldquo;summer time&rdquo; provisions in the EEC member states have been going on for several years.  There are various problems including, of course, the fact that natural time in this country is substantially different from <Col N="1044" /> that of, say, Germany or Italy.  So far all that has been agreed is the starting dates for summer time in 1981 and 1982.  Discussions towards achieving further harmonisation are continuing.  I now call on the House to approve this order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a subject which provokes strong feelings and we are all in agreement with what the Minister proposes.  Harmonisation, as he points out, would be of use in many areas of life within the EEC.  He also points out that nature will intervene to prevent total harmonisation.  One point that I am always puzzled by, and I should know from my business experience, is in relation to the alteration in the closing times in the licensing laws.  Does that follow the change from winter to summer time?  If so, will the change in the licensing laws follow the changes now proposed by the Minister so that people will know that when winter time comes in the licensing hours will change?</P>

      <P>I will be very brief because, like Senator Cooney, I do not find this in any way a controversial measure.  It is a measure that one would welcome.  I would also like to welcome the Minister of State into the House today. I would have dearly wished that he could have been here for an item which I tried to add to the Order of Business, and I see that he would have been able to be present.  There was a reference to a report of the Law Reform Commission and I referred to the fact that this seems to be contrary to what was in the report.</P>

      <P>I welcome this proposal.  It is a beginning anyway.  It is difficult enough to keep travel dates for anybody who is travelling without having different summer and winter times between different countries.  The Minister refers to EEC members states.  Is there any harmonisation with the European countries that are not member states?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to put two questions to the Minister on this. He has mentioned the EEC directive.  Do we take it that each of the ten member states is in agreement with this?  Also some of the EEC member states have traditionally been two hours ahead of winter time.  Has that been harmonised or will there still be the one hour differential in France and Italy as there has been up to now?  I take it that all the timetables in preparation for this order have been already harmonised for the coming year.</P>

      <P>Senator Cooney's question relating to the changes for liquor licensing laws is a separate matter and the order that is made has no relevance to liquor licensing law changes.  Furthermore, the position that we have been trying to achieve is harmonisation of winter time for the reasons stated, for travel, communications, commerce and so on. Discussions are still continuing in relation to the harmonisation of summer time. These discussions are not final and it is hoped that when they are we will be in a position to bring an order before the House.</P>
      <P>The hours of difference in member states are Ireland and England summer time GMT plus one hour, winter time GMT, Greece GMT plus three hours and all other states GMT plus two hours. Winter time in Greece is GMT plus two hours and in all other member states GMT plus one hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mac-Sharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to implement the Government decision to suspend the bovine disease levies as announced in the recent budget statement by the Minister for Finance. These levies were introduced in 1979 to <Col N="1047" /> provide a farmer contribution towards the cost of eradicating bovine TB and brucellosis, the main benefits of which will accrue to the farming sector.  As part of the measures which the Government have taken to help farmers to overcome the income difficulties currently being experienced the levies are being suspended with effect as from 1 February 1981.  As a result farmers' income will be increased by over £10 million per year.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that suspension of the levies should not be constructed as any weakening of the national effort to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis as quickly as possible.  Provision has been made for State expenditure of close to £26 million on eradication in the current year.  Now that the levies have been removed, I hope that all our farmers will help to make this substantial State expenditure well worth while by continuing to co-operate in full with all the eradication requirements.  The better the co-operation the sooner the goal of complete eradication will be achieved, thus securing the future of our livestock industry on the export and home markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House will not oppose this amendment, but we are disappointed that it is just a suspension of the levies.  At all times we opposed this levy.  When we discussed the levy some months ago in the Seanad we voted against it and we are now found to be correct.  Levies are a financial weed sown to stunt the development of finance.  They are introduced to prevent growth and in this instance they did destroy the enthusiasm farmers would have had for getting rid of bovine disease. This should not have cost the farmer anything because it would be a benefit to the nation to get rid of disease and the farmers should be encouraged in every way possible to get rid of it.  Bovine disease has cost the State many millions of pounds and the sooner we get rid of it the better.</P>

    <P>The Minister included this levy with others when we discussed it on the last occasion and we would like to see those other levies also taken into consideration <Col N="1048" /> and removed.  They are also stunting the development of agriculture in the other areas.  Agriculture at this time needs every encouragement it can get to increase production and to allow farmers to get back the confidence that they had from 1973 to 1977.  They were the boom years for agriculture and since 1977 the farmers have been having a very rough time, without encouragement from the Government.  This has now been accepted by the farming organisations and they have come out very strongly against the attitude of the Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>Farm incomes have fallen drastically over the last few years while the cost of inputs to agriculture have increased enormously.  The pressures from the farming organisations with the pressures from this party have not prevailed and the only thing that will bring commonsense back to the country is that we have a general election very soon and let the farmers and the people make a decision on that. The decision will be very, very clear.  I propose here and now that we have it.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour group welcome this measure in that it will, in some small way, alleviate the plight of the farmers at the moment. However, I would like to comment on the method chosen by the Minister and to express some dissatisfaction at the lack of full information given to this House. The Minister said on introducing the order that he proposed, as had been indicated in the budget, to suspend the bovine diseases levy.  Precisely what the order does is to fix the amount of levy payable under section 2 of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, as regards milk at nil per gallon and animals slaughtered or exported live at nil per animal. As far as the order is concerned the amendment is to fix at nil the levy in respect of those two different products. If the levy was revoked, as suggested by the previous speaker, we would know where we were.  There would not be a levy.  At the moment the levy is fixed at nil, but we do not know when the Minister will change his mind and bring in another order to reimpose the levy or impose it at a different rate.  I would ask the Minister when he is replying to this debate at least to indicate the minimum period at which the levy will be at nil and, therefore, effectively suspended.  I think farmers must be in a position to know what is happening.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to the possibility of an election, and elections bring promises and periods of grace.  This House and the farmers are entitled to known for how long this levy on these two products is to be fixed at nil.  Also there should be a minimum period during which, in accordance with a guarantee by the Minister, on the record in this House, that the Minister will not bring in an order reimposing the levy under the 1979 Act on these two items.  I would be grateful for clarification on that.</P>

      <P>I welcome this regulation as announced by the Minister for Agriculture which zero-rates the diseases levies as they affect farmers in this country. <Col N="1050" /> It is no harm to say that I would have preferred if he had decided to revoke the system of levies.  I can appreciate his difficulty in refusing to accept or agree to levies that are being imposed from the Commission while at the same time he is operating them on the home front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture are a very formidable Department.  With the resources they have with the dual statistics &mdash; they must surely have an economic division there still &mdash; certainly their forward planning and forecasting must have been extremely bad if it has taken them two years to monitor the fact that farm incomes have declined drastically since 1978.  This is a disturbing aspect of the entire situation.  The last time the Minister spoke in the House on the bovine TB disease issue he was very scathing in his attack on farmers who returned reactors, but the very week after that, in one of the Minister's own farms, run by the Department of Agriculture, there was an outbreak of disease and subsequent to that, there has been a second outbreak.  While I join in the Minister's plea to farmers to increase their efforts to rid the country and the national herd of diseases, at the same time I accept that the vast majority of farmers take every precaution and it is seemingly unexplainable how these breakdowns in the test occur.  The Minister has first-hand experience in the State farms where it is accepted that there is a very high standard of management and so on.  If we come to look on the farmers as dragging their heels in this matter, we should remember that Senator Whitaker last year gave in total the amount of money attributed to receipts from farmers since these disease eradication schemes were introduced, and it made fairly generous reading.  But the fact is that while all farmers are anxious to have the diseases eradicated and while they lose by them, it has cost them a considerable amount in both time and energy to carry out the tests and to keep their herds in order.  I hope that by this time the Minister is fully aware of the decline in agricultural incomes and the fact that they are not picking up.  Even the removal of these two levies will not contribute significantly to the overall situation <Col N="1051" /> as far as farm incomes are concerned.  At present we read in the daily papers that different sectors are being offered increases from 14-28 per cent per annum, and when a significant sector such as the farming community in the last two years have seen their incomes go 50 per cent the other way, it is very difficult for them to contain their anger.  The one thing that perhaps is saving the Minister and his colleagues from the wrath of the farmers is that traditionally farmers like to keep their own business to themselves so it is unlikely that they will be on the street corners saying that they have lost £X or that they are in total indebtedness to so many pounds.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the motion introduced by the Minister, I hope we can take it that he at last recognises that there is a problem in the agricultural sector and that he and his officials do not believe that by just merely lifting levies such as these in a temporary capacity they are solving the agriculture problem just by this motion here this afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few points arising out of what the Minister said and what has been said in the contributions so far.  Senator Robinson speculated as to the length of time the suspension will endure and wondered why it is being introduced now.  As to how long it will last, that depends on why it is introduced.  Electoral considerations are never far from the minds of the party opposite in anything they do, and possibly impending events will have encouraged the introduction of these regulations, though I might give them credit and say they were persuaded by the hardships being endured by the farming industry at the moment and that the dramatic and drastic down-turn in farm incomes has provoked the suspension of these regulations.  If we accorded that motivation to the other side, then the length of time that the suspension is going to last will be <Col N="1052" /> negligible because, unfortunately, I cannot see any great glimmer of light on the horizon for the farming industry.  The contribution made towards the farming industry by these regulations in saving the farmers the cost of the levy is welcomed, but unfortunately in the context of the overall problem of farmers' incomes it is small.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable disappointment &mdash; if there is a stronger word it could be used &mdash; at the result of the Minister's negotiations within the EEC, and unless a substantial improvement can be got by the Minister from that source I cannot see any way in which the industry can have its income increased.  Small palliatives such as this are not going to be of any real assistance.  The suggestion that the Exchequer might cough up what it has got from the EEC seems to be totally unrealistic when the amount budgeted for the Minister's Department is down not just in real terms but in actual money terms from last year.  The outlook for farming for the foreseeable future is extremely grim and the levies will have to remain suspended for some time.</P>
      <P>I share the Minister's hope that the State contribution made here by suspending these levies will be reciprocated by an increased effort on the part of farmers to eradicate disease.  The loss to individual farmers and to the State in having to slaughter diseased animals is considerable, apart from the big question mark that is puts over the future of our meat exports.  If EEC regulations are to be implemented against us fully we could find ourselves in a extremely serious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One method which was introduced a couple of years ago to speed up and tighten the eradication of disease was the 30 day test &mdash; I can call it the infamous 30 day test &mdash; and that was sold to farmers on the veterinary grounds &mdash; against considerable opposition by them on technical grounds &mdash; that it would have a significant and speedy effect in reducing the incidence of disease in our herds.  The Minister can correct me on this but I recall reading recently that following a couple of years of the operation of the 30 day test the incidence of animal disease has <Col N="1053" /> dropped only marginally.  I submit to the Minister at this stage that the hardships that have been imposed by virtue of the 30 day test have not been rewarded by a substantial decrease in disease incidence and that it is now time to look again at the 30 day test to see if it is as medically indicated and as medically effective as we were told.  It seems to me that the proof of that pudding has not been found in the eating.  I suggest to the Minister that this is an area in which he may have to have second thoughts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit early in the day to start talking about the resumption of a regulation that we have not yet put into force.  When the levy was introduced there were two schools of thought as to whether the farming community should pay a share of the cost of disease eradication from their herds or whether it should be eradicated through 100 per cent capital injection from the Government.  Our experience in bovine TB eradication over the last 20 years or more was that we had not a very successful result; while moneys were continually poured into eradication we did not get the best results.  However, this £10 million injection at this time is going to be a useful asset to the farming community.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the progress that has been made over the last two years at any rate will not be retarded and that this country will have a disease-free herd inside the next two or three years.  It is a sizeable challenge. While I felt that the 30 day test was severe and harsh at the time it was introduced, I believe that the amendment to that by the Minister of a re-test in 45 days alleviated the hardship to some degree.  If it is doing the job it was intended to do then I would retain it but I would like an assurance from the Minister that there will be no cutback as a result of the removal of the levies in the progress we are making in eradication.  We are an island country and we do not want pollution or any cattle coming in that will bring in diseases.  A disease-free herd will be a useful asset to this nation in the future, and the quicker we reach that goal the better.  It will pay 100 per cent or a <Col N="1054" /> hundred fold to the farming community of this country.  I welcome the removal of the levy, and it is a bit soon to start talking about periods or length of time because we are just about to remove it.  I would say we could leave such discussion to another day.</P>

      <P>The fact that it is a suspension only that we are discussing implies there is still a school of thought within the Government which believes that there is some equitable and economic justification for levies such as this. That should be noted by all farmers.</P>
      <P>The Government give as their reason for the suspension of this levy that it is to help farmers to overcome the income difficulties they are experiencing at present. That admission indicates without any doubt whatsoever that if their income position was stable at the moment, such a levy would be in operation.  If there is that school of thought within the Government as regards these bovine levies, it is sad because it is far removed from the experience of farmers as regards what such levies do to confidence within the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality and health of our livestock is a matter of national concern.  There should be a national contribution to the eradication of diseases from our livestock industry.  It is inequitable that this levy should be imposed on farmers.  It is further inequitable because it would fall on the small farmer as much as on the large farmer.  If the levy is a disincentive to the small farmer, it is also a disincentive to the larger farmer.  I would welcome the complete abolition of this levy.  It is only a confusion of words for speakers on the opposite side of this House to use the word &ldquo;removed&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;suspended&rdquo;.  The wording of the Minister's speech is that the levy has been suspended, not removed.  If it has been suspended because farmers' income is at a low level at present, that implies its possible reintroduction at a future date.  That would be a mistake for the Government or for any Government.  I would certainly welcome the complete abolition or scrapping of this levy, which was a mistake <Col N="1055" /> in the first instance.  It should be forgotten about as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was proposed to abolish this levy entirely I would welcome it wholeheartedly.  Because it is only a matter of suspending it, my welcome is less enthusiastic.  At the time this levy and a number of others were introduced here, we opposed them on the grounds that they were introduced at a time when farmers' income was obviously on the downturn.  That case was made very strongly here.  The Government persisted in going ahead with the imposition of a number of levies.  This contributed to a significant degree to the loss of confidence in agriculture, with disastrous results to the agricultural community and to the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>The introduction of levies of this nature should be very carefully thought out and the consequences that these levies might have on the industry particularly at a time of downturn in income, should have been carefully weighed up. Then they would not have had the contributory effect of the loss of optimism and confidence on the land.  That is the result that the imposition of these levies had.  It was a most inappropriate time to introduce them.  It should have been obvious to expect difficulties in agriculture.  These were compounded by imposing levies which left the agricultural community most unhappy, dissatisfied and suffering from a growing loss of confidence.  It was an unfortunate move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Levies introduced in the 1979 budget were so ill-considered that within the space of a few days the Minister had to announce their withdrawal to some degree and in another week he announced the withdrawal of some more. That led to a lack of confidence in the Government's plan for agriculture.  The farming community were in a position clearly to demonstrate how inequitable and unjust these series of agricultural levies were, how damaging they would be to agriculture, how impossible to collect in some cases and how unfair and unjust they were to sections of the community.  The farming organisations were able to prove this which, in turn, led to <Col N="1056" /> withdrawal.  Other organisations in the country believed that they should put on pressure and the Government would yield.  That happened.  Measures of this nature should be carefully considered and all the side effects and likely developments that would arise as a result of their introduction should be carefully weighed up.  There would not be this stop-go business of levy on, levy off with the consequent uncertainly and lack of confidence that that policy generates. Even today, while I welcome this measure to a degree, uncertainty will continue to prevail because the order does not say that this levy will be abolished.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Cooney in what he said with regard to the 30-day test.  The operation of the 30-day test and the short time that it allows the farming community to dispose of their cattle when they get the result of the test causes a certain amount of opposition to the whole idea. There is another system in operation in Britain which extends the time.  If that could be introduced here, the farmer would be given a longer period to make sales and so on.  It would generate more goodwill on the part of the farming community towards the test, because they look on it now as a persecution.</P>
    <P>It would be very helpful if compensation was paid more quickly to people who lose their dairy herd and if the payments were more up to the market value of the animals lost.  I am less than enthusiastic about this because the thought might still be there that this would be reimposed at whatever time the Minister or the Government decide to embark on a levy campaign again.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Finance announced in his recent budget speech the suspension of the bovine diseases levies all my farmer friends were very pleased indeed.  It came as a great surprise today to hear the removal of these levies being grudgingly welcomed by my good friends on the other side of the House.  These levies were introduced in 1979 to allow the farming community to make a definite contribution towards the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis.  One thinks <Col N="1057" /> immediately of the seanfhocal, fear na bó féin faoí na heireaball.  The people who gained most by the eradication of these dreadful diseases were the farmers themselves.  They accepted that position and were glad to contribute something definite towards the eradication of those diseases.</P>
      <P>Times are not so good at present for the farming community.  Incomes have gone down.  The suspension of these levies is one of the many indications of the concern the Government have for the farming community.  It is just one of the indications but it is a good one.  The relief of £10 million to the farmers is worthwhile.  At the same time, the Government are devoting £26 million provided by general taxation for the eradication of these diseases in the current year.  It is up to everybody interested in animals, in farming and in our exports to see that every effort is made to eradicate these diseases as soon as possible.  Instead of a grudging welcome from the other side of the House one would have thought there would have been a very warm welcome.  I welcome the suspension for the time being of these levies in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Senators who contributed.  The same theme was mentioned in many of the speeches in relation to suspension rather than complete abolition.  I want to make it quite clear &mdash; the Minister for Finance on the day of the budget did as well &mdash; that the levies are being suspended for this year.  The Government will review the situation at the end of the year and decide, in the light of prevailing conditions, whether or not levies should be reimposed.  There are no levies this year. The farming community concerned are very pleased.  It is something they have been talking about for some time, particularly in relation to incomes over the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the suspension of these levies is because of the difficulties surrounding farmers' incomes.  It is important also to point out that before any levies could be reintroduced it would <Col N="1058" /> require a motion to be passed both in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  It is one of the many measures taken by the Government to assist the farming community.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what Senator McDonald said, that the decline in farming incomes continues.  The situation in recent months gives cause for some optimism; every farmer will accept that.  The situation in regard to the weather over the last number of months has made an enormous impact on agriculture.  We are now experiencing record prices for livestock, cattle, calves and beef.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have had a serious drop in the dairy herd, there has been an increase so far this year in milk production of 1.2 per cent.  One can look with some optimism to the months ahead. We hope we have turned the corner in getting away from the difficulties of the last two years in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald also referred to the scathing attack made by me on farmers in this House on another occasion.  That is not true.  What I said was that we were appealing to the very minute percentage of people, whether they were farmers or dealers, who were still causing trouble in relation to the efforts we were making to eradicate these two dreadful diseases. We will continue to appeal to them.</P>
    <P>The 30-day test was mentioned by Senator Cooney and others.  It is important to point out that there has been progress in that regard.  Senator Cooney made the point that there had not been much progress with the 30-day operation and it should be looked at again.  We are disappointed with the level of progress in relation to TB but very happy with the progress that was made during that period in regard to brucellosis.  It is important to point out that the 30-day test during its operation turned up 3,000 TB reactors and 6,000 brucellosis reactors.  If it were not for the 30-day test cattle would have been moving around the country spreading disease further. We are making progress.  I want to assure Senator O'Toole that we will keep up our efforts and plead with the farming community and all concerned to keep up their efforts in relation to the eradication of both these diseases.  It is in their interest, <Col N="1059" /> the farmers' interest and the interests of the economy to do so.</P>
    <P>It is only right to point out again in relation to some of these measures, which I do accept cause hardship and difficulty to many people in the business, that we are working from existing derogations under existing EEC regulations.  When we discuss again in the months ahead the three year accelerated programme that was agreed between ourselves and the EEC we can show that progress has been made.  I will try to have some of the objectionable measures eliminated.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney also referred to the negotiations in the EEC and expressed his disappointment in regard to the conclusions of those negotiations.  I would like to take the opportunity to say that in relation to the special measures announced yesterday in the price proposals for 1981 that negotiations are only beginning.  The first meeting in relation to those measures will take place next Monday.</P>
    <P>That covers the points that were made by Senators.  I thank them for their welcome and, as I said, the matter will be reviewed in the light of the prevailing circumstances at the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Until now, most women in employment have faced a real and often difficult choice between the desire to have a family and the wish to stay in paid employment.  The former &ldquo;marriage bar&rdquo; has been replaced by a &ldquo;maternity bar&rdquo;, less obvious but no less effective.  For too long an expectant working mother has had no right to return to her work after her confinement. In addition she often suffered financial hardship because of her loss of income. I felt this was a situation which had to be <Col N="1060" /> rectified forthwith.  Since taking up office, it has been my concern that there should be no further delay in taking action; that this Bill should be brought forward in the shortest possible time consistent with its meeting the standards required of such an important measure by the Government.  That those standards have been well met was, I believe, reflected in the all-party welcome given to the Bill in the other House.  The Bill entitles a woman to maternity leave from her employment and to return to work afterwards.  Its provisions, together with the new maternity allowance scheme proposed by the Minister for Social Welfare, represent a major advance in the welfare of expectant working mothers and eliminates a further barrier to the full participation of women in the life of the nation.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that certain existing statutory provisions give some measure of protection to an expectant working mother.  In labour legislation such protection is included in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the Redundancy Payments Act of 1979.  The Unfair Dismissals Act protects a woman, subject to certain conditions, from dismissal solely on account of her pregnancy, but its protection ceases at the point where she has to give up work in order to have her baby. The Redundancy Payments Act, 1979, provides that an employee does not break her continuity of service where she stops work for up to 13 weeks, during which she has a baby.  In addition, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, permits an employer to give special treatment to an employee in connection with pregnancy or childbirth, despite its general prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex or marital status.  Finally, under social welfare legislation, maternity allowance is payable to a woman who satisfies the relevant social insurance contribution conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions are, however, too disparate and limited to be considered as an adequate scheme of maternity protection for the growing number of women in employment.  They do not give entitlement to take maternity leave and to return to work afterwards.  Neither do they confer the related right to job security <Col N="1061" /> during absence on maternity leave. I consider these three rights are essential to an adequate scheme of maternity protection.</P>
    <P>Many individual employers and their employees have negotiated schemes for maternity leave, on a voluntary basis. However, the majority of female employees do not benefit from such schemes.  In view of this, I believe the Government have a responsibility to take action, hence this Bill.</P>
    <P>When proposals for protective legislation are being formulated, it is vital to bear in mind the views of both sides of industry.  In addition, where legislation specifically relating to women is concerned, the views of the Council for the Status of Women must be borne in mind. Therefore, both at the inception of proposals for this Bill and during its further development, full consultations were held with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  I am confident that this Bill accommodates the interests of both employers and employees.  The Bill has also been welcomed by the Council for the Status of Women.  For many years, the council have been pressing for recognition, in law, that working women have the right to take maternity leave.  The submissions from the council have stressed the need for legislative action to give effect to the recommendation on maternity leave which is contained in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise here the great care taken in the Bill to facilitate the employer in the efficient running of his business.  The Bill, therefore, requires the employee to notify her employer in writing, at appropriate stages, of her intentions.  For instance, she must give at least four weeks' notice of her intention to take maternity leave.  In addition, the Bill permits maximum flexibility as regards the employee's return to work; an employer must give her the same job or its equivalent.  If that alternative is not reasonably practicable for him, he may offer her a suitable alternative job on not less favourable conditions.  I feel this flexibility <Col N="1062" /> will be of particular benefit to small employers.</P>
    <P>The two key sections of the Bill before the House are section 8, giving a minimum period of 14 consecutive weeks' maternity leave, and section 20, which entitles an employee to return to work after her maternity leave.  As regards allocation of the minimum period of maternity leave, under section 10, the employee must generally take four of the 14 weeks before her baby is due to arrive and a further four after its birth.  The remaining six weeks to which she is entitled may be taken as she wishes.  This flexibility will enable her to be guided by medical advice as to when she should stop or return to work.  In case the baby is born earlier or later than expected, sections 12 and 13 have been devised to make appropriate provision.</P>
    <P>If the employee wishes, she may take four weeks' additional maternity leave immediately after her maternity leave; it will be unpaid leave.  This will, for instance, give her additional time to breast-feed her baby.</P>
    <P>During her minimum period of maternity leave the employee will be treated, under section 15, so far as her employment rights are concerned, as if she were at work.  For instance, her right to annual leave will be preserved.  In addition, the new maternity allowance under the auspices of the Minister for Social Welfare will be payable during absence on maternity leave.  Additional maternity leave differs from maternity leave in that the employee's rights are suspended and no maternity allowance is payable during it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that proper medical care plays a large part in protecting the health and welfare of both mother and child. Section 16 will enable the Minister to make regulations entitling a woman to take time off from her work to attend her doctor or clinic, before and after her confinement.  When the Bill has been enacted, I will consult the FUE and the ICTU with a view to making regulations as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>As I explained earlier, the Bill lays down that the employee must keep her employer fully notified of her intentions regarding her maternity leave and date <Col N="1063" /> of return to work.  Under section 9, at least four weeks before she intends to go on leave she must give her employer written notification of the date she intends to begin her maternity leave.  She must also show him a medical certificate confirming her pregnancy and stating the expected date of her confinement.  Under section 14 she must also give four weeks' notice of her intention to take additional maternity leave.  Her right to return to work under section 20 is subject to her having complied with the two notification procedures laid down by section 22.  The requirement of a second notification confirming her intentions two weeks prior to her expected date of return is included in case an employee is prevented form fulfilling her intention to return to work by unforeseen circumstances.  This will be of particular relevance where the employee notifies her employer before, or early in, her maternity leave of the expected date of her return.</P>
    <P>The right to take maternity leave presumes the right to return to work afterwards.  As I mentioned, the Bill provides for a certain flexibility in this regard. Under section 20 the employee is entitled to return to a job which is the same as, or equivalent to, the one which she held before her absence on maternity leave. However, where the employer does not find it reasonably practicable to permit her to do so, he may, by virtue of section 21, offer her a suitable alternative job. To protect the employee, this job must be on terms and conditions not substantially less favourable to her than her original job.</P>
    <P>The employee is thus guaranteed the right to return to work after her leave. To reinforce this, the Bill grants additional measures of job security under section 17 and 18.  Section 25 applies the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, to deem it an unfair dismissal where the employee loses her job because she exercised her rights under this legislation.  A dispute between an employer and employee for a reason other than unfair dismissal may, by virtue of section 27, be brought to a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> I feel it is essential to the successful operation of the Maternity Protection of Employees Act to make adequate publicity available.  I have already put in train preparation of explanatory material, summarising the provisions of the Act and indicating necessary procedures, for example for notification.  I will have this published as soon as possible after the Act comes into force.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House covers entitlement to maternity leave and to return to work afterwards.  It does not extend to maternity pay.  This is being dealt with under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1981, sections 9 to 11 of which set up a new maternity allowance scheme for employees on maternity leave under the Maternity Protection of Employees Act.  Under this new scheme, an employee in insurable employment will receive a weekly allowance during her maternity leave: the amount will correspond to her normal net take-home pay, taking into account the value of any tax refund.  While she is receiving the allowance, she will be credited with social insurance contributions.  The allowance will be subject only to the employee's being on leave under this Act; in other words should she not find it possible to return to work, she will not forfeit her right to the new maternity allowance. The Minister for Social Welfare is dealing with the question of contribution conditions and allowances in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1981 presently before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As it is the intention of the Government to have both pieces of legislation in operation from 6 April 1981 I commend the Bill to the House and urge Senators to give it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill very sincerely as a most significant piece of legislation.  It is perhaps a little tardy in that we are the last EEC country to embark on this particular path.  However, we have arrived.  The passing of this Bill may be seen as an extraordinarily significant development in the way society looks at and treats the whole idea of parenthood and working.  It is obviously a first step in terms of recognising the <Col N="1065" /> extremely important social role of parenthood.  There are certain other steps which it is essential to take quickly in order not to leave a situation where we would, perhaps, perpetuate the idea that a child has only one parent.</P>
      <P>When we talk about maternity leave for women in the workforce, I foresee another spate of articles in the media and discussions and even perhaps politically inspired divisions between women who are encouraged to believe that giving women in the workforce additional protection and help somehow or other, to use a word which is thrown around, denigrates the woman who in fact chooses not to go out to work outside her home.  That would be completely wrong. When we are talking about maternity leave we must remember also the fact that the woman having a baby who is not out at work and who has decided to stay at home is in great need also of legislative protection which she is not getting at the moment.  This kind of legislative protection would involve extra support during pregnancy and when the baby is very young.  It would involve extra support in terms of child-minding to give a full-time mother a break.  It would involve, of course, the absolute right of a wife and mother to a full financial and legal share in the family home and income.  In discussing maternity protection legislation, we must remember we are only talking about one small section of the workforce, the section of married women who go out to work.  There is the far larger section of the workforce, of married women who work inside the home.  I hope that in this House we will have many opportunities to discuss significant legislation to protect the woman who does not go out to work.</P>
      <P>We have of course the dichotomy of problems.  Here we are talking about insured employees.  We all know that the wives of insured men are in a very weak position if they do not go out to work. That is another area we shall have to discuss before long in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been fears expressed, I understand, by employers, by women and by responsible people in all sections of society, that this Bill may in fact discourage <Col N="1066" /> employers, particularly small employers, from employing women.  All those fears and arguments were raised during the passage of equal pay legislation and anti-discrimination legislation generally.  We women who were saying the unthinkable things, that we would have to have equal pay for equal work and have protective legislation, were told we were doing women a disservice, that employers would not employ women.  I have a higher opinion both of employers and of the women in the workforce than to fall for that one.  In every other European country where they have maternity protection legislation on the lines of this Bill it has not been shown that it has had an adverse effect on the employment of women.  It is important that we should warn employers that there is a lot of legislation to protect women against such discrimination when they come to be employed in the first place.</P>
    <P>However, fears about women not being employed are groundless.  There are also fears, of course, that we are headed towards some kind of upheaval in society, that we are going to have women leaving the workforce in vast numbers to stay at home and thereby upsetting the whole even tenor of employment practices.  The time is long gone when the even tenor of employment practices should suffer an upheaval.  I believe this legislation will help to bring about that upheaval which is long overdue.  There is absolutely nothing sacred whatsoever about nine to five.  The concept of flexitime is one to which we have not begun to address ourselves in this country.  The important concept of the role of the father in the home has not begun to be assessed by the workforce. The opposition and horror which greet the concept of paternity leave as an alternative or an option to maternity leave, after a certain point, not for health reasons but for solid family reasons, come not really so much from a deep hostility but from a fear of change.  I am glad to say that the younger generation do not have the fear which older people seem to have of actually being asked to fulfil a role in the home which has become a <Col N="1067" /> deserving scene, seen as being extremely important.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises two things.  It recognises the right of a woman to work and to have a family.  It recognises the importance of the social role of childbearing and child rearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was extremely good.  I do not think he would thank me for pointing out there were certain pressures on the Government under the terms of the national understanding to bring in this legislation &mdash; and I welcome that. Trade unions in the past have not always been in the forefront on the side of equal rights for women.  They are belatedly catching up now due to the great work of women within the trade union movement, women who not only have the great problem of trying to work and be parents but also have the problem of joining in the activities of trade unions despite the double burden which any working mother carries, that of working and of looking after a family.</P>
    <P>We have provisions for maternity leave in all the other EEC countries and we should remind ourselves of some of the maternity leave provisions.  I quote from &ldquo;Working Document in the European Parliament,&rdquo; Document No. 1829/80 and it is the famous document which caused such a furore in the European Parliament about two weeks ago because in an enormous document of 181 pages two pages dealt with a subject which the Irish members appeared to think was the only subject in the whole document.  The document dealt in a most fundamental and basic way with the position of women in the whole European Community and the future steps for women in the European Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention some of the provisions for maternity leave in other countries.  Perhaps we should begin now to refer to this kind of provision as &ldquo;parental leave&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;maternity leave&rdquo; which I think would be a step in the right direction.  In West Germany maternity leave amounts to 14 weeks at full pay and since July 1979 it has been possible to obtain additional maternity leave for four months.  In this case the <Col N="1068" /> maximum pay is 750 deutschemarks per month, which is a lot of deutschemark. The women also enjoy guarantees that they will not lose their jobs.  In Germany when this scheme was introduced a public debate immediately arose about the position of full-time housewives: should they not be entitled to comparable financial support?  A Bill has been tabled in the Bundestag providing for the entitlement of full-time housewives to support. I am aware that that kind of Bill is not around the corner in this country but any Government in Ireland who are not aware that this kind of demand is going to arise and is going to be pushed would be living in the clouds.  I believe that motherhood deserves support inside or outside the workforce.</P>
    <P>In Belgium, maternity leave is of 14 week duration at 79.5 per cent of gross pay; in Denmark, 14 weeks; in France, 16 weeks; in Italy, five months duration, two months before and three months after the birth; in Luxembourg, 16 weeks full pay; in the Netherlands, 12 weeks full pay; in the United Kingdom 18 weeks during which time the mother receives a fixed amount.  In the United Kingdom a woman has to be working for a certain length of time in the company before she is eligible for maternity leave and one very good part of this legislation which we are introducing here is that a woman is entitled to maternity leave from day one of her employment.</P>
    <P>I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>There is an increasing tendency to extend traditional maternity leave by a period of child-caring rearing leave. In some countries this facility can also be used by the father.  This is already the case in France and Italy and is being considered in Denmark.  There is only one country where parents are entitled to leave to care for a sick child.</P>
    <P>Ireland in bringing in this legislation is not leading the field but we are finally catching up with the field and it is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 1978 when the women's representative committee were disbanded by the Government they brought <Col N="1069" /> out a final report.  It was the second progress report on the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  In that report they had a section on maternity legislation, which said:</P>
    <P>An EEC report on the employment of women in 1972 stresses that maternity should be recognised as a social function and should not be regarded as an occupational disadvantage.  Society as a whole and the Government in particular has a duty to see that working women are adequately protected before, during and after confinement.</P>
    <P>That was stated by the women's representative committee whose chairperson was Deputy Eileen Desmond.  The report continued:</P>
    <P>It appears to the women's representative committee that the time has come when measures to provide for protection against dismissal during absences due to maternity, income maintenance during maternity and a right to return to the same or similar job should be extended by law to all women workers.</P>
    <P>They go on to quote the ILO convention on maternity protection adopted in 1919. So, this is not a question that suddenly arose quite recently.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency in their first report also stressed the need &mdash; that first report came out in January, 1980 and they were reporting on their first 18 months in operation &mdash; for this kind of legislation.  In their report which came out in January of this year the Employment Equality Agency say:</P>
    <P>It would like to see legislation introduced providing for crêches in the work place, the operation of flexi-working hours and the provisions of entitlement to parental leave both to fathers and to mothers.</P>
    <P>It is not some voices in the wilderness talking about the need to extend this kind of leave and to consider it in a broader context of providing other support services for mothers.  It is extremely important <Col N="1070" /> to consider the whole question of child care.</P>
    <P>In this country it has been fashionable in recent years when one talks about a crêche or a nursery group to say women who would put their children into care of that kind are heartless mothers.  I would like to challenge that.  I believe that the mother who is working full-time in the home or who wants to work outside the home very badly needs very good child-care which is very good for children.  A very small child will benefit from a one-to-one relationship in the home with the parent but a child who is beginning to toddle and to see the outside world can do very well in a crêche or a play group for a couple of hours a day particularly if it is the kind of crêche or play group which society should set up, a properly run play-group run by properly qualified people.  This is one of the very big problems that working mothers face.  Giving them maternity protection leave is obviously very important but then the problem is: there is very little available in the line of child-care and we should be looking very much into the question.</P>
    <P>All of this is aiming at something which is now being called the symmetrical family where job opportunities are equal between the father and the mother and the family role is shared between the father and the mother.  This is what we should be aiming at.  This legislation brings us some way along the road to that situation.</P>
    <P>I am rather worried that that part of the maternity leave which is unpaid is so short in this Bill.  I would like to think that before long we will be able to increase that considerably with a right to return to work.  We really must not give too little and then leave it without changing the position, because I would much prefer to see a mother having a choice of staying longer with her child than the period specified in this Bill.  A European survey which is detailed in that same report finds that most parents in the Community would like a situation where either mother or father could have two years leave after the birth of a child with an option to return to work.  That kind of time scale in Irish society is inclined to <Col N="1071" /> cause shock.  I do not think it will be very long before we actually seriously consider do we really believe that the work in the home is important; do we really believe that security for a small child for the first few years of life is important, because if we really believe this &mdash; and no doubt there will be many speeches about the sanctity of the home and the importance of the parents of a young child &mdash; we should make it a possibility and should not be penalising either parent for having become a parent.</P>
    <P>I see why the Minister wants this Bill to have a speedy passage, because there are other things allied to it and also because it has to be law by 6 April.  The intention of this Government is to have both pieces of legislation in operation from 6 April.  I believe this Bill needs a careful Committee Stage which I certainly would not like to see taken today. We have had complaints already today about the number of times this House sits.  I am certainly prepared to sit a whole lot of extra days between this and 6 April in order to go through this Bill and discuss its implications, because as I said at the outset it is an extremely important Bill and it is beginning to pay some practical attention to something that Governments and authorities have always spoken about, which is the importance of the child, the importance of security in the home and the importance of full rights for fathers and mothers.  If it is as significant and important as that, which I believe that this House is a very suitable House in which to have a careful Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to welcome this Bill this afternoon. Whenever one looks at a Bill such as this which Senator Hussey has now welcomed, and which received the same welcome in the other House, one can usually take a look at the Minister who is responsible for the Bill and his officials who concern themselves deeply with the problems of the people and just go away and do something about it and stop talking. <Col N="1072" /> In a constantly changing world I am not surprised to see Minister Daly here today with this Bill, because we must gracefully accept change and try to change where change is needed.  Job security is provided for under section 18.  The purpose of section 14 is to give the employee the option of taking up four extra unpaid weeks.  Section 16 entitles the employee to take time off from work for the purpose of ante-and post-natal care.  I understand this is intended to be very kind but I would like to ask the Minister how this is going to be dealt with when one is talking on the factory floor of replacing somebody for, say, one or two hours?</P>
      <P>Section 8 entitles an employee to take a minimum period of 14 weeks leave and Section 20 entitles her to return to her work after her baby is born.  I heartily welcome and support the Bill and its sections.  They are a major advance in a field in which the Minister has shown more than a deep interest since he got his portfolio.</P>
      <P>I would ask him to take a look at section 24 about which I have a reservation. I am not too happy about this because a person who is to take on a job only for a few weeks may find herself placed in work for the first time and then doing it only for a few weeks and leaving again for the mother to get back into her job.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this and I may be chopped by my colleague in my constituency but I am going to say it anyway.  I would like to pay tribute to the woman who can hold down a full-time job and raise a family as well, because I could not do it and I have raised a family.  I understand that the standards of living in this country are now higher; there are carpets and there are two cars and there are all these things that were not there when I was raising my children, but I still feel that the woman who can do a full-time job and raise a family is doing a marvellous job.  My worry here is that in the end with this system it may be the children who pay the price for not having proper parental control or attention in the home. I have said that now.  I may be hauled over the coals at the weekend for saying it, but it is said.  I am sure the Minister is accustomed to me by now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> Working at a very close range with the Minister, I am not surprised at all that we have this Bill here today.  He has this lovely way of looking after interests of the women.  Let me say he is looking after interests of the men as well.  So, knowing and understanding the ethics of my Government and my party &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  In fact, in my present situation I cannot but extend a particular welcome to this measure for obvious and natural reasons.  It is, as Senator Hussey has already emphasised, an important and too-long-delayed measure.  It relates to the position of the married woman as a worker and makes necessary and very basic statutory provisions for protection of the married woman worker during pregnancy and maternity.  It has to be emphasised how basic and essential a reform it is because we must view this Bill in the context of what the State has done and in particular what the State has still failed to do in relation to the married woman, whether it be a married woman in the work place or a married woman in the home.  This Bill provides us with a welcome opportunity for a balanced and serious appraisal of the way in which the State views and protects or discriminates against the married woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Hussey I would like the opportunity for a separate and detailed Committee Stage.  There are a number of matters which I would like to consider and possibly put down technical and possibly minor amendments.  Nevertheless I would like to have that opportunity on Committee Stage.  Also I think if we go through this Bill section by section in a full Committee Stage it will give us an opportunity to examine in more depth <Col N="1074" /> what are in fact very general provisions and a great deal depends on the type of regulations or orders the Minister may make, the type of publicity that may be available, the type of safeguards for ensuring the right to return to work and so forth.</P>
    <P>Taking this measure then, first of all as one which provides the basic protection and indeed social justice to the married woman worker who becomes pregnant, I would like to place it in the overall context of the many continuing discriminations that exist against the married woman worker.  I would like to begin with the discrimination in relation to unemployment assistance and benefits.  We do not sufficiently advert to the serious discriminations which exist in relation to unemployment and in relation to the attempts by married women to obtain unemployment assistance or benefit.  In general married women still cannot qualify for unemployment assistance.  Only if a married woman is not dependent on her husband and has at least one dependant will she be eligible.  This brings in a married woman who is supporting an invalid husband &mdash; and that would be a comparatively rare though not totally unusual situation.  It would also bring in a separated woman with at least one dependent child.  But a separated wife who does not have a dependent child would not qualify for unemployment assistance though she might qualify for a deserted wife's allowance or supplementary welfare allowance.  Again I think there is a very evident discrimination where each of a working couple happen to be unemployed &mdash; and I am talking about unemployment assistance, not about qualifying for benefit &mdash; because again it is the husband who can claim for the unemployment assistance.  These are discriminations which reflect our attitude and our approach to the married woman who either wants to or needs to go out to work, and both categories of married women are entitled to the full support and protection of the State in going out to work.</P>
    <P>Similarly in relation to unemployment benefit, we still have reduced rates of benefit in relation to married women. <Col N="1075" /> Married women receive lower weekly rates of certain benefits than those payable to other applicants.  This is significant in cash terms per week in relation to unemployment benefit as well as in relation to disability benefit and some other benefits.  Similarly the time of duration of unemployment benefit is shorter for a married woman than for another comparable worker and this is a totally unwarranted and unfair discrimination and yet it is part of our social welfare code.  The time limit on the duration of unemployment benefit is generally 15 months, but for married women being supported by their husbands it is limited to 12 months.  Ireland will be obliged to remove these types of discriminations under the EEC directive requiring equal treatment in relation to social security. That directive was passed in December 1978 but it has a particularly long lee time, time for implementation, of six years for full implementation which brings us up to December 1984.  So if we have not put our house in order by then we will be compelled by the EEC to remove these discriminations in our social welfare and social security code by December 1984.  But must we wait until the EEC hammer falls on us or until the European Commission brings Ireland before the court in Luxembourg for breach of its obligations under the Treaty?  Surely we can anticipate and, indeed, from our own culture and our own sense of values, achieve a better balance, a fairer situation and the removal of legal discriminations which exist against the married woman?</P>
    <P>Apart from these legal discriminations I think that one very real discrimination that exists is in relation to the low level of income of women, the low rate of pay of a married woman.  In practice this is what causes the main differences between the social welfare cover for men and women and what we see then as the result of it is the low participation rate of women in the labour force.  Again, I am referring to the figures of the 1977 labour force survey which show a participation rate for all women aged 15 to 65 of 32 per cent compared with 84 per cent for men <Col N="1076" /> in the same age group.  This low labour force participation of married women &mdash; Ireland has the lowest in the European Community with the possible exception now of Greece &mdash; is an overriding factor in considering the position of the married woman.  Again, because entitlement to social insurance benefits depends on contributions which are paid in respect of previous employment and therefore demand a continuity of employment, only women who are currently working or who have recently worked in the paid labour force would be eligible.  This I think is the cycle of discrimination and deprivation for married women.  This is aggravated by the fact that a great number of married women find themselves obliged, because of lack of other supports &mdash; which I will come to and which Senator Hussey dealt with to some extent &mdash; to take part-time, very often uninsured, work and they find they are outside any real protection either of legislation or of the trade union movement.  It is in this context that we have to look at a measure which will make a significant contribution within its own terms to the protection of the married woman worker in employment and particularly during pregnancy and maternity.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that all of the discriminations that I have been referring to stem from an approach, a traditional approach &mdash; and there are some who see constitutional sanction for it in the reference to the special recognition of the role of the married woman in the home and that women should not be forced by economic necessity to go out to work.  I believe that that is open to a much more positive and supportive interpretation than that rather negative view.  But the approach is one which treats a married woman basically still as a dependant of her husband.  That is the approach of the social welfare code; that is still very largely the approach of our society and we are only beginning to change it.  In other words, I hope we can view this measure, and indeed I will be criticising some aspects of this measure in that context, as the beginning of the treatment of a married woman as an individual in relation to her own choice and own needs, as to whether she will <Col N="1077" /> work in the home and involve herself particularly in child rearing when the children are a young age or whether she will go, out of necessity or out of self-development or out of whatever motivation, and work outside the home.  It is time we got past this old notion of the married woman as a dependant, of her rights as a worker as being only ancillary really to her main function in society and past the very narrow and still prevalent conditioning of men and women in our society. That is my first general comment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply to the debate might give some indication as to whether it is proposed to anticipate the deadline imposed by the EEC directive to remove some of the discriminations in the social welfare code and whether we can do this of our own sense of priorities and values rather than waiting until the big stick of the EEC imperative arrives.</P>
    <P>The second general comment I would make concerns a matter which was referred to by Senator Hussey, that is, that the Bill provides for maternity leave &mdash; indeed, that is encapsulated in the title Maternity Protection of Employment Bill, 1981 &mdash; but does not provide for the broader issue, parental leave. Like Senator Hussey, I believe that we should move deliberately in this direction, that we should certainly provide for maternity leave during pregnancy and during and after childbirth and should approach the whole question on the basis of parental leave.  We should do as I understand is done in countries like Sweden, where parental leave can be taken by either father or mother.  Approximately 12 per cent of fathers in Sweden I understand take parental leave in the early stages after the birth of a child.  It would be longer than the four weeks following the 14 weeks provided for here. Nevertheless, parental leave is taken by the father rather than the mother in, admittedly, a minority of cases.  It is very important to have this balanced approach in the context of parental leave.</P>
    <P>We should also view the Bill in the context of the need for other supports and other facilities being made available to the worker, particularly to the married woman worker with family commitments. <Col N="1078" />  Here again I would emphasise the importance of legislative provision for proper child care, for creches and for pre-school and after-school facilities. One of the problems at the moment is that school hours for younger children are much shorter than the rigid working hours, the nine to five type hours, governing a lot of the employment of married women.  We need much greater emphasis on these kinds of support.  These supports are essential also for another category of worker, that is, the single parent, male or female, who is particularly dependent on these supports and services.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need for an overall structure of creches and pre-school and after-school facilities, there is need for a review by employers and trade unions of working hours.  Such review should take cognisance of the family.  A nine to five cycle or, indeed, a continuous 24-hour cycle with night work, excludes women workers from opportunities of employment.  We need much more part-time and flexitime and job sharing for the important family considerations in the context of parental responsibility and parental leave.</P>
    <P>But in order to have legislation which reflects these values we need to hold these values more visibly in our society. Therefore, we need a social change in dealing with the question of families and parental responsibility within families.</P>
    <P>Here we move into a neglected areanot a totally neglected area but so far a fairly neglected area of what I would like to call domestic politics.  It is a key area which has been to some extent overlooked by the more radical women's movement, the more articulate spokespersons for the women's movement who have tended to focus on certain issues, a number of them relating to the work-place or relating to specific social reforms.  Not enough attention has been paid to the importance of the politics with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo; within the household.</P>
    <P>In so far as there has been a welcome change and improvement in the sharing of responsibilities within the home between husband and wife, mother and father, this sharing has tended to be directed towards sharing child minding <Col N="1079" /> and child rearing.  In other words, in the case of a young couple now it is not at all unusual for the husband and father to share looking after the children, to share playing with the children, to share collecting the children from school, to share bathing the children, to be more involved than had been the traditional pattern.  It is much less common, much more rare, to see the husband/father sharing the other chores.  Indeed, as some body put it and not so long ago it is now regarded as being welcome support from the husband if he stands beside his wife while she is washing up or if he talks to her while she is scrubbing the floor or if he holds the dustpan while she sweeps the stairs down or whatever it may be.  We have not got to the stage in domestic politics which is the essential core of equality at home and in the work-place of shared responsibility for housework and chores.  Perhaps those women who are in a position where they have interesting jobs and a good deal of job satisfaction and a reasonable income from the jobs that they tend to some extent to combine the full-time job with the full-time housework in the home rather than embark on the difficult job of fighting the battle on the domestic politics front and trying to have a more fair and equitable sharing of the household burden as well as the responsibility for and care of young children.</P>
    <P>Much more attention needs to be paid to the necessity for men to be involved in the house running and household work as well as in child minding responsibilities if we are to have genuine equality both in the home and in the work place between the sexes.  That will involve a fairly substantial change from the present conditioning and perceptions and it will lead very naturally to the removal of the kind of discriminations that I was outlining and to an approach based on parental leave.  All of that would follow because the balance would be struck in society itself.</P>
    <P>Turning then to the measure which we are considering this afternoon, it is a particularly welcome measure in that it does provide the statutory maternity leave and what intrigues me about it is that the <Col N="1080" /> Government, as I understand it, are required by the national understanding to implement this measure and to implement it on the basis of 14 weeks paid maternity leave by April 1981.  I would just like to reflect on that for a moment. It is interesting that out of negotiations between employers, trade unions and the Government there is a binding commitment to implement social legislation of a particular sort within a particular time-scale.</P>
    <P>I hope they would not, but if this House decided that 13 weeks was enough, I wonder if they would be able to consider an amendment proposing 13 weeks, because they are bound to 14 weeks.  The same might apply if we tried, for example, to extend what I feel is a very brief time, the four weeks unpaid leave.  I would like to have an opportunity on Committee Stage to consider whether there could be a longer period of unpaid leave after the 14 weeks of statutory paid leave.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of democratic accountability and leadership and the relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas, it is very interesting that the decision has been taken outside the Oireachtas altogether.  The decision has been taken in the context of the national understanding entered into between employers, unions and the Government and it is one of the terms of the national understanding that the Government will ensure that this legislation will be through both Houses and in force by April 1981.  Because of the kind of delay that Senator Hussey summarised and outlined, I have to welcome the fact that the trade union movement used the big stick and forced a commitment and a date and indeed a specific commitment for 14 weeks paid maternity leave.  But I do question the desirability of having our social legislation thrashed out in that forum and then just processed through Leinster House.  Perhaps as Deputies and Senators we should be more concerned that things have come to the stage where they are negotiated outside this forum and then we are, more or less, a rubber stamp to implement them and put them on the Statute Book.  It may be that we are not doing the job that we were elected <Col N="1081" /> to do and implementing social legislation which is keeping up with the requirements and the needs of the young and fast-growing population that we have. That would be a view that I would have a lot of sympathy for, that we are simply failing to implement in a direct sense, failing to give enough time to various kinds of social legislation and so we find ourselves at the receiving end of a pact between employers, unions and the Government.</P>
    <P>Whilst raising that concern &mdash; and it is a democratic concern, it is a concern about allocation of responsibility and political accountability &mdash; I would like to pay tribute to the negotiators on the union side, and I would also like to pay an individual tribute to Peter Cassells whom I have heard on many platforms for the last few years speaking, campaigning for and arguing for maternity legislation.  He was one of the people, among others, who ensured that it would be included as provision of the national understanding and hence we find ourselves here today with a very tight deadline and with the Minister calling on us to have a speedy debate.  However, as I have already mentioned, I am not in favour of the kind of speedy debate which took place in the other House on this measure because, by my calculations, having looked at the Official Dáil Report of 24 February when this measure was introduced, it was introduced by the Minster who spoke and three other Deputies spoke in that House on Second Stage and then the Committee and Report and Final Stages were put through and the whole business took less than an hour-and-a-half.  That does not seem to me to be a full and considered analysis by a House of the Oireachtas of important social legislation.  It perhaps emphasises&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed my private view and if the Chair thinks that I should not have then I accept the ruling of the Chair.  Let me put it in a neutral sense.  I <Col N="1082" /> found it surprising that an important piece of social legislation could go through all the Stages in a House of the Oireachtas in under an hour-and-a-half. It reinforces the point I was making earlier about where the real decision was made and in what context it was made and perhaps reflects on the Houses of the Oireachtas but I will not pursue that point lest the Chair pull me up again.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about some aspects of this Bill apart from the basic narrowness of it in that it relates only to maternity leave and it does not approach, even in some measure, the question of introducing also the broader concept of paternal leave and making it clear that this is the way in which we will be moving and moving as rapidly as we can as a society.</P>
      <P>Perhaps if I indicate a couple of provisions at this stage it will give the Minister an idea of the areas in which it may be necessary to table amendments before Committee Stage.  For example, the powers of the Minister seem to be very broad in relation to the making of orders under this Bill.  Under section (2) there is the kind of general provision which I do not particularly like in legislation because it means almost anything as I read it.  It provides:</P>
      <P>an order under this Act may contain such consequential, supplementary and ancillary provisions including any provisions modifying any provision of this Act as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.</P>
      <P>I accept that such an order has to be laid in draft and we will have an opportunity to comment on it but, nevertheless, we have had a few orders in draft earlier today.  It does not really give us much opportunity to consider it.  I would like to ask why the Minister feels that he should take so much power to himself and what in particular is meant by the phrase that he could by order modify any provisions of this Act.  For example, could he modify some of the essential provisions of this Act, and modify in what particular way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important substantial point I am not happy about is the question of whether a qualifying period is necessary <Col N="1083" /> in order to avail of the social welfare provisions for statutory maternity leave. When this Bill went through like a dose of salts in the Dáil, the terms of the Social Welfare Bill were not known.  They are at present under discussion in the other House.  In the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill of 1981, there are sections 9 to 11, and while I appreciate that they are not directly before us they are of immedpate concern.  They are totally linked to this Bill.  This is creating statutory maternity leave.  The Social Welfare Bill is saying on what conditions a woman will get her paid maternity leave.</P>
    <P>One of the features which was welcomed &mdash; for example, it was welcomed in this very helpful article in <i>Liberty</i> and by Rosheen Callender &mdash; was the fact that there was no qualifying period for statutory maternity leave.  In this article which is published in the March issue of <i>Liberty</i> under sub-heading &ldquo;No Qualifying Period&rdquo; it is stated:</P>
    <P>One very welcome aspect of the new scheme is that no qualifying period is required before a woman can claim entitlement to paid maternity leave. When she is employed and insured for social welfare, she is covered for maternity pay; the various contribution conditions for other social benefits do not apply.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, this is something the employers are annoyed about; they had sought a qualifying period and argue that absence of same will &lsquo;put off employing women&rsquo;.  In fact, they seem to think that the whole Bill will put employers off the idea of taking on women workers &mdash; just like the equal pay act, no doubt!</P>
    <P>It seems to me, trying to link together the provisions of section 9 to 11 of the Social Welfare Bill, which we will have an opportunity of considering in detail later, that it is necessary to have the contributions and that the number of contributions are set out in that Bill in order to qualify for the level of payment for the 14 weeks under the statutory scheme.  In other words, there is a qualifying period <Col N="1084" /> in effect but it is not in this Bill, but in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill. The Minister in his reply should deal fairly fully with that aspect and tell us exactly what the position is, not in this rather difficult statutory language but in plain English.  He should say whether there is a qualifying period because although it appears that there is no qualifying period to obtain maternity leave and the benefit of it under the legislation that we are considering this afternoon, if one then looks at the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, there is a qualifying period.  There appear to be, certainly at best, two classes of women workers who will benefit in different ways from the maternity leave.  This should be clearly understood by all of us before we go any further in dealing with the legislation.</P>
    <P>Another small point would be more suitable for Committee Stage but I will indicate it at this stage.  I am not too happy about some of the language used in Part III on right to return to work.  For example, under section 20 (1) (c) where there is a right to return under the contract of employment</P>
    <P>under terms or conditions not less favourable than those that would have been applicable to her if she had not been so absent from work.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of being very precise but what does &ldquo;not less favourable&rdquo; mean and who is going to decide what is favourable and what is not favourable?  Similarly, in relation to the right to suitable alternative employment in certain circumstances on return to work, what is suitable alternative employment? How is that going to be determined and what are the criteria for it?</P>
    <P>One of the matters that I was going to raise very strongly when I got the text of the Bill was the question of publicity about its provisions because it places a very substantial onus on the married woman worker to notify.  She must at set times notify the employer, and there are very clear and rather rigid periods for notification.  I can see the importance of notification but I am very much concerned <Col N="1085" /> that there be much more emphasis on the publicising of the provisions of this Bill &mdash; and the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill which will deal with the amount of allowances in the matter&mdash; than seems to emerge from the Minister's speech.  It is not in the text of the Bill at all.  The Minister talked in terms of publicity for the Act.  He said</P>
    <P>I feel it is essential to the successful operation of the Maternity Protection of Employees Act to make adequate publicity available.  I have already put in train preparation of explanatory material, summarising the provisions of the Act indicating necessary procedures, for example, for notification.  I will have this published as soon as possible after the Act comes into force.</P>
    <P>It would be very helpful to us to know what the Minister has in mind.  I do not think that newspaper publication is very helpful.  It is there for the days that the newspaper is there and some people might cut it out, most people would not. Any woman who is not married or who is not pregnant is not concerned about it until the reality comes along.  There is the possibility of tabling an amendment imposing a statutory duty on employers to have a notice in the work-place summarising the protection afforded by this measure and the requirements for notification by married women who wish to avail of the maternity leave under it. One of the criticisms that I expressed when the equal pay legislation was being brought in was that, despite the reference in the directive on equal pay and the directive on equal treatment to adequate publication of them, there never really was and there still is not adequate publication in the work place of the provisions on equal pay and equal treatment.  Both the Minister's Department and the Employment Equality Agency have brought out very helpful booklets and pamphlets on rights but, apart from that, we should approach this question of publicity in the same way as we might approach the minimum terms and conditions of employment.  If there is not a statutory obligation to give every worker <Col N="1086" /> a form which would set out the rights, at least it should be mandatory for employers to set up in the actual work place well publicised notices so that there will not be any unintentional or unnecessary deprivation of the rights and protections given under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I extend a welcome to the Bill.  It is very decidely a move in the right direction and I would like to see further opportunities in this House for much more debate about the whole question of work in relation to the family life of workers and indeed to family life in our society so that we can ensure that our social welfare and social security provisions and our approach to leave in the case of pregnancy are based on a balanced view of the shared role of parents in relation to child minding, house running and work opportunity, and then we will move more quickly towards genuine equality in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House acknowledges that the needs of the working married woman should have the protection of the law and this principle has been recognised not only by the Government but by the social partners, by the employers and by the trade unions under the terms of the national understanding.  This is a most important step in the area of social legislation.  The Minister's speech outlining the provisions of the Bill was very comprehensive but he may have unwittingly referred to other areas which still need the attention of our laws if the legislation that we have on equal pay and discrimination is to be effective.  I refer to what he said when referring to section 14 of the Bill, that if the employee so wishes she may take an extra four weeks' unpaid maternity leave. That is very welcome but in his follow-up I find the fine Italian hand of a man because he said &ldquo;This will, for instance, give additional time to breast-feed her baby&rdquo;. Any mother, having had a baby who undertakes and is able to establish a successful pattern of breast-feeding is not going to throw it up after four weeks to go back to work and she is not going to throw it up after 14 weeks.  That is a commitment she deliberately undertakes <Col N="1087" /> for a period of at least six months and possible one year.  The logical consequences of what the Minister has said is that we really need facilities to enable women to bring their small children to work with them and look after them there.  I am not talking about turning every office block and factory floor into a nursery, but neither am I talking about a gas ring to heat a baby's bottle on so that a mother can go down at her lunchtime and have a bottle at one end of her baby and attack the other end with a diaper.  I am talking about proper facilities to be planned for at the planning stage of building, properly qualified staff to look after young children, flexible working hours, flexitime and generally the setting up of a system under which, and I can do no better than quote from the report of the Employment Equality Agency which has already been referred to and which speaks about</P>
      <P>working conditions to be sufficiently flexible to allow women and men to respond to the demands of family and employment responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents a step in the right direction but its successful implementation will be only as good as the goodwill that it engenders among those who will have to operate it.  The attitudes of women who work and women who stay at home are terribly important if the Bill is to work effectively and if other social legislation of this sort is to take the right direction.  Therefore, I would like to speak in a general way about attitudes. Over the last decade or so things like the removal of the marriage ban in the public service, the more widespread use of birth control and more material expectations have meant that a girl on getting married does not choose to stay at home.  In fact, the girl who does choose to say at home is becoming the exception rather than the rule.  This, while it is welcome, has led to a complete reversal in public opinion. Ten years ago or so the woman who left her family to go out to work was regarded as a neglectful mother.  Now if a woman chooses to stay at home she is regarded <Col N="1088" /> somehow as not fulfilling her proper role or her true potential.  There is a tendency to denigrate the role of the mother who quite willingly chooses to stay at home. This has led to young married women being subject not only to economic pressures but to social pressures so that where they would choose to stay at home they feel obliged to go out to work.  I find this deplorable.  From my own experience, as someone who did make a choice to stay at home, maybe an involuntary choice but a choice nevertheless, I have never found that the task of rearing a family was stultifying intellectually.  I have found, and many mothers would agree with me, that the task of being in charge of the development of young minds is mentally very stimulating and mind-stretching.  I would remind the House that there is more to rearing a family than putting children into clean socks.</P>
    <P>This point of view or attitude was brought home rather forcefully to me the other day when I turned on the radio and listened to that excellent women's programme &ldquo;Women today&rdquo;.  A middle-aged woman wrote in and she was employed as a child minder.  She was looking after the children of another woman who went out to work and for being a substitute mother she was paid the princely sum of £1 an hour.  That is the sum that my young children get for babysitting and all they have to do when babysitting is to ensure that the small children do not garrotte each other or set the house on fire.  This woman had to step in and take the place of the mother who was out at work and look after and be responsible for those small children for that rate.  I would say that if a married woman and her husband want a substitute for mother, they ought to be prepared to pay for such.  The point that this woman who wrote the letter was making was that the woman who was paying her thought very little of her own role as the mother.  I find this a very deplorable attitude.</P>
    <P>A far more dangerous influence is the influence that is exercised by parents on their children's choice of career particularly when it affects young girls.  I am not saying that it is a bad thing for parents to <Col N="1089" /> influence their children's choice of careers.  It is a very good thing when that influence is well-informed and educated, but where it is not and especially where it is, as in this country, combined with a lack of adequate career guidance, such an influence, uninformed as it is, is dangerous to children starting their careers and also very dangerous for the economy as a whole.  The attitudes of parents, of my generation anyway, are coloured by the fear that we have of the new and developing technology.  We see it in terms of job loss.  We tend to translate the media terms of skilled obsolescence and planned leisure into the more common terms of redundnacy and dole queues. Yet the facts are before us.  We need to take advantage of the jobs that will be available.  We need technicians.  The fact is that young people do not see their future careers in these new developing industries.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House to the Science Budget which was debated here recently in which these facts were put very clearly and very forcefully and in which certain solutions were suggested.  Here I will confine myself to the facts regarding girls, because we are dealing with women in employment.  Although we need thousands of technicians and although we have a great pool of people who need guidance in their future careers at school, less than three per cent of girls doing the leaving certificate in 1979 took the higher mathematics paper.  The reason for that, I am afraid, has to be put down to the attitude of teachers.  If one asks why a girl who has done reasonably well in the intermediate examination cannot take the physical sciences, which include such things as physics and higher mathematics, for her leaving certificate, one is told blandly that girls do not do higher mathematics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important because it relates to the attitude of people putting their daughters into traditional jobs.  We <Col N="1090" /> have to remember about traditional jobs that whatever the job loss is, due to the new technology, 90 per cent of that job loss will be among women.  It is important that girls should know the options that are open to them in any employment that they take.  It has been suggested that employers should be engaged in the process of structuring the educational curricula.  I would ask why parents should not be concerned too.  I hope that I have emphasised sufficiently the need for parents and career experts to be involved in education in order to ensure a more secure future in employment particularly for our young women.  Women will bring about change in this field and they will need the co-operation and sympathy particularly of women like myself who do stay at home but who understand their problems.</P>
      <P>I am very interested also in the comments of other speakers on the fine things that have been done in other countries in relation to payments for married women who have children, both in the home and outside the home.  We have been referred to figures in Germany, France and in Scandinavian countries.  I always understood that the <i>rationale</i> of these Government incentives was to encourage married women to stay at home to enlarge their families to ensure that populations in these countries, which have been decimated by two world wars and by very liberal abortion and birth control legislation, would be improved.  Women are paid to stay at home in order to have babies.  Therefore, when we talk about these figures we are not comparing like with like.</P>
      <P>Briefly, I welcome the Bill.  I compliment the Minister on it and on his speech and I hope that on Committee Stage we can go deeper into the details of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that a Bill such as this one today has come as (1) a result of progress in a more liberal attitude towards women at work, (2) an effort to tap that great talent that undoubtedly lies in women and to maintain that talent even when they get married and (3) to try to meet the economic pressures that now fall on every married <Col N="1091" /> couple to go out to work.  With regret I have to say that the Bill is before us largely because of pressure which has come through bodies such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency and last but by no means least, the fact that every other EEC country has already such legislation.  Whether that means we lay credit with those bodies or blame with the Government for being so tardy in bringing forward this legislation is rather academic at this stage.  It behoves us to look into the implications of this legislation to see if it has gone far enough or too far.  I undoubtedly welcome this legislation.  I would like to think that it was a further process in a liberal attitude towards women in employment, but I maintain that the Government must take further have opened a box out of which many other matters will pop up their heads on which the Government must take further action and introduce further legislative measures.  Otherwise the Bill may well fall through neglect or lack of willpower on the part of the Government, or perhaps through abuses of the very many provisions in this legislation.  As regards abuses of the provisions of this Bill, later on I will mention a few of them which may provide loopholes for some employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the question in Ireland of women at work has agitated many minds in the recent decade.  Up to then it was a question of believing and maintaining and standing firmly by the principle that a woman's place was in the home.  Even in reading the debate in the course of this Bill's passage through the other House, it struck me that here we found still being trotted out the idea that all Irish women still prefer to stay at home, but I am not so sure that that is the case any longer.  Women in recent years have become far more aware that they are entitled to the same rights as a man in seeking a profession outside the home.  Women now know that economic pressures are forcing them to continue to work.  I remember a Bill coming into this House which was one of the first pieces <Col N="1092" /> of legislation following our entry into the EEC and which provided for women the same rights as men in equal pay for equal work in their places of employment.  I remember expressing some reservations and saying that it could lead to an awful lot of problems for firms and that it could well result in young girls leaving school not being able to find positions open to them if many married women sought to continue to work.  In the light of experience where so many women have come to me in the past seven or eight years and been adamant in insisting on the necessity for them to continue to work after their marriage for pure economic pressures if for nothing else.  I have concluded that that legislation was necessary.  That it was already in operation in the EEC does not take away from the fact that it was also necessary and desirable in this country no matter how slow it might have been coming.</P>
    <P>It seems that all along the line we are behind every other country in taking legislative measures, and only as a result of pressure from bodies such as Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Council for the Status of Women, is anything being done.  This Bill is before us for no other reason than that it was part of the deal that was done within the context of the national understanding 1980.  That is regrettable but it is a fact of life and we must consider the proposals in this Bill irrespective of whether the Bill has come about through liberal attitudes or as a result of these pressures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not answer that one.  There is no doubt that at present too many people in this country are chasing too few jobs.  The parallel to that is that we are going to have too many women chasing too few jobs also.  One of the consequences of this legislation will be the necessity to provide more and more extra jobs to fill this need.  As a result of this Bill there could be pressure by trade unions to insist that where a woman leaves her place of employment for 12 to 14 weeks for pregnancy reasons there should be an immediate replacement <Col N="1093" /> for her.  If so, when she comes back to work the young girl replacing her will be thrown out of employment to look for work elsewhere.  We will have to create far more jobs at a far better rate than we have ever experienced here before.</P>
      <P>It is not only in that line that we will have problems.  There are no child-care facilities in this country, and the lack of child-care facilities in many places of employment could be an excuse put forward by an employer for his reluctance to take on a girl who in his opinion might well be married within two years and seeking this maternity leave of absence. The Government must tackle this problem of child-care facilities if this Bill is to be seen to be operated in its right context.</P>
      <P>We have also the question of paternity leave in this matter.  If we do not have paternity leave as a result of this Bill we are breeding further discrimination in the whole matter of employment and rights arising for everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made those points, there is no doubt that the Bill is welcome.  I cannot imagine anybody but a rather chauvinistic employer being reluctant to implement such a Bill, or the most chauvinistic anti-woman female being anything but pleased with a Bill such as this.  However, when one looks at the provisions, the terms and sections of the Bill and the way in which they are worded, one begins to wonder whether enough has been done to make sure the Bill can be implemented properly without many loopholes being created.  For instance, section 21 (1) states that when the employee returns to work she is to be offered by her employer suitable alternative employment.  Well and good, but section 21 (2) states that where the employer cannot offer the same job or an alternative job he shall offer a job in which the terms and conditions of employment are not substantially less favourable to her than those of her contract of employment.  What is the interpretation of &ldquo;substantially less favourable&rdquo;?  Are we not, therefore, going to have a situation where an employer can offer a job which is less favourable than the job she held previously, or will the union come into the matter and create a dispute because that <Col N="1094" /> employee is being offered a job which in their interpretation of &ldquo;substantially less favourable&rdquo; is discriminating against that employee?</P>
    <P>Section 2 confines the privileges, if you might call them that, of this legislation but, as I read it, it restricts them to people more or less in permanent employment. It excludes people who are in part-time employment or employment for less than six months of the year.  Here again we find that married women more and more are seeking such part-time employment to meet the economic pressures which are imposed upon them and I find it difficult to accept that the Bill is really facing up to the task of helping such women. There are always the less-privileged women, the women who have to go out and find work for even a few months in the year, and section 2 appears to exclude them from the privileges of this Bill. These are loopholes which employers may well utilise unless the Government show the will to insist that there are no loopholes in this Bill.  If not, resulting from the operation of some sections there could be downgrading of the position of female employees in their places of work. That is to be abhorred.</P>
    <P>This Bill should proceed slowly.  On this side of the House we want a Committee Stage.  I have given a few examples of where I think a lot of indefinite, vague wording can create many problems.  Perhaps we can try to straighten it out to the benefit of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I believe that you can change a law and you can bring in a new law but unless there is substantial changes in the attitudes of people towards what you are trying to do in that law, it might never have appeared on the Statute Book for all the good it can do. If we can straighten out the possible defects that there appear to be in the wording of the Bill and remove any loopholes that an unscrupulous employer may try to find, we will have worthwhile legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is an important step towards having true equality between men and women, particularly in the area of <Col N="1095" /> employment.  Until the early seventies, the idea of married women going out to work was unheard of.  A girl's future on leaving school was seen in terms of a relatively short period in temporary lowly employment and then she was to take on the responsibilities of marriage and parenthood.  The idea that any woman would combine a career outside the home with one inside the home was something that was relatively new and not very popular. After a few years, employers and society generally accepted the idea that married women should work if they wanted to and that there was nothing wrong with that.  The idea then grew that when a married woman had a child she would cease employment because, if she did not, she was neglecting her child and her family.  Thankfully, with the introduction of this Bill, that concept will go and it will be realised that a woman who works outside the home is no more neglecting her family than the woman who stays at home, lies in bed for the morning, goes out shopping in the afternoon and perhaps does not look after her children at all.  We have got to realise that a fulfilled career outside the home can often lead to a better marriage and to children growing up in better family circumstances than might necessarily be the case if that woman were at home all day.  Many housewives who stay at home all day may not necessarily be very happy doing that but because of various pressures and the lack of provision of child-care facilities they are forced to do so.</P>
      <P>The concept of paid maternity leave is not something that is totally new to our society.  The public servants have enjoyed it now for some time but despite that fact, it is very sad, wrong and a disgrace to our country and our society that there have been no child-care facilities available to married women who wish to go out to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill, I am not entirely happy with the fact that we have not as yet made provision to have children properly looked after in cases where women are forced to work or who want to work.  Any system of paid maternity leave must have with it, as an integral <Col N="1096" /> part of that legislation, proper child-care facilities organised by the State, local authorities or the health boards as well as those which are currently provided by private employers.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough in 1981 to have a situation where there are absolutely no facilities for any young mother who wants to have her children looked after.  This applied not only in the case of mothers who go out to work but to mothers who want to go shopping.</P>
    <P>I represent Tallaght in County Dublin. This is an area which comprises hundreds of young married couples, many of whom cannot get a baby-sitter during the day while they go into town to do some shopping or to look after some important business.  That is a disgrace when we claim to have true equality for men and women. At a recent meeting of Dublin County Council I tabled a motion to the manager asking him to provide child-care facilities throughout County Dublin.  I was horrified when he replied that statutorily he was not entitled to do so.  I hope the Minister will press to make sure that we will have, before long, a comprehensive system of child-care facilities, whereby there will be crêches, not only attached to centres of employment, but also run by the State and by local authorities, to make sure that children can have the proper expert care that they need, especially at a very early age.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Dáil speech he referred to the fact that the Government had given a commitment to the establishment of child-care facilities.  He did not refer to it here today and I am a little disappointed about that.  He said a committee would be established to make recommendations to the Government.  I would like the Minister to be more specific as to the type of committee this will be and how long it will have to report.  I hope such committee will comprise representatives of employers and trade unions, women's organisations.  Government Departments and very importantly, representatives of married women who stay at home and who very often do not have anybody to speak on their behalf.  I hope that the committee will be appointed before long and that it will <Col N="1097" /> proceed very rapidly to make its recommendations to the Government.</P>
    <P>The important sections of the Bill have been well outlined by other Senators. Reference has been made in particular to the fact that we will have on the Statute Book that every woman who is in full-time employment is entitled to 14 weeks' paid maternity leave and a further four weeks' unpaid leave if she so wishes.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what the position is regarding women in part-time or temporary employment.  People can be in temporary employment for quite some time.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill entitles an employee to return to work after she has had her baby: that she cannot be asked to leave simply because she takes 14 weeks off to have her child.  I welcome this section.  It is a very important section.</P>
    <P>I would like to know at what stage the employee has to indicate to her employer that she will be returning to work. Women might leave employment for the 14 weeks with every intention of returning to work but maybe for health reasons and so on, are not able at the end of the 14 weeks and the further four weeks, to return to employment.  I would like to think that in 12 months or two years later if they felt capable of returning to work the option would be open to them in certain special circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has made allowances for women taking time off during pregnancy and after the baby is born to have medical attention.  This is very important because many of these facilities are available only during the normal nine to five office hours.  Women who work those hours may not have very conveniently available to them these medical services.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly referred to the fact that as soon as the Bill becomes law, he will organise a high-level publicity campaign and will publish a detailed explanatory leaflet outlining the provisions of the Bill.  I am very happy that the Minister is doing this and I hope that this publicity will extend to every place of employment, that advertisements will be carried on notice boards where people are at work explaining the provisions of <Col N="1098" /> the Bill.  If it is possible.  I hope the Minister will send a copy of this leaflet to every married woman that he is aware of who is in employment.</P>
    <P>Rightly, the Minister in drafting this Bill, consulted with ICTU, trade unions, employers and women's organisations. That is as it should be.  I would not be in favour of the attitude conveyed by some of the Senators on the Oposition side when they said that this Bill simply came out of some sort of pressure from different groups.  All Bills introduced by governments come from one sort of pressure or another.  Those of us who represent the female community in the Houses of the Oireachtas are here because of pressure from women's movements and women's organisations.  A few years ago there was no pressure and there were relatively few women involved in Irish politics.  In a few more years, because of further pressures, there will be many more women in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would not necessarily criticise the Government because they may have reacted to pressure.  Governments at all times must react to different sorts of pressure from lobby groups if it is in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the need for child-care facilities.  Side by side with that we must establish in all places of employment the idea of flexitime, so that a woman can look after her children in the morning and can come into work at ten o'clock and work later in the evening or can finish earlier to collect her children from school and to cook their evening meal, if she so wishes.  This must go hand in hand with any legislation providing for equal opportunities in the area of employment for men and women.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by referring briefly to something which Senator Hussey spoke about: the attitudes of employers in Ireland.  The Senator said that she was aware of the fact that they were very favourably disposed towards employing married people.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of employers are.  I have become aware in recent times of certain types of questions that employers tend to ask women when they go for interviews for positions, questions to which I and <Col N="1099" /> many other women take objection.  If they are married they are asked if they intend to have children.  If they are not married they are asked if they intend to get married.  That attitude on the part of employers must change.  Bills like this give married women in particular and women in general more opportunities to participate fully in the life of the nation; they will help to change attitudes.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the Houses of the Oireachtas will see much more legislation in this area and possibly in a few years time, as more and more young women become elected to the Houses of Parliament, we will have the other facilities I referred to. Perhaps in Leinster House in the not too distant future we will have crêche and child care facilities to ensure that married women who want to participate in public life and politics will be able to have their children looked after.  I look forward to the Minister's views on these questions which are important and an integral part of legislation of this kind.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for the contributions they have made.  There was little critical comment on the Bill.  The areas which were criticised are outside the scope of this legislation.  I should like to say to Senators, especially to Senator Robinson, who made some suggestions about social welfare legislation, that these are areas which are not covered directly in this Bill. The Minister for Social Welfare is examining them, keeping in mind EEC regulations in relation to social welfare.  Other criticisms which were made can be discussed when the Social Welfare Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major points of concern to most Senators was in relation to the provision of child care facilities.  The question of child care facilities for working parents is outside the scope of the maternity protection legislation.  Serious practical difficulties may remain even after the Bill is enacted for women who wish to continue working.  In such cases suitable alternative arrangements for the care of a child are essential to ensure its <Col N="1100" /> healthy development and to safeguard the parents' peace of mind as well.  I am establishing a working party on child care facilities for working parents.  The terms of reference will be to examine the position of child care services and facilities for working parents having regard to ILO recommendation 123 of 1965 concerning the employment of women with family responsibilities and to make recommendations thereon.  I am finalising the composition of the working party, which I will announce next week.  It is my intention that the working party should hold its first meeting as soon as possible.  I hope that will be before Easter and it may well meet some of the comments which have been made here by Senators which are outside the scope of the present legislation but which are very important.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some criticism which Senator Robinson made regarding paid maternity leave in that it was part of the national understanding and that we were discussing it here because of the pressure which was put on the Government from unions, employers and from people generally.  This is part of the national understanding and, as such, it has to be implemented.  In the national understanding, in relation to paid maternity leave, it is stated that a statutory scheme of paid maternity leave for women in employment will be introduced and will operate from April, 1981.</P>
    <P>It does not mention any specific number of weeks.  Senator Robinson said that 14 weeks was mentioned in the national understanding and because agreements had been reached outside this House and outside the Dáil there was something wrong in that.  When I spoke in Copenhagen at the conference in relation to woman last July I made a commitment that this legislation would be introduced and passed early this year.  Long before negotiations commenced on the national understanding I had given a commitment on behalf of the Government when I addressed the Copenhagen conference. There was no specified number of weeks in the national understanding.  A further criticism which was expressed was that the additional four weeks that could be taken might be too short or too restricted. <Col N="1101" /> For that reason Senator Robinson felt it might be necessary to amend the Bill to provide for a longer period.  There is provision in the Bill that the four weeks can be extended by an affirmative order under section 14(6) of the Bill.  The position is clear from that section.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey was concerned about the operation of flexible working hours, which can be of very considerable overall benefit to both employers and employees.  Flexitime arrangements have worked very well in my Department since their introduction in late 1977.  Employees with family responsibilities find flexibility of particular use to them.  The introduction of such arrangements is entirely a matter for discussion between employers and employees.  I do not envisage any change in that position but if there is agreement between both sides of industry, I would consider sponsoring any necessary legislation in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan was concerned about replacing persons leaving the factory floor and the difficulties in relation to women leaving to have check ups and medical examinations.  I accept this is something we should bear in mind.  I will consider the matter when making the necessary regulations.  We will be making regulations under this section in discussion with our social partners to deal with this and we will keep Senators' views in mind then.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson dealt at some length with the areas of discrimination in social welfare legislation.  This is being considered by the Minister for Social Welfare and I undertake that the EEC deadlines will be adhered to in this regard.  The EEC directive will require changes outlined by the Senator.  We are moving towards that area and, in the future, care will be taken to ensure that we comply with the EEC requirements.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey and Senator Robinson referred to parental leave.  The question of providing for this leave is under consideration in the EEC Commission and preliminary work is being done with a view to formulating directives.  Among the EEC countries only Italy has free availability of parental leave for 24 weeks following maternity leave.  That is available <Col N="1102" /> to either parent.  We should get this Bill through and get this legislation enacted.  We can look at the other areas as possible future areas for consideration at a later stage.  There was some concern about the publicity which would be necessary to bring home to women information about, especially, the areas dealing with notification of the employer relating to pregnancy.  I envisage that we can mount a publicity campaign through the unions and employers.  It is my intention to issue a booklet or some explanatory leaflets in this area.  Under the Young Person's Employment Act we circulated some documentation about that Act to schools and other places, to employers and to Senators and to unions. I undertook to circulate that documentation relating to the Young Person's Employment Act when we had a discussion here on that legislation.  I envisage we could do something similar in relation to this legislation.  We should utilise television, radio and newspapers, and especially the unions and people who are in contact with workers.  I shall ensure the necessary publicity to bring home to women the importance of the areas which are covered by this legislation so that we will get that message across.  The criticism which has been levelled at the Bill in that particular area is being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to Part 3 in relation to returning to work.  Some criticism was made of the terminology which was used in relation to Part 3.  The terminology here is the best which is available. There may be some cases which will be brought to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is impossible to get better terminology and if there is any conflict the tribunal will settle this and full discussions can take place.  Basically there is nothing by way of substantial criticism of the Bill which would delay its passage unduly.  I would be very anxious to proceed to the Committee Stage this afternoon also.  I think I have covered most of the points which have been made and I am very anxious that we should proceed with it and conclude all Stages of it this evening.</P>
    <P>I would like again to thank all the Senators who contributed and to assure <Col N="1103" /> them that we are very conscious of the points which they made.  We feel they are adequately covered under present legislation.</P>

I know that my colleague, Senator Hussey, is under the impression that there will be a separate Committee Stage.  I am anxious to consider the possibility of tabling amendments, even if they are fairly technical amendments, and to have the opportunity to table them.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly) Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>For some years now employers and trade unions in the bakery industry have been complaining about the operation of the Night Work (Bakeries) Act, 1936.  This legislation was enacted to give effect to ILO convention No. 20 which prohibits the baking of bread and flour confectionery at night.</P>
      <P>The ban on night work applies to the baking operation only.  Other ancillary operations such as slicing, wrapping, packing orders, loading vans and so on can be legally carried out at night.  In addition, regulations have been made under the Act which allow flour blending, dough making, sponge making and clearing of ovens to be carried out at night. The 1936 Act, therefore, applies only to the bakers who comprise a minority of bakery workers.</P>
      <P>A consultative document which set out various options in regard to the Act was issued to all interested parties in February 1980.  The options were briefly as follows: (a) to change the legal starting and finishing times for baking to 4 a.m. and 9 p.m.; (b) to introduce a licensing system authorising bakeries to work at night; (c) to allow night baking on a partial basis (for example for 26 weeks per year as in Britain and Northern Ireland, or on a particular day or days of the week); (d) to introduce more effective enforcement procedures; (e) to increase the penalties for breaches of the Act.</P>
      <P>Discussions on these options were held with both sides of the industry and resulted in agreement that action needed to be taken if employment in the industry was to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of the year the national delegate conference of the Bakery <Col N="1105" /> and Food Workers' Amalgamated Union passed a motion noting with concern the growing threat to security of employment of the union's members and calling for acceptable amendments which would make the Act more effective or, alternatively, the repeal of the 1936 Act.</P>
    <P>The employers for their part wanted greater flexibility of operation to enable them to supply fresh bread to meet the decline in bread consumption.</P>
    <P>Late last summer a number of bakeries indicated that they would have to close unless they were allowed to operate more flexibly, in particular having permission to bake at night.  Such closures would have involved large-scale unemployment.  These developments made it a matter of urgency that a solution be found quickly.  Last October the Labour Court heard a claim on behalf of a bakery that the unions should agree to alterations in working conditions including the introduction of night work on a rotation basis. The court ruled that it did not seem that a case had been established for the continuing prohibition of all night work and if night shifts were included in a rotational shift pattern the court felt that the legislation should be amended to allow this to take place where unions and employers agree.</P>
    <P>Having studied the views of all sides I feel the best way to tackle the problems which exist in the industry is by way of amending the Act to allow a licensing system as well as improving enforcement and increasing penalties.  This is what is contained in the Bill before the House. What is proposed is a system of licensing which will allow baking throughout the night where it is shown that circumstances warrant it.  Before licences are issued, it is provided that the representatives of employers and workers concerned will be consulted.  Apart from this, I have taken the opportunity to pass the enforcement of the Act to the industrial inspectorate of my Department and penalties have also been increased for breaches of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that the enactment of this legislation will augur better times ahead for the bakery industry and <Col N="1106" /> its employment.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We have no objection to this Bill being speedily passed through the House.  I believe that it has come about by reason of the fact that the 1936 Act has been flouted in certain instances by a small number of bakers.  This has been to the detriment of other bakers who have complied with the 1936 Act, especially city bakers.  If so, if it is to remedy any defects in the operation of the 1936 Act, we would agree with and support this Bill.  It just prompts me to ask why there was the ban on night time baking, in the first instance, under the 1936 Act?  I do not know why the ban is there; perhaps the Minister would explain that to me.  If this amendment is for the reason I have suggested we are in agreement that this Bill should be passed.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 18 February, 1981, takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored <Col N="1108" /> Bodies on Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta which was laid before the Seanad on 5 February 1981 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
    <P>Sugar beet is a basic industry in this country and is vital to its economy.  As outlined in page 33 of the report, sugar beet produces the highest cash return of several key enterprises, ahead, for example, of creamery milk.  The Sugar Company itself is a very important source of employment in many towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are, however a number of serious problems facing the company at this time.  The EEC sugar regime has imposed pricing constraints which have implications for an increase in sugar production. The white sugar produced by the company is under threat of competition in its main markets, namely, the Republic and the North of Ireland.  This means of course that the company is vulnerable and is threatened by an erosion of its market share on its main markets.  Sugar production in the countries of the EEC exceeds consumption.  There is increasing emphasis on diet and allied to this there is competition from substitute products which in turn are contributing to this sugar surplus situation.  A further problem faced by the company, is the high interest payable on the sugar company's borrowings.  If the company is to turn the corner and to return to profitability factory modernisation is a top priority.  As the report underlines, the company needs a capital injection now of £25 million to surmount its present financial weakness. It needs a further injection of equity combined with borrowing to support its additional modernisation programme.  To improve its competitiveness in the countries of the EEC the company needs to modernise as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to industrial relations in the Sugar Company which in my view are a model of how industrial relations should be conducted.  The company and its workforce down the years are to be commended for the exceptional record of industrial peace achieved.  The industrial dispute which occurred at the <Col N="1109" /> Carlow sugar factory last year was the first in the company for over 30 years. This is a truly remarkable record.  In connection with industrial relations, paragraphs 102 and 103 of the report are particularly relevant.  As one who is deeply involved in industrial relations I fully subscribe to the management's tradition in the Sugar Company in which the implementation of personnel policy and industrial relations are considered part and parcel of every manager's job.  It is up to each manager from foreman upwards to face up to issues where they arise and to resolve industrial relations problems nearest the point where they occur.  Since most disputes originate at the work-place it is there that the capacity and the expertise on the part of management and employees and their representatives, the shop stewards, are most needed.</P>
    <P>This underlines the importance of training people in industrial relations at management and shop steward levels. Power, as we know, has moved downwards from trade union headquarters to shop stewards on the shop floor.  The number of negotiable issues continues to expand.  I believe managements should encourage the growth of the shop steward movement.  At the same time managements can reasonably expect professionalism and responsible behaviour from shop stewards.  This would include adherence to written procedures, jointly agreed between the two sides, and shop stewards who do not conform to these agreed procedures should be dealt with firmly by their trade unions.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company has for many years had a system of written dispute procedures which have been agreed with the trade unions and in fact the company has been in the forefront of industrial relations practice in this respect.  As one of the seven designated State-sponsored bodies, it has a number of elected worker-directors on the board.  The company must again be commended for the vision it has shown by devoting very considerable attention to communications.  For many years past, factory works committees have been in operation. There is a recognition that sub-board <Col N="1110" /> structures need to be strengthened further so that the worker-directors can more effectively report back to their constituents, the trade union members, and so that the trade union members in turn can communicate back through these sub-board structures to the directors themselves.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think the opportunity to debate this report is a welcome and positive step.  I feel confident this view is shared by the Sugar Company itself.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second the motion before us this evening and I, like Senator Hillery, am delighted to be given an opportunity to discuss some of the aspects of this report.  First of all, the official news today or yesterday that the Sugar Company as a general body has lost over £9 million trading in the financial year under review leads one to hope that this position can be rectified in the years to come in the interests of Irish agriculture.  I will have a lot to say about a certain region within the Sugar Company's operations in a few moments.  It is true to say that because of the structure and the special relationship that has always existed between the Sugar Company and Irish farming it is very important for the overall agricultural industry that the Sugar Company should do well.  I know that this is the first time that the deficit on trading has been so great.  I understand that a number of elements would have caused this to a certain degree.  A big debt would be one of those factors that the company would have to note.  I understand that the strike in the Carlow factory last year has been costed at nearly £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might assume that we would not have a return to that type of incident in the future and indeed, from the labour relations point of view, anything that can be done to avoid a terrible event like that recurring should be attempted.  However, even taking that into consideration, the Sugar Company had a very bad year. There were special circumstances militating against the company.  Reports that I have read in recent times concerning the company indicate that the amount of light at the end of the tunnel is not that great <Col N="1111" /> and that there may be a very difficult road ahead for the company.  I would like to go on record this evening as saying that anything that can be done to ensure that they are allowed to fulfil the purpose for which they were set up should certainly be done.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Joint Committee Report that it is envisaged that a sum of between £30 and £40 million would need to be spent in the next few years to modernise the company's sugar factories. Whether or not that money is available is another question.  It is imperative on behalf of the farmers of Ireland that this investment be made and that the necessary money be made available by the Minister.  It is in nobody's interest that the Sugar Company should be under-capitalised.  The sugar Company represents an important aspect of agriculture.  In nine or ten years time we would be sorry that we did not find this £30 or £40 million.  I thought the modernisation proposals might demand even more than that, but the people concerned are the experts in this line of business and if they say £40 million, I assume that is what they are looking for.</P>
    <P>I certainly hope that the Government of the day, no matter who is in office, will take particular note of this request, because in the years to come we might be very sorry if we allowed this call to go unheeded.  We might find ourselves unable to have factories on a basis that they would be competitive with factories in Europe.  Those are considerations that we have to worry about.</P>
    <P>Allied to the general overall problems of the company I see in the Joint Committee report that there is a proposal that in order further to cut the losses of the company, a very close look be taken at the operations in Tuam.  This is not the first time Tuam has been put on the chopping block and I dare say it may not be the last.  It is not in the interest of anybody, the Sugar Company, farmers or the general workers that the factory in Tuam should fade out of existence.  There is a bona fide case for the sugar factory at Tuam.  In the next few moments I will go <Col N="1112" /> through some of the reasons why I think so.</P>
    <P>First, I think so because of the social and regional development responsibilities that the Sugar Company have always shown.  I personally regard the Sugar Company as being on the side of the small man.  Over the years it has shown a very healthy respect for the problems of the small farmers of Ireland.  It is significant that the factory was sited in Tuam originally.  It is also important to say that from a financial and economic point of view and from a social point of view, that factory has done trojan things for the western region.</P>
    <P>There is a very fine, skilled staff in the Tuam factory area.  Their skills are on a par with anything that is available in any of the other three factories.  The production and work rate of the part-time or campaign workers are as good as you will find anywhere.  The factory has been almost totally without strikes of any description.</P>
    <P>The big problem is: how do we answer the critics?  The beet acreage in the west is dropping and I am the first to accept that that is so but it is important for the analysts to go back to their textbooks again.  It has been proved that in 1979 farmers who grew beet in areas other than the Tuam factory area were able to sell 15½ tons of washed beet per acre. Unfortunately, the farmers in my area supplying the Tuam sugar factory were able to manage only 12 tons on average. Everybody must recognise that much of the land in the west obviously is not as good as in the other areas of the country where beet is normally grown.  That does not mean to say that it is not a good crop and an important crop to a western farmer.</P>
    <P>There are certain important technical advances on the way in regard to sugar beet production.  I believe that Galway, Mayo or Roscommon farmers will be as quick as the next to catch on to those improvements if it is in their own interest. Basically a farmer on a normal type of land in the west can expect to receive £90 less for his acre of beet than his counterpart anywhere else in the country.  The question is asked: why are not more farmers <Col N="1113" /> in the west growing beet?  It has always been a recognised fact in farming that if a man is paid sufficiently for a certain line of farming that is the line he will be in.</P>
    <P>There are other factors that I have not time to go through, factors like the small, fragmented farm, the lack of machinery and so on.  The situation is changing dramatically.  Some of the technology that is being used in other areas will spread very quickly to the small farming areas.  There is an important part for sugar beet production in crop rotation in western agriculture.  If the Sugar Company and the Government of the day are interested in retaining a factory of the type that is in Tuam, there are a number of points that they will have to look into very closely.</P>
    <P>Tuam is not the only place in the Sugar Company's overall operations that is losing money.  The reports that I have seen would suggest that.  It is true that there seems to be some panic at this stage that, if the Sugar Company is to survive, Tuam will have to be cut off.  There is no way that either the farmers or the factory workers or the people generally of the west, including the people of Tuam, can accept that, because for a lot of reasons it would be a retrograde step.  If you take the average cost to the IDA of providing one new job in industry at the moment, you will see that the proposal that I am making this evening to keep 530 people at their work is only a flea bite in comparison with what it would cost the IDA to bring in a new Japanese factory or something like that.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other reasons why Tuam should be helped.  Most farmers throughout the country will say that the campaigns are too long.  Tuam came in very handy on a number of occasions: the surplus or excess beet from the other factory areas could be diverted to Tuam and you could have a reasonable compaign suitable to everybody.  In recent times, were it not for the £800,000 that the previous Administration put into the factory in Tuam we would now find ourselves with a factory that might not be able to keep going at all.  I do not like to hear of the idea of closing, much less <Col N="1114" /> deciding at company level not to put any more funds for modernisation into Tuam.</P>
    <P>In order to keep the factory in Tuam as viable as possible it is necessary to pay a direct subsidy to a farmer on a production basis.  I am not at all advocating that a man should be getting money just because he grows beet of one description or another.  I am talking about a production bonus for beet delivered within the Tuam factory area.  It is the answer to a great extent to the critics of the so-called farmers' dole.  Some people have been shouting for years that it should be connected to some type of production bonus. I am suggesting that there is an ideal opportunity to bridge the gap between the average grower in Galway in the disadvantaged areas and the average grower in Tipperary or Cork.</P>
    <P>There are many other reasons why the Tuam factory should be retained.  The future of the potato co-op is interlinked with the beet factory in Tuam.  There has been an exchange of staff and it is very important that both should be retained.</P>
    <P>Finally, and most important of all, there are 530 people in full-time employment.  We have them and they are trained.  We can increase production by the very simple method of direct production subsidy.  Certainly with all the talk about EEC aid to disadvantaged areas, now is the time for people in authority to show that they really care for the people in those areas.</P>
    <P>I am making a special plea to the House that there should be no talk whatever about closing the factory at Tuam because to close that factory would be a retrograde step and it would take the IDA several years to have a replacement in that area, if in fact they could do it at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the members of the Joint Committee for the work they have put into the preparation of this comprehensive report on the Sugar Company.  The report itself, together with the minutes of evidence, clearly indicate the sustained efforts made by the committee to examine the role of the company, to lay bare its weaknesses and to suggest <Col N="1115" /> remedies where appropriate.  The minutes of evidence, in particular, demonstrate the depth of detail which the committee was prepared to grapple with so that the full picture of the company would be recorded.  The committee even went to visit the company's premises at Carlow to make sure that they acquired first-hand experience of what they were examining.</P>
      <P>As we know, the company no longer deals exclusively with the manufacture and sale of sugar, but also engages in extensive food processing operations, the manufacture of agricultural machinery and other ancillary enterprises.  Each of these areas has been covered in the report which contains a wealth of information, is a model of clarity and will be of great assistance to me and to the officers of my Department in dealing with the policy and activities of the company, responsibility for which was comparatively recently assigned to me.  Up to February 1980, as the House knows, statutory responsibility for the company was vested in the Minister for Finance.  That Minister remains the principal shareholder, holding £6.5 million of the issued share capital of £7 million.</P>
      <P>I understand that this is the first occasion on which the Members of the Seanad have had an opportunity to debate a report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  For my part I welcome the report as a constructive document and look forward to hearing the views of this House on it.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the more salient matters arising from the report I think it well to recall briefly some of the relevant background to the company's activities, with a view to putting its present situation into better perspective.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Company was set up in 1933 to provide an additional source of revenue for Irish farmers and to improve the national balance of payments by reducing or eliminating sugar imports.  The four sugar factories which we still have were established in those early years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we joined the EEC the sugar industry operated within a protected home market which safeguarded the Irish manufacturers of goods containing sugar <Col N="1116" /> for domestic consumption.  At that time world sugar prices were generally low and such manufacturers, using home produced beet sugar were finding it impossible to sell their products on export markets in competition with products incorporating sugar at world prices.  To help these manufacturers stay in business the Irish Sugar Company committed itself to importing substantial quantities of raw cane sugar for sale, after refining, to the sugar goods sector, for incorporation in products for export.</P>
    <P>During the ten years prior to our accession to the Community these sugar imports averaged 42,000 tonnes a year. As a result, because of the necessity for the imports, and the low prices generally prevailing for sugar on world markets limitations had to be imposed on the production of the more expensive beet sugar. The area under beet was, accordingly, limited to around 69,000 acres a year, although demand by growers for beet quotas was often in excess of that figure.</P>
    <P>These limitations on beet acreage and the retention of four production units to process this, acted as a severe constraint on the development potential of the industry.  Such capital as was available was invested in the establishment and development of food processing.  Consequently, on entry to the Community in 1973 the Irish sugar industry was underdeveloped, much of its equipment being old and inefficient.</P>
    <P>The advent of EEC membership and the integration of the industry into the common organisation of the market for sugar changed the situation, however, and provided the industry with the desired scope for development.  Among other advantages the Community pricing system for sugar enabled the use of home grown beet sugar in processed products for export.  An investment and modernisation programme was, therefore, commenced.  As the joint committee have pointed out the company regards this investment programme as essential to the survival of the sugar industry; efficiency in production is no less vital in this industry than it is in any other.  I shall return to the company's investment programme.  In the meantime I should like <Col N="1117" /> to offer some comments on the importance of CSET in the national context.</P>
    <P>With an annual turnover last year of £140 million the company is one of the top 20 Irish companies and employs about 3,600 people.  It is the second largest enterprise in the Irish food industry. Apart from those directly employed there is vital ancillary employment on the farm, in the cultivation and harvesting of the crop.  In addition, there is substantial employment in providing necessary inputs for the crop &mdash; fertilisers, seed, machinery, ground limestone and so on. In the haulage area employment on road and rail transport is involved.  Up to 16,000 people are employed in the sugar using industry which is serviced with supplies of sugar from the company.</P>
    <P>Another very important aspect of the Irish Sugar Company's role in the economy is that it is a rurally based industry. With its sugar factories in Carlow, Thurles, Mallow and Tuam and with its other activities in various corners of the country, the company spreads widely its economic advantage.  I would like at this stage to refer to the point made by Senator Connaghton in relation to the Tuam factory and to state quite clearly that there are no proposals before me regarding the closure of the Tuam factory.  Not only does the commercial life of a town benefit greatly from the presence of a sugar company operation but so, too, does the social environment.  Departure of young people to the major cities is greatly stemmed as service industries also grow up in the town, creating employment in all walks of life.</P>
    <P>Last year there were approximately 8,000 farmers growing beet under contract for the company; the importance of the industry to these farmers is very great indeed.  For example, close on £40 million was paid to growers which represents a sizeable contribution to farm incomes generally.  At present the company is issuing new beet contracts for 1981-82 and every encouragement is being given to new growers to undertake beet production.  At a time when many aspects of farming are experiencing difficulties of one sort or another, the importance to the Irish farmer of a guaranteed market <Col N="1118" /> and a comparatively favourable price for his produce cannot be overestimated.  As recent statistics published by An Foras Talúntais show, beet is still the most lucrative of farm enterprises.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the importance of the industry in terms of employment created, and in terms of the benefits to the farmers, the very existence of the industry ensures not only that we are self-sufficient in sugar but that we can be net exporters also.  This helps our balance of payments.  The approximate value of our sugar exports for 1979-80 was £17 million.  Domestically we consume in the region of 150,000 tonnes of sugar annually.  If this sugar had to be imported the adverse effect on our balance of payments would be close on £60 million.</P>
    <P>Any discussion of the Irish Sugar Company should take place, therefore, against the background of the definite importance of the industry to Ireland, its economy and its people.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the impetus which our joining the EEC gave to the industry.  One of the matters referred to in the report is the fact that proposed changes in the EEC sugar regime would, if implemented, adversely affect the company's operations.  The background to this is that last year the EEC Commission proposed the introduction of a regime which was essentially aimed at cutting back production in the Community.  The Commission advocated this because Community consumption had stabilised and the cost of disposing of surplus requirements on a depressed world market was proving to be very costly on the EECs financial resources.  As far as Ireland was concerned the measures proposed envisaged a substantial reduction in our so-called &lsquo;A&rsquo;, or basic sugar quota from 182,000 tonnes to 164,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The direct implications of the proposals were of extreme gravity for the industry in Ireland.  It was, therefore, incumbent on me to present the Irish case in Brussels and to point out the disastrous consequences such proposals would have for our industry.  I am glad to say that eventually the Commission withdrew their proposal and presented an alternative which at least ensures us of the retention <Col N="1119" /> of our basic quota and thus provides an opportunity for the industry to develop.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the production levy to which Senator Hillery referred is a maximum levy and not a fixed amount. None of it need be charged unless the Community incurs losses on its sugar operations.  In fact over the past year or so sugar prices on world markets have been high and no losses were incurred on surpluses.  Naturally I would have preferred to have no levy at all on &lsquo;A&rsquo; sugar. However, it is not possible to argue plausibly in favour of one approach to sugar and in favour of a conflicting approach to milk.  If the levy is at the maximum it will represent about £1 million but the price increase already put forward by the Commission represents a gain of close on £5 million for the industry.  I have already said I will press for an increase on this figure of £5 million.</P>
    <P>When the Council of Ministers are discussing sugar quotas, past production performance is a vital consideration.  I was very disappointed, therefore, at the decline in our production from the campaign recently ended.  I realise, of course, that the weather in 1980 was not particularly favourable to growth and that harvesting conditions were also difficult.  But these factors only partly explain the decline in our sugar outturn.  The acreage of sugar beet last year was almost 6,000 down on that of the previous year. Obviously acreage is a critical factor in determining total production and any significant fall in acreage is greatly to be regretted.</P>
    <P>Apart from its effects on our sugar quotas such a fall clearly has implications for the profitability of the Sugar Company, not alone in relation to the domestic market but also in relation to exports, especially at a time when world market prices are higher than those obtaining in the Community.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will, therefore, I hope forgive me if I take this opportunity to address myself, through them, to beet growers.  Acreage of beet is, of course, a matter in which growers themselves can exert a real influence.  I realise <Col N="1120" /> of course that costs of production have gone up but, notwithstanding that, beet growing continues to be most attractive for producers.  According to the findings of an Agricultural Research Institute research team beet production gave the best return of all farm enterprises in 1980 and it is expected to head the list in the current year also.</P>
    <P>In addition to the advantages of beet as a cash crop there is the consideration that beet is ideal for a tillage set-up where, in rotation, the crop cleans up the land after cereals.  Beet has none of the marketing problems and risks associated with some other crops and, moreover, the pulp provides farmers with a valuable and economical livestock food.</P>
    <P>I would regard farmers as partners with the Sugar Company when it comes to ensuring the survival of the beet sugar industry.  We are now at a stage where the company's profitability will be seriously threatened &mdash; perhaps irreversibly &mdash; unless its production targets are achieved.</P>
    <P>For the coming season the company is making a new drive to expand the acreage of beet and has recently agreed with the Beet and Vegetable Growers Association on the prices to be paid.  It is anxious to have at least 90,000 acres grown and will not be limiting its offers of contracts to existing growers.  I would urge all concerned to co-operate fully with the company in their drive to ensure the security of the sugar industry and its thousands of jobs for the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the careful consideration given by the committee to the company's food division &mdash; Erin Foods &mdash; and I note the comments and recommendations made.  1980 was a particularly unfortunate year for this division as it suffered from much publicised irregularities.  The total cost of these to the company is shown in the recently published accounts at about £1.8 million arising mainly from stocks of goods which as yet remain unsold.  This is a very large sum and Garda investigations into the irregularities are continuing.  I am assured by the company that every effort is being made to prevent a recurrence of any similar <Col N="1121" /> incidents by improving procedures, systems and controls.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, Erin Foods has been having more widespread and more deeply rooted problems over the years. The company has made these known to the committee.  One of these problems &mdash; indeed the major one &mdash; is its overdependence upon the production of industrial dehydrates.  The dehydrate market is currently suffering from a severe downturn not only in Ireland but in the EEC as a whole.  The diminishing market is also subject to strong competition from non-EEC low cost producers. It is in such a context that the company has had to implement certain rationalisation measures within its food sector in order to safeguard the company as a whole.  The recent decisions taken to cease its Carlow Erin Foods operation and to terminate its financial involvement with the Fastnet Co-operative Society represent attempts by the company to secure a commercially viable food division.  These measures were as regrettable as they were inevitable.  The sugar division cannot, as it did in the past, bear the losses of the food division.  The recently published annual accounts of the company, which show a trading loss for the group of over £8 million, highlight only too dramatically this very point.</P>
    <P>However the company, in keeping with its traditional social commitment, is at present making every possible effort to limit the adverse effects of such closures on the communities concerned.  In conjunction with the IDA it is attempting to provide alternative productive employment in the areas directly affected by the closures.  As I have said, I regret that the need for the company to cease these food operations was necessary but I am confident that, given the priority which the IDA are according the matter of replacement industries and given the genuine concern of the company itself to absorb staff by transfer to other parts of the company where possible, the adverse effects of what are necessary measures of rationalisation will be the minimum possible.</P>
    <P>In the case of growers who have regularly grown vegetables in the areas and <Col N="1122" /> who have committed significant expenditure to the production of these, the company assures me that efforts will be made, where appropriate, to offer beet contracts <i>in lieu.</i> Where this is not feasible alternative special arrangements will be considered.</P>
    <P>The future of the food industry as a whole is at present under detailed examination by the Horticultural Development Group which I have set up under the aegis of my Department and I will ensure that the questions raised and the recommendations made will be given detailed examination.</P>
    <P>Apart from the two aspects of the company's activities to which I have broadly referred, namely, sugar and food, the committee deal with many other matters in their report.  While all of these are important and are at present being considered in my Department there is one which is, perhaps, of more importance than any other.  That is the present serious strain on the company's finances.</P>
    <P>I have attempted in my earlier remarks to indicate one of the underlying causes for this, namely, the lack of investment over the years on the sugar side which has resulted in the company having now to borrow heavily for investment purposes at a time when interest rates are very high and when the general level of activity in certain of the company's areas of operation is not very buoyant.  The existence of high interest rates has added to the company's financial burden in regard to its working capital also since at periods of the year it has to carry very sizeable stocks of sugar.</P>
    <P>The question of an immediate equity injection of £25 million is referred to, as well as further injections to help fund the investment programme over the next few years.  Coupled with this reference is a recognition that opportunities for innovation may exist in financing the company's development.  One of the suggestions made, for example in paragraph 31, is that the question of widening the ownership base and the provision of funds from suppliers' resources should be examined.</P>
    <P>The report concludes with the observation that the company faces difficult <Col N="1123" /> decisions in a number of areas in its attempt to restore profitability and to correct the imbalance on its capital structure; and it suggests a number of areas where Government action and assistance are required.  It indicates also that the company will need the full co-operation of all concerned if it is to continue in its long-standing development role in key areas of the Irish agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>In this regard I can say that subject to the company coming forward with a suitable programme for restoring full viability the Government will not be found wanting.  I have already initiated a detailed examination within my Department of the committee's report.  In so far as the immediate major problem is concerned, namely, that of the company's financial situation, consultations between the company and my Department and the Department of Finance are already in progress.</P>
    <P>Although the problems facing the company are by no means minor ones the report rightly draws attention to a number of favourable aspects in tackling them.  These include the company's management expertise and physical infrastructure, its strong position on the home market, its capacity for applied research and development work in all of its main areas of activity, its background of good relations with the agricultural community and its tradition of good industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want again to thank the joint committee for providing me with the opportunity to take part in this debate and to have made available to me the views of this House on what the committee described as one of the major industrial enterprises in the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad to have the opportunity to debate this report coming from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  It is a most important document because it deals with one of our major State enterprises which over the past 50 years, has achieved a turnover of over £140 million and provided secure employment for almost 4,000 people. When one adds ancillaries such as road <Col N="1124" /> haulage and so on, one is talking of about 21,000 or 22,000 people who are either directly or indirectly gaining a living through this company.  The good thing about this industry is that it is giving employment not just in one particular area but is spread around the country and the value to the economy is phenomenal.</P>
      <P>It is, as the report states, one of the major industrial firms in the economy.  It has fulfilled a very long-standing development role in key areas of the economy particularly in the agricultural and food processing industries.  The Sugar Company contributes in a most significant way to our economic welfare and this can be seen from the recent annual report which reveals that the turnover of £140 million is in fact making the largest single contribution in the food circle.  When we see that the export sales amounted to £30 million, that wages and salaries reached £23 million and that payments to beet and vegetable growers were more than £36 million we must immediately understand the very substantial value to the economy and the very major role that this company plays in the whole area of the economic life of the country.  It is a lasting contribution and not just something that has been going on for a few years, for example, where one might put a lot of money into a company in the private sector which might go out of business in a short time and one would have to start thinking of putting something else there to replace it.  The Sugar Company has been very consistent over the past 50 years and this has been of great value to us in the Labour Party because we are great advocates of State enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the report of the Joint Committee and the company's report we have to admit that some serious problems are revealed.  We also have to take cognisance of the part that the company have played over the past 50 years and the importance of that role not only to the economic benefit of the country but also to the social benefits that have come through the actual inflow of money generated throughout the economy.  The problems are there and they have to be faced up to.  We in the Labour Party are realistic and we want to face up to them. <Col N="1125" /> But we also recognise that the basis of the policy and the message going out from this House must be positive.  The best way we can do that is to look at the statement of the Chairman of the Company.  He states that the industry is basic and vital to our country and he affirms his faith in the enterprise and its future and obviously we can glean from the Minister's speech that he in fact has the same faith in the company that the chairman has.  Whether he is prepared to walk down the same road as the chairman is another matter.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about a company who make a balance of payments contribution of at least £75 million annually and who are the largest and highest quality provider in Europe of a whole range of processed foodstuffs.  To face up to the reality of the report and to face up to the issues that are raised in the report it is absolutely vital that we should set down the things that have to be faced up to.  In this respect I would like to make four points.</P>
    <P>First of all, we must support the committee's call for an immediate injection of £25 million in capital and for further capital investment in line with the company's own internal plans.  The present situation in which the State's investment is only £6.5 million in a company with assets of £50 million is in fact absurd.  For example last year the amount of interest on borrowing was £8 million.  Much of that was used to fund necessary fixed capital investment.  The State must look at this, it must have a look at the committee's report and it must be prepared to support the company by giving it the injection of £25 million and it must also have regard to the fact that the small State investment of £6.5 million is an absurdity.  This is particularly so when one takes account of the £800 million being invested in the IDA &mdash; for whom I have great respect &mdash; and where there is no real evidence that the IDA are not working well.  However, there is evidence that they do not always work well.  Here we have proposals and policies set out in the committee's report and in fact all the signs are that if an injection of £25 million <Col N="1126" /> is made instantly the future of this company will look well.</P>
    <P>Secondly, all efforts must be made to secure the future of the basic sugar industry.  We feel that the company should be supported in the drawing up and implementation of a development plan which will lead to the economic production of our full sugar requirements and of sugar for export to available markets.  This plan, we believe, should be adequately funded and fully backed.  We took exception to the imposition of the EEC levy on Irish sugar output.  The Minister has made some points in his speech about this.  We still believe that the levy should not have been accepted by the Minister in the light of the unjustified burden it placed on the industry as a whole and the side-effects that it was liable to have on employment.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the importance of the food sector must be underlined.  While restructuring is necessary, Erin Foods must be enlarged to enable them to grow in suitable market areas.  They must be allowed to go ahead with technological and product development and to operate effectively in combating the take-over of our food industry by the multi-nationals. The take-over by the multi-nationals is not just a &ldquo;Reds under the bed&rdquo; scare, saying that the capitalists are going to take-over; it is happening all over the world on a regular basis.  We in the Labour Party, make no apologies for giving the State-sponsored and semi-State bodies all the protection that is necessary, particularly where, if there is a slide in any direction, they could well end up under foreign domination and control. When this happens it usually puts an end to the whole question of public employment scrutiny and we would not be, as we are today, debating a report on a State-sponsored body if that scrutiny and control were to be removed by multi-nationals getting in by the side door taking over the profitable side and leaving the other side to the company itself to run on a State basis, as is happening in other areas.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to allow this basic industry to fall into foreign hands, but if <Col N="1127" /> we panic, or if we are too sparing, there is great likelihood that we might, through agitation or pressure from outside sources and so on, find ourselves heading in that direction.  It is our job in this House to see that this does not happen and we offer our support &mdash; in this direction anyway &mdash; to the company.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the general strategy that was outlined in the committee's report should be endorsed, not in every detail but in terms of its insistence on planning and on prudent development of this great national industry.  We should pay attention to the Committee's insistence on planning.  We are not the best in the world when it comes to the question of accepting the concept of planning.  For some reason or another we associate or identify planning with the Eastern bloc countries.</P>

      <P>Many of the problems experienced by the Sugar Company are shared by all Irish enterprises.  Many of the problems are exacerbated by the total failure of the Government's agricultural policy which has led to a collapse in the farm input sector.  They can be solved if the policy is changed and redirected positively and if the company are encouraged and supported in their own development planning.  A company who engage in this wide spectrum of services and industry and so on should get the support we can give them, not only by the injection of £25 million but by paying attention to their insistence on planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report in which are some statements which show the achievements of the Irish Sugar Company.  From it I gather that Ireland has been essentially self-sufficient in sugar during the past 40 years through the efforts of the Sugar Company; and also that their industrial relations have been very good.  For 32 years there has not been any industrial relations trouble.  I note that the company has reported profits in all but three years since it was established in 1933.  These <Col N="1128" /> are solid achievements by the company. I took from the report that there was a debate concerning the future objectives of the company as between social and commercial roles and the question as to whether restoring the company to profitability would conflict with other objectives of the company.  There was a regional development objective for the Sugar Company which influenced the siting of the four factories.  I would like to stress the social and regional objectives because they are very important in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the question of quotas, I would like to commend the Minister for Agriculture for the very strong case he made in Brussels for retaining our basic quotas.  It is interesting to note that in the last five years the Sugar Company has failed to produce enough sugar to fulfil the basic quota of 182,000 tons. What amazed me in the report was that there was a recommendation to close the Tuam sugar factory when we have not even reached our quota with the four factories.  It reminds me of the type of argument that CIE have when they say they will close down such and such a railway line and save money while their subsidy seems to be increasing every year.  However, I am glad the Minister has said that there are no proposals before him as regards the closure of the Tuam sugar factory.</P>
      <P>The question of the competitiveness of beet <i>vis-à-vis</i> other farm enterprises was raised in the report.  It is true that the popularity of beet will depend on the attractiveness of tillage in general.  The price is very important for the grower, and technological developments will undoubtedly influence the acreage of beet.  The level of input is high in growing beet and this increases the risk which the grower takes.  One interesting item in the report is the suggestion of making attractive premiums to growers who would be willing to commit themselves to the crop for a number of years.  I hope that the response to this will mean increased acreage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of efficiency in the Irish sugar industry was mentioned and the fact that we lag considerably behind our <Col N="1129" /> competitors in Europe.  Two reasons given were our out-dated equipment and the small size of our plant.  For that reason I welcome, as the other speakers have done, the Oireachtas Joint Committee agreement to invest £25 million immediately.  Again, I will have to be critical, because Tuam is singled out as having problems because of its small size.  All our factories are small compared with sugar factories in other European countries.  We should realise we are talking about the Irish sugar industry.  The first point I would make is that most of the farms in the west are small farms.  Eighty per cent of farms in County Galway are under 50 acres.  If we are to increase our acreage it is from these small farms that the extra beet will have to come.  For example, in the 1975-76 campaign 3,341 acres of beet were grown in the west of Ireland, and in 1980-81 the acreage was 2,431 and the number of growers decreased also.  Factors mentioned by Senator Connaughton cause problems in the west of Ireland.  Climate is one.  Wet springs and wet autumns bring problems in sowing and harvesting.  Numbers are decreasing also in areas east of the Shannon where traditionally beet is grown for the Tuam factory.</P>
    <P>I have to agree with the speakers who mentioned the yield per acre in the west of Ireland compared with the rest of the country.  There was a difference of three and-a-half tons per acre in the 1979 campaign and that means a difference of £90 per acre in what the grower gets for the beet.  The difference should be made up to a farmer who sees people in other parts of the country getting much more for their beet.  It is small farms who will have to produce the extra beet.  There are problems with breakdowns in machinery which I hope can be overcome.  Farmers overcame them in the past because of their determination.  If farmers from the south, east or any part of Ireland would come into the west to grow beet I do not think they would do any better than the farmers there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative of the Sugar Company in providing a land bank for tillage.  I understand that this has now reached over 1,000 acres and 500 acres <Col N="1130" /> will be devoted to sugar beet in the coming season.  Considerable publicity should be given to this fact.  In the past farmers have said that they could not get land, and I hope that young farmers in particular will have access to this land pool. Macra na Feirme have been involved in this scheme which was promoted by young farmers who up to now had not been able to grow beet on their own land, and Macra na Feirme are very strong in County Galway.  Their traditions go back as far as sugar beet growing, and I hope that they will be successful regarding this scheme to which they certainly have given enthusiastic support and a good response.</P>
    <P>Other young farmers have financial rather than land problems and I hope that the Sugar Company can help them. We all hope that these &ldquo;steps&rdquo; will result in increased acreage of beet, particularly in the province of Connacht.  Many farmers in Connacht do not grow beet at all. This problem can be overcome by publicity regarding the land bank and the advisory service.  There are signs that acreage will increase in the coming season.</P>
    <P>It is important for the west of Ireland that an agreement be concluded with CIE to continue the rail transport of sugar beet.  The report stated that CIE have been reluctant to bring sugar beet to Tuam.  It is very important to have an agreement with CIE so that beet can be transported from east of the Shannon to the Tuam factory.</P>
    <P>A number of incentives can be given for beet production.  Beet machinery might be included for grants under the group fodder scheme.  I would like the Minister to take a note of that because beet produces fodder and that is one incentive that farmers would respond to. The smaller farmers in the west of Ireland should be given every incentive to grow beet because many of them work as seasonal workers in the factories.  This provides a supplementary income, which helps to maintain them on the land.  It is in the interest of the west of Ireland that beet growing would continue.  We were very glad of the western drainage programme which has succeeded in getting many acres of land drained in the west of <Col N="1131" /> Ireland.  It made a lot of land suitable for growing beet.  I hope the western development programme which will soon be commencing will add to that acreage.  I might mention that, five miles from Tuam, the river Nanny remains undrained and thousands of acres are flooded.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there are at a maximum 627 people employed in Tuam, closure of the Tuam factory would send a shudder through the whole of County Galway.  The question has to be asked as to where the alternative employment will come for these people.  The IDA could not move in there until the factory closed and a lot of skilled people like plumbers, fitters and electricians would be unemployed and there is a danger of the skills being lost to the area.  Social welfare would have to be paid to these people. The report mentions that in the event of the Tuam factory closing the western growers would get a transport subsidy to bring their beet to one of the remaining factories.  If that happens it will mean that beet will not be grown in the West of Ireland.  I hope that in the coming campaign there will be improvement in procedures as regards sampling and sugar determination so that the technical quality of individual consignments of beet will be better assessed.  I would hope also that from now on all statements on beet growing would be encouraging.  We have had a lot of gloom and doom and a defeatist attitude particularly as regards the Tuam factory.  There have been many difficulties in the Tuam area in the past.  Since the thirties there have been many times when the Tuam factory could have closed down but it weathered the storm and I believe it will do so again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks be to God for the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  Without it, I wonder how long the situation in the Sugar Company could have continued in the direction in which it is going before the question became public and we had the opportunity to express our views on the very serious state in which the Sugar Company find themselves at the moment.  I compliment <Col N="1132" /> the Joint Committee on the excellence of their report.  It is a marvellous report and for people who are not expert in the technical aspects of the industry it is certainly easy to follow.  The financial and economic aspects are made clear and the report highlights the remarkably difficult future the industry is facing.</P>
      <P>There are lessons to be learned obviously, not just about the sugar industry but about the whole system in which our semi-State industries are being run, in that they can find themselves in such serious financial straits and going in such seriously wrong directions before the political publicity that is needed sometimes to correct the course is brought to bear upon them.  The report says on page 5 paragraph 8:</P>
      <P>There is a clear need to think hard about the basic goals of the Company. Given its present precarious financial position, it is essential that the Company has a mandate setting out its future role and responsibilities unambiguously so that the management can tackle the Company's difficulties in a realistic fashion.</P>
      <P>If that statement had been made two, three, four or five years ago something might have been done before now that would have improved the position that the Sugar Company unfortunately had cause to report the other day.  The really sad thing about it is that the losses the Sugar Company announced the other day are not the hallmark of an improvident company because, as many speakers have pointed out they are a company with a superb record.  They have had 47 years of existence.  Their profits are described as unspectacular but consistent nevertheless, by the report, and for every year except five in their history, as Senator Hillery has pointed out, they have had superb industrial relations.  As Senator Connaughton has pointed out they have had and have superb relations with all types of farmers.  They have played a very important role in regional development. They pioneered industrial development on a regional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All in all, here we are faced with a problem which is met by perhaps the most successful semi-State body or <Col N="1133" /> semi-State company that we have, one that stood the test of time, that helped this country in so many ways and is now almost on the brink of falling altogether because &mdash; maybe I am being simplistic &mdash; the financial structure was not examined and was not, perhaps, attended to a few years ago.  Having said that, I want to make it quite clear that I am far more optimistic about the future of the sugar company than the Minister for Agriculture appears to be from the speech he has made this evening.  I will say more about that in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>The book of evidence of witnesses which has been published and accompanies the report is a very useful document. One gleans far more interesting information from it, certainly in relation to some of the remarks made.</P>
    <P>On page 3 of the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, 14 May 1980, Mr. Sheehy, in answer to a question put by Deputy Lawlor makes the statement:</P>
    <P>On a national basis, if a sugar industry were not there at the moment, somebody would have to think of putting one there.</P>
    <P>That is the basis upon which we should commence our consideration of this report and this entire debate as to what is going to happen in the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are problems.  Any company relying on expensive capital, plant and equipment to manufacture their produce, whatever it might be, must at various stages in their history run into difficulties of modernising their plant. We are in an unfortunate position now in that some of it should have been done maybe ten or 15 years ago.  Now if we are to live at all in the competitive scene into which our entry to the European Economic Community has put us in relation to industry it is an absolute must that we modernise our plant.  If this industry is to continue to exist and to play the part it has played to date in this country, money must be provided.  I find it awful, depressing and frightening that the Minister could not make that simple statement. The Minister has suggested that he will consider the position in the future.  The overall loss was £9 million but a great <Col N="1134" /> proportion of that was due to the appalling interest repayments that the Sugar Company had to make because of their commitment to modernising plant.  I would have hoped that the Minister would have been more alive to the problem and more encouraging than he was here this evening.</P>
    <P>The company are under-capitalised. That is absolutely clear.  There are big problems to be faced, problems as to how the probable total of £75 million will be spent.  Is it going to be spent on one or two plants out of the four major ones?  Is Tuam going to close down?  Is Thurles going to close down?  I do not mind being parochial and saying that I do not want to see Thurles sugar factory close down any more than Senator Connaughton or Senator Kitt or anybody else from the west of Ireland wants to see Tuam sugar factory close down.  It is a great pity that the Minister did not have something to offer on this.  What will his approach be in dealing with this problem?  The report highlights questions: What is the purpose of the Sugar Company? Is their purpose that of commercial success?  If it is, then probably the answer is to close down all but one or maybe build a new one outside Dublin or in an area where most beet is grown and where production is best and to put all your £70 million or £100 million or whatever it will be in one plant.  Certainly you will make it a tremendous commercial success if you take that approach to it.</P>
    <P>However, there is another aspect to it, namely regional and social responsibility. The Sugar Company have pioneered the industrial development that we have seen in regions of Munster through the factories at Mallow and Thurles and in the west of Ireland through the establishment of the plant in Tuam.  We must make a decision on that.  That is not something that can await some further report or proposal.  It is astonishing that in this day and age this question has not already been considered and that the powers that be, namely, the Minister, who is responsible no matter how he might try to fob off his responsibility on to the board of the Sugar Company, has not made a decision before now.  I am disgusted and <Col N="1135" /> distressed that the Minister has not indicated what his mind is on that subject.</P>
    <P>I regard the social aspect of the Sugar Company as important.  That is obvious, coming from Thurles as I do.  If we did not have in Thurles the sugar factory or if it closed down Thurles would be a ghost town.  Of that there is no doubt.  It is a town that has found it hard to attract real industry.  I make no bones about it, as long as I represent the views of people in that region, of course I want to see the sugar factory kept there and I will fight tooth and nail to stop anybody trying to take it from us.  I can understand Senator Connaughton and Senator Kitt taking similar views with regard to Tuam but a decision must be made.  The Minister must make his mind up very quickly as to what his intentions are in this respect. The Sugar Company cannot be blamed if they run certain plants at a loss.  I do not have figures in relation to Thurles.  In fact, I do not believe that Thurles is so badly off.  There is something that goes unexplained in the report but appears in appendix 4 to the report.  Everybody speaks here of Tuam; maybe the Joint Committee was well informed that people from the west of Ireland were concerned about the Tuam factory but, extraordinarily enough, in the years 1974-75 to 1978-79 there was an increase of employment in the four sugar factories.  Tuam had the smallest increase with 36.  There were 148 in Carlow and over 100 in Mallow and there was a drop of 154 persons employed in the Thurles plant.  Why did that happen?  Is it that Thurles is being downgraded?  The investment that is being made in Carlow and Mallow has not been made in Thurles.  I am concerned from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Obviously, anybody is concerned about his or her own area, but, on the general question, so far as the Sugar Company is concerned they must have their goal set out clearly.  They are not simply a commercial enterprise.  No semi-State organisation can be simply a commercial entity.  They are not there simply to make profit for the sake of making profit.  They are there to fulfil a <Col N="1136" /> function in the community and that is the function that we are here to consider today.  If the Minister is having any difficulty in deciding whether the Sugar Company should benefit from the <i>largesse</i> of the taxpayer and have injected into them any number of millions of pounds he should consider it on two bases.  First of all, if we are to accept that the Sugar Company have a social responsibility then they should be subsidised to the extent necessary to fulfil their social responsibilities if in fact they take a loss, in say, the Tuam factory to maintain that enterprise there.</P>
    <P>The decision is whether the Government are prepared to subsidise the Irish Sugar Company to that extent.  If there is a commercial operation in Tuam, Thurles or anywhere else, you are going to lose money there, but you have a responsibility because we ask you to run a factory there and if you are going to suffer a loss we are going to pay you for the loss.  As this report has already discussed, if you analyse the cost of putting men on the dole and of spending millions of pounds to bring in a foreign company that might not last too long and might cost the country an awful lot more money, it would be much cheaper to subsidise.  To accept that principle now is what is basic and fundamental to our consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>There is not one word in the Minister's speech to give one encouragement to believe that he is facing up to that reality. He is, he says, awaiting proposals from the sugar company itself.  He does not say and does not seem to acknowledge that he has responsibility in the matter.  The Minister has a very heavy responsibility, which is highlighted in the report.  The Minister for Agriculture, the report says, oversees the general policy of the company, is advised of major investment expenditures and is generally kept appraised of the progress of the company.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech one would believe that the first he heard about the problem of the sugar company was when he got this report.  I do not believe that.  I believe that the Minister for Agriculture, or his predecessor who <Col N="1137" /> was the Minister for Finance prior to that, has known of the difficulties in the sugar company for the past three or four years. He must have known and if he did not know the blame for that lies either with senior executives or with the board of the sugar company.  I have no reason to believe that that board have not discharged their responsibilities.  If they had failed to discharge their responsibilities in that respect, it would have emerged in this report.  It has not.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the Minister has known of the difficulties for as long as the sugar company were investing these millions and millions of pounds, namely, in the past two or three years.  He must have known.  He has a responsibility to know about it.  The Minister knew about the increase in interest rates.  The Minister also knew that this is a company that had a measly capital investment from the Government and was under-capitalised. I imagine this company was under-capitalised before these high interest rates occurred at all.  When the decision was made, as it had to be made, to invest this sort of money, that was the time when the money should have been provided by the State.  It is a pity that the money was not provided then.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister come in here and indicate to us that now he hears about this and that even at this moment he has not made up his mind about it?  He has read the report but he is awaiting further proposals.  Does he not recognise that he has a responsibility in this matter?  Is he perhaps pleased to let the matter lie until after an election takes place and then announce the closure of a couple of plants?  Senator Kitt said he was pleased to hear that the Minister did not intend to close down the Tuam sugar complex. That is not what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>I remind Senator Kitt that the Minister said that he has received no proposals himself that the plant in Tuam should be closed down.  I believe that the Minister knows that some proposal is being discussed.  I do not know what that proposal is.  The Minister should put before this House &mdash; he should have done it in his speech this evening &mdash; what his intentions are in relation to the Irish Sugar Company. <Col N="1138" />  I offer my suggestions to him.  This is an excellent company.  It has proved itself by its record.  Give it the money. We may have to put more money into one or two plants or into other plants but it has a tremendously important role to play in the whole area of community and regional development.  It would be a shame if we lost sight of that, even given the financial difficulties that are faced by this company.  What this report demands and what the sugar company need is a commitment by the Government to do something about their problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to be able to talk on this report which is very timely in relation to the working of the company.  It is a disturbing and thought-provoking report dealing with a company which is, as has been said, undercapitalised but which has a turnover of £140 million, directly employing 3,600 people.  We have heard of the problems that the industry has and whether they are based on the historical financial set up of the company, on bad management or other factors outside the company's control, we should have a look at the problems.  The sugar company was originally set up in 1933 for the manufacture of sugar and I think that we should take that as the base from which we argue or the base from which we look at the company.  Since 1933 there has been a diversification programme and it is because of that programme that was undertaken by the company that it now finds itself in difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company was eminently successful when it was manufacturing sugar.  The profits that were being made by the sugar company were very good by any standards.  They were very good employers, they were good to the farmers of the regions, and they were good to the infrastructure of the particular regions in which the factories had been set up.  The problem of the sugar company came about when they started to diversify into other areas of operation.  This is borne out by the figures which have been produced in this excellent report.  In this report we get the turnover breakdown of the various, aspects of the operations of the <Col N="1139" /> company.  We get the turnover of the sugar-making situation.  We get the turnover of the agricultural engineering operation and we get the turnover in the Erin Foods operation.  Unfortunately, when we come to the breakdown profit or loss we only get a general breakdown of profit and loss.  Therefore, it is not very easy for anybody to distinguish where the problems lie.</P>
    <P>However, it seems at present as if there is an immediate need for £25 million to put the capital structure of the company right and there is an immediate cash injection of £40 million needed to modernise the plant.  It is interesting to note that this is possibly the amount of money which was lost in the ancillary activities of the company for the past number of years.  It has been stated in the report that the losses in the food section and in the engineering section are understated because of the fact that the overheads and working capital are not written into the main company financial reports, whereas the ancillary companies are working on the trading profit and loss account only.  The needs of the sugar company itself are great.</P>
    <P>I do not think that £40 million will be enough to bring this particular enterprise up to modern standards.  £40 million is probably needed in Carlow alone to do this and when anybody visits the factory in Carlow he can see the run down state of the machinery.  I do not know how workers achieve their production levels in that factory.  It is stated in the report that CSET as a whole are only getting 60 to 70 per cent of the production levels that are being got in Britain at present. I have heard people say this is because of the low productivity level of the workers within the sugar company factories in Ireland.  I disagree totally.  There is no way that a man can produce if the machinery with which he tries to produce is 40 years old.  There will have to be a capital injection for equipment before the workers can produce.  They are producing to a very high level.  The situation is that the wages in the factory in 1978-79 were in the region of £20 million and this was about 15 per cent of the <Col N="1140" /> turnover of the factory whereas in 1940 it was about 17 per cent, and in 1945 about 16.8 per cent, so they are producing at a reasonable level given the machinery that they have to work with.</P>
    <P>It was very necessary for somebody to go into the food section because we are living in a country which is, possibly, the best producer of food products in the world.  There is a definite need to have these food products processed and put on the market in a way that the housewives of this country and other countries can buy.  The research and development which went into the Erin Foods section of this industry were not enough.  They came up with products which have proved to be unsaleable.  It was a terrible mistake to get involved with Heinz.  I do not see any advantage to the Irish economy or to CSET or Erin Foods in their marketing arrangements with Heinz.  We market for them in Ireland and they market for us abroad.  The market here is quite small to them but we needed them to push the products that we were producing.  They have not pushed Irish products as against Heinz products.  They pushed the products from the places where they are getting them more cheaply produced.  Executives were hived off from the Sugar Company into the ancillary end of their enterprises so that people could get promotion.  There were promotion blocks within the Irish Sugar Company so hiving them off as managing directors into this company or that company meant they were better paid and they are quite satisfied.  The average engineering business they went into was very limited.  They produced a very good beet harvesting machine of high quality and it is recognised world-wide as such. I feel they would have been much better off if they had got in touch with some manufacturer of a beet harvester or farm machinery and gone in on a joint venture basis with them.  I think there would be a much better marketing and sales arrangement for such products.</P>
    <P>Another area that they got into in the seventies was the manufacture of fertilisers at a time when the over-capacity in New Ross alone would have produced more than enough fertilisers for our <Col N="1141" /> whole needs.  Still, the Irish Sugar Company built a factory to produce fertiliser within 14 miles of the factory in New Ross.  It was lack of thinking to do something on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and it says in the report that it was Government intervention that stopped them from doing this, as if Government intervention was not a good thing at the time.  They have now gone in with the other fertiliser manufacturers.  On the basis of joint venture with them they are selling products that are manufactured by Irish companies.  That is a very good idea because it is giving the fertiliser manufacturing companies, such as Erin, a better chance of surviving in a very tough market.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sugar Company and their offshoots play a very important social role in the life of small towns around the country.  When you think of 3,600 people directly employed, of the people who grow, the people who transport, the people who maintain the transport, the shopkeepers, those who service the machines in the factories, and the many thousands of people outside the direct employment who are involved in the Irish Sugar Company, one begins to see why it is essential that this industry is maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not think it was a right decision by the Sugar Company to close the Erin Foods factory in Carlow.  There was a very high level of technical expertise in that factory.  There were very good people working on research and development there.  The big problem was, because they were part of a group, they were not standing on their own feet. Therefore their marketing and financial controls were not as they should be and this is borne out by the fact that there was a massive fraud within the company which is going to create further problems for them.</P>
    <P>If we are ever going to get a viable food processing industry it can be based on the expertise that is now within the Erin Foods division of CSET.  I sincerely hope that the IDA will fight very hard not just to put in another industry into the premises which are being vacated by Erin Foods but that they will put in industries which are closely allied to the agricultural industry and particularly closely allied to <Col N="1142" /> the food processing industry because if that food cannot be processed and sold we might as well build factories and import raw material such as steel and iron and so on and produce machines.  I do not think that is what we want or need. The Sugar Company played a major part in the industrial development of Ireland. I sincerely hope as a result of this report that in future, as an industry, it will be looked at much more carefully both from within and without.  I say from within because it is the first time I know of that a State-sponsored body has come under the scrutiny of this Chamber.  I sincerely hope it is not the last.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary that this industry should be protected.  It can be protected with the help that I know the Government will give.  I think that I counted the Minister's lack of responsibility 60 times in the speech made by the Senator from the opposite side.  He did not mention one aspect of the industry but he did criticise the Minister time and time again. He did not make one solitary conclusive argument about where the Sugar Company could be going.  If we are going to have a debate on the report from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, criticism is not needed in this or the other House.  We should be talking about the industry and airing our views. I hope that there will be the same airing of views on many other reports from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies because it is very necessary.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan is getting a little thin skinned but, nevertheless, I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture has now the responsibility for this semi-State organisation because, since 1933, they have been under the aegis of the Minister for Finance.  The Department of Finance see things in rounded figures and perhaps they do not get down to the grassroots.  I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on the 13th report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I hope that 13 is not an unlucky number.  The report itself is most interesting and I compliment the colleagues who serve on and put so much work into that committee.  Comhlucht <Col N="1143" /> Siúicre Éireann have a long, distinguished and successful history of operating in the agricultural sector. Personalities like Lieutenant-General Costello played a tremendous role in developing the Sugar Company.</P>
      <P>I live less than 20 miles from Carlow and 30 from Thurles, which Senator Molony was worried about, and indeed only about ten miles from Lisduff which is one of the company's own lime works which is on the blink at present.  The lime transport subsidy was removed over the last couple of years.  It is not attractive for farmers to use crushed limestone now.</P>
      <P>We must recognise &mdash; I hope the 3,600 employees of the group of companies agree with me &mdash; that the growers should be considered as close partners in this industry.  There is not sufficient emphasis on this close interdependence between the people actually working on the factory floor and the people who contract to supply either beet or vegetables to the companies.  This is very important.  That was brought home a little over a year ago when there were meetings on the international sugar agreement.  For the first time very many people in the industrial sectors saw that the common agricultural policy impinged on them and had relevance to them.  I hope that the Irish Sugar Company will continue to foster that idea.  In the midland counties where the Sugar Company have been so successful, where their efforts have meant such a lot to the ordinary living and working conditions of the people, it is good agricultural practice to have crop rotation.  The Minister has responsibility to see that the line of agricultural produce is maintained and that proper crop husbandry continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in the European Parliament, I travelled very frequently to various European cities with personnel from the Carlow agricultural machinery plant. They were servicing or selling machines even in Eastern Europe.  Their operation was eminently successful.  They were people who knew their business and in whom you would have confidence.  I have confidence in the Irish Sugar Company.  I see a future for them and that is why I think <Col N="1144" /> the entire operation must be supported. I am amazed at the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann over the years stuck with a long term policy for development and modernisation.  In 1980, it is not an excuse to say that the plant is run down, old, or not modern enough.  The plant should have been improved and modernised as time progressed.  This is a weakness in this country.  The disturbing thing is, that a decision was taken to close Erin Foods.  It is horrific to think that last year we imported £7 million worth of vegetables.  An ordinary chipper or a hotel will not take a bag of potatoes.  Potatoes have to be imported, frozen and chipped, either from Belgium, Cyprus or Israel. The Minister has responsibility, he also has an opportunity under Article 93 of the Rome Treaty to take measures if there is evidence that produce is being dumped.</P>
    <P>I see no evidence that the Department have even tried to slow down the importation of vegetables.  Distributors will not sell fruit to supermarkets unless they take vegetables as well.  At a time when farmers across the midlands are ploughing in vegetables and produce, Erin Foods are closing down for the lack of markets.  We cannot lose faith in an industry like that. The Department should not acquiesce in the closing of a plant like that.  There are 83 jobs involved in Carlow.  There are also a considerable number of growers. Senator Hillery paid tribute to the remarkable industrial relations of the company.  He said there was no strike for 30 years.  A strike occurred in Carlow last year in the middle of the beet harvest. That created a lot of bother and worry for growers.  I presume they were compensated.  This does not go far enough. The unfortunate thing about that is that one of the company's worker directors was out on the path.  We hoped when that legislation was going through, to see worker participation on the board.</P>
    <P>It is just not good enough to say we are going to close this company because it is non-viable and to hell with the workers. You can promise them an IDA factory but what can you promise the farmer who has, perhaps, invested in specialised machinery costing thousands of pounds, <Col N="1145" /> to grow and to harvest the crop?  It is not good enough to agree or to say that that entire industry should go to the wall, that we are able to import vegetables from Cyprus and Spain much more cheaply.  I do not accept that for a minute.  I think that this House would certainly be reneging on its responsibilities if it agreed to that.</P>
    <P>Market gardeners and vegetable growers throughout the country at present do not grade any of their top quality produce grade A.  It is all grade 2.  Ordinary shopkeepers or supermarket managers do not want to see them, because it is handier to get frozen or semi-frozen vegetables from the Continent or wherever they are imported from.  There is absolutely no excuse.  The housewife thinks everything is Irish if there is a &ldquo;G&rdquo; on it.  How do you get that &ldquo;G&rdquo; on to a carrot from Israel?  The country has gone crackers.  We must have a realistic approach.  If the machinery is run down, it must be modernised.  It must be brought up to standard and the entire company must be adequately capitalised.</P>
    <P>All enterprises, whether they are public, semi-State or private must be based on the old capitalistic notion that the element of a healthy profit is essential for safe, secure employment.</P>
    <P>Are the Government seriously supporting this industry?  If so, how can they reconcile that with the Minister's recent decision to agree to a new levy on the production of beet this year and a regulation where he zero rated the levies on milk and beef?  It is quite extraordinary that in the same place in the same week he agreed to a new levy on the beet crop, especially since the whole sugar industry is in difficulty at the moment.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Joint Committee on the preparation and the work they put into this report.  I hope that the examination they gave it will perhaps encourage the company to get out of their present difficulties and I hope that the Government will grasp the nettle firmly and will provide whatever capital is necessary to ensure the continuation of this rural-based industry which is very important to a quite large number of rural-based <Col N="1146" /> families, both people directly working on the land and people who are servicing the inputs in farming and also processing farm produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the first oil shock of 1973 all of Irish industry both public and private has had to cope with severe and deepening problems but these all pale into insignificance in comparision with the rates of inflation which we have to face today.  I want to get this debate into that perspective because one can dwell on the past to a great degree without getting very far.  The Sugar Company is an operation which is most akin to private enterprise and therefore I welcome this debate on its affairs because we must all face up to this fact of inflation and reducing income expectation if industrial progress is to proceed.</P>
      <P>There are two points in the report: one the Sugar Company complains about the slowness of the National Prices Commission.  Many other industries complain about this causing a downturn in profits because they do not give the permission soon enough.  I feel they have to do their job like everybody else, and try to keep the consumer index as low as possible.  It is a good thing that the National Prices Commission take such a strong view and require the executives of companies, both public and private, to justify their price increases and that one is committed in this way to try to control unnecessary inflation.  I hope that these reports will have the same effect in analysing the public enterprises and provoking some welcome reaction.</P>
      <P>The other point in the report is that I think it a bit unfair to compare profit margins with other large Irish public listed companies, due to the fact that profit margins are traditionally very low in the food industries.  For instance, in Britain they operate on high volume-low margin which makes them very competitive.  Therefore, it is unfair that the Sugar Company should be compared with other companies which do not operate on such low margins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also highlights the lack of corporate planning in assessing soon enough the necessity for re-investment to <Col N="1147" /> replace outdated plants.  Paragraph 6 on page 4 identifies objectives of the Sugar Company and it seems to me that the maintenance of its present sugar business and the restructuring of Erin Foods are looked upon as subsidiary objectives to creating ongoing growth and to maintaining employment.</P>
    <P>From a totally commercial point of view I would have thought that a company such as the sugar company which is facing a serious crisis in profitability which needs massive investment of capital to replace its assets and which must come to terms with the chronic loss-making operation in Erin Foods, should be thinking totally in terms of consolidation and of streamlining its present operation before considering any further growth and development.  With the experience I had in private enterprise in the Irish biscuit industry some years ago, this process of consolidation would, I reckon, given the size of the Irish Sugar Company operation, take at least three to five years and may mean significant loss of employment but could result in a much more efficient and profitable company.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan that traditionally the Sugar Company has made a lot of profit which was unfortunately reinvested in mainly unsuccessful trading diversification rather than put back into sugar manufacturing activity.  The lack of investment in sugar manufacturing is now catching up with the company and the successful completion of a major capital investment programme costing an estimated £40 million, together with an effective restructuring of Erin Foods poses a major challenge for any management group in the present economic environment.  Any view that such needs can be dealt with as routine while simultaneously growth and diversification should continue will involve the company and therefore the taxpayer in heavy loss and ultimately threaten the survival of the company.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the State needs the Irish Sugar Company.  It needs a local sugar manufacturing operation because of the strategic importance of sugar and the enormous added value <Col N="1148" /> to the Irish farmer and the community, as the company has proved in the last four decades.  I can vouch for the fact that the Sugar Company has for many years past been an efficient and helpful supplier to us and everyone else in the food industry.  The essential problem seems to be that they have been trading with outmoded assets which now have to be replaced at vastly higher costs, a problem which, quite frankly, we had to face up to ten years ago, which led to the complete modernisation and relocation of the whole Irish biscuit industry.</P>
    <P>Let no one under-estimate the toughness of the job.  In my opinion the essential concern should be that the Government and the company should see the task of updating the Sugar Company factories as a major priority.  I do not mean just that the investment required be made but that it be undertaken in such a way that the Sugar Company can achieve the same rate of productivity with the investment as is achieved by their European competitors.  It is reported that the British Sugar Company has double the output per person.  Unfortunately, the report casts some doubt on this possibility.  The company must resolve this problem if it is to become competitive in the future.</P>
    <P>The unprofitability of the food division could indirectly have been responsible for putting other Irish food manufacturers out of business because they could not compete with the State subsidisation of Erin Foods.  The story of the Sugar Company illustrates a general concern in the community that even if such divisions do make profits they are often overstated or if they make losses they are understated to the extent that they do not often include overhead and working capital charges borne by the State enterprise.  I, therefore, thoroughly agree with the Joint Committee recommendation that future annual accounts of the company should provide relevant information on profits and losses and rates of return on capital in each of the different activities. Such information is necessary to account properly for the management of its affairs and the use of Exchequer funds subscribed.</P>
    <P>Listening to this debate I think such <Col N="1149" /> criteria should be extended to all debates on budget estimates, in order to overcome this euphoria that seems to take place when we are debating State enterprises, euphoria aligned with politicians' loyalty to their constituents, which over-emphasises the general concern.  There are various commitments which I would like to see opened up a lot more in debates within the Seanad.  For instance, we have had reference to the closure of Tuam Factory, that it is inevitable.  Like everyone else, I have great sympathy for the employees of the Tuam factory and some way must be found to get alternative employment, but those who question the unpalatable decision to close it down must face up to the fact that unless the Irish Sugar Company does become competitive then many jobs may be lost in other Irish industries, due to the noncompetitive price of sugar.  That includes exporting of food products which have a sugar content.  The Joint Committee supports the company's view that an immediate injection of £25 million is a matter of urgency and I support this view provided attention is given to the reservations I have expressed and that realism prevails.  The Minister has expressed his consciousness that realism must prevail and I have every faith that provided the Sugar Company is given new terms of reference and given time to achieve them, then with the total commitment of management, it can succeed in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report of the Joint Committee.  I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the matter in this House.  Coming from the town of Carlow, in which I live under the shadow of the sugar factory, I could not put too much stress on what the consequences would be, not alone for the town, but for the agricultural community and indeed the hinterland, if anything were to happen to the sugar factory in Carlow.  We read on last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent,</i> 7 March, and I quote, &ldquo;Another State Company in Trouble&rdquo;.  It is not unusual these days to read that many companies, not alone State companies, are in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first remark here with regard to the <Col N="1150" /> heading on this paper is that if the Sugar Company need £25 million from the Government that request should be acceded to, not left on the long finger for six months or more before anything is done, not left, as has already been said here tonight, in the same way the sugar factories and plants were left and allowed to run down over the years.  We have an example of this in the factory in Carlow. Senator Lanigan has already mentioned this.  If one visits that factory &mdash; and indeed I am glad to see that the Committee did their homework and did go there &mdash; it is quite obvious that the plant and machinery were allowed to run down over the years.  I do not say that that was the fault of the management.  It may have been because funds were not available from the State.  With inflation as it is, with interest rates as they are, the cost of replacing this type of machinery will be enormous.  So that, apart from the £25 million that has been mentioned here, there must be some other huge injection needed in order to service the four factories.</P>
    <P>The record of the Sugar Company down through the years has been an excellent one with regard to industrial relations.  In Carlow, over the lifetime of that company, we have had only two strikes.  That, I think, is a fair record for any company of this size.  In the brief time which is at my disposal, I want to ask the Minister to act quickly and not wait for the day when we as Senators and Deputies from the other House will be breaking our necks coming up here to Dublin to meet the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance to ask him then to rescue the company.</P>
    <P>I have seen the Erin Foods plant in Carlow and I cannot understand what has happened here.  I cannot understand why the board of directors of the Irish Sugar Company took a decision to close Erin Foods in Carlow.  I have said it was a wrong decision and I still say so.  I was at a meeting last December in Carlow at which there were Deputies, Senators, Members of the European Parliament, the BGA and the IFA and everybody clamoured that night to have that plant kept open.  We were told that the Government <Col N="1151" /> had not taken a decision at that stage.  Here we are now in a situation where that plant is closing.  We have pious platitudes from the Minister, such as:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the company, in keeping with its traditional social commitment, is at present making every possible effort to limit the adverse effects of such closures on the communities concerned. In conjunction with the IDA, it is attempting to provide alternative productive employment in the areas directly affected by closures&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I am confident that, given the priority which the IDA is according the matter of replacement industries and given the genuine concern of the company itself to absorb staff by transfer to other parts of the company where possible, the adverse effects of what are necessary measures of rationalisation will be the minimum possible.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says &ldquo;absorb staff&rdquo;, I know he can absorb staff and the company can do it by moving some of the workers that are employed in Erin Foods across the road to the sugar factory but when Erin Foods is lying there idle, there are other people left in the dole queue who should be working in the sugar factory.  It is not sufficient to transfer one lot across the road and leave out the people who should be taking part in the campaign.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise a few points with regard to Erin Foods, having said that I do not agree with the decision that was taken.  Increasing quantities of vegetables are being brought into this country. There are carrots coming from Italy and France in the early season and, in the main season, onions and cauliflowers are coming from the United Kingdom.  Irish growers provide good crops but the marketing set-up is poor.  The multinational supermarkets are seeking quantity and quality and continuity of supply and they are buying from importers instead of buying from Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Apart from the home market, with our <Col N="1152" /> natural advantages for vegetable production we should be expanding in the fresh vegetable export business.  As I have said, before the phasing out began and the closure was on the way what was needed was an-expert marketing organisation.  I wonder was this considered at any stage by the Sugar Company.  Erin Foods should be the organisation to streamline Irish vegetable production, both fresh and processed.  They have the expertise to supervise the growing and harvesting, the grading and packaging and the loading and so on.  The fresh vegetable business would complement the processing business.  For example, produce which is too big or too small for the fresh market could be used in the processing side of the business.  This is done in other countries in the case of carrots, onions, potatoes and sprouts.  Was this ever considered before the decision was taken to close this plant?</P>
    <P>I believe there was a considerable opportunity through this company to combine a fresh vegetable and processing enterprise.  I am on the record in this House &mdash; I am sorry I have not got the date; I think it was in the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign debate &mdash; as calling on the Minister for an immediate and comprehensive examination of this potential.  I said it was required without delay.  That debate took place long before the Christmas recess.  Was any heed paid to that suggestion?  Did the Minister or his Department ever act in that direction? These are just some points that I think should be highlighted with regard to this industry.  It was a pity, even though they found themselves on the losing side in Erin Foods that the company were not given another 12 months.  Indeed, I was on a deputation when it was suggested that they be given another 12 months so that the farmers who had supported this company down through the years by growing vegetable crops for the company would have continuation of operation. Now the time is past and that cannot happen.  The serious aspect of this is that if that 12 months had been allowed and contracts given for this year the position would now be different.  I am aware that the people who attended that meeting in <Col N="1153" /> Carlow that night, both those representing the IFA and the BGA, would continue to grow vegetables for Erin Foods to help the survival of that company.  That was their clear message.</P>
    <P>I hope that this excellent report that we have before us will be fully examined over a lengthy period by the Minister and his officials and that even at this late hour something will be done to ensure that the position of Erin Foods in Carlow will be reconsidered.  The board refused to rescind their decision on one occasion.  Even at this late stage I would appeal to them to reconsider the matter and I would ask the Minister also to ensure that whatever moneys are necessary for the Irish Sugar Company be given forthwith in order that jobs be retained and the farming community and the business people concerned be assured of a decent livelihood through this great company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be arguing later against the viewpoints underlying some of the recommendations of the Joint Committee but I would like to take this first available opportunity to express my admiration of the very fine work which is being done by the Committee.  Their standard of analysis and presentation is extremely high and in terms of quality and quantity no criticism can be levelled against their productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I come to the reservations I have about the philosophy underlying some of the recommendations of the Committee, lest time runs out may I just refer quickly to the disturbing problems of the Sugar Company so effectively brought to light by the Joint Committee? I am afraid that things are so bad that quite a radical restructuring is needed and that a new look must be taken, in the light of the Committee's findings, at the £40 million programme of modernisation of the company's sugar operations, which, as the Committee said, &ldquo;has not been justified to it on the grounds that it would yield a worthwhile economic or financial return&rdquo;.  The Committee also believe that the company &ldquo;would be unable to service its borrowings unless it achieved substantial improvements in its processing efficiency, even if the Government <Col N="1154" /> take steps to improve its capital structure&rdquo;.  The table on page 37 of the report shows how enormous is the gap in processing efficiency, a gap due to a combination of factors, including inadequate throughout in all factories, outmoded plant and other inefficiencies.  It is a frightening picture.  The Committee does not relieve our worries by saying that Ireland has a comparative disadvantage in sugar beet production within the European Community.</P>
    <P>I think it is very urgent that the relevant Departments, the IDA, the company themselves, and the unions representing their employees should come together with a view to reaching as soon as possible a situation in which self-sustaining, not subsidised, employment will be given by the restructured and consolidated &mdash; I agree with Senator Lambert on the need for consolidation &mdash; operations of the company plus such economic activities as may be put in place of those which are clearly no longer viable.  The Minister gave some reassurance, at least I read it as reassurance, when he said that if a suitable programme for restoring full viability is put forward by the company the Government will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the reservations I have about the Joint Committee's approach to two basic issues &mdash; first, the issue of compensating State bodies from the Exchequer for losses incurred on any social responsibilities they are thought to discharge; second, the issue of providing equity capital from public funds to relieve the interest burden on State bodies associated with their borrowing from the market.</P>
    <P>On the first issue, I would not disagree with the view that an identified and specific social service for which there is a public need should be paid for by the Exchequer so as to make explicit the cost involved.  Rather would I emphasise the need to qualify this principle very carefully indeed.  A State body, whether it be the Sugar Company, CIE or Aer Lingus, may be tempted to excuse a loss-making activity on the grounds that it is a social service.  If such claims where too readily accepted in principle, the loss might then <Col N="1155" /> be thought defensible almost irrespective of its amount.  I have two reservations. The first is that to claim that something is a social service does not make it a social service.  The service may be helpful to some people but it may not be indispensable.  Surely there must not only be an absolute necessity for the service but also there must be a clear inability to provide it or a reasonable substitute for it in any less expensive way.  My second reservation is that, even if the claim that an activity of a social kind is a necessary public responsibility is established beyond question, it certainly does not follow that the social benefit &mdash; the benefit to the community &mdash; is measured by whatever loss the company providing the service may make.  The loss may be excessive because of inefficiency due to low productivity or unnecessarily high costs. Indeed, almost inevitably, if a company is less than efficient in its general operations, it will be less than efficient in the social elements of its activities and the loss it incurs on them will, therefore, exceed any justifiable charge to the community on social grounds.</P>
    <P>These criticisms or qualifications apply to describing a job as a social service as much as describing, say, a transport facility as a social service.  While we must do all we can to ease social problems and maintain employment, we cannot forget that we live in a country in which capital is scarce and has to be borrowed on a large scale from abroad, and in which taxation is high.  We just cannot afford deliberately to lose money in maintaining non-viable industries and services.  Our only hope of realising the social aspirations we all share in regard to employment <Col N="1156" /> and living standards is by moving up the scale in efficiency in all our operations.</P>
