      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to express disappointment at the lack of other than purely routine legislation coming on to the agenda of this House.  A Bill recently passed in the Dail, the Turf Development Bill, is a Bill of considerable importance and significance in rural Ireland.  Many people in the country, local authorities and individuals, were hoping that this Bill would be law in time for the current turf cutting season.  Having regard to the campaign to substitute native fuel for imported fuel, it is vitally important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to come before the Seanad again this year with a measure to provide very substantial increases in social welfare payments.  The Government's resolve to protect the old, the weak, the deprived and the underprivileged sectors in our society is restated clearly by the provisions in this Bill. Social welfare payments are being increased in real terms and not just in line with the cost of living or movements in earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in recent years considerable attention has been devoted to consolidating the statutory provisions relating to the social welfare code, the real emphasis has been on improving the living standards of social welfare recipients, and of providing substantial extensions of schemes.  On a phased basis each year, anomalies have been removed, qualifying conditions have been eased and the scope of certain allowances has been extended to those not previously entitled to them.  This is being continued and certain anomalies and minor discrepancies which came to light during the preparation and passage of the Consolidation <Col N="1229" /> Act are being dealt with in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of this Bill relate to the proposals for increases in the rates of payments which were announced in the budget and also for changes in the pay-related benefit scheme and for the new maternity allowance scheme for women in employment.</P>
    <P>The new rates of payment set out in the Schedules represent increases of 25 per cent in the adult long-term rates of payment, giving increases ranging from £5.25 to £6.15 a week in the personal rate of payments of the principal pensions and allowances.  The single women's allowance is being increased by £4.60 a week, while pensioners under the occupational injuries benefit scheme will receive increases of up to £7.40 a week.  The amounts payable in respect of adult dependants are also being increased by 25 per cent as are the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; and &ldquo;over 80&rdquo; allowances.</P>
    <P>In the case of short-term payments, that is disability benefit, unemployment benefit and assistance, injury benefit and supplementary welfare allowance, the increase is 20 per cent.  All smallholders, including those whose means are assessed on the notional basis, qualifying for unemployment assistance will receive this increase.  The amounts paid for dependent children under all insurance and assistance schemes, both long and short-term, are going up by approximately 10 per cent, in addition to the 30 per cent increase in children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill sets out a number of examples showing the increases being granted.  I would like to deal with an aspect not set out in that memorandum, and which is sometimes lost sight of.  The value of many pensions is enhanced by the various additional services available. Pensioners over the age of 66 are entitled to free travel and frequently also to fuel vouchers.  In addition, these pensioners receive an increase of £2.05 per week if they are living alone.  They may also receive free electricity allowance, free TV licence and assistance towards the cost of having a telephone if they are <Col N="1230" /> living alone or with certain relatives or with other pensioners.</P>
    <P>The monthly amounts of children's allowance are being increased by about 30 per cent this year.  The new rates will be £6 for the first child and £9 for the second and each subsequent child.  The monthly allowance for a family with three children will be £24 from 1 July next compared to £18.50 at present.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the total removal of the condition which requires that in order to qualify for old age pension a person must have had at least 15 years' residence in the State.  The improvement will be of general application but it is being done at this time to ease the position for South-East Asian refugees who have recently settled in this country.  The five year residence condition for blind pension is also being removed.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit scheme is being revised in two respects.  At present pay-related benefit is payable only from the 13th day of incapacity for work or of unemployment in a period of interruption of employment.  In other words, there are 12 &lsquo;waiting days&rsquo; for pay-related benefit purposes.  Where two periods of incapacity or of unemployment are separated by not more than 13 weeks, the &lsquo;waiting days&rsquo; served on the first claim count also for the subsequent claim.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 6 is that 12 &lsquo;waiting days&rsquo; will be applied for pay-related benefit purposes for each distinct spell of incapacity.  It does not affect the position of claims for unemployment benefit. Where, however, a person has a relapse within three days of resuming work or his incapacity occurs during a period of unemployment, additional &lsquo;waiting days&rsquo; will not generally be imposed.</P>
    <P>It was not envisaged that pay-related benefit would be paid for very short interruptions of employment due to illness or unemployment and this is why the existing waiting days provision was introduced under the 1973 Act which brought in the pay-related benefit scheme.  In the case of unemployment, tax refunds are taken into account in determining the rate of pay-related benefit to be paid in conjunction with unemployment benefit.  It has <Col N="1231" /> not proved possible to take tax refunds into account in the same way for disability benefit cases.  The change being made is an alternative way of ensuring that the objectives of the pay-related scheme will be equitably met in all cases of short absences from work whether due to incapacity or unemployment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides the second change. The basic rate of pay-related benefit is calculated by deducting £14 from the reckonable weekly earnings and by then taking a percentage &mdash; 40 per cent for the first 147 days and 30 per cent, 25 per cent and finally 20 per cent for each subsequent 78 days &mdash; of the balance of those earnings.  The disregard now in operation was fixed in 1973 and first applied when the maximum rate of disability benefit and unemployment benefit was £6.55 and the yearly ceiling for reckonable earnings was £2,500.  It has not been revised since despite the increases in the flat-rate benefit and the ceiling.  From next month the weekly flat rate of benefit goes up to £24.55 and the ceiling will be £8,500.</P>
    <P>While the provision now proposed will not restore the old relativity, the amount disregarded will now be linked to the maximum personal rate of short-term benefit payable at the beginning of each benefit year.  The new disregard will, accordingly, be £20 in the present year and will apply to fresh claims commencing after 6 April.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for a new pay-related maternity allowance scheme for women in employment which relates to the provisions for statutory maternity leave recently introduced by the Minister for Labour and approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  An improved allowance will be payable for 14 weeks to women on maternity leave.  The level of payment is designed to correspond to take-home pay when tax refunds are taken into account.  The actual payment will be 80 per cent of the earnings which are reckonable for pay-related benefit purposes.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the package is that there will be a minimum weekly payment of £45.75 as compared with the minimum of £20.45 payable at present. <Col N="1232" /> The minimum payment is based on the average earnings of female workers.  In addition, the contribution conditions for maternity allowance are being eased under the new scheme so as to cater for women who re-enter the workforce after an absence of some years.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will give considerably greater amounts of benefit to persons entitled to maternity leave.  For example, a person receiving the current average earnings of about £80 per week in the food and drink industry will receive more than £300 in additional benefit, while a woman now earning £55 in, say, the textiles industry will receive an additional £200 or more.  In addition, the claimant would usually receive tax refunds.  I believe that the levels of payment proposed will not only make it easier for a woman to abstain from work outside the home for a suitable interval before and after her confinement, but will make a valuable contribution towards the many expenses which a family incurs on those occasions.</P>
    <P>The scheme provided in Part III of this Bill will subsume the existing 12 weeks scheme in the case of women entitled to maternity leave.  The additional cost will be met in full by an addition of 0.15 per cent to the employer's pay-related social insurance contribution.  This 0.15 per cent increase is included in the overall increase of 0.25 per cent for the employer.  This arrangement will equalise the cost of maternity leave for employers. Currently an employer with a predominantly female workforce is severely disadvantaged if he pays in respect of maternity leave.  The existing 12 week maternity allowance scheme will continue to apply to women who do not qualify for maternity leave under the maternity protection of employees legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous amendments designed to achieve uniformity in the social welfare code.  Most of these items arose from work on the preparation of the Consolidation Act and many of them were debated in the private sessions of the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. In fact, I undertook during the Committee's <Col N="1233" /> deliberations to provide for some of these items at the first suitable opportunity.</P>
    <P>The cost in 1981 of the improvements being provided by this Bill is estimated at £137 million.  In addition, £7 million is being made available for improvements in the fuel voucher and telephone rental schemes which do not come under the scope of this Bill, giving a gross cost of £144 million.  The increases provided by section 5 of this Bill in the rates of pay-related social insurance contributions, effective from 6 April 1981 will yield an estimated £33 million, leaving £111 million to be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The new rates of social insurance contributions will be 9.55 per cent for employers and 3.75 per cent for employees as compared with 8.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively, at present.  The rates of voluntary contributions are also being increased.  The new employer's contribution of 9.55 per cent includes the element of 0.15 per cent to meet the cost of the new maternity allowance scheme. The occupational injuries contribution is being reduced from 0.45 per cent to 0.3 per cent as the yield from the current rate has proved to be more than is required to meet the fund's outgoings; this contribution is borne in full by employers.  The earnings ceiling up to which contributions are payable is being raised from £7,000 to £8,500.</P>
    <P>The new overall PRSI contribution goes up from 14.3 per cent to 14.8 per cent, with employers paying 10.05 per cent and employees paying 4.75 per cent, the net increase in each case being 0.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to Seanad Éireann and ask Senators to give it speedy and favourable consideration.  In this connection I would point out that this Bill must be enacted before 1 April 1981, the operative day of the increases in the rates of unemployment assistance.  Increases in the other schemes, except children's allowance, will all apply from the first appropriate date in April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has concluded by asking the Seanad to give speedy and favourable consideration to <Col N="1234" /> this Bill.  I want to say in reply that we recognise the need to have this Bill enacted by 1 April.  We are only too willing to extend our co-operation to ensure that whatever benefits the Bill will bestow on people to whom it relates will be available to them as and from 1 April.  With regard to favourable consideration we will, I am sure, extend our favourable consideration to the parts of the Bill that we feel deserve these and to other parts of the Bill we will extend certain criticisms that we feel we are justified in making.</P>
      <P>I recognise that it is the Minister's privilege to praise his Bill, to praise its contents, to highlight what he feels are advantages and to emphasise the benefits the Bill will bestow on some of the people concerned.  I regard it as being my privilege also, while acknowledging the worthwhile aspects of the Bill, to dispute certain claims that the Minister may be making in relation to it, and to draw the attention of the House to where I feel that the Bill has failed to fulfil the needs of the weaker sections of our community, the old, the infirm, the sick and the unemployed.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of the Bill and there are provisions in the Bill that I certainly welcome.  I welcome the increase in the long-term and short-term benefits.  At a later stage I will be suggesting that, taking the Minister's figure of 20 and 25 per cent, it will in fact very likely prove to be inadequate as the year progresses.  I welcome the maternity allowance scheme.  I welcome the removal of the 15 years residential qualification for old age pensioners.  There is another matter related to the Bill which I also welcome, that is in relation to landowners who apply for old age pension and who until recently experienced considerable delays in receiving the pension, due to the necessity of having the deed of transfer stamped.  I acknowledge a progressive move by the Minister in ensuring that old age pensioners and the people eligible for old age pensions will qualify for their pensions from the date of lodgment of the documents regarding the transfer of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's remarks in relation to the weaker sections of our <Col N="1235" /> people &mdash; this Bill certainly applies to them &mdash; the under-privileged in our society who, through age, or sickness, or want of a job, have to depend on the State for existence, for the means of providing them with the basic essentials of life.  It is only fair to point out that we live in an age in which the well-organised in our society will use their resources of organisation and muscle to extract the greatest possible share of the national cake they can obtain for themselves without often having regard to those who are under-privileged or who are weak and may not be organised.</P>
    <P>The people on social welfare, old age pensioners, unemployed, widows, orphans, are people without an organisation to press their claims, without channels through which they can exercise muscle to obtain for themselves what we would all accept as just demands.  For them the strike weapon is totally out; we do not see them involved in protest marches and they occupy a very vulnerable position in our society.  I believe the Minister and as a whole the Oireachtas have a duty to ensure that the interests of these people are protected, that they get justice and that the basic essentials of life are made available to them.</P>
    <P>The budget, and this Social Welfare Bill that follows from it, are the channels through which we can discharge that duty.  For that reason I propose to measure what is proposed in this Bill in relation to achieving that objective.  I propose to measure it, first of all, in relation to the background of inflation and price increases that affect our community and, secondly, to measure the amounts that we are legislating to provide for people on social welfare against, for example, the average industrial wage because I believe that that is a yardstick we have to use in estimating the capacity of the money we are making available to the people we are dealing with here to provide them with the basic essentials of life.</P>
    <P>In relation to inflation it is generally accepted that it is somewhere in excess of 18 per cent, possibly pushing up towards 20 per cent.  The Minister has said that under the Bill the long-term rates will be <Col N="1236" /> 25 per cent and the short-term rates will be at 20 per cent.  We have to recognise, in measuring these sums, that already three months of 1981 have virtually passed by and, therefore, effectively, for 1981 we are talking of increases that are 18 per cent for long-term benefits and 15 per cent for short-term benefits.  The 15 per cent, which I believe will be the real increase to people on social welfare for 1981, will apply to people in receipt of disability and injury payments, unemployment benefit and assistance and supplementary welfare allowances.  In view of that, I will argue that, taking inflation into account, these people are already losing ground.  They are now committed to having to accept a lower standard of living by the end of 1981.</P>
    <P>I followed the debate that took place in the other House in relation to this Bill. The Minister is reported as saying that the average industrial wage is something in the region of £104 which is expected to rise to £121 by the end of 1981.  It is against this figure that we have to measure what we are providing in this Bill for people who are unemployed.  Unemployment assistance for a single person under this Bill will be £20.40 per week, roughly one-fifth of the average industrial wage in the country.  For an unemployed person with one dependant it will be £35.10, again roughly one-third of the average industrial wage.  An orphan's pension will be £14.80, approximately one-seventh of the average industrial wage.  A widow will receive £26.35, which is one-fourth of the average industrial earnings and an unmarried mother with one child will receive £33.75.  Therefore, the capacity of the people who have to live on those incomes as measured against the average industrial wage is certainly limited in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>In relation to the unemployed I detect a certain policy in what is being proposed here.  Without a doubt, the amounts that are being made available to the unemployed in real terms are being reduced and it indicates to me that somehow there seems to be a policy of adjusting downwards the position of the people who are unemployed.  Their limited spending power has been reduced already and the <Col N="1237" /> proposed rates will represent real reductions for them.  I do not believe that is a fair attitude to adopt to people who are unemployed.  The unemployment figures show that there are over 127,000 unemployed in the country at present.  Therefore, there are no jobs available for the people who are registered as unemployed.  It is not their fault.  For that reason, we are being less than just in what we are proposing to provide them with under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to give one other example.  An unemployed couple, with two children on unemployment assistance will receive under the provisions of this Bill £45.70 plus £1 if they reside in an urban area. That is less than £12 per individual to provide heating, clothing, light and food per week.  Nobody could survive at present on a sum as meagre as that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to children's allowances.  He said, as far as I can recall, that children's allowance were being increased by 30 per cent.  That is correct, but let us look at the amount involved. Children's allowances are increasing from 35p to 50p per week, that is roughly from 5p to 7p per day.  The allowance for dependent children, which I assume from the Minister's speech is being added to this, is being increased from 40p to 60p per week, or from 6p to 9p per day.  The combined increase in the children's allowance and the rates for dependent children is from 11p to 16p per week.  The value of that can best be measured by an experience I had this morning when I found that the price of an apple at Kingsbridge Station is 15p.  That, in true purchasing power, is the value of the increase for dependent children within the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the non-contributory old age pension.  I note, with regret, that for the fourth year in succession the Minister and the Government have failed to reduce the qualifying age to 65 years. That is in contrast with the achievements of the National Coalition during their period in office when they reduced the qualifying age each year by one year. When the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1980 was being discussed I raised a point with the Minister.  He referred to it <Col N="1238" /> when he was replying to the Second Stage debate.  I regret to see that no action has been taken on this particular point since then.  The point I am referring to is the failure to raise the threshold of £6 means per week, that is, the amount that is disregarded in calculating the eligibility of a person for a non-contributory old age pension.  This £6 per week means has existed for quite a number of years.  It is unfair that that basic rate has not been adjusted upwards.  I raised that point with the Minister last year.  I regret that the opportunity was not availed of on this occasion to increase it to a figure which would correspond to what that £6 was worth at the time it was first introduced.</P>
    <P>I want to raise, in relation to the method of assessing non-contributory old age pensions, the question of assessing means, particularly in relation to people, for example, from my own part of the country, who live on farms, either medium sized or small, who apply for old age pensions when they reach the qualifying age.  I am a member of an old age pensions committee and from my experience I know that there is no set standard by which the income from a medium or small farm is assessed.  It is left solely to the judgment of the pension officer or the official concerned who visits the holding and inquires as to how many cows are being milked, how many cattle are being sold and then makes a rough guess as to the average possible income from that holding.</P>
    <P>Many of these calculations are wide of the mark and sufficient consideration is not given to the decline in farm incomes which occurred over the past two years. In the interests of the people concerned there should be a standard means and a standard method by which the income from these holdings is assessed.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the old age pensions situation is that people who have spent a lifetime in hard work, often in difficult circumstances, and who have accumulated a few pounds and set it aside as security for their old age are being penalised for their thrift.  On the other hand, the person who had drifted in life and wasted any resources that he ever had is <Col N="1239" /> being rewarded.  Those who were thrifty and progressive and who arranged some security for themselves in their old age are being penalised.  That is wrong and I suggest that the Minister should look seriously at that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the advantages which old age pensioners can enjoy in relation to free travel, free electricity allowances and a telephone allowance. In my county some people would qualify for free travel, for an allowance towards their electricity bill and for a free telephone, but none of these services is available to them.  It misrepresents the case to a certain degree to state that these advantages are measurable and that they apply across the board.  I had a case in the past few weeks where an old age pensioner living alone applied to have electricity connected to his house and the cost of connecting the power to his home would come to £1,460.  Obviously that is away beyond his means so therefore he is excluded from the Minister's assertion that these benefits are worth so much to different people.  I also have two cases in my area of people seeking the installation of telephones and they will be a ripe old age at the present rate of progress, if they ever do have the telephone while they are still on this side of the great divide.</P>
    <P>There is one other problem in relation to the old age pension about which I am deeply concerned.  As a member of an old age pensions committee I see the people who are affected by this.  Some people who are in receipt of UK pensions and who have come back to reside in Ireland have found that their pensions are being reduced because of the differential between the punt and sterling.  I am not happy with the explanation for it. When these people appear before the committee one sees that they are people who had to leave their homes many years ago because there was no opportunity for them here.  They emigrated to Britain to accept perhaps the worst jobs at the bottom of the industrial sphere.  They spent a lifetime of toil with few comforts and in their old age they returned to this country.  We had no time for them when they were young, we had no respect, opportunities <Col N="1240" /> or jobs for them and now when they return in their declining years we deprive them of this temporary little bonus.  It is an extraordinary situation that I am thoroughly ashamed of.  If the Minister has a conscience he will feel equally ashamed of this situation.</P>
    <P>The fuel scheme has been mentioned and the allocation of £3 per week for part of the year is totally inadequate.  We were fortunate to have a mild winter and some people who are alive today owe that to the fact that we had a mild winter.  If they were dependent on that £3 per week they would not have the heat that they are entitled to.  Three pounds is worth very little when one compares it to the cost of gas, electricity, coal, turf, oil or any other source of heat.  I would ask the Minister to increase that figure before the end of this year.  When one takes account of the continuing increase in the cost of living and the increase in inflation people in receipt of social welfare payments will be worse off at the end of 1981 than at the present time.  Our objectives, as a society, should be to raise the level of payments to social welfare recipients, to bring them to a level where they can have easy access to the essentials of life.  Having brought it to that point, social welfare payments should be indexed to the cost of living thereby ensuring that the position of the people in need of social welfare does not disimprove by virtue of changes in the cost of living caused by inflation.</P>
    <P>Many of the people we are concerned with here today are people who have found considerable difficulties in the past few months in obtaining their payments from the Department of Social Welfare. That point has been laboured extensively elsewhere, but I feel it my duty to register my protest at the unreasonable delays which have increased the level of hardship for people who are in urgent need, and who are entitled to payment.</P>

      <P>Matters of administration do not arise on this Bill so I would not like the Senator to make them a main topic of his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt obliged to register <Col N="1241" /> my protest on that.  There is one other point that I feel obliged to make.  When we are dealing with people in receipt of social welfare, we are dealing with people who very often are in that situation through no fault of their own.  There is often a failure to treat these people with the dignity and the respect they deserve. They endure hardship and it is my experience, and I am sure the experience of many others in public life, that these people come to us because they have failed to obtain their just entitlements.  The benefits are their right; they are in these circumstances through no fault of their own and they should be treated with dignity and respect.</P>
      <P>The Bill has certain good points.  I criticise it mainly because it has failed fully to recognise the plight of many people on social welfare.  There is a failure to recognise the extent of the problem and the hardship suffered by the old, the sick and the unemployed.  It is wrong, bearing in mind the ravages of cost increases and inflation to represent this Bill as giving real and substantial improvements.  The Minister should give an undertaking that he and the Government are prepared to review at the end of the summer the income position of the people on social welfare, in the light of adverse changes that may have affected their position because of inflation, price increases and so on.</P>

      <P>I too welcome this Bill and the generous increases given to our social welfare recipients &mdash; increases ranging from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. These clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to helping the weaker sections of our community.  That is as it should be, because the old, the infirm, the deserted wife and the unmarried mother are the most vulnerable sections of our society.  Very often they have nobody to speak on their behalf and they rely each year on the budget speech by the Minister for Finance to find out what their financial state will be for the following year.  It is very hard for people to have to survive on the payments outlined by the Minister.  Nonetheless, the increases given in this year's budget represent <Col N="1242" /> a tremendous increase in real terms on the payments they have been receiving up to now.</P>
      <P>I was happy to hear the Minister say that many of the anomalies currently existing under the social welfare code are gradually being phased out.  I would like the Minister in future years to consider the female section of our population, those women who spend most of their time at home as full-time housewives, who are not entitled to very many social welfare payments.  The Minister should consider in future years the extension of the social welfare payments to include free dental and optical care for full-time housewives.  A recent survey published indicated that the housewives of Ireland have the worst teeth in the country.  I know the Minister, as Minister for Health, must also be concerned about this.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that in the Social Welfare Bill this year, maternity allowances are now to be given to women at work.  They will now get 14 weeks paid maternity leave and a further four weeks at their own discretion if they so wish. This is as it should be.  Women who want to stay at work, who perhaps through financial necessity have to stay at work, are now being looked after in our social welfare code.  Side by side with this legislation this Minister, or the Minister for the Environment, should ensure that women who go back to work after they get married will have available to them child-care facilities properly run by the Department, by the Eastern Health Board and other health boards throughout the country so that children can be looked after.  These are all part and parcel of any social welfare legislation, because whilst one may provide &mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but in discussing the welcome payments being made we must also make provision to have the children properly looked after. Whilst it may not be essentially a matter for social welfare legislation, it is nonetheless part and parcel of any legislation <Col N="1243" /> in this area.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister, in the case of widows and deserted wives, to make a special examination of their situation, particularly cases of widows whose husbands died suddenly.  A young woman with three or four children could suddenly find, as a result of an accident, that the main breadwinner in the house is no longer there.  Salaries of perhaps £100 or £200 a week could have been coming into that house but the family may not have any money saved, because of house repayments and so on.  Some sort of special allowance should be made to a widow at times like this to help her carry over through the first month or so after the death of her husband.  This sort of payment could be related to her needs, to the salary her husband was earning, to the number of children and to her financial responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I would particularly welcome the increases given in the children's allowances.  They were very generous increases of 30 per cent.  I hope that we will continue along this path to make sure that all our social welfare payments, particularly those relating to children, to deserted wives, unmarried mothers and old age pensioners, will keep pace with and indeed, will be ahead of increases in the cost of living.  The only way the weaker sections of our community will ever be brought up to a level with the rest of the community will be by having real increases of this nature each year.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill and in congratulating the Minister on his very generous increases I hope that he will seriously consider some of the matters I have mentioned.  This being the International Year of the Disabled, I am very pleased that the Minister made special allowances for many of the infirm in our community. That is as it should be.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour group wish to see this Bill passed as speedily as possible so that the increases in it may come into effect, as the Minister said, mainly on 1 April.  There is no room for complacency, self-satisfaction or self-congratulation in relation to the provisions <Col N="1244" /> of the Bill because the stark truth is that the kind of increases in this Bill will not redress the present cycle of poverty and will not remove the grinding incidence of poverty and deprivation which are part of our society.  It behoves us to be very serious and even subdued in this House in considering the provisions of this Social Welfare Bill in realising that for those who are living below the poverty line &mdash; a very significant proportion of our population &mdash; these increases, although they will make some difference, do not outweigh other factors.  It is these factors which I wish the Minister to deal with in his reply.</P>
      <P>I do not see the overall <i>rationale</i> of the distinction drawn between long-term and short-term benefits, particularly in relation to unemployment.  It seems strange, when the unemployment fate is now 126,000, that we would regard unemployment assistance as short-term and therefore have it come within the lower rate of increase, an increase of 20 per cent rather than 25 per cent as in the case of long-term benefits.  I accept that there may be some difficulties in this.  It is something we discussed in this House in relation to the doubling of benefits at Christmas.  The Minister came some way to acknowledging the possible harshness of only doubling the long-term benefits and leaving out short-term benefits, even though these short-term benefits may be benefits which a family have been dependent on for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the case now with unemployment assistance.  It may be the sole source of income to a family over a period of several years and it looks as though this could be an increasing factor.  If a person has pay-related benefit, when the time runs out and he has to depend on assistance once again, the severe drop in income can be extremely harsh.  I would like the Minister to deal with this distinction for the purposes of calculating the increase, and in particular to deal with this in the context of unemployment assistance.  In doing so perhaps the Minister would be in a position to give us some figures for the periods of time in which people are on unemployment assistance.  I can certainly give the Minister <Col N="1245" /> the means of individuals and of individual families who have been drawing unemployment assistance for a period in excess of one year and in some cases in excess of two years.  I wonder if the Minister is in a position to give us percentage rates on this, given the fact that there is, to some extent, a constant turn-over and movement in these figures. Nevertheless there are a substantial number who are now long-term recipients of unemployment assistance, which we characterise as a short term benefit for the purposes of giving a lower increase.</P>
    <P>I would question the Minister's assertion that these measures will give social welfare increases in real terms and not just in line with the cost of living or movements in earnings.  To some extent this depends on one's perception of the cost of living.  I understand that the cost of living index figure will be disclosed tomorrow and that it is estimated that it will run at something like 20 per cent. Apart from that cost of living index figure there are other cost factors which weigh much more heavily on people who are dependent on a social welfare income or who are low wage earners.  These are the very significant increases in recent years and in recent months in energy and transport costs.  These are probably two of the main areas of devastating increases for persons on social welfare incomes or low wage earners.</P>
    <P>Just to have the facts of this on the record of the House, is the Minister in a position to give us the precise increase in gas and electricity costs from 1 March 1980 to 1 March this year, given that this figure of increase is fairly easily ascertainable?  Gas and electricity bills are the bills which hit most the low income families. It is no good producing a £70 electricity bill to a family living on £50-odd a month and expecting them to be able to pay that bill.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I would ask the Minister to give us the public transport fares increase from 1 March 1980 to 1 March of this year.  There is nothing particularly significant about the months and if the Minister wants to vary them a little I do not mind. I just want to know the net increase in the last 12 months, since there was an <Col N="1246" /> increase in the social welfare payments, which will put into perspective the devastating impact on the families concerned.</P>
    <P>In this context it would be very helpful if the Minister would deal with the scope of the capacity of a community welfare officer to use the supplementary welfare benefits to assist families burdened by particularly high electricity bills.  This is one of the single greatest problems and tensions for families and there appears to be a difference in practice between community welfare officers.  For example, if there is an outstanding ESB bill and the ESB prescribe payments of, say, £20 a week to pay off the bill, in some cases the community welfare officer will, where somebody is dependent on social welfare income, pay half of that out of supplementary welfare.  He could pay as much as £10 of the £20 out of supplementary welfare benefit.  In other cases the community welfare officer will say that he has no jurisdiction to pay any part of the electricity bill or he will pay a much smaller amount.  This is a very real problem because most families, certainly most of the families that I have come in contact with, families who are dependent purely on a social welfare income, have outstanding electricity bills.  They borrow, short-term, at very high rates to try to meet their electricity bills.</P>
    <P>There appears to be no approach on the basis that electricity is a necessity of life, both for light and heat for these families and that it should be dealt with in a standardised way under the social welfare code.  I would ask the Minister to deal with this problem and in particular to indicate what is the scope of discretion of community welfare officers in assisting in the paying off of high electricity bills. The same would apply to high gas bills. Although at a rather superficial level a 25 per cent increase sounds like a generous increase it does not compensate for the enormous increases in energy costs, and in transport costs and the fact that the consumer price index is likely to show an increase of 20 per cent or thereabouts when the figures are released.</P>
    <P>Far from being in any way complacent about this Bill, we should realise that it <Col N="1247" /> will not close the gap.  We will still see that gap widening between those earning an income and benefiting from industrial wage increases and those dependent on social welfare benefits.  I agree with Senator Howard that this is the appropriate standard for us to use so that we can be aware of the level of deprivation which we seem to regard as decent and as adequate.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other specific points that I will mention on this Bill. One relates to an anomaly which I know the Minister is aware of, because representations have been made to him, but which is not removed in this Bill.  That is the fact that an unmarried mother, a single mother with a child, cannot benefit from the higher level of social welfare benefits.  She can benefit only from the unmarried mother's allowance even if she has been working for a number of years in insured employment, paying her insurance contributions, and ought to be able to get the higher level of benefit.  In other words, the unmarried mother is discriminated against in comparision with for example, a widow who is getting the widow's benefit on her own earnings, or any other category of earner who qualifies for a social welfare benefit because of contributions made through earned income in previous years.  I know that representations have been made to the Minister by Cherish in relation to this.  I know that the anomaly has been pointed out to the Minister and I would ask him to deal specifically with this issue, because it appears to be a totally unfair and unwarranted discrimination which obviously makes life all that harder for that one parent family.  It has caused considerable resentment and feelings of inequality and injustice among mothers who have worked for a substantial number of years, in some cases, in insured employment, who cannot under our system avail of the higher benefit level and can only avail of the unmarried mother's allowance.</P>
    <P>In this connection I join with Senator Howard in protesting about the still continuing £6 means limit.  This was introduced either in 1974 or 1975 &mdash; certainly <Col N="1248" /> not more recently than 1975 &mdash; and it has remained unchanged since that date.  It is a totally unrealistic limit; it causes very real hardship and I would ask the Minister in his reply to say why the £6 means test limit has not been raised not by a £1 or £2 but very substantially raised for all the individuals and families affected by it.  A great number of one parent families and, as Senator Howard has emphasised, old age pensioners are affected by the unreal level of the £6 means test.  This perpetuates its own cycle of poverty because it is a disincentive to trying to supplement a social welfare income which is inadequate to live on.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back again to the position of the unmarried mother with which I have considerable familiarity through my association with Cherish. What happens is that an unmarried mother is unable to live with her child on the unmarried mother's allowance so she seeks work to supplement it.  She finds that as soon as she starts to earn she can claim only £6 plus another £2 for her child before her earnings will be eroded by tax, so she starts to work on what I might call the black market.  She does not declare her earnings because she would be hit by taxation in this cycle of poverty.  Then she places her child with a child minder or in a nursery school and, again, this is all done in a kind of black market, unacknowledged way because the same situation probably applies in the case of the child minder.  She may be a widow who does this as a part-time job and does not want to acknowledge that she is doing it because she too would have the £6 limit only before she would have to pay tax. The Minister should ponder on the way in which categories of people are being driven into part-time unprotected work to avoid the harsh limit of this unchanged £6 ceiling.  This is a matter which urgently needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a final point in relation to the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister referred to the 30 per cent increase in children's allowances.  This on its own will be a substantial level of increase when it comes in, but it does not meet the real problem which has been very well identified and very well documented <Col N="1249" /> for the cost of children and the fact that our system at the moment is discriminating in financial terms against larger families.  I would refer the Minister to the very detailed analysis and unanswerable analysis of this in the recent NESC report prepared by Councillor Eithne Fitzgerald.  That report revealed that, although we subscribe to cherishing children and being in favour of the family, and in favour of encouraging people to have children, we actually discriminate against larger families, and that the cost of children is a very real factor in the poverty of a family on a low income.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not take that into account.  It does not really adopt any of the proposals put forward in that NESC report, not even the proposal for special allowances at particular times of the year. I would remind the Minister that one of the proposals in that NESC report was for particular account to be taken of the cost of older children in a family and of high cost at particular times of the year such as, for example, in September when children are returning to school and need additional clothing, additional shoes, text books, and so on.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to accept and implement some of the recommendations in that report it would be an acknowledgement, which is very badly needed, of the way in which, as a country, we have neglected children and therefore deepened the poverty of those families and created, in some cases, unbearable tensions for the families and particularly for the mothers concerned.  This has resulted in a number of mothers damaging their own health through sacrificing their needs in order to feed and clothe their children, becoming anaemic, becoming unable to cope, and suffering the resulting social costs.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill must be expedited so that those who will benefit from it can get the increases and allowances which will come their way.  We in this House ought to have an early opportunity to consider further measures, not paying lip service to keeping up with the real costs of living &mdash; I do not believe this Bill does that &mdash; but considering a number of co-ordinated measures which would <Col N="1250" /> begin to narrow the gap between those who are the privileged job holders, the wage earners in our society, and those who are dependent on social welfare incomes, on short or long-term benefits, and who have become the very poor and indeed who are getting poorer in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got very many observations to make on this Bill. The unfortunate old age pensioners, people on public assistance and people in receipt of unemployment assistance will benefit from it and for that I welcome it. There are certain anomalies in it, some of which the Minister could have removed.  One is in respect of old age pensions and it is seen as being a hardship.  A parent may need personal care. A daughter aged 30 or 40 years may spend the best years of her life performing a very charitable act for her mother or father and no supplementary allowance is payable.  On the other hand if she came to their assistance at 56 or 57 years of age an allowance would be payable.  If the Minister had given this full consideration I am sure he would have amended the law.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is the social benefits that are paid to people who are unemployed.  Unfortunately there are quite a number of such people at present.  I would imagine the Minister's Department are very extensively employed in sorting out the qualifications or disqualifications of such persons who are in receipt of social assistance by reason of being unemployed, people who are on the dole, so to speak.  It is rather disconcerting that very often these people are passed on to the health boards and that amounts of money which should be used to provide health board services are being demanded from the county councils who, in turn, have to raise them from local taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go further into that matter but it is very prevalent at the moment.  I should like the Minister to take account of the circumstances of the people about whom I have made representations to him.  I do not want to over-state the case but it is a tragedy in <Col N="1251" /> so far as the poorer sections of the community are the sufferers.</P>
    <P>On the question of children's allowances, I know a mother of seven or eight children who received all the payments due on her book up to June 1980.  Despite all her representations she has been unable to get any allowance from that date to this.  I will give the Minister the details again.  I have already written to him about it.  He should be able to exercise more effective and more decisive control in a case like this.  It is hardly fair that it should go on for eight or nine months.  I would not say it is the result of neglect but it is the result of mismanagement to some extent.  I do not want to go any further than that.  Where people are unable to get the service to which they are entitled that service should be supplemented from another source.  An interim payment of the appropriate amount should be made and subsequently the payment should be adjusted to meet the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>It is also a tragedy &mdash; if &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; is the correct word &mdash; that a person with small means living in a prefab, and in receipt of a full old age pension, should have his pension book withdrawn and a reduced pension book sent back to him. He has never been told why it happened. The Minister should give him a written explanation.  This is not the case of a civil servant who is fairly well off and who is getting a pension by virtue of the work he did.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take account of all the difficulties and problems that arise in the administration of the health service.  I should like him to design a system which would involve no hardship for people and their families. Over the past years there have been savage increases in the cost of living and in the price of bread and other necessaries of life for people like old age pensioners. Increases in allowances are swallowed up.  While they are welcome as a stop gap they do not improve standards of living. I would ask the Minister to take account of these increases in the cost of living and to make appropriate half-yearly adjustments to the social services.  With the rate <Col N="1252" /> at which costs are increasing no matter how welcome increased allowances may be, they are not keeping pace with costs and inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Séamus de Brún</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at length on this Bill.  I merely wish to welcome it sincerely and to congratulate the Minister and the Government on the great concern they have shown for the less well-off sections of our people, that is, all those who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  I believe, and I think the general public believe, that the allowances and the increases granted by the Minister are very generous in the circumstances.  Whatever faults people may have found with the budget to which this Bill is a sequel, it is generally agreed, even by people on the other side of the House, that the increases provided by the Minister in his budget, and now in this Bill, are generous and substantial in the light of the present circumstances and the very difficult times we are going through.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked for a speedy passage for this Bill so that its provisions can be implemented as soon as possible and thereby benefit those people for whom we express such great sympathy in this House and, indeed, as do Members in the other House.  To show our concern for those people whom we are now discussing we should accede to the Minister's request and give this Bill a speedy passage to enable them to benefit as soon and as substantially as possible, that is, from early April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All categories of social welfare recipients are catered for in this Bill.  it is obvious that the increases are generous in every section of the Bill.  It is all very well to talk about those people and the increases that they need, and to say the benefits they are being given here are not in proportion to the increases in the cost of living, but one must remember that the money to provide all these benefits must be found somewhere.  Who can provide it other than those paying taxes? Everyone is concerned with the provision of this money.  Granted, the increases are not as substantial as the Minister would wish them to be, or as the Government would wish them to be, or indeed as any <Col N="1253" /> one of us here would wish them to be. Nevertheless, they are generous in the circumstances.  The Minister and his Government are to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>In his reference to the financing of this scheme the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The cost in 1981 of the improvements being provided by this Bill is estimated at £137 million.  In addition, £7 million is being made available for improvements in the fuel voucher and telephone rental schemes which do not come under the scope of this Bill, giving a gross cost of £144 million.</P>
    <P>That is a substantial sum of money.  I am proud that we have such a Bill before us giving such considerable improvements to all social welfare recipients.  Every category is being provided for in social welfare benefits, children's allowances and all across the board.  Special maternity allowances are being given.  This is a great improvement on anything we have seen in any financial year in the past.  Let me remind people that we have had Coalition Governments in office who professed to have great concern for the less well-off sections of our community but I do not think any Coalition Government ever provided such generous allowances or additions to allowances as the Minister and the Government have provided on this occasion.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will be given a very speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Any fair-minded person would have to welcome this Bill and many of the provisions in it.  I would say that the Minister must be disappointed that so many of the benefits have been eroded in the meantime by increases in prices and the overall increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to disability benefits. People on disability benefit get letters from the Department asking them to change over to invalidity pensions.  A small number of these people cannot change over to invalidity pensions for the simple reason that, if they do, they will come under the income tax code.  If they remain on disability benefit that is not taxable, whereas if the change over to an <Col N="1254" /> invalidity pension it is taxable.  The type of people I refer to are people who worked in the civil service, in a local authority, in the banks, and had to give up their employment as a result of MS, Parkinson's disease, a stroke and so on.  They get a small pension.  A small pension added to the invalidity pension puts them into the tax bracket.</P>
    <P>We see the advantages they have.  They get the free electricity allowance, a free licence for black and white television, and they get free travel.  Many of these people are not interested in travelling. Our public transport system was not set up to carry people suffering from MS, Parkinson's disease, or a stroke.  It is impossible for these people to get into a train or a bus unless they get exceptional help.  That exceptional help is not always available.  Many buses have a driver, and that is all.  What can he do?  If a person arrives at a bus stop in a wheelchair, unless some people on the bus get off and lift him in, public transport is no good to him.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the type of people I refer to.  If they remain on disability allowance they do not get free travel until they are 66 years. Many of them are very young people who had to retire before their time.  Their employers were decent and gave them reasonable pensions.  Add on the invalidity pension and they are into the tax bracket and the other advantages they get become null and void.  I would ask the Minister to give that matter his consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it is an improvement in dealing with the various categories listed.  In his statement the Minister was a little too enthusiastic when he described the increases as &ldquo;very substantial increases in social welfare&rdquo;.  They may appear to be very substantial until you translate their value into real terms, and then you find they are not as substantial as the Minister says they are and I am sure as the Minister would like them to be.  There are increases of 20 per cent.  When measured against the increase in the cost of living, or the figure for inflation, a 20 per cent increase is an <Col N="1255" />&ldquo;as you were&rdquo; situation.  That could not be described as something about which we should be enthusiastic.</P>
      <P>Many of the points I had intended to make have been covered already.  I will not go back over them.  I want to draw attention to a couple of items.  One is the case of a single man on disability benefit who gets £20.40.  Does any reasonable person think it is possible for a person like that to have anything other than a poor standard of living on £20.40 a week? His situation will be improved only minimally if he gets an increase of 20 per cent which puts him up to £24.19 per week.  I do not believe it can be contended that that person is above the poverty line.</P>
      <P>People in that category have great difficulty in qualifying for fuel grants because of their age and they are at a serious advantage.  Some of them suffer from a disability for a very long time and fringe benefits extended to old age pensioners should be extended to them automatically.  Because of the illness from which they suffer, while they may by young according to the calendar, they are old in health, in physique, in strength, and in so far as they are not capable of taking up employment.  I would ask for consideration for people like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of old age pensioners living alone depends to a large degree on interpretation by assistance officers employed by the health boards.  It often happens that a family settlement includes a right of residence for the old man or woman of the house, as the case might be.  Technically they are living with their families but it very often happens that such old people have to maintain their own fires, heating, do their own cooking and so on.  Interpretation varies.  In such cases we should err on the side of clemency rather than strict application of the law which deprives the person concerned of free fuel, free light, free television, and so on, although in fact, he or she lives alone.  Because of the niggardly way in which the service is administered it very often happens that old people have to move out of the home where they were prepared to live, where the settlement <Col N="1256" /> provided that they should live, and go into hospital.  To maintain an old person in a hospital costs three to four times what it would cost to maintain him or her in a rather generous fashion at home. Health board officials should not be so niggardly and super-strict in their interpretation of the regulations.  In many cases, the pensioners are, in fact, alone though it might appear that they are living with families.</P>
    <P>A good deal was said in the other House about delays in payments.  The Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled that these were matters of administration that should not be discussed.  The Minister must be concerned about delays.  He would be doing the country a good service if he reorganised his Department so as to eliminate long delays.  It can be a terrible experience for social welfare recipients to have to wait two or three months, or longer, for payment and to have to ask the local shopkeeper or fuel supplier for credit.  From what I know of the Minister he would not want a situation like that to prevail.  It is time the Department was streamlined so as to eliminate long delays.  Some time ago the Minister said he would see to it that payment was expedited.  At that time I was trying to get an old age pension paid to a man who had been declared eligible 20 months before.  In fairness to the Minister I should say that after I wrote him a personal letter on the matter payment was made within a week.  In the first instance, that delay should not have taken place.  I would ask the Minister to continue his efforts to have prompt payment, to eliminate red tape so that there will not be long periods of uncertainty, during which old people have to implore shopkeepers and business people to come to their rescue with credit.</P>
    <P>In so far as there have been increases and improvements I welcome them but when translated into real terms, they are not what they appear.  In regard to a statement that was made on the other side of the House about the record of the National Coalition I should say that their record in regard to improving social welfare payments was a very creditable one. They introduced many improvements. <Col N="1257" /> To cite one or two only, they reduced the old age pension qualifying age to 66, the first reduction implemented in the qualifying age since its inception in 1908; they included categories of single parents for assistance; they granted payments to unmarried women of 57 and over.  In very many ways they improved the social welfare system.  They are entitled to great credit for their innovations.</P>

      <P>In the context of the situation in which we live one could say that the social welfare increases are reasonable.  At the same time it would be appropriate to select the Bill as a means of highlighting the inadequacy applicable to some social welfare recipients, that is to say, the inadequacy of how they are dealt with.  I refer particularly to old age pensioners, non-contributory retirement pensioners, widows' pensions, deserted wives' allowances and so on, and those on social assistance.  From the time I was a boy the attitudes of society do not seem to have changed.  The attitude always has been: well, if we do well in the other areas and if there is anything good left, we will spill it over to you.  The concept of tackling poverty was never a reality and nobody wanted to know anything about it.  I am afraid the attitude has not changed very much in all those years.  It has not changed from the time when a very large family, living in the late twenties or the early thirties, received nine shillings and two pounds of neck beef, or something like that, in social welfare benefit.  That attitude has been continued throughout our history, whether the economy was good, bad or indifferent, that is that if there was something left over we would apply it to the people, not in the sense of a real re-distribution of incomes, but rather that some percentage would be allocated to the area of real poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about poverty obviously we are referring to people in the lower income groups, by and large those in the social welfare area of old age pensions and so on.  In our society the only means of tackling poverty open to us is by increasing social welfare benefits. Frankly I do not think that achieves the objective.  We are missing the whole <Col N="1258" /> point.  When I say the only means open to us I say that in the context of a free enterprise system.  If we are doing well, you will get something; if we are not doing too well, then you will get less. There is another way and that is through a real re-distribution of wealth.  There is plenty to be re-distributed and there have been very good times for the economy. I do not exclude the Coalition Government from my criticism.  There is inequity in our society.  We do not care that 25 per cent of the population, including lower-paid workers, social welfare recipients and children under 14 years of age, are living in poverty.  We are supposed to cherish the children equally.  The people who talk about cherishing all of our children equally are prepared to keep them living in poverty.  There is no point in saying that we have not had opportunities in the past to make some improvements because we have indeed.  We had the chance to make some effort through the combat poverty projects, not in the sense that we would hand out benefits and so on, but in order that the people would get to know their rights and thereby be enabled to assert themselves more forcibly in society.  It was hoped that self-help would be one of the objectives to be achieved through these combat poverty projects.  I am not blaming the Government but, unfortunately, that Combat Poverty Committee have been disbanded.  If the will had been there those combat poverty projects could have been continued.  In this age of abundance of wealth living alongside poverty we still have the bulk of our children, whom we are supposed to cherish equally, denied a basic human right in this socio-economic sphere.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to tackle poverty in the manner we have been doing.  We give piecemeal increases, one Government giving 25 per cent, another 20 per cent and so on.  No matter how coldly or logically we quote figures, such piecemeal increases are eroded very rapidly because of the rapid rate of price increases not alone during the term of office of Fianna Fáil but of the National Coalition also.  As far as I am concerned poverty constitutes the most significant <Col N="1259" /> aspect of inequality in the whole socio-economic system.  The structural causes of poverty delve deeply into the very nature of the socio-economic climate in which we live.  As long as we are all happy to welcome piecemeal increases that is the way the situation will remain.  In perhaps ten, 15 or 20 years time we will still be congratulating some Minister &mdash; whether Coalition or Fianna Fáil &mdash; on the percentage increases he may be granting.  But we will still have the problem of poverty with us because there is no conscious political will to tackle real poverty. We will always be happy to grant such social welfare increases because it is a means of salving our consciences.  As legislators I suggest we have no right to accept the flagrant injustices that constitute the results of the social and economic forces which reflect the underlying trends in our society.</P>
    <P>Because social welfare beneficiaries are awaiting its provisions we must pass the Bill as quickly as possible.  In that sense we welcome the fact that something is happening.  But we should not hesitate to attack a system based on inequality. We all shout about inequality in every other sphere where there is some muscle. As Senator Harney said this afternoon, that particular section has not got the political muscle.  For that reason as legislators we tend to gloss over the situation, appeasing our consciences by this piecemeal method of endeavouring to overcome the problem.  The piecemeal methods are merely attempts at offsetting the problem.  Whether we like it or not poverty is an inherent element of the free enterprise system.  No matter at what free enterprise system one looks&mdash;and this is not an ideological view&mdash;there is poverty living alongside abundance.  We should not be afraid to attack it lest somebody points a finger at us and calls us reds under the bed.  I am no red under the bed.  I am not afraid to attack it nor should anybody else in this House.  Poverty will remain as long as our structures remain unchanged, in the sense of not tackling the whole question of redistribution of wealth.  We accept a recognisable degree of inequality.  There is in <Col N="1260" /> existence real and socially unacceptable degrees of inequality and consequently poverty emanating therefrom.  It is clearly in evidence in the form of the 25 per cent of population I mentioned earlier.  A large proportion of people who live in poverty are dependent on social welfare and live below reasonable standards.  In a society which claims to cherish all of its children we have no right to ask a certain percentage to live below reasonable standards of dignity and welfare.</P>
    <P>The irony of it all is that it is nothing new and will not finish there.  I maintained earlier that we had not dealt with our social welfare problems, particularly that of poverty in good times.  In times when the structure of our economy had altered significantly, when output had accelerated, Irish society remained characterised by many elements of economic imbalance and under-development. Even the best economic achievements did not remove inequality and poverty from our society.  Social Welfare Bills with piecemeal offerings were the best we had to offer.</P>
    <P>Frankly I hold out no hope of eliminating this poverty as long as we believe in the system: I am all right Jack and the devil take the hindmost.  For some inherent reason we make no effort to end our exploitative attitudes, there is no acceptance of the need to give power to the poor; we do not want to give power to the poor.  In my opinion an acceptance of a new order of priorities is called for and not merely piecemeal settlements in social welfare.  We should be actively seeking opportunities to help social welfare recipients&mdash;I am not saying every social welfare recipient because I am not dealing with people who are just out of work&mdash;the people who are subsisting in the poverty area, who have been recognised in ESRI research, combat poverty programmes and so on.  We should ensure that these deprived and neglected people in our society get a fairer deal.  It will not be solved by piecemeal adjustments.  The pace of change in life is too fast, the effects of other economies on ours will be advanced against the idea of tackling the real question of poverty.  I submit that that is not a valid argument; <Col N="1261" /> there is ample wealth in the country if only it were properly redistributed.  In the overall area of social welfare throughout the 60 year history of this State we have not really exercised the necessary political will with which to remove those inequalities.</P>

      <P>First, I shall refer to the remarks of Senator Harte, sincerely made, and which constituted a fair contribution though I would not agree with all of what he said.  I appreciate his objective, that of tackling poverty in our society.  I would submit to Senator Harte that in this Bill and indeed in last year's also, notwithstanding the extreme difficult economic circumstances obtaining&mdash;and Senator Harte will appreciate that these are particularly difficult economic times, not times when we can have <i>largesse</i> to disperse &mdash; we gave the two highest rates ever given in our history to beneficiaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Senator says but, referring specifically to this Bill, there is a genuine effort being made here, notwithstanding our present economic difficulties, to distribute income. That is a very real effort and it costs money.  It means that we have to find £144 million extra at this point in time to cover this year's expenditure which incidentally brings the total expenditure on social welfare now to £1,092 million.  It is no harm to get that in perspective.  Here I am referring not merely to what Senator Harte said but to what other Senators said earlier &mdash; there are 954,000 beneficiaries in total throughout the whole social welfare system &mdash; that excludes beneficiaries of children's allowances &mdash; generally, the various unemployment and long-term benefits for old age pensioners and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a huge and complicated system most of which operates fairly effectively and well in terms of delivering the services.  From time to time we experience difficulties with some parts of the administration, <Col N="1262" /> which were referred to by Senators.  It is important to realise that the total sum now being distributed, or re-distributed, is £1,092 million, which includes an extra £144 million this year.  If we look at the percentage of the gross national product &mdash; and this is reverting to Senator Harte's point about the distribution of the total wealth &mdash; the percentage was 9.6 in 1977 and it is over 11 per cent in 1981.  Therefore there is a genuine effort being made to increase the amount distributed in this way.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the spending of the extra £144 million.  It provides the increases we have mentioned: the 25 per cent, the 20 per cent, the 30 per cent in children's allowances.  It provides also for a very interesting and somewhat novel maternity scheme which will be particularly important to working women on lower incomes, especially those who have not been able to benefit very significantly from previous schemes.  It means that there will be a minimum payment.  That minimum payment of £20.45 for 12 weeks now becomes £45.75 for 14 weeks.  I think the Senator will agree that that constitutes a very significant improvement in that scheme, the minimum payment being £45.75.  I mentioned in my opening speech the effects of this in terms of people in different sectors.  It is a particularly important scheme and will be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>In the case of an old age pensioner under 80 with an adult dependant over 66 &mdash; in other words, an old age pension couple &mdash; the pension will go up from £42.80 to £53.55, an increase of £10.75 per week.  Given the circumstances of this year, that is a very reasonable and worthwhile increase.  The single pensioner has an increase of £6.15, bringing that level to £30.65.  When we look at the £53.55 I feel that for the first time we are approaching an amount of money for an old age pension couple which is meaningful.  I am very happy to be associated with the introduction of this Bill bringing these amounts into being.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to see these increases in their true perspective and I appreciate that Senators &mdash; just as did Deputies in the Dáil &mdash; will comment that while there <Col N="1263" /> is an increase they would like to see a lot more.  The problem is &mdash; as some Senators said &mdash; that somebody has to pay for them and it is difficult to see them in their true perspective.  But the increases provided for pensioners in this Bill compare very favourably with those announced recently in the British budget.  They show quite clearly that substantial improvements have been made notwithstanding our present economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>From next week a single old age contributory pensioner will receive an increase of £6.15 per week whereas the increase for a British pensioner and also a Northern Ireland pensioner amounts to £2.45.  Therefore we are talking here about legislation which brings an increase of £6.15 a week, starting next week whereas they in their circumstances &mdash; which are difficult also &mdash; are talking about £2.45 commencing on November 1 next.  I am sure that kind of increase would receive a very hot reception in this House or in the Dáil.  Notwithstanding the circumstances I am very glad we have done so much.  Then the increase for a married couple, for an old age contributory pension, from next week, will be £10.75 here while the comparable increase in the UK and Northern Ireland will be £3.90 from November next. Therefore to some extent this puts it in perspective.</P>
    <P>Several Senators raised the question of the adequacy of the increases in relation to changes in the consumer price index. Senators Howard and Robinson raised this question and spoke for some time about it.  It is relevant to look at what has happened in relation to the consumer price index.  If we look at the figures, the factual situation is that earnings have increased considerably more rapidly than the consumer price index and by a considerable extent.  Therefore when we compare social welfare payments with earnings we find that social welfare recipients have received advantages from our increasing prosperity.  I will give an example of that.  For example in regard to the old age contributory pension, between 1973 and 1977, the increase in social welfare payments over earnings for a single <Col N="1264" /> old age pensioner was nil; the actual increase against earnings was nil.  For the same person between 1977 and 1981 the actual increase against earnings was 22.5 per cent.  Therefore, Senators will recognise that there is a very real effort being made here to increase the long-term benefits particularly, which were at such a constant long-term low level, an effort to increase the position in real terms.  If we look at the old age contributory pension for a married couple we find that between 1973 and 1977, against earnings it constituted a reduction of 2 per cent; earnings went somewhat ahead of the social welfare benefits.  If we look at the position between 1977 and 1981 the increase over earnings of social welfare benefits was 22.6 per cent.  I could break that down into different parts and show it in different ways but that will suffice to indicate that there were real increases granted particularly those in the last two years, 1980 and 1981, have been real increases. While I agree with Senators who suggested that they would like to see more done, particularly in certain cases, we will continue to pursue improvements for those genuinely in the weaker sectors of our society.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult period but there were difficult periods previously.  If we take the 1976 and 1977 period the long-term beneficiaries in 1977 got an increase of 9 per cent, then, in October, an additional 5 per cent.  One Senator said he would like to see a two-tier increase with one slice being granted now and the other later.  Certainly the position will be kept under review but I think it was far better, again in 1980 and in 1981, to give a 25 per cent increase so that it applies to the whole of the year rather than to give, say, 9 or as, in 1976 a 10 per cent increase with the possibility of another 5 per cent as was paid in that case.  It is considerably less in real terms as I think anybody who measures the effects of it will recognise. In 1976, the increase was 10 per cent in long-term benefits and then 5 per cent supplementary increase in October while in 1977 the increase in the budget was 9 per cent and five per cent in October.</P>
    <P>In effect, what we are talking about is giving the full 25 per cent here and now <Col N="1265" /> and in effect these increases will apply from next week as I have said &mdash; hence the urgency for this Bill to be passed.</P>
    <P>There were quite a number of other questions raised.  Children's allowances are increased by 30 per cent and some of the Senators said that they did not really consider that this was adequate, that the whole thing needed to be changed in a very dramatic and major way.  This is something which we are reviewing, but it is also important to point out that children's allowances can only come from taxation.  This is one of the realities of the situation and the cost of increasing the children's allowances now by approximately 30 per cent &mdash; it varies slightly above it and slightly below it, depending on the number of children &mdash; is £12 million.  There is no fund to provide that additional cost at this stage and it brings the total cost of children's allowances this year to £92.2 million so you are talking about that much on children's allowances and that will give Senators some indication of the magnitude of the expenditure in that area and the kind of increase which is taking place now.  However it is something which we are reviewing in relation to family benefits generally but it is somewhat unreasonable not to welcome openly an increase of the order of 30 per cent because it is a particularly welcome increase and, as Minister, I am glad to be in the position to give this increase this year.</P>
    <P>There was a little bit of criticism here and there about my appearing happy or joyful about the Bill, or I was accused of boasting that the increases are substantial and significant.  In effect, if Senators read my speech they will not find much boasting in it.  I would say, though, that the increases are considerable.  I should be happy about this Bill because in the present circumstances it represents the biggest increases ever given in any terms, in real terms as well as in present-day terms, at any time, even over the whole of 60 years.  Senator Harte made that point fairly clear in his contribution.  Of course I am happy as Minister to be able to deliver increases of this order.  I would not be normal if I was not happy to be doing that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> Other questions which were raised were the questions of qualifying age at 66 and the basic means test level which applies to the non-contributory pensions only.  I think what Senators failed to recognise here is that the upper level is increased and in effect in those cases if you take a person with a means of £15, because of the increase in the upper level and the lengthening of the scales, he will receive increases of up to 50 per cent as a result of the technical effect of that measure.  So there is much more benefit in that than is apparent to the eye at first instance.</P>
    <P>Regarding the qualifying age of 66, the main question is that of the cost of changing that qualifying age.  It would cost £18 million to reduce it to 65 in present circumstances.  The Government opted instead to increase by a greater amount the levels of existing pensions.  This is something which will be considered further in future.</P>
    <P>The ultimate answer to many of these questions which relate to non-contributory pensions and to means tests is the national income-related pension scheme. That is something which I expect will be brought before the Government very shortly.  It is being considered in the various Departments at the moment and I would regard it as a very important measure.  I will do all I can to bring out the White Paper on that because I believe that in the longer term this is one of the best means of overcoming many of the difficulties raised in relation to assistance schemes.  If there is not a contribution, if there is not a fund, well then you are talking about taxation and if you are talking about the taxpayer paying directly for all the benefits concerned you are talking about a means test.  It is not very feasible otherwise because the expense would become far too great.</P>
    <P>Some Senators raised the question of the national fuel scheme.  Senator Howard suggested that the £3 a week is totally inadequate.  Unfortunately, I find, as Minister for Social Welfare, that no matter what I do it comes out when I come into either House as being regarded by some people as being totally inadequate. I must point out that I did achieve an <Col N="1267" /> increase of 33? per cent in the fuel scheme in August last and a further 50 per cent from 1 February this year.  Also at the same time I brought in a national scheme. In other words I had the scheme extended to cover everyone throughout the country on a general basis.  Now I know that within the scheme there are some anomalies, that there are some categories in the 17 towns who have a special benefit but there were a lot of people who did not benefit from the scheme previously and we did manage to have the scheme extended to cover those.  To get a scheme extended in the climate of this year, particularly so as to make it a national scheme &mdash; to grant an increase of 33? per cent in August last and a further increase of 50 per cent from 1 February &mdash; was a very significant development in the scheme.  I do not know of anyone in any party in previous years who developed a scheme in any way like that.  All I can say to Senators is that it is something which will be reviewed before we go into next winter.</P>
    <P>Senator Harney recognised the real increases which were there and made special pleas in relation to support for women at work and for housewives in relation to free dental and optical benefit for housewives.  We are examining the various aspects of this in terms of women who are working or who have worked outside the home for some time and so on with a view to seeing what can be done within the resources available.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson spoke about there being no room for congratulations or for complacency.  I agree about the complacency but I do not agree about the congratulations.  I think we are all to be congratulated on achieving what we have achieved and I would agree entirely that there is no room for complacency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson raised the question about not agreeing with the distinction between long-term and short-term benefits.  The Senator is forgetting that for unemployment benefit in particular there is a 15 month pay-related <Col N="1268" /> benefit on top of the unemployment benefit, the basic benefit.  If the person then transfers to assistance there is no pay-related benefit.  There are adjustments in relation to family size and whatever, but the distinction has been highlighted in the opposite way by some other Senators who said that those who are really in this long-term poverty situation must have special treatment.  Here we have had the case of the widows, old age pensioners and other long-term beneficiaries.  It is to adjust their position that the distinction was made.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson talked about the price of gas, about the ESB increases and about a family on £50 a week.  That was probably a slip of the tongue because even the family referred to here were on £45.75 a week.  The consumer price index takes in the overall increases and at the time in which these changes were made that was 18 per cent.  They do include increases for cigarettes and beer and various other things.  I accept that gas and the ESB have been two substantial elements in that increase but we have more than compensated for the overall increases and where the fuel schemes are available &mdash; this applied particularly to certain categories &mdash; they also go some of the way towards meeting those needs.</P>
      <P>Where Senators have raised the question of poverty and of people being in a poverty cycle, I would be very concerned with this situation and I assure the Senators that it is something to which we will give attention.  Globally, what we are doing in this Bill is one of the most important things, that is shifting a great deal of the wealth in that direction.  It does not mean necessarily that it is used by all groups or that all groups have equal access to or benefit from it.  Where anomalies like that exist I will certainly be concerned to do something about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of the community welfare officers and the scope that these officers have.  It is a fact that the community welfare officer has discretion to meet payments which he or she regards as excessive hardship on the beneficiaries.  Another Senator raised the question of having to go to a shopkeeper. One should not have to go to a shopkeeper <Col N="1269" /> when the supplementary welfare system is there.  I had a meeting recently with the chief executive officers of the health boards.  I asked them to bear in mind the difficult circumstances currently being experienced and to take that into consideration in exercising their discretion.  I would be anxious that that discretion would be exercised in a way which was practical and useful and which solved the problems, though I accept that they must take care that the more ready use of this discretion does not lead to abuse in some cases.  There is an over concern at times about such cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Kilbride raised the question of the prescribed relative allowance.  This allowance goes to the pensioner and not to the person who is minding the pensioner.  But we give credits to the relative who is minding an old-age pensioner for the period involved and that keeps him in benefit in relation to social welfare and pension benefits subsequently, but there is no direct payment currently.  Senator Kilbride also raised the question of one lady's children's allowance book.  We are having that investigated.  It is a specific case.  There are 440,000 of these books and there are constant changes in them, in effect, because you have children going out of benefit and new children coming into benefit and family sizes changing constantly.  This is something which has to be dealt with on a continuing basis. The question he raised is currently being investigated.</P>
    <P>Senator de Brún welcomed the Bill. He felt that congratulations were in order.  I have to agree with him on that. He was glad to give it a speedy passage in the House.  That is something to which I might make very brief reference.  It is essential that it has a speedy passage.  It has been delayed already because of all the talk in the Dáil about administration. Assuming that it is passed today, if there is any hitch in the printing stages there could be difficulty.  We have a motion, which hopefully will be passed, to deal with this.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe raised the question of people on disability benefit and the fact that they are not taxable in that situation, <Col N="1270" /> and that when the Department endeavour to change them to invalidity they then become taxable.  The reason why the Department are prepared to change them to invalidity is because they have longer-term benefit which is easier in operation and is at higher rates.  The rate for a married couple on invalidity is £5 higher per week.  Presumably they would wish to have that.  If they have in addition an income it is true that that income will be taxable as any other person's income is taxable.</P>
    <P>I will look at how this may affect people such as those mentioned by Senator McAuliffe, people with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease and other long-term diseases.  If there are anomalies occurring, I would certainly be keen to see if we could do anything about them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien raised the question of people having to go to the shopkeeper. I have covered that in relation to the supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should mention.  Perhaps a wrong impression was given when Senator Howard talked about unemployment benefit because he neglected to say that the pay-related benefit would apply in a case such as he mentioned.  If you take unemployment benefit &mdash; this is in the argument about long-term and short-term benefits &mdash; a man with a wife and three children would receive, including pay-related benefit, average income of £77 a week approximately.  That is roughly the situation.  I want to be sure that Senators are aware of the order of that benefit.  Any of the remarks made would apply to the long-term assistance beneficiaries rather than to unemployment benefits.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Senators for what were in the main constructive views on the Bill and for the support that they have said they will give to it.  I would be very glad if the Seanad would give it a speedy passage.</P>

    <P>firstly, to provide powers to control dumping at sea from ships, aircraft or <Col N="1272" /> marine structures and thus enable effective steps to be taken to prevent the pollution of the sea by substances and materials that are liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea, and secondly, to enable Ireland to ratify two international conventions, namely,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the 1972 Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the London Convention of the same year on the prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. </P>
    <P>In recent years international concern has been growing in regard to the risk of pollution of the sea through the deliberate dumping of noxious substances from ships, where the ship's voyage is undertaken for the specific purpose of getting rid of some hazardous substance.  The first incident of this kind to attract widespread international attention occurred in 1970, when an attempt was made to dump a cargo of poisonous chemical waste in the Atlantic.  Representations by a number of west European countries, including Ireland, led to the cancellation of the attempted dumping, but the incident served to focus attention on the growing practice of disposing of harmful substances by dumping them at sea and on the need for concerted action to prevent and combat marine pollution.</P>
    <P>International action was taken by way of the two conventions I have already mentioned.  The Oslo Convention, which came into force in April 1974 and has been ratified by 12 countries, applies, broadly speaking, to the sea areas northwards of Gibraltar and eastward of Greenland, including the North Sea, but excluding the Mediterranean and the Baltic&mdash;to which separate regional dumping conventions apply.</P>
    <P>The Oslo Convention provides principally that contracting states shall ensure that, within the sea areas covered by the convention:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> (a) the dumping of certain specified highly toxic substances shall be prohibited as well as other substances listed in Annex I to the convention:</P>
    <P>(b) the dumping in significant quantities of other less toxic substances or other substances and materials which may present a serious obstacle to fishing or navigation or seriously reduce amenities shall require for each occasion of dumping a specific permit from the national authority concerned; these substances and materials are listed in Annex II of the convention:</P>
    <P>(c) the dumping of any other substance or material shall require the approval of the national authority concerned; and</P>
    <P>(d) each national authority shall, in issuing permits or approvals for dumping at sea, take into account certain specified factors listed in Annex III to the convention, for example, characteristics of waste, dumping site, method of deposit and so forth. </P>
    <P>For the purpose of the Oslo Convention, dumping is defined as the deliberate disposal of substances and materials into the sea from ships, including fixed or floating platforms, or aircraft, other than any discharge incidental to the normal operation of a ship or aircraft, or the placing of substances or materials for a purpose other than the mere disposal thereof, provided that this is not contrary to the aim of the convention.  The latter exception would, for example, cover the use of disperants at sea to deal with an oil spillage.</P>
    <P>Each state ratifying the Oslo Convention undertakes to ensure compliance by its own ships and aircraft, by ships and aircraft of any country loading in its territory substances and materials with a view to dumping, and by ships and aircraft of any country dumping within its territorial seas, and to take appropriate measures <Col N="1274" /> to prevent and punish conduct in contravention of the convention.  Vessels entitled to sovereign immunity under international law, such as naval vessels are exempted from the terms of the convention, although states are expected to ensure that in practice they comply as far as possible.  Contracting states also agree to assist one another as appropriate in dealing with dumping incidents and to exchange information on methods of dealing with such incidents.</P>
    <P>The London Convention, which came into force in August 1975 and has been ratified by 45 countries, is in substance and form generally similar in most respects to the Oslo Convention.  Its scope is much wider, however, in that it applies to all the seas and oceans of the world.  It has a number of other differences and variations of emphasis.  For example, it specifically prohibits the dumping of high level radioactive waste declared by the International Atomic Energy Agency as unsuitable for dumping at sea and also the dumping of mineral oils taken on board for the purpose of dumping, Incineration at sea as a means of waste disposal is also controlled by the convention.</P>
    <P>The prohibitions on dumping at sea imposed by the Oslo and London conventions are specially expressed in the conventions not to apply in case of <i>force majeure</i> due to stress of weather or any other cause, when safety of human life or of a ship, aircraft or marine structure is threatened, if dumping appears to be the only way to avert the threat, but full details of the occurrence are required to be reported to the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO), which administers the London Convention, and, as appropriate, to the Oslo Commission.  If, in an emergency, a state considers that a prohibited substance cannot be disposed of on land without unacceptable danger or damage, it is obliged under the conventions to consult with IMCO and, where appropriate, the Oslo Commission, which shall recommend the most satisfactory methods of storage, destruction or disposal in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> As an island nation we have a particular interest in preventing pollution of the sea and in the general protection of the marine environment, in the interests of human health, marine life and amenities.  Ireland's geographical position, in conjunction with the pattern of prevailing winds and currents, renders it particularly vulnerable to the effects of dumping of harmful substances in the North Atlantic.  The danger of our situation is accentuated by the natural tendency of vessels engaged in dumping, on economic grounds, to choose a dumping site no further west into the Atlantic than is absolutely necessary.  By joining with other nations in taking measures for the strict control of dumping at sea of toxic, noxious and other objectionable materials, we will be protecting our own interests and at the same time contributing to international efforts to improve protection of the marine environment generally for the benefit of all humanity.</P>
    <P>As an indication of support for the international objectives in this area, Ireland is already a signatory to both the Oslo and London conventions.  However, it is only by ratification of the conventions and enforcement of their provisions that we can demonstrate our full commitment to them.  I can tell the Seanad that it is the Government's intention to ratify both conventions as soon as possible after the Dumping at Sea Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Basically, the Bill is a very simple one. In accordance with the provisions of the convention, it prohibits dumping at sea or loading at a place within the state or in its territorial seas for dumping at sea, from any vessel, aircraft or marine structure, of any substance or material, unless such dumping or loading takes place under and in accordance with a permit granted under section 3 of the Bill or under an authorisation granted by another state that is party to either convention.  This prohibition on dumping will apply, firstly, to all sea areas under our jurisdiction, including tidal waters, and secondly, anywhere at sea where the vessel, aircraft or marine structure concerned in the dumping is Irish.</P>
    <P>As in the conventions, provision is <Col N="1276" /> made in the Bill whereby the restrictions on dumping will not apply in certain emergency situations, but the Bill also provides that any such dumping must be reported to the Minister not later than seven days after it takes place.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the Bill, dumping means deliberate disposal at sea, including disposal by incineration, of any substance or material from a vessel, aircraft or marine structure.  It includes disposal of material from dredgers or other such vessels specially constructed for the disposal of materials at sea but excludes disposal incidental to the normal operation of the vessel, aircraft or marine structure.  Disposal of materials directly into the sea from a land based source is not comprehended by the Bill.  This is controlled by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, which also controls dumping into rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>In so far as oil pollution is concerned, the Bill applies to deliberate dumping of oil but does not apply to the accidental discharge of oil from ships such as spills arising from a marine casualty.  The oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977, cover such incidents and provide for heavy penalties for pollution damage, even where spills are accidental.</P>
    <P>Dispersants used for combating oil pollution are likewise excluded from the scope of the Bill.  A strict licensing requirement on the lines envisaged in the Bill would not be appropriate for such substances which have to be used at short notice.  The use of these substances is already subject to control by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the grant or refusal of permits for dumping or for loading for the purpose of dumping.  Before taking a decision on any application for permits, the Minister will have to consult with the Ministers for the Environment, Fisheries and Forestry, Industry, Commerce and Tourism and Energy and he will also have to take into consideration the provisions of Annex III of both the Oslo and London conventions, which are set out in the table to section 3 of the Bill.  Provision is being made for charging a fee in respect of an <Col N="1277" /> application for a permit and for an additional fee related to the cost of any monitoring, surveys and examinations necessary in any case in which it is proposed to grant a permit.</P>
    <P>To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill, it is proposed under section 4 that authorised officers may be appointed by the Minister and, in the case of radioactive substances and materials, by the Minister for Energy.  In addition, authorised officers may be appointed, specifically in respect of the harbours under their control, by the various harbour authorities, the Commissioners of Public Works and Córas Impair Éireann.  It is intended that an authorised officer will have wide powers enabling him, <i>inter alia</i>, to enter any vehicle, place or premises, to board any vessel, aircraft or marine structure and to carry out any inspection and examination which he considers reasonably necessary.  He will be empowered to detain a vessel, aircraft or marine structure if he suspects that a contravention of the Act is taking place or has already taken place.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the prosecution of offences and specifies the penalties for such offences.  In particular, it provides for substantial penalties, including imprisonment in certain cases, for contraventions of the restrictions on dumping imposed by section 2.  It is the Minister's hope that the possibility of substantial penalties on conviction will be an effective deterrent to would-be offenders.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, dumping at sea originating from Irish ports has not constituted a problem.  Some treated sewage sludge is dumped in Dublin Bay by Dublin Corporation and material dredged by harbour authorities in connection with harbour maintenance or improvement works is dumped at various places around the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>Some industrial wastes are dumped off the south coast in accordance with licences issued by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry under the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1959.  Dumping of this nature will also be comprehended by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The spirit of the Oslo and London conventions <Col N="1278" /> is that harmful dumping at sea should be prevented as far as possible and it is the Minister's intention that the Bill will be administered in the same spirit.  Applicants for permits will have to satisfy him that there is no suitable alternative means of disposal of the substances for which they seek a permit and, where necessary, before any permit is granted special tests and investigations will be carried out to assess the possible effects of the proposed dumping.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw special attention to the fact that provision is made in section 3(8) whereby, in the case of radioactive substances and materials, the powers under this Bill will be vested in the Minister for Energy rather than in the Minister for Transport.  This will avoid a duality of responsibility in relation to those substances and materials.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is obviously an extremely welcome development.  I do not think the ringing tones of the Minister and the triumphant manner in which he informed us of the great things this Bill is going to do were quite justified.  I give the Bill a qualified welcome.  We have some serious reservations about various provisions in the Bill and this party will try to have amendments accepted on various provisions. Obviously, the whole question of dumping at sea and the possible consequences for a small maritime country like ourselves is a very relevant one in this day of such advanced technological and industrial development and also because we have to close off possible escape routes for large companies who have been controlled in other areas, on land, as regards dumping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there have been only seven licensed dumpings off the coast of this country over the years.  We have been relatively unaffected, as yet, by pollution caused by dumping at sea.  That is a matter of luck rather than foresight on our part.  We have got away with it over the years.  We stand to benefit enormously from the implementation of the Oslo Convention, 1972, for the prevention of <Col N="1279" /> marine pollution and the London Convention, 1972.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves, before we go on to discuss it any further, of the awful state of the Mediterranean Sea which is now a complete write off in terms of purity and has been misused and abused because of lack of co-operation of all the countries with a coastline onto the Mediterranean.  It is also relevant to remind ourselves that although there has been a lot of excitement about accidental oil spillage from large oil tankers at sea more oil is dumped at sea than is accidentally spilled.</P>
    <P>There has been an extraordinarily long delay in bringing this Bill before the House when one looks at 1972 as the date of these two important conventions which are the basis of the Bill.  Such legislation introduced in so many countries, is part of the modern arsenal of safeguards against the worst depredations of industrial progress.  It is part of a very important modern weaponry which environmental lawyers and those concerned with the protection of the environment work on and bring before their governments' attention.</P>
    <P>This Bill comes under the heading of an important weapon against the awful side-effects of industrial progress.  Ireland should have seized on this opportunity to join international efforts like this. We should have taken the opportunity long before now to avail of the international expertise which went into the conventions of Oslo and London.  We are very lucky to be able to benefit from international efforts like this, but why has it taken so long to introduce these measures?  It is now 1981 and the first incident of deliberate dumping of noxious substances occurred in 1970.  It was as a result of that incident that the two conventions were undertaken.  If it has taken us nine years to get around to bringing this Bill before the House, we must find out why it has taken nine years.  We have to ask ourselves what could have happened during those nine years.  The most alarming aspect is that it raises the question of what other delays are occurring in other vital areas which might affect this country <Col N="1280" /> where we wake up too late to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a notoriously bad reputation in regard to speed of implementation of international conventions.  This is something that, unfortunately, we cannot put down to natural caution.  We have to face up to the fact that we have a very bad record as to implementing conventions and that it has nothing to do with how carefully and painstakingly we study them.  There is wrangling and inefficiency of a bureaucratic nature which go on in a most half-hearted and long-drawn out manner behind the scenes.  If delays and bungling occur as a result of wrangling between bureaucrats, the blame has to be laid firmly at the door of successive Ministers, including Ministers who have held office since 1977 or more recently. Because the buck stops with the Government the buck stops with Ministers.</P>
    <P>There has been an example of a delay like this one in implementing some of the amendments to the 1954 Oil Pollution of the Sea Convention.  These 1969 amendments were not implemented until 1980&mdash;a delay of 11 years&mdash;by the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Records) Regulations 1980.  That too is an absolutely appalling delay.  The mind boggles at the thought that Ireland is not making use of the kind of international armaments available to us against pollution and disasters.  It is blameworthy that there should be such long delays.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Oil Pollution of the Sea Convention meant that ships would have to keep strict records of what was happening to their stocks of oil and whether there was any oil jettisoned around the world.  It is extraordinary that it should take us 11 years to implement that convention.</P>
    <P>I would refer to a world-wide journal, <i>The International Environment Reporter.</i> This journal reports on international environmental measures right across the world and is a very prestigious document. It refers at some length to the Bill before us.  It is a pity that I have to quote something like this from an international document, <i>International Environment Reporter</i>, Volume 3, No. 8, of August 13, 1980 which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> Informed sources told IER that civil service wranglings on this issue delayed the introduction of the Bill for years.</P>
    <P>The issue that they were discussing was which Government Department should be responsible for marine pollution and for the measures being introduced to deal with this matter.  The problem was whether it should be the Department of Fisheries or the Department of the Environment. Obviously a third element entered into it and perhaps delayed it even further, because now the Department of Transport have been added and that in itself is another question mark.  I am not denying that it is very important to decide definitively which Departments will be in charge of different areas but I wonder what sort of a country we are running when we cannot decide that much sooner and get this kind of legislation through Parliament.  The Members of these Houses are elected by the people to make decisions and to make laws in the name of the people.</P>
    <P>On the question of the mechanics of implementing the Bill, I was very interested to learn from the Minister and to read in the Bill all the things that these special authorised officers will do in terms of implementing the very complex responsibilities which the Bill imposes on the Minister's Department.  What kind of staff, facilities and infrastructure backing has the Minister acquired for implementing the Bill?  The Directory of State Services lists only six or seven surveyors in the technical section of the Department of Transport.  I understand that these surveyors are already involved in the enforcement of harbours and oil pollution legislation.  The mind boggles at how many people will be required to implement this Bill.  What provision has the Minister been making for the acquisition of the kind of skilled personnel and facilities in his Department that will make enforcement of the Bill a reality?</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that the demands which will be placed on the people charged with implementing this Bill will increase every day because of nuclear science, industrialisation generally, the <Col N="1282" /> proliferation of toxic substances and the efforts of multinational companies to find places to dump toxic waste.  The demand on the Minister's Department will be enormous.  How will this Bill be implemented to protect this country?  The fact that we have a debate on the Bill and go through the motions of legislating does not confer protection from marine pollution.  It is easy sometimes to convince ourselves that talk is action, when talk is only clearing the decks for action.  Will the Minister say how he intends to provide this protection in reality?</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned about the way the Minister or Ministers will decide on who will or will not get a licence for dumping of different substances at sea. My main concern is the lack of mention of citizen participation in that kind of decision making.  It flies in the face of modern environmental practice that there should not be a very strong provision that citizens may join in the decisions about the issue of licences.  I see nothing in this Bill to allow third parties such as environmental protection groups to be informed about what is happening or to be consulted about what is happening.  I am very disappointed that citizen participation is not provided for.  I will be bringing forward amendments on section 3.</P>
    <P>I do not mean that one would hope that every second Joe Soap will bang in appeals or disagreements about licences, but there are expert citizens who should be brought in to work in co-operation with the people who are running this country, either individually or in groups.  For example, groups like An Taisce have acquired an expertise and have expert committees.  Organisations like that should be used and should be welcomed by Government Departments.  There should be every possible opportunity for groups like that to make a major input to protection of the environment.  I do not believe that undue delays would be caused.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of problems with delays in planning appeals, but in the matter of dumping of toxic material only real experts would come in to discuss with the Minister the kind of problems which would arise and this kind of expert skill <Col N="1283" /> and knowledge are not possessed by the ordinary individual.  We should encourage experts to contribute to decisions in these areas.  It is unusual internationally to have environmental legislation which does not have very good specific requirements for input from citizens.  I am very interested to hear if the Minister can perhaps consider amending the legislation to allow this to happen.  A register of licences should be maintained in a public office available for public inspection.  I can find no mechanism in the Bill whereby the public will have easy access or full rights to see what licences have been issued.  I cannot understand the reason for this apparent secrecy.  There should be far more requirement for publicity for licence applications.  I can see no reason why people should not be compelled to publish their intention to apply for a licence in the public newspapers. This is surely a minimum requirement. The people who will be looking for the kind of licence we are talking about are highly skilled very wealthy multinational companies who are very adept at dealing with laws and getting around laws and doing their own thing very efficiently. More power to them; that is what they are in business for; but we must make sure that our citizens who may be harmed by their activities have full knowledge of the position and full rights to protect themselves against such companies.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a register of licences open to public inspection during normal office hours.  I would also like to see provision that, before a licence is issued, the Minister shall take account of the objections and representations of interested members of the public and scientific or other expert bodies.  There are people who might well be able to inform the Minister about some company applying for a licence a company which might have a very bad record in other countries, which perhaps might have escaped the Minister's attention.  There are experts on toxic substances here who could give advice to the Minister on this question.</P>
    <P>Those are my main worries about this Bill although obviously the spirit and the intentions behind it are very admirable. <Col N="1284" /> The problem of the incredible delay is something which must worry all of us and the problem of citizen participation in the whole question of the disposal of toxic substances must be tackled and should have been tackled in the Bill.  I hope that before the Bill goes on the Statute Book it will have been amended to include provision for citizen participation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State back to a full active life within the Oireachtas.  He had my greatest sympathy in regard to the unfortunate accident which befell him as a result of which we all felt &ldquo;There, but for the grace of God, go I.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>An important and interesting aspect of this Bill is that it embraces so many Ministerial boundaries, as the Minister said, Transport, Environment, Fisheries, Industry, Commerce and Tourism and Energy, but when it is put into practice it controls only one aspect of dumping at sea.  I, therefore, hope that this legislation is the forerunner of many other Bills which will ensure greater control over our ill-conceived plans in the future so that we do not perpetuate the disastrous decisions which are sorely affecting our natural habitation.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that, as an island nation, we have a particular interest in preventing pollution at sea and in the general protection of the marine environment.</P>
      <P>I took particular notice of the address of the Minister for the Environment in the confidence debate in the Dáil in which he stressed the necessary liaison between his Department and local authorities and how their combined contribution to the economy is immense, affecting virtually everybody in one way or another, as the providers of essential infrastructural services such as water sewerage facilities and roads which are prerequisites for industrial development.  The Minister for the Environment illustrated aspects which lead to dumping at sea.  Successive Governments have not fully recognised the importance of arterial drainage which is a continuing problem around the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that up to the present dumping at sea has not <Col N="1285" /> constituted a problem.  A most alarming example was reported last year in Dublin Bay where pollution levels exceed the mandatory limits allowed by the EEC. The pollution of Blackrock for instance is eight times above the limit imposed by the Brussels directive in 1975.  I was somewhat relieved that the Dun Laoghaire councillors were shocked at these facts but I wonder what has been done in the meantime.  The worst areas are north of Blackrock baths and Seafield Road in Killiney, but the levels along the entire coastline around Dun Laoghaire are higher than the limits desired in Ireland.  The extent of the pollution was revealed in a regular survey carried out by Dr. Brendan O'Donnell, the Dublin medical officer, and samples were taken last September.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Donnell said in his report to the council that the sea was choppy and that the figures were unusually high.  Controversy erupted last summer when Dr. O'Donnell warned that shellfish from parts of the coast around Dublin could cause typhoid.  Caution signs were put up to act as warnings to the public.  For some time local people have been complaining that untreated sewage is flowing into the sea at Seapoint.  The Bill obviously does not go far enough to control this type of unwelcome dumping at sea which is hazardous to human health and survival.</P>
    <P>As a Dubliner, I regarded Killiney Bay as one of the most beautiful places in the world, and I have heard it likened to the Bay of Naples.  But in recent years the view has dramatically changed and the picture in this year's Irish Life calendar bears no resemblance to the position today.  It is a pity that we should use this calendar in the promotion of our tourist facilities when the scene is quite different.  Killiney is built up and there is a large number of houses around Ballybrack and the adjoining areas.  A complex is planned for something like 70,000 people.  The drainage must flow into Killiney Bay.  I am not just talking about sewerage, I am talking about all drainage into rivers.  Drainage is causing a tremendous problem in the sea around Dublin.</P>
    <P>The building development, including the thousands of dwellings that I mentioned, <Col N="1286" /> together with the road infrastructures, mean that there is no place for rainwater to go.  The land is covered with concrete and the water has to flow into streams which are now becoming rivers and are carrying all the flotsam and jetsam of plastics, bedsteads, bicycles, wheels and everything into the sea at Killiney.  Killiney beach now looks like the latest dumping ground around Dublin.  It is a great tragedy.  Also the tidal waves tend to sweep back the outflow of these estuaries which are not planned for, thus causing coastal erosion.  I have been in correspondence with the Corporation in Dun Laoghaire about this.  It is the increasing level of the river that is causing coastal erosion around Killiney and not the tides.  Quite recently it was impossible to walk along the each because of flooding although this has been an established public amenity for many years.  Apart from the effluents and the odours, objects are being dumped into Killiney Bay.</P>
    <P>I referred to the problem of the east coast of Dublin to draw the Minister's attention to the responsibility of the local authorities for dumping at sea in such an insidious way.  We can think of many other examples around Ireland's beautiful coast where similar ill-planned disaster areas are affecting our natural environment &mdash; the dumping of untreated sewerage in the town of Midleton into Cork Harbour, caravan sites sewage pipes going into such world famous beauty resorts as Glengariff, and the serious risk to beaches in Galway Bay. Enterprising developers are being highly criticised but they have not been made aware of the hazards they are causing.</P>
    <P>Pollution is one of the greatest threats facing the world today.  This Bill recognises only one form of pollution, to underpin, as the Minister says, the London Convention and the Oslo Convention.  We should have an all-Ireland convention to initiate a Bill which would prevent dumping at sea within our territorial waters including river estuaries. We are committed to pursuing with alacrity and enthusiasm our economic and industrial development but we must hasten to impose &mdash; I agree with Senator Hussey on this &mdash; more cautious planning <Col N="1287" /> restrictions so that future generations will not be poisoned by the lack of co-ordinated control.  With an increasing population, enterprising opportunism is bound to flourish and I hope the Minister will use his influence to impress on the Minister for the Environment the necessity to pursue more urgently this policy of liaison with his Department and the local authorities throughout our island so that everyone is made more fully aware of the hazards we face.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a first step in safeguarding the glorious natural surroundings which we were fortunate to inherit, and I hope, starting with the Litter Bill there will be other Bills which will soon be introduced to overcome this very dramatic problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Senators for their participation in the Second Reading debate.  I thank Senator Hussey for her welcome for the Bill albeit somewhat qualified by some of her subsequent remarks.  I would greatly regret if I thought that my triumphant tone suggested that the matter would be passed without any undue delay.  I was hoping that it might be possible to give it unanimous support and I am still hopeful on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation at present is that there are some four licences currently in operation for dumping off our coasts.  Should Senator Hussey require any further information on the permits and what they cover I would be only too delighted to accommodate her in that regard at any time.  Senator Hussey made considerable reference to the Mediterranean situation and I have to concur with her opinions in that regard in that there is a situation there that we would not like repeated off our coasts or in the Irish Sea.  I suppose the situation in the Irish Sea would be the nearest thing we could have to the Mediterranean situation.  However, I can reassure Senator Hussey that such is not the case and that it is our concern to see to it that the Mediterranean situation is not repeated in our waters.  This Bill <Col N="1288" /> might be referred to as a substantial step towards ensuring that that will not be the case now or in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey alleged that there was considerable delay in having this Bill brought before the House.  A Dumping at Sea Bill was introduced in July 1976 arising from the Oslo and London conventions which came into force in 1974 and 1975 respectively.  One would not regard the introduction of such a Bill in 1976 as indicating undue delay, in the circumstances.  However, it was not proceeded with at that time because of pressure of other legislative work.  It was not possible to proceed with the preparation of the text at that time.  On the dissolution of the Dáil in 1977 it lapsed.</P>
    <P>The current Bill was introduced in 1980.  Perhaps because of my inability to attend in 1980 we are now dealing with it in 1981.  However, in all the circumstances appertaining to the Bill and to the promotion of the Bill by the Department, there is no good foundation for the remark that there has been undue delay in promoting the Bill.  Indeed, I must refute the suggestion that the delay was due to any wrangling between Departments.  A great deal of urgent business had to be dealt with during that period. I think there was a shortage of staff in the section which might have accounted somewhat for the delay that did take place.  I know it is no excuse.  There has been no serious dumping at sea in the intervening period but that is not a justification for any delay.  I readily understand that but, at the same time, it is reassuring to know that no serious dumping has taken place.  We are assured of that because of our international participation in IMCO and other agencies which keep us fully informed of all permits granted for the disposal of any matter at sea.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey asked about the authorised staff, how many there are, from which Departments they come, and the implementation of the provisions of the Bill when it becomes law.  I may be able to persuade Senator Hussey to give me all stages of the Bill this evening if I refer to the complement of staff which may be necessary for the full implementation <Col N="1289" /> of the Bill, and the number of officers that will be necessary to deal with its provisions.  It will be somewhere in the region of 40 to 50 officers.  Half a dozen or so will be drawn from both the Department of Transport and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  The harbour authorities will provide the biggest complement of staff &mdash; up to 25 people.  The Office of Public Works will be involved and CIE will provide at least one officer. The Nuclear Energy Board will also provide an officer.  The staff complement is available to deal with the matter in hand. In particular the Department of Fisheries and Forestry will have their aquatic environment unit dealing with the matter.  I understand they have all the necessary chemists, biologists and technicians available in that unit to deal effectively with permits sought by interested bodies. They also have sufficient engineering staff available to deal with any matters that might arise.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board, because of their involvement in regard to radioactive waste, will be very closely concerned.  I understand that the Nuclear Energy Board have about six scientists and engineers and other staff to deal with all permits requested.  They will be involved in the assessment of the licence applications, the assessment of the environment impact, and also the question of the issue of the licences.  They will also monitor the permit once it has issued.  All in all I can assure the Seanad that sufficient trained staff will be available, staff with very high technical qualifications. They will have access to the expertise of all the countries who are participating in the conventions.  As a member of IMCO we have had access to that expertise for some time.  Ireland has been represented at all the meetings of the joint monitoring groups, thereby providing the necessary information to the officers working in the Department of Transport, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and the Nuclear Energy Board.  We have available the necessary expertise to deal effectively with the licence requests and the subsequent monitoring and surveying.</P>
    <P>The Senator dealt with citizen participation in the granting of permits.  I suggest <Col N="1290" /> to Senator Hussey that there is sufficient expertise in the various Departments to deal effectively with any applications that come before us.  It is well to point out that the seeking of permits for dumping at sea is not a major problem at this time.  The Department are very conscious of their responsibilities and are taking this step in advance of any serious dumping that might occur because of our increased technology and our increased heavy industry situation. There is nothing secretive as far as the Department are concerned in dealing with these permits.</P>
    <P>The Department have a register for their own purposes and that register is necessary when one considers that all permits issued are notified to the executives of IMCO and the other consultative bodies under the Oslo and London conventions.  The information concerning permits is available.  It might not be in the best public interest at all times if details of the waste to be disposed of were a matter for public participation. Almost invariably dumping of waste is a result of high technology.  Waste has to be disposed of and this Bill is trying to ensure that when it is disposed of at sea it will be done in accordance with the best conditions and conventions available at this time in this part of the world. There is nothing secretive in the Department as far as dumping is concerned.</P>
    <P>I recognise fully that there are experts other than the experts in the various Departments to which I referred.  The advantage the experts in the Department of Transport, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and the Nuclear Energy Board have is that they are in constant consultation with their fellow experts attached to the various conventions and commissions.  They are continually attending meetings of these bodies and consequently they are recognised experts in dealing with applications from interested parties.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hussey that not all the people seeking permits to dump waste at sea have good records.  That, basically is one of the reasons why this legislation is necessary.  It is being enacted before any great number of permits <Col N="1291" /> are sought in this country to ensure that none of the &ldquo;bad boys&rdquo; of dumping practice gets a permit to dump matter deleterious to our environment or to our marine life.  It is significant that all the countries of western Europe are involved in these conventions.  We are a party to all the expertise and we have knowledge of all permits sought and granted in all other countries.</P>
    <P>There is one little point which should be made at this time.  Dumping at sea of the type of substance in the type of quantity that has been referred to is a very expensive business.  It is not a small operation.  I agree that monitoring, surveying and researching are absolutely necessary.  Dumping at sea is an expensive business.  Because of that aspect, what is being dumped and where it is proposed to dump it is always known.  I am satisfied that we have the experts and that they will be appointed in due course to deal with any permits requested from the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Senator Lambert for his very kind words of personal welcome to me after the unfortunate business near Castlebar in early December, and to thank him for his welcome for the Bill.  I agree with him that we are all very much concerned with pollution levels in the sea and, in particular, pollution levels in the sea in and about Dublin.  It is important to remember that pollution of Dublin Bay might arise from land-based sources or discharges from pipelines. That is the kind of pollution he was referring to and not pollution from ships loaded in other areas and dumped outside or inside our territorial waters.  The main purpose of this Bill is to deal with dumping at sea from ships, or platforms, or marine structures of that kind.  The question of pollution and discharge of sludge or sewerage in Dublin Bay is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  A separate convention, the Paris Convention, deals quite effectively with this.  We propose to ratify that in the very near future.  We can all agree with the Senator's sentiments about keeping a very tight control over dumping or pollution of any kind which can have a deleterious <Col N="1292" /> effect and can be harmful to the environment, to marine life and our general amenities.</P>
    <P>Senator Lambert referred specifically to river pollution.  As I said, the disposal of materials directly into the sea from land based source is not comprehended by this Bill.  It is controlled by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, which deals with discharges into rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised by Senators.  This Bill ratifies the Oslo and London conventions to which we are signatories and we will apply the provisions in them.  We are anxious and willing, and we have the necessary expertise, to implement the provisions of these two conventions.  We feel that we are not asking too much in asking for a speedy passage for the Bill, and hopefully Senator Hussey will accommodate me.  I appreciate the words of welcome for the Bill.  Hopefully it will get a speedy passage through the House.</P>

    <Title>Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 18 February, 1981, takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Implementation of Council Directives which was laid before the Seanad on 11th March, 1981 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
      <P>Despite the time of day and the number of Senators here to listen to the debate, this motion is a singularly important one. Effectively, what we are debating is whether it is proper that two EEC schemes, in respect of the administration of a sum of £57.5 million according to the Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 1980, more than a quarter of the total agriculture Vote, should be administered by the Minister without any legislation justifying or controlling his expenditure of these moneys. Perhaps I should put it a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is not merely dealing with expenditure of the order I have mentioned, that is to say in excess of one quarter of the total Vote for the Department. <Col N="1294" />  It is also dealing with the expenditure of moneys from the European Community, the expenditure of a sum which I cannot tell the House but which the Minister will know.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is the first time the Minister has come here but I should very much like to welcome him, and most particularly to welcome him to a debate on a report of the Joint Committee of which he was a very active member and, indeed, the chairman of a very active sub-committee.  He knows a good deal, therefore, about the Joint Committee's view on this.  No doubt he knows a good deal about the view of the Minister for Agriculture on it.</P>
    <P>From the very first days of the Joint Committee we have been at issue with the Department of Agriculture on this matter.  The first report drawing attention to it was signed by no less a person than the present Taoiseach on 28 April 1974. A further report, again signed by the then Deputy Haughey, was made on 2 July 1975 and, apart from the present report, I reported earlier on 19 December 1979.</P>
    <P>Two important questions arise.  The first is as to whether from the point of view of expenditure there is appropriate justifying legislation in existence.  More important for my purpose as Chairman of the Joint Committee is whether there is adequate parliamentary scrutiny of two Acts of the European Community.  These Acts relate to the disadvantaged areas scheme and the farm modernisation scheme, both of which have very significant political, social and economic consequences.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best way to introduce the House to this is to remind the House of the legislation governing this matter.  The European Communities Act, 1972, which is the principal Act, provided that from 1 January 1973 the treaties governing the Communities and the existing and future acts adopted by the institutions shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.  Section 3 provides that a Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 to have full effect.  Section 4, which was introduced by the amending Act of <Col N="1295" /> 1973, provided that regulations made under section 3 should have statutory effect and should be capable of annulment if the Joint Committee, of which I am the present chairman, should recommend to the House that such regulations should be annulled.</P>
    <P>The scheme of the code contemplated that there would be an Act of Parliament enacting as domestic legislation what did not become domestic legislation by virtue of the Treaty of Rome or, failing an Act of Parliament, that the appropriate Minister would make regulations giving effect to the Act and, by regulation, make it part of the domestic law.  Such an order was to be subject to the scrutiny of the Joint Committee.  This is referred to in section 4, introduced by section 1 of the amending Act.  It was to be subject to scrutiny of such a kind that, if the regulations made by the Minister did not seem to be right, if the manner in which he was choosing to give effect in domestic law to the act of the institutions did not meet with the approval of the committee as the parliamentary scrutineer, the order containing such regulations and introducing such domestic law could be annulled, or there would be a debate about its annulment in this House and in the other.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, the Minister, his colleagues and his predecessors have from the beginning claimed to be entitled to administer these schemes without any legislation other than such support there may be for what they are doing as may be found in the terms of the Appropriation Act with which I will have to deal in a moment.  In the report of the Joint Committee of 28 April 1976, the Joint Committee drew attention to the concept of direct applicability of Community secondary legislation and pointed out that:</P>
    <P>where such legislation is not directly applicable, it cannot give rise to individual rights and obligations in Irish municipal law without the enactment of domestic implementing legislation. In the case of a scheme initiated by a Council Directive which is not directly applicable, as is usually the case</P>
    <P>and is the case here both in relation to <Col N="1296" /> the disadvantaged areas scheme and in relation to the farm modernisation scheme&mdash;</P>
    <P>the question arises as to what domestic legislation is sufficient if the scheme is financed partly from Community and partly from national funds.  The Joint Committee doubts if Members of the Oireachtas appreciate that if the Houses, by passing the annual Appropriation Bill, appropriate money to a particular scheme which is not founded on other legislation, they are deemed to be giving the Minister concerned <i>carte blanche</i> to administer the scheme as he sees fit.  Nevertheless, this seems to be the effect of a Supreme Court decision, [Latchford and Sons Ltd. v. Minister for Industry and Commerce (1950) IR 33].  Although it is not at all clear to the Joint Committee that this decision is applicable to schemes financed partly from Community and partly from national resources, it may be that a different view is held in some Government Departments.  The Joint Committee believes that the Houses in setting up the Joint Committee considered that they were establishing machinery to monitor Community secondary legislation at all stages from its inception as a proposal to its final implementation in Irish law.  In particular, it is of opinion the Houses intended to control the detailed application of Community secondary legislation in so far as it requires domestic law to give it full effect.  In the Joint Committee's view this objective is frustrated when the terms of schemes such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are embodied neither in a statutory instrument, which is subject to the scrutiny of the Joint Committee, nor in a Bill, which can be considered by the Houses themselves.</P>
    <P>That has been the consistent view expressed by the Joint Committee, both in the report signed by Deputy Haughey and in the subsequent reports which I was directed by the Joint Committee to sign.  I do not think it is possible to contend that the scheme of the European Communities Act contemplated that <Col N="1297" /> there would be acts which would give rise to expenditures of such an order and which would involve receipts of matching expenditures of such an order that the Minister would claim that by virtue of the existing controls of public expenditure there was no need for him to make an order which would give rise to an examination by the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the European Communities Act reads:</P>
    <P>A Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect.</P>
    <P>I will read section 2 again:</P>
    <P>From the 1st day of January, 1973, the treaties governing the European Communities and the existing and future acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
    <P>Then as I have said, section 3 says that a Minister of State may make regulations enabling section 2 to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Article 189 of the Treaty talks about regulations and directives.  It says:</P>
    <P>A regulation shall have general application.  It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable to all Member States.</P>
    <P>Then it says about directives:</P>
    <P>A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.</P>
    <P>In both of these cases the Minister for Agriculture has clearly identified himself as the national authority to give effect in domestic law to these provisions.</P>
    <P>I will draw the House's attention to the particular directives because I do not think we can debate this in a satisfactory way without reference to them.  In the Farm Modernisation Scheme there is a requirement in Article 3.1. that:</P>
    <P>Member States shall for the purpose <Col N="1298" /> of this Directive define what is meant by the expression &lsquo;a farmer practising farming as his main occupation&rsquo;.  Definitions shall, in the case of a natural person, at least include the condition that the proportion of income from farming be not less than 50 per cent of the farmer's total income and that the working time devoted to non-farming activities be less than half of the farmer's total working time.</P>
    <P>And in Article 3.2 that:</P>
    <P>In addition, Member States shall lay down the criteria for assessing the occupational skill and competence of the farmer.</P>
    <P>If one is engaged in the matter of defining what expressions mean, if one is involved in the matter of laying down what are criteria, one is in fact engaged in the business of laying down rules, making orders, providing for rights, deciding who falls within the ambit of the definition, who lies outside it, who achieves the criteria, who does not.  But the Constitution provides at Article 15.2.1 that &ldquo;the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  No other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.  No other authority, which includes the Minister for Agriculture, has power to make definitions which amount to laws, to lay down criteria which amount to laws.  I would draw the House's attention to the fact that it is perfectly open to the Houses of the Oireachtas to delegate to the Minister the power to make these definitions.  It is perfectly open to the Houses to delegate to the Minister the power to act at his complete discretion as to who comes within the definition, to act at his complete discretion as to what the criteria are to be.  But the Houses have not done so.  The Minister could have made an order, pursuant to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Directive or the Farm Modernisation Scheme Directive, providing that the definitions shall be as the Minister may from time to time determine, that the criteria shall be such as the Minister may from time to time determine.  He could make an order of that <Col N="1299" /> kind.  We could have a debate as to whether or not it is appropriate to administer the two schemes involved by giving to the Minister the power which, in fact, the Minister is claiming to have.  If the Houses were satisfied with that we could give him such power.  He could then go ahead and engage in the administration of the substantial sums involved by virtue of the discretionary power thus given to him.  But no discretionary power of that kind has been proposed to this House to be given to the Minister for Agriculture. In the absence of the delegation by the Houses of the Oireachtas of the power of legislation, the power of legislation is still retained within these Houses.</P>
    <P>There has been some argument which is referred to in the report on the matter of the Appropriation Act.  With regard to that, the Appropriation Act, 1980 &mdash; to take the one that we passed without recommendation and which was duly enacted on 24 December &mdash; provides only with regard to this matter, at Vote No. 39, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that office and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants in aid.  The Book of Estimates for that year provides, in Part 1, a total estimated expenditure of £140,041,000 which was exceeded by the usual Supplementary Estimates. Then under subhead M these two schemes are separately provided for.</P>
    <P>I would draw the House's attention to a publication entitled <i>An Outline of Irish Financial Procedures,</i> which was issued after the enactment of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965 and which I must say I found exceedingly helpful in understanding how this matter operates.  In paragraph 18 it says with regard to the Appropriation Act:</P>
    <P>The Act does not give legal effect to the various subheads....</P>
    <P>In other words, in this particular case, the farm modernisation scheme or the disadvantaged areas scheme referred to in the different items under subheads M.I. and M.3. <i>An Outline of Irish Financial Procedures</i> goes on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> ...To do so</P>
    <P>in other words, the Appropriation Act did not give legal effect to the various subheads which are to be contained in Part II of the Vote &mdash;</P>
    <P>would almost certainly result in considerable over-estimation and would disrupt the smooth working of the present financial system.  Accordingly, the Minister for Finance has discretion to vary the allocation for each Vote between its constituent subheads.</P>
    <P>This is known as virement.</P>
    <P>Virement requires the sanction of the Minister for Finance in every case.</P>
    <P>Virement is an application, under the specific authority of the Minister for Finance, of savings on one or more subheads to meet excess expenditure on another subhead, or subheads, in the same Vote, including any new subhead opened during the course of the year. This is not particularly a matter of the farm modernisation scheme or the disadvantaged areas scheme but rather generally of the treatment of expenditures which are comprised in Part II of the Estimates and which have been the subject of considerable exchanges between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On 21 April 1977 the Committee of Public Accounts, referring to an earlier report of that committee, repeated that they did not accept the view that the Appropriation Act constituted the further legislation which they considered should be enacted to validate the issue out of voted moneys of grants in excess of the limits laid down in existing legislation.  In that same report of 21 April 1977 that Committee had this to say:</P>
    <P>It is clear to the Committee that the efforts made in the past to justify, by reference to the Appropriation Act, the making of payments in excess of amounts specifically provided for in particular legislation has now led to the situation in which, as in the case of the housing reconstruction grants, statutory limits are being ignored and parliamentary <Col N="1301" /> control is no longer evident.</P>
    <P>On the general principle involved the Committee made a number of points:</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Act appropriates moneys voted by Dáil Eireann for services described in Part I, the ambit, of each estimate.</P>
    <P>which, in this case, is an estimated expenditure of £140 million, which ambit has been extended by additional supplies during the year.</P>
    <P>The Committee commented further about the Appropriation Act that:</P>
    <P>It makes no reference to the subheads and therefore gives no legal standing to the subheads.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the view of the Committee of Public Accounts there is no legal standing to the appropriation of moneys to the farm modernisation scheme and aids to farmers in certain less favoured areas, to give the full title of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In that particular report the Committee pointed out that there was no reference in the long title or in the text of the Appropriation Act&mdash;and that is correct&mdash;to the amendment of the Transport Acts.  They continued to say:</P>
    <P>If it is being held that the Appropriation Act constitutes amending legislation by virtue of what is contained in the subheads of particular estimates the subheads themselves then assume a statutory significance which is at variance with recognised principles of Government accounting.  It would call in question immediately the practice of <i>virement</i></P>
    <P>which is referred to in <i>An Outline of Irish Financial Procedures&mdash;</i></P>
    <P>under which by the specific authority of the Minister for Finance, savings on one or more subheads can be applied to meet excess expenditure on another subhead or subheads in the same Vote.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Committee concluded that: <Col N="1302" /> Virement would be in breach of the Appropriation Act if the subheads had any statutory significance.</P>
    <P>That Committee of Public Accounts referred to how successive Committee of Public Accounts had expressed themselves.</P>
    <P>Subsequently there was a cross-examination&mdash;if that is a correct description of what goes on in the Committee of Public Accounts; I could not say that it is; it appears to me to be a very light crossexamination&mdash;by Deputy Vivion de Valera of Mr. O Cofaigh.  After that the Committee of Public Accounts went on&mdash;because Deputy de Valera is very hot, much hotter than I am, on this subject of the subheads&mdash;about the legal significance of these subheads and of the Appropriation Act with regard to them.  In a correct reference which I have read&mdash;because I have a copy of the interview with the Secretary here&mdash;the Committee was assured by the Secretary of the Department of Finance that a particular submission that had been made to the Attorney General was merely an internal, administrative document given to the Committee for their information, that it had no significance as a precedent or an interpretation that should be regarded as a precedent and that it did not rank in status with the minute of the Minister for Finance.  The Committee wished to record their acceptance of this assurance. The Committee concluded, on this particular point, that the debate had gone on for a number of years and the Committee trusted that the principle which they sought to have established had now been unequivocally accepted and that they would never again have occasion to raise this matter.</P>
    <P>The Committee, clearly, will have occasion again to raise the matter, but that is for the Committee of Public Accounts; that is not my particular concern.  My particular concern is that our Committee do not have an opportunity to study, on behalf of Parliament, the schemes which have been decided upon administratively by the Minister for Agriculture, have not been able to express our view on the advantages or <Col N="1303" /> disadvantages of either of the schemes. Our Committee have not been able to make any report to Parliament as to whether the Minister has made the right decision in determining the type of scheme that he has produced.  Incidentally, we have had every opportunity to do this with regard to the farm retirement scheme, which has been amended very many times because of the money factor.  But we have had no opportunity, in these much more important schemes, to express any view to Parliament as to whether or not the schemes have been well designed.</P>
    <P>The European Communities Act quite clearly contemplated that the method to be adopted would be a method of ministerial order, that the ministerial order could be annulled, that the Joint Committee, which is referred to in the Act of Parliament, would be able to scrutinise the order made by the Minister in determining the type of scheme, to give effect to this Act, and the Houses would then be given an opportunity to decide whether or not they liked the schemes.</P>
    <P>There is a further important point, that is that there are cases where directives may be directly applicable, as regulations always are.  These are both cases where there is no question of the directives being directly applicable.  If the Minister made an order determining the scheme the question would arise of the rights which farmers might have under the schemes.  In our domestic law they would have rights, which they do not have, because of the way in which this has been done.</P>
    <P>I might draw the House's attention again to the wording of Article 189 of the Treaty:</P>
    <P>A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.</P>
    <P>The national authority for legislating, giving effect to schemes of this order, is clearly under the Constitution, the Houses of Parliament.  It is not any Minister, it is not the Cabinet, it is not the Executive, save to the extent that Ministers <Col N="1304" /> may have such legislative power delegated to them. and no such legislative power has been given.  Legislative power in this case it would seem to me is clearly necessary.  I would submit to the House it is clearly necessary and has not been given.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the European Communities Act, 1972, said:</P>
    <P>From the 1st day of January, 1973, the treaties governing the European Communities and the existing and future acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
    <P>The condition laid down in the Treaty in regard to the directive is that the national authority should choose the form and methods.  Under the Constitution the national authority for making legislation is the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>A Minister of State may make regulations for enabling Section 2 of this Act to have full effect.</P>
    <P>I would submit very strongly to the House that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; here in section 3 means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash;A Minister of State &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect. Section 2 of this Act, which refers to the acts of the institution, which refers to a directive, requires regulations because of the language used by the Treaty itself with regard to directives, that they shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authority the choice of form and methods.</P>
    <P>I would argue on two grounds, what is appropriate legislation and what is proper parliamentary scrutiny, that, as this report I was directed to sign recommends, we should have these schemes dealt with by ministerial regulation rather than, as the Department of Agriculture have contended, it must be said without dissent from any particular Minister, from the beginning, administratively.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution to this debate because the principle on which the Joint Committee takes its stand is an important one in relation to preserving adequate parliamentary control over public expenditure. It is a principle that extends of course generally and, therefore, not just to the two schemes, the Farm Modernisation Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme mentioned in the particular directives.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald has taken us through the debate or altercation&mdash;whatever one might call it&mdash;which has been going on for years between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Minister for Finance about the adequacy of the Appropriation Act to authorise expenditure.  It is not necessary for me to cover that ground again.  The Joint Committee, in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the present report, recites briefly what the Committee of Public Accounts considers very firmly to be the position.  That committee considers that the Appropriation Act, merely by authorising the payment of money under Vote, does not give legal standing to the subheads of that Vote and cannot therefore be held to provide statutory validity for payments set out in a subhead to a Vote.  The particular form in which the principle is expressed here is that the Appropriation Act provides no statutory cover for payments in excess of the limits laid down by particular Statutes.  But, if there is some lack of propriety, some derogation from parliamentary control, involved in exceeding an existing statutory provision by way of a subhead of a Vote covered by the Appropriation Act, there must also be a derogation of authority over expenditure involved in using the Appropriation Act, or purporting to use the Appropriation Act to authorise payments which were not authorised at all by any existing legislation, and even more so, to use the Appropriation Act purportedly to authorise payments which are implicitly forbidden or at least for which liability is expressly disclaimed in existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into any detail about the particular instance, may I just use as <Col N="1306" /> an illustration of what I am saying a major instance in recent years of what seems to me to be the unjustifiable resort to the Appropriation Act to cover expenditure? The Appropriation Act, simply because it lists and covers the Miscellaneous Expenses Vote, has been thought to give authority for a very large reimbursement of money from public funds, to the extent of some £2 million, to the depositors of the Irish Trust Bank.  Apart from that altogether, in that same case, a payment of almost £1 million has been arranged to be made by the Central Bank to the same depositors to complete their reimbursement in full, although there is an express provision in the Central Bank Act of 1971 declaring that no liability rests on the Central Bank in such circumstances.  I do not want to go into detail on this case; I am citing purely for illustration.  But it does reveal, I think, what is wrong with purporting to use the Appropriation Act as a means of authorising various forms of public expenditure which are not delimited in some way in express legislation.  What is at fault really is that, without the legislation, there is no genuine discussion of the principle on which the payments are being made.  There is no Second Reading in either House to decide whether this is a principle which ought to be authorised.  Further than that there is no discussion, no laying down of the conditions which ought to limit the acceptance of this principle in particular cases.  No legislation has been through either House providing an opportunity to discuss either the principle of the payments or any limitations or qualifications which, in the public interest, should be imposed on the making of such payments.  In the particular instance I have mentioned, the Central Bank, no doubt, made the payment on the basis of an assurance from the Government that at least in relation to what the Central Bank was paying, there would be covering legislative authority.  No such authority has yet been obtained.  Years have gone by and no legislation is yet in sight.  There is here quite an important principle in which, not only the Public Accounts Committee but all of us should take an interest because of its implica- <Col N="1307" /> tions for adequate parliamentary control of expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support very strongly the case made by Senator FitzGerald.  In his brilliant statement of the case he gave us the legal position from the point of view of our Constitution and from the point of view of the citizen and indeed of the areas where the Oireachtas was being short-changed.  He explained fully the history of this problem and the attitude of successive Ministers to it.</P>
      <P>The clarity with which the Senator argued this case leaves very little for anyone else to say.  Nevertheless, I recall the case being argued when this matter was going to the Joint Committee first in 1975.  It could be said then in the early years of our membership that the Department should have had the easy way out but there is not, now, that kind of excuse for this abuse of our Constitution.  The Oireachtas must have their perogative as the legislative arm of our Republic.  If these schemes are implemented by Act or by statutory instrument, it has been said that the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;the spokesman of the people&mdash;will have the opportunity of discussing them and commenting on them.  That is exactly what the Treaty of Rome has laid down: that these directives should be implemented by national legislation.  To take as an example the administration of the disadvantaged areas scheme, it certainly leaves too many questions unanswered. The current Estimates show a reduction of £17,500,000 for that scheme.</P>
      <P>Yet, we find that in the middle of January the Minister extended the designated areas by 105 electoral divisions or parts thereof.  This is confusing.  In addition, the Government have introduced a new system whereby they designate areas for special high grants of 70 per cent for drainage alone.  The ordinary farmers think that they are part of a designated scheme, that they come under the European grant.  This creates a lot of confusion to the point where people do not know what they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The Government have broken up the disadvantaged areas scheme and have given parts of the scheme to one area and other benefits to another.  This is not what was indended.  The selection of those areas conformed to no particular specification.  Certainly, it is not based on the national soil survey; neither is it based on elevation because, we find, even within parishes, that the higher, mountainous areas are excluded whereas lower and better land is included.  Nor is selection based on fertility.  The boglands are not even considered.  You have areas where one side of a river can be designated, and the other bank, such as the Offaly side of the Shannon, only falls into a national scheme.</P>
    <P>It is in this area that clear legislation is needed so that people will know and appreciate what they are entitled to from public expenditure.  In addition, on the latest 105 electoral divisions even ACOT refused any input into the selection of the schemes.  The most extraordinary thing is that the Department have not made maps available indicating what areas have been included.  They will not produce such maps.  The administration of this scheme is most unsatisfactory from the citizen's point of view.  This has to stem from the fact that there is nothing clear-cut laid down in legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that towards the end of January I wrote to him asking him for a map of the areas included in the scheme.  I have not received one and I do not believe that one is available.  It is not good enough that we should have a grace-and-favour situation for the handing out of almost one-quarter of the finance coming under the Department of Agriculture.  The Joint Committee&mdash;and I can only speak for the committee of which I was a member in 1975 &mdash; lay it down quite clearly and, as Senator FitzGerald has said, the situation has not changed.  In their recommendations of 2 July 1975 the Joint Committee stated that they could not accept that the Appropriation Act does any more than sanction the total national expenditure required for a community scheme and that in the case of the disadvantaged areas scheme, they believe that the prescribing of the <Col N="1309" /> detailed provisions of the scheme is a legislative act and as such is reserved for the Oireachtas alone under the Constitution.  The Treaty of Rome, while it may be vague, envisages that the administration should be carried out by the national parliaments in the various countries.  This is what is happening in the other eight member states of the Community as I understand the situation to be.  I cannot speak for the newest member, Greece. The volume of legal opinion has been in favour of the regularisation of this situation.  This view has been consistent since 1974-1975 and it is the unanimous view of the committees who have considered it.  Since, in practice, the administration of these schemes leaves so much to be desired, it is time the problem was rectified.</P>
    <P>I would join with those who have spoken in imploring the Minister to comply with the wishes of the Joint Committee and thereby to ensure that the EEC schemes that are operated under those directives and the national schemes not only are but are seen to be open and honest and that they treat all citizens, whom they are designed to assist, impartially and equally.  In this disadvantaged areas scheme the least the Department can do is to have a map showing clearly the areas that are included.  As it is, it is becoming a joke.  It is difficult to find people who know whether they are in or out of the schemes.  How is anyone to know which parts come into the grace-and-favour section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Senator FitzGerald for his words of welcome and to say that I am sorry that on this occasion I cannot be more accommodating to his view.  The Seanad is asked this evening to take note of that part of the Joint Committee's report which deals with the implementation of certain directives of the EEC and expresses reservations about the manner of their implementation.  The main import of the committee's conclusions relates to three separate points: firstly, that the absence of statutory instruments for the implementation of certain directives <Col N="1310" /> frustrates the control which the Houses of the Oireachtas intended to exercise over the implementation of Community secondary legislation; secondly, that if the implementation of a directive requires legislation only the Oireachtas can so legislate although it may delegate that power, and thirdly, that the Appropriation Act does not provide &ldquo;statutory validation for payments&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with these individual aspects, I want to make a few general points.  For a start, there is nothing, anywhere, no provision in the Treaty of Rome or in the Treaty of Accession, and no provision that I am aware of in our domestic legislation which lays down that an EEC directive shall be implemented only by statute or by statutory instrument.  This needs to be said in case the public should get the impression that some doubtful practice or something underhand is being or has been done. There is no question of even attempting to circumvent any law.</P>
      <P>Indeed the definitions in Article 189 of the Rome Treaty itself allow for flexibility in the manner of implementation of directives.  That Article&mdash;and I note that the committee have referred to it from time to time&mdash;enables the EEC Council and the Commission (a) to make regulations, (b) to issue directives, (c) to take decisions and (d) to make recommendations or deliver opinions.</P>
      <P>Regulations apply generally and are binding in their entirety in all member states.  That is clear and precise.  Directives are binding only as to the result to be achieved but the form and methods of achieving the result are left to each member state.  There options are allowed. Decisions are binding in their entirety. Again this is very clear and definite.  Recommendations and opinions are not of course binding.</P>
      <P>It is evident therefore that directives were intended to leave discretion to the member state as to the manner of their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, the directives that we are now talking about themselves allow for different ways of implementing them. Directive 159 for example requires member <Col N="1311" /> states to submit to the Commission the laws, regulations or administrative provisions they intend to apply in pursuance of the directive.  In some cases we chose to use administrative provisions rather than regulations.</P>
    <P>I want to make just two more points. One is that there is as far as I can judge no suggestion either by the Joint Committee or by this House that the schemes which have been introduced&mdash;the farm modernisation scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme&mdash;do not fulfil the requirements of the directive.  I am glad if that is so because, of course, we had in fact to satisfy not only the EEC Commission itself but also our fellow members meeting in standing committee that what we were doing or were proposing to do, did fulfil any obligations imposed by the directives.  Any criticism on this score in the past has, however, been more inclined to the view that in reality we are over-scrupulous in fulfilling our obligations rather than lax in doing so.</P>
    <P>The other general point relates to the position of Directive 160 of 1972 which has been implemented by way of statutory instrument.  Why should this be so for that directive and not for the others&mdash;a legitimate question posed by the Joint Committee?  Directive 160 involves the surrender of land by farmers, the fixing of a market price for it, and its redistribution to others.  That is the essence of it, with of course financial provisions added on.  Suppose this activity was being carried on otherwise than under an EEC umbrella, what would the position be?  I think the House could agree that that particular kind of activity would have to be backed by statute just as all Land Commission work is.  For that reason, that particular case of Directive 160 does not in my view establish the case for using statutory instruments as an invariable practice.</P>
    <P>I should say that when I was looking into the background to this question, I came across a rather interesting earlier discussion on the subject.  It took place at a meeting of the then Joint Committee on 2 July 1975 and it is reported in Volume 1, No. 15 of the debates, columns <Col N="1312" /> 423 to 434.  I would suggest to any Members of the House who may not have done so already that they might with advantage read the contribution made by the then Deputy John Esmonde during that discussion.  His observations made with commendable insight and clarity at the time seem to me to deserve closer attention than they received then and to be entirely relevant still.</P>
    <P>I return now to the particular aspects of this issue that seem to be of concern to the Joint Committee.  The first of these was that failure to use the statutory instrument procedure frustrates the control which the Houses of the Oireachtas are intended to have over EEC Secondary legislation.  That would certainly be valid if examination by the Joint Committee was the only measure of control open to the Oireachtas.  But that is not the case.  Indeed I note that in the debate I have just referred to the then Deputy Esmonde dealt very forcibly with this particular question pointing out that our Parliament has a variety of means open to it under Standing Orders if it wants to get to grips with a particular issue.  These include motions of censure, notice of motion and even the parliamentary question procedure.  Besides, the Joint Committee now have a full opportunity to examine EEC proposals for regulations or directives at the draft stage and can make appropriate recommendations at that stage.  I agree that Directive 159 is different in that regard because it was there before the Joint Committee was established.  But that is the exception.  On a general plane the argument that absence of a statutory instrument frustrates control does not stand up.  Indeed, the implementation of Directive 159 in the guise of the farm modernisation scheme was debated in the Seanad as far back as May 1974 and aspects of it have been the subject of debate here on other occasions since then.</P>
    <P>The second reservation of the committee, as I interpret it at any rate, is that if and when legislation is required, its enactment is a function of the Oireachtas. That certainly is an accepted principle. But as I said already, the question really is whether or not directives have to entail <Col N="1313" /> specific statutory instruments or statutes for their implementation.  There is nothing that says it must be so.  The question of whether a directive should be implemented by legislative action is therefore left to the judgment of the member state in each case.  It so happens that in many cases a statutory instrument will be appropriate.  In others it will be less so. Take Directive 159 for example.  Only part of that directive is in fact obligatory on the member states.  Other parts of it are permissive especially Article 14.2(a) which allows for national aids to farmers. The disadvantaged areas directive is essentially an enabling directive and a member state if it so chose, could decline to implement it at all.</P>
    <P>Amendments of a non-substantial nature have arisen in both cases.  These arose in the main from the green £ changes which led in turn to adjustments in figures specified in the directives. These changes were occurring so often a few years ago that, if we were then operating on the basis of statutory provisions, amending orders would be cropping up with almost ludicrous frequency.  So, in the first place, there is no requirement which says absolutely that directives must be implemented statutorily and in no other way and there will always be cases where non-statutory action will be the more appropriate.</P>
    <P>Coming to the role of the Appropriation Act, I have read very carefully the views of the Committee of Public Accounts quoted in the report.  The conclusion reached by the Committee is that the Appropriation Act does not of itself confer any authority for payments which are in excess of limits laid down in other statutes.  That makes sense.  Let us take a hypothetical example.  Suppose the Diseases of Animals Act lays down a limit of £500 for compensation for an animal slaughtered because of some disease.  If the Minister for Agriculture wanted to pay £600, he would have no authority to do so and could not rely on the Appropriation Act to authorise such a payment. The proper course would, of course, be to amend the specific legislation first. That, however, is a far cry from saying that the Appropriation Act confers no <Col N="1314" /> authority at all.  Many schemes down through the years&mdash;the farm building scheme, the calved heifer scheme, the land project, lime and fertiliser subsidies and many others did not have specific statutory backing.  It is hardly being suggested now that those were not legal.  The Appropriation Act may not authorise payments which are in excess of statutory limits but it does authorise legitimate payments.  Besides, of course, the Estimate for each Department is examined and debated in the Dáil each year and each subhead is open to scrutiny at that time.  The views of the Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriation Act which are quoted in the report must be looked at on the basis I have outlined. There has been no attempt to exceed any limits imposed by the basic directives. Indeed, the committee have not suggested that there was any attempt of this kind.  Authority for the expenditure does not therefore seem to be at issue.  The fact that Community money may be involved does not alter that.  The Exchequer has to spend the money first from its own resources and then receive recoupment.  As well as that all the payments are subject to audit both by our own Comptroller and Auditor General and by EEC auditors.  There cannot be any scope for abuse.</P>
    <P>In sum, the position as I see it is that there is not necessarily any single unique &ldquo;best&rdquo; way of applying EEC directives. The method adopted will depend on a variety of considerations.  In the ultimate, however, no matter what method is used, there are adequate safeguards to ensure that no abuse is possible and furthermore adequate means of supervision and control remain open to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are one or two comments I want to make in relation to points that have been made during the debate.  The point that the Appropriation Act does not give legal effect to expenditure under subheads and the general questioning regarding expenditure that has been made traditionally down through the years under this Act seems to be one of the points with which both Senator FitzGerald and Senator Whitaker take issue. As far back as 1946 the then Minister for <Col N="1315" /> Industry and Commerce had an action involving the Latchford bakers.  This arose because, under a discretionary clause he proposed to withhold a subsidy which was then payable to that bakery. A Supreme Court case ensued which decided in favour of the plaintiff, Latchford.  The status of the Appropriation Act, even though there was no statute, was quoted in the course of the court's judgment as authority for payment.  That is a long time ago but it established the rights of an individual to secure whatever benefits are available under a State scheme, even though the scheme has no specific statutory basis, once a person complies with the conditions.  Nobody can suggest that any farmer would arbitrarily be denied benefits from the Farm Modernisation Scheme or the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme because the actual scheme had no statutory basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points made by Senator Whitaker, if he questions the Appropriation Act in the way in which he does, it probably is a matter which will have to be debated elsewhere.  As the Senator will know from his own experience, payments down through the years have been made on a variety of schemes, subsidies and other kinds, under that particular Act and if it is now being suggested that these were inappropriate on some legal grounds, it has very little to do with the question of the responsibility of this joint committee on secondary legislation and is one which may have to be decided more appropriately elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the tenor of Senator McDonald's remarks in relation to the disadvantaged areas scheme and the claim that designation of areas in this country are by grace and favour.  It is an extraordinary statement and it is clear from it that the Senator would want to have a closer look at the whole system as to how areas are designated.  I would not have proposed normally to deal at any great length with that particular matter here as it is not relevant but because of the unfounded charges that are made I must say a few brief words about it.</P>
    <P>The directive under which areas are designated sets out the most rigid criteria. <Col N="1316" /> For areas to be designated they have to come up to certain standards in relation to a decline in population, low productivity and a series of other criteria with which only areas which are fairly deprived can comply.  These proposals are compiled through the ACOT services, through the Department of Agriculture and are negotiated through the structures committees in the EEC over a very protracted period.  Long and exhaustive discussions have gone on between the different agencies in relation to the designation of areas in this country.  It would be far from the wish of the majority of Members of this House to cast reflection on those men serving in the ACOT services, in the Department of Agriculture and in the structures committees in Brussels, some of whom have been extraordinary helpful to this country in getting an extension to those schemes.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to everyone that the soil survey is not yet completed and in recent times the people in An Foras Talúntais have given the number of years it will take to complete it thoroughly.  At no stage was it envisaged, though there has been contact with An Foras Talúntais in relation to that soil map, that that would be the only method of deciding what areas would qualify.  While a soil analysis deals with the soil, I would hope that any Government worth their salt in relation to this matter would be more concerned with people and what can be done for them.  As far back as 1976 the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Mark Clinton, said that would be the last extension that would be made.  Since then we have been able, by getting the total agriculture area for the country increased, to get a further extension.</P>
    <P>In relation to these extensions, maps are available.  District electoral division maps giving all the townlands are available and have been publicised in the national newspapers and the local papers.  They are available to anybody who wants to find out precisely what areas are included.  There is ample information as to the townlands and everything else available in the local authorities without even coming to the <Col N="1317" /> Department of Agriculture, though we would be glad to assist anybody to find out whether they are in or not.</P>
    <P>The position is that this extension, the last one or indeed any future one, has to be negotiated under very strict criteria. You can only succeed if the scheme of proposals is satisfactory to the structural committee in Brussels.  You have only to look at the record in the last two years, during which no other country except Ireland succeeded in getting any extension at all, to understand how difficult it is to meet the criteria.  Any suggestions that areas have been designated because of grace and favour is so far away from the reality of the situation that I do not want to say more about them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole general situation, I should like to add that there has been a case where a person in this country who felt a grievance in relation to implementation of the farm modernisation scheme was able to have his case taken to the European Court.  As you know, under the general system of common law here we allow the greatest flexibility to citizens to pursue their rights.  In the Houses of the Oireachtas the Minister must satisfy the Houses.  There are different procedures available to anybody who feels that he or she has a grievance to follow it through the normal course. We have to satisfy the EEC Commission in regard to how we implement these schemes.  But at every level the opportunity is there for people who think otherwise to have it examined.</P>
    <P>In the course of my short experience in the Department of Agriculture, I would say that up to 75 per cent of the questions being asked at Question Time in the Dáil in relation to the areas that have been assigned to me have been in relation to these schemes.  At no stage have I had a question from a Deputy suggesting that there was any improvising on matters of that kind by my Department.  That will continue to be the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to contribute on this report.  As I am a member of the committee and have been in on the discussions, I think it is right that I should say a few words.  I have not got a legal <Col N="1318" /> mind and I find it difficult at times to wrap my brain around some of these issues.  A few thoughts struck me as we were going through it.  Remember that this motion is asking the Seanad to note the report.  It seems to me that there is an issue here.  It came up before the previous Joint Committee and it has come up again.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for dealing with the matter very thoroughly and answering the points raised by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I could not help feeling that even the Coalition would have done something about it if they were that worried about grace and favour.  The Minister has dealt with it and we can leave the small politics and the big politics of the matter aside.</P>
      <P>As far as the problem is concerned, it occurred to me that this question of the form is to be decided by the member state.  I assume that Senator FitzGerald covered this, but, just to give my own perspective on it, it comes down to an understanding of what &ldquo;member state&rdquo; means.  Who decides the form?  Is it the Government, the Minister, the Department officials or the Oireachtas in all of its meanings?</P>
      <P>If some of the provisions of the directives are to be legitimised perhaps enabling legislation, which provides for flexibility, once-off legislation, might get over the problem.  The Department would then be in a position to make whatever adjustments have to be made in relation to green £ adjustments or adjustments in relation to designated areas. Some umbrella enabling legislation, which could be periodically adjusted the same way as we adjust legislation in terms of, say capital, limits applied to the borrowing power of Aer Lingus or a semi-State body, might get over the problem. Perhaps that is too naive a view of it, but I throw it out as a contribution to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the relationship between EEC legislation and national legislation worries me a little bit at the moment because of the discussion that is taking place, for instance, about how far can the EEC go in relation to contentious issues like divorce, abortion and so forth. <Col N="1319" /> That debate took place in Brussels earlier this month.  It was brought to my attention recently, when discussing the operation of the Equality Acts and Unfair Dismissals Acts, that the terms of the Third Amendment to the Constitution seem to give the EEC legislation overriding powers in relation to our Acts.  I am referring here to Part II of the Third Amendment to the Constitution Act, 1972, where it says:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I was meant to hear what the Senator has just said.  I did not hear it so I hope I do not have to deal with it.  I am not going to do any summing up on this debate.  I am thankful to the Minister for what he said.  I will just concentrate on one point.  The Minister for Agriculture is wrong on this.  If I may concentrate on one matter, section 2 of the European Communities Act says that: Acts of the <Col N="1320" /> Institution to the Communities should be binding on the State and should be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in the treaties. Article 89, which is the relevant one, specifies with regard to directives that it shall be binding as to the result to be achieved, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and method.  Senator Mulcahy is entirely right.  It is a question of who are the national authorities.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the European Communities Act says very clearly that a Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect.  The Minister of State is given the power, if chosen as the national authority, to choose the form and the method for implementing these two directives. He is clearly chosen as the person to determine the form and the method.  He has a choice to make; as the Minister said in regard to one of them &ldquo;it is enabling only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section goes on to indicate the manner in which the Minister must make his choice.  The Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 to have full effect, that is to say, to choose the form and the method by ministerial orders, whereby the directive has sole effect to constitute the importance of domestic law.</P>
      <P>Section 3 says, &ldquo;to enable section 2 of this Act to have full effect&rdquo;.  Section 2 says that these Acts shall be part of the domestic law.  It does not leave that optional.  It says these Acts shall be part of the domestic law.  They cannot be part of our domestic law unless the Minister makes an order under section 3.  By making an order under section 3 he makes them part of the domestic law, unless, and until, following a report of the Joint Committee, this House and the other House, annul his order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has this power and he must exercise it to make the directive part of our domestic law. This is so specified in the Act and it is not a question of the Treaty depriving us of this choice.  The treaty, with regard to directives, gives us the choice.  It gives our national authorities the choice and <Col N="1321" /> form of the method.  Our national authorities are the Oireachtas, enabling Ministers to make orders and regulations subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.  I will not follow the Minister or Senator Whitaker on the other question of the Appropriation Act.  I think the Minister is incorrect on that.  This is the more important aspect of the matter.  I would like to end the debate by inviting the Minister to consider again the legal position of the Minister for Agriculture with regard to this.  These directives provide for rules.  They refer to criteria; they indicate decisions which will mean some people are in and some people are out. That is a matter or regulation, order and law.  If the Minister wishes to do it, it is open to him to make an order saying: &ldquo;I hereby declare that anything that occurs to me after Tuesday next is part of this directive&rdquo; and to try to collect from the Houses of the Oireachtas the full power that he is purporting at present to exercise.  It is open to the Oireachtas to decide whether to give it to him or not.  At the moment it has not been given to him. There is not an order in existence which has the effect of complying with the requirement of section 3 to make regulations to enable section 2 to have full effect.  Section 2 has not full effect with regard to these two directives, because there is not an order under section 3.</P>

      <P>Senator Connaughton has given notice that he proposes to raise the matter of the urgency of completing arrangements for the payment of reconstruction grants for all applicants entitled to the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to the House for allowing this discussion on the non-payment of reconstruction grants.  I raise the matter out of sheer frustration, not alone on my own behalf but on behalf of many hundreds of people about whom we will talk in a few minutes. I am sorry I have to say that the performance of the Department of the Environment during the past 14 months certainly has been away below par as far as I am concerned.  I believe there is a grave dissatisfaction throughout the length and breadth of this country with the non-action of the Department in relation to housing grants generally.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the applicants, particularly the people that I specifically deal with in east Galway, seem to have been stymied in every way possible in the last ten to 12 months by this Department. I have lists of applicants who at this stage do not know if their applications have been accepted by the Department.  Is it fair to inform the House how this has come about.  The then Minister for the Environment made an order discontinuing reconstruction grants to any houses on 21 January 1980.  There was about a week left for people who wished to make application under certain conditions, to hand their applications into the Department.</P>
      <P>I know that something like 47,000 people made applications during that week. I want to go on record here today to say that I have to accept that there were grave problems in the Department for a few months until all those applications were processed, indexed and so on.  I am not talking about that.  I am talking about what is happening right now.  I know several applicants who 14 months later are not sure if they have been accepted into the scheme.  I know several others who have not had an inspection of their jobs, despite the fact that they had the reconstruction jobs finished in late 1979 or early 1980.  I also know several applicants who wrote to the Department several times.  I know one man who wrote 11 times and he never got an answer from the Department during the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When many people, including myself <Col N="1323" />&mdash; and I contact the Department weekly &mdash; are told that their files are out with the inspector.  The inspectors must have very large cars if they are carrying all those files around.  I cannot understand, if a file was sent to an inspector in a region five, six or nine months ago, even with the backlog, why he cannot come to the householder in question.</P>
    <P>Some of the bona fide applicants who applied before 1 February 1980 have been informed that their applications have not been received in the Department.  Even if they were late, they could have been acknowledged by the Department as being late.  As far as I can see from several queries I have made, the applications never got to the Department.  Is it the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or the Department of the Environment who are at fault?  I know that in several cases those applications were posted although unfortunately, I admit, they were not sent by registered post.  They were certainly posted and some of them never arrived at the Department of the Environment in Dublin.  Probably the worst factor of all is that for many people who had an inspection carried out, they had a hell of a long time to wait before they got their money.</P>
    <P>There are a few questions I would like to ask the Minister this evening.  Is it not possible to devise a scheme whereby the regional offices in Limerick, Cork and Galway could have inspectors for those areas?  People from the local areas could go in and have a chat with them and find out if their file was in order and not have people waiting eight, ten and 12 months to find out if their application is in order, never mind getting the money.  It is bureaucracy gone daft that a farmer or a householder of any description in Galway has to depend on O'Connell Bridge House in Dublin for his or her grant, considering we have similar offices in the various cities.</P>
    <P>It is fair to put on the record of the House that it is a grave injustice to deny any householder £600, which was the maximum reconstruction grant.  If he was entitled to get £600 12, 15 or 18 months ago, surely with inflation it is only worth <Col N="1324" /> £500 today.  Why penalise those people? Why has there not been a determined effort to get the work inspected and the grant paid?</P>
    <P>I have come across instances in the last couple of months where householders were involved in small reconstruction jobs under the old reconstruction grant system of a few years ago.  This was the system where £200 was paid by the then Department of Local Government and £200 by the local authority.  On several occasions I have come across people who did the work in question and got their £400 but four or five years later they found they had not done sufficient reconstruction.  They found that in order to have a reasonable house they needed a bigger reconstruction job.  I firmly believe that at least those people were entitled to the difference between the new grant and the old one.  It could be argued that they could be entitled to the entire new grant. Evidence of the past few weeks suggests that those people will not get the difference in value between the two grants.</P>
    <P>The Department have a duty to honour the existing reconstruction grants that are outstanding.  It is only reasonable that the Minister should indicate this evening when he intends to have the grants paid to the majority of those people who have been waiting for so long.  It could be argued that we could not expect the Department to tick over as efficiently as we would like in the first few months after the big in-flow of applications.  Let nobody tell me that the Department could not create a system whereby grants, inspections and cheques could be sent out to householders after 14 months.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister this evening to give an undertaking to the House that it will not be another 14 months before some of those people get their money.  I am sure the Minister is as well aware as I am of the grave financial hardship that people have to go through to try to reconstruct their homes to make them a little more pleasant and more comfortable.  We are all well aware of the spiralling costs of building materials and of the actual cost of getting the job done through small builders and so on.  Needless to say, although it is not relevant to the matter <Col N="1325" /> we are discussing, it was a disaster to withdraw the grants in the first place, but what makes it even worse is that people who are entitled to the grant still cannot get it.</P>
    <P>One could argue that people who have reconstructed their houses in the last 12 months are not entitled to a grant as such because it was withdrawn by this administration, but at least they were never told that they would get one.  If one were to take the number of people that I deal with who are living in hope of a grant and multiply it right across the country, we are talking about thousands of people. Will the Minister on behalf of those people give an undertaking that in the next couple of weeks the vast majority of them will either have an inspection as appropriate or get their money?</P>
    <P>We have had reconstruction grants for many years now but we never had anything like the mix-up that we have at the moment.  This episode will go down in the annals of history as the greatest bungling exercise ever created here by any Department.  I hope the Minister will clarify the situation for us.  On the way out this evening I will hand the Minister two long lists of applications to illustrate that I am not talking nonsense.  Those people have been waiting for grants for a very long time.  I hope that they and others will have better news as a result of this motion here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments which prompted the Senator to raise this matter on the Adjournment, although I do not, of course, accept all of what he has just said.  Indeed, I dare say that nobody has taken a greater interest than I have, since my appointment to my present position in December 1979, in seeing that applications under the house improvement grants scheme are processed with all possible speed and efficiency in the Department.  I, therefore, welcome this opportunity of putting the real facts of the situation before the Seanad and of assuring <Col N="1326" /> Senators of my continuing endeavours to speed up the payment of grants.</P>
      <P>Between 1 January and 1 February 1980 &mdash; the final date for the receipt of applications under this scheme &mdash; some 49,000 house improvement grant applications were received in the Department. Another 3,400 were received in the days following 1 February and approximately 1,000 of these were subsequently accepted on the grounds that they had been posted in time for delivery on the final day.  This left a total of some 50,000 applications, including solid fuel grant applications, to be processed.  The magnitude of that task can be gauged from the fact that the total number of improvement grant applications received during the whole of the preceding year, 1979, was 52,500 which, in itself, represented a record work load for the housing grants section.  So the administrative structure which had been geared to handle in the region of 50,000 applications a year was hit by an avalanche of the equivalent of ten months applications in the course of ten days.  Consequently it was not surprising that this structure buckled somewhat under this sudden and relentless pressure.  Because the scheme had been terminated, great care had to be taken to see that all applications received were individually date stamped, acknowledged and recorded before the question of eligibility could be considered and the cases sent for inspections.  It must also be appreciated that in addition to the improvement grant applications, approximately 10,000 new house grant applications had to be processed in the Department in 1980.</P>
      <P>In all these circumstances it was inevitable that what had become the normal time scales for processing applications, arranging inspections and issuing payments could not be maintained, even with the best will in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For Senator Connaughton's information, in County Galway 2,127 house improvement grants totalling £920,000 have been paid since 1 January 1980. Senator Connaughton spoke earlier about lost applications.  Earlier today I answered a question in the Dáil in regard to lost applications and only about half a <Col N="1327" /> dozen have been brought to my notice by public representatives.  The Department informed me that fewer than 50 lost applications have been brought to the notice of the Department.</P>
    <P>Regulations are laid down under the Housing Acts and a statutory notice appeared in the papers in respect of that. It stated that where evidence of a posting could be produced before the expiry date the grant would be payable.  Where we received letters posted on 31 January 1980 all those cases were looked after. We are talking here about fewer than 50 cases now.  I asked the Department at that time to make sure that all correspondence in regard to housing grants was date stamped and recorded.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion in regard to lost applications.  If an application is sent out to an inspector of my Department and is lost in the post or lost in transit, it does not mean that the applicant will lose the grant because it has already been recorded on the index.  We have a card which will state that the grant application whether it be for a back boiler or a new house has been recorded and if the file is lost we will make up a new file.  If the applicant meets the criteria laid down in the regulations that grant will be honoured in full.  There have been some misleading statements in regard to that, and I want to make the position straight.  If an application is lost in transit it will be looked after, because once we have received the application in the Department it is recorded.  If it is lost, we make up new files and if the applicant meets the regulations laid down under the rules we will honour that and pay that grant.</P>
    <P>Last year we paid 51,000 housing grants.  In the first two weeks of January, I paid more grants than the Coalition Government paid in the first half of 1977. In the first three months of this year to 31 March, I will have paid 19,300 grants and I will be paying, for the months of April and May, over 5,000 grants per month.  The staff are and have been working for a long time now on continuous overtime.  I have asked them to carry out the inspections as quickly as they possibly can and that is being done.  A number of <Col N="1328" /> the people who applied at that time have not yet notified the Department of the completion of the work.  I have to get the facts right on the real issue.  I am prepared to stand up and defend that stance at any time.  This year I and my Department will pay out over 51,000 grants.  The staff in my Department are working very efficiently.  I have never denied any Deputy or Senator the right to contact officials in my Department, as was alleged earlier, in regard to correspondence coming through my office.  My officials have been asked to be courteous and to give information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator agrees.  Does the Senator deny that for the first three months of this year we have paid 19,300 grants and that my Department are working full time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>From the information that I receive from Deputies and Senators in this regard it is obvious that applicants give wrong names and addresses or they do not comply with the regulations.  It makes it very awkward for the officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>In regard to second grants, these cannot be paid within ten years of the first grant except where the work involves an extension required to relieve overcrowding and then the waiting period is five years.  This is laid down in the Housing Acts.  The condition was accepted by the Dáil and the Seanad without question when the Bills were before the Houses. If the conditions were not there, there would be nothing to prevent a person getting a succession of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the old Coalition grants brought in by a previous administration, the Department of the Environment paid £200 of the grant and the local authority paid the other £200.  Notice appeared in all the national newspapers stating that if the applicant did not notify the county council before a specified date he would <Col N="1329" /> not qualify for the supplementary grant from the council.  I received very few complaints in regard to that because we gave good notice in all the daily papers.</P>
    <P>The number of delayed cases is very small, but the inspectors, including a number of part-time inspectors, are looking after this work and they are attending to the cases as quickly as they possibly can.  The staff in my Department are working continuous overtime to deal with this problem and I have met very little <Col N="1330" /> criticism from Members of the Dáil and the Seanad in general, a lot of whom have been very grateful to me.  If any Member of the House asked me to show him a file on any grants paid, there was no problem about it and there shall be no problem. In co-operation with the officials of my Department I will deal with the position as quickly as I can.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 1 April 1981.</P>
