      <P>Yes.  As set out in the explanatory memorandum already circulated, the purpose of the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill is to increase the authorised share capital of the company by £50 million, that is, from £27.5 million to £77.5 million, and the limit on the company's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee by £50 million, that is from £100 million to £150 million.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, NET were established in 1961 as a State-sponsored company to produce nitrogenous fertilisers at Arklow.  From relatively modest beginnings the company have grown to a point where they are now a major industrial and chemical undertaking, providing permanent employment for over 1,150 people.  Total assets are more than £170 million and net sales revenue in 1980 was over £60 million.  The Marino Point plant in Cork produces ammonia &mdash; a raw material for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers &mdash; from natural gas supplied from the Kinsale Head gasfield.  The ammonia is mainly used to produce urea at Marino Point and calcium ammonium nitrate &mdash; or NET -nitrate as it is more commonly called &mdash; at Arklow &mdash; both straight nitrogen fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NET have established over the years a reputation for consistent supply of high quality product and have made a major contribution to the phenomenal expansion in nitrogen usage by Irish farmers over the past 15 years, increasing from 32,000 tonnes of nutrient N in 1965-66 to 247,000 tonnes in 1979-80.  NET supply up to 85 per cent of the domestic market for straight nitrogen and the company's operations ensure national security of supply in respect of this strategic commodity for Irish agriculture, as well as making a valuable contribution to the country's balance of payments.  While it is fair to say that sufficient supplies of <Col N="1799" /> nitrogenous fertiliser seem to be available at present on the international market to meet the needs of this country, this has not always been the case in the past and may not necessarily be the case in the future.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to give this House any further background on the company's operations as few State-sponsored companies have been subject to such extensive attention, publicity and study in recent times as NET.  Senators will be particularly aware of the fairly comprehensive report on NET's activities which was published by the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies on 4 May.</P>
    <P>NET received Government approval in 1974 to proceed with their major expansion programme at Marino Point. The history of this project has already been well documented in the Joint Committee's report and was the subject of extensive debate in the Dáil in connection with this Bill.  For that reason I do not propose to go over the same ground again on this occasion.  The House will be aware that major difficulties were experienced in connection with this project which resulted in a delay of over 15 months and an eventual cost of £137.3 million compared with what NET regard as the first detailed estimate of £63.5 million.</P>
    <P>As the construction of this project advanced, it became clear to me that there was reason to be very seriously concerned about the cost escalations and delays involved.  As a result I had extensive discussions on many occasions during the past three years with the board and management of NET and impressed on them my deep concern about the way the project had developed.  In mid-1978 I set up a system whereby NET were required to submit quarterly reports in relation to the project and the content of these reports has been extended since then.  By the end of 1978 I felt that the history of the project was such as to warrant a confidential independent consultancy review to discover how the capital costs had increased to such an extent and what lessons could usefully be learned from NET's experience.  However, the <Col N="1800" /> fact is that once the initial decisions are taken and contracts entered into in respect of a project of this kind, it is extremely difficult to abandon it in midstream and no amount of monitoring or supervision will change for the better its basic economics.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies in the Dáil made the point that there should be greater control by central Departments of the State-sponsored Bodies.  This is a very controversial issue as the <i>rationale</i> behind the establishment of many of these bodies in the first place was to remove their activities from what was regarded as the constraining effect of central controls.  The NESC Report on &ldquo;Enterprise in the Public Sector&rdquo; published some months ago, came out strongly against what they regarded as the excessive level of central control of these bodies.  Admittedly the NET experience would seem to suggest otherwise but a lot depends on the calibre of the management and on their sense of accountability to the Departments concerned. Indeed, I am reviewing at present the general question of the relationship between my Department and the State-sponsored bodies to assess what changes, if any, are necessary in the light of experience in recent years.</P>
    <P>The increased expenditure associated with the Marino Point project has had a profound effect on NET's finances.  This has been exacerbated by the separate problems affecting the Arklow plant, which has been trading at an increasing net loss in recent years.  Losses directly applicable to Arklow have grown from £0.8 million in 1975 to nearly £8 million in 1980.  The principal reasons for the losses at Arklow have been changes in production technology in the fertiliser industry which made the company's involvement in the manufacture of phosphoric acid and compound fertilisers unprofitable, increased competition from bulk-blenders of cheap intermediate fertiliser products, general overmanning in NET, depressed price levels for fertilisers which have failed to keep pace with input costs and unfavourable industrial relations and labour practices.  These problems have forced NET to engage in a very <Col N="1801" /> substantial level of borrowings with associated crippling financing charges.  NET's accumulated losses at the end of 1979 amounted to £24 million and the loss for 1980 is expected to be £56 million.  The total amount of NET's medium and short-term borrowings at the end of 1980 was over £200 million, with associated annual financing charges of £30 million. The company are now in serious financial trouble, as their capital base is completely eroded and they are unable to service their borrowing commitments. NET have proposed a capital restructuring of the company, and have requested additional paid-up equity of £90 million, which they say will enable the company to return to a commercially acceptable debt/equity ratio and reduce the very large burden of bank interest which prevents them returning to a viable position in the long-term.</P>
    <P>NET are facing an immediate financial crisis as they are obliged to repay a short-term, non-renewable bridging loan of $80 million &mdash; equivalent to £50 million approximately &mdash; by 29 May 1981. Although there were references to specific borrowings by NET in the Joint Committee's minutes of evidence, I feel that this particular aspect of the company's finances was not sufficiently highlighted in the committee's report.  Furthermore, NET have, at present, up to £50 million in existing medium-term loans which are not the subject of ministerial guarantees under the NET Acts and it is desirable, in the context of any new legislation, that provision should be made for formal guarantees in these cases.  These guarantees will also enable a marginal reduction to be secured in respect of the interest rate for the medium-term loans in question.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the Dáil, the Government have concluded that the immediate financial difficulties facing NET must be tackled now and the specific purpose of the present Bill is to enable the $80 million bridging loan to be repaid by 29 May 1981 and to provide formal guarantees for the existing unguaranteed medium-term loans of £50 million.  Failure to tackle these problems at this juncture would, in my opinion, inevitably precipitate <Col N="1802" /> the immediate closure of the company. Although I have been aware for some months of the company's impending financial difficulties I felt it appropriate to await the publication of the Joint Committee's report on NET as it would have been improper of me to bring a Bill of this nature before the Houses of the Oireachtas when publication of such a report was imminent.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that the present Bill does not signify that the Government have concluded their examination of NET's future prospects.  In this regard, the Government share the view of the Joint Committee that further study and specialist advice are necessary under a number of headings, before any final decisions can be realistically taken about NET's future.  Some analysis has already been undertaken of the possible options open to the Government but it is clear that further work needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  With this in mind, the Government have now decided to establish an inter-departmental committee of senior officials to consider in detail all the options for the further of NET with a view to reporting to me as soon as practicable so that proposals can be presented to the Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the committee will use independent specialist consultants to advise on specific aspects of this matter where they consider it necessary. Obviously one of the matters which will have to be considered is the dramatic change which has taken place in the energy field since the original decisions relating to Kinsale Head gas were taken. There may be better uses to which this gas can now be put and the full implications for this in relation to employment, balance of payments, energy efficiency and returns to the Exchequer will have to be examined.  My understanding is that the position at the moment is that there are no immediate alternative uses to which NET's substantial offtake of natural gas can be put and this position is unlikely to alter for the next two to three years pending developments in relation to the proposed Cork-Dublin pipeline and possible conversion/adaptation of ESB generating capacity.  However, the <Col N="1803" /> problem about exercises in which possible alternative uses for the gas are assessed is that the correct answers three years ago would not necessarily be the correct answers today and it is possible that the correct answer today will not be the correct answer in three years' time. A fundamentally important factor is how energy and fertiliser prices and supplies move in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the future deliberations of the proposed inter-departmental committee, I must say that I have been impressed by the resolute action taken by NET, and in particular the company's new managing director, during the past year in attempting to restore order to the company's operations and finances.  I was also glad to see that this action was endorsed by the Joint Committee. As a result, I must admit that I am now more optimistic than I was some months ago about the company's future prospects.  The action to which I refer comprises the closure of the unprofitable Arklow Gypsum subsidiary, the retirement from phosphoric acid and compound fertiliser operations at Arklow, a re-organisation of the company's management structure and a general slimming down of excess manpower with a view to increasing productivity.  It is, of course, deeply regrettable that action of this nature, involving the loss of a very significant number of jobs, has to be taken.  However, it must be recognised that these measures are absolutely necessary if the company are to have any prospect of future viability.  Furthermore, the results of NET for the first four months of this year were very encouraging and output from the company's plants was well up to rated capacity.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, I said that my attention had been brought on numerous occasions to extraordinary and hair-raising work practices which apparently exist at NET's Arklow plant.  While I indicated that poor management in the past had enabled this situation to develop, I sincerely hope that for the future, there will be a new attitude of responsibility and realism on the part of workers as well as on the part of management. NET's financial difficulties are <Col N="1804" /> very real and the company's future prospects would be very much improved by a positive approach from management and workers alike, acting in a spirit of mutual co-operation to tackle the company's difficulties.  For example, I very much doubt if NET could survive a deterioration in industrial relations, further industrial action &mdash; such as the prolonged strike in October, 1978 &mdash; or excessive pay demends.  The fact that a State company are involved will have little bearing on the situation if adverse circumstances such as these should occur.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our party support the broad principle of this Bill which aspires to increase the share capital of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta by £50 million.  The alternative to doing this at this stage is a continuation of the catastrophe there has been in relation to NET because a failure to do so would simply mean the bankruptcy of this company and the immediate unemployment of about 1,000 people.</P>
      <P>It is interesting, debating this Bill in the House, to realise why it is before us. This Bill is not before us so that we may debate general policy considerations of NET so that the Houses of the Oireachtas might consider the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies' report relating to NET.  We are not establishing guidelines in the interest of this country in so far as this company is concerned in future years.  This Bill is before us because it is a crisis Bill.  It is an example of the mess there has been in NET over a number of years that this crisis continues and continues in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a crisis Bill because NET, in their debts structure, are obliged to repay a bridging loan of 80 million dollars, which is non-renewable, by 29 May 1981.  The 80 million dollars is approximately £50 million and 29 May, looking at my diary, is Friday week.  It is a crisis Bill in the sense that if the Houses of the Oireachtas do not pass this NET Bill, 1981, this company will go bankrupt.  The <Col N="1805" /> implications of it being a Government company and the lack of financial prudence by Government, should it go bankrupt, is an appalling indictment and a continuation of the same saga.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that he does not see this as being the ultimate solution in so far as this company are concerned.  I appreciate his view on that. But let us get first things first and brutally see why this Bill is before us.</P>
    <P>What has happened in NET over a number of years must lead to the utmost disquiet among people concerned with public life and public expenditure.  We are a small country with a limited budget and the extent of the debacle here in relative terms must be much greater than that in British Leyland, for example, or the British economy or other examples throughout western Europe.  I do not know of one on this scale.  We have had a saga not just of mismanagement but lack of control of a major project involving enormous capital expenditure.  There has been an apparent lack of control within the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, lack of control by the board of NET and mismanagement by the company both in the development of the capital investment and in the operations of the company.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that even in the Minister's speech today, whilst we are handing out bouquets to the new structure, and apparently this company are being run better than they had been, we are told about the level of losses in the Arklow factory.  In 1975 losses amounted to £800,000.  In 1980 losses were estimated at £8 million and we are given the reasons for this.  It is a very interesting and simple point but it is part again of the continuation of the saga.  The NET accumulated losses at the end of 1979 were £24 million. The loss for 1980 is expected to be £56 million and we are having a debate on 20 May.  Regardless of the size of the company, some of the largest multinational companies in the world can produce a balance sheet on 1 February to tell you what happened in the previous year. Accounting efficiency within this company should have allowed them to know <Col N="1806" /> by mid-February or March what happened in 1980.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now present and I wish to make one or two points.  I was suggesting that in so far as the affairs of NET are concerned there is still a continuation of problems concerned with controlling this company.  I was pointing out a very small example of what I see as a continuing loss of control in this company.  We are told in the Minister's speech, which the Minister of State read here, and the speech the Minister made in the Dáil, that the NET accumulated losses at the end of 1979 were £24 million.  We are told that the losses for 1980 are expected to be £56 million.  The Minister in his speech on 12 May referred to the loss of NET for 1980 and said it was expected to be £56 million, instead of being precise.  Regardless of the size of the company, the biggest companies in the world can produce a balance sheet by 1 February or by the middle of February 1981 to tell you what happened in 1980.  Why in this company where we were so concerned about the saga of lack of control over the years, is there a suggestion in May 1981 that the loss for 1980 is expected to be so much, instead of being precise?  There seems to be a continuing lack of control which is very disturbing.</P>
    <P>One of the benefits of this debacle has been the emergence of the excellent work which is being done within the Oireachtas by the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  I should like to pay a tribute to that committee and the members of it for the excellent, quite work behind the scense which they have been doing and who have put in a great many hours, I am sure at personal inconvenience both politically and financially, in their excellent work.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who applauded the establishment of the committee because of the problems which are arising in a State where such a huge proportion of public revenue is moving into the semi-State sector as opposed to the pure departmental area, and the dangers of lack of adequate control.  One of the healthiest things which has happened to democracy in this country in the last decade has been <Col N="1807" /> the establishment of this committee.  The report, in so far as NET are concerned, is a classic one and the committee have done and excellent service to this country. I hope, having read that report and having listened to the debate on it, that the lesson will be learned.</P>
    <P>In these areas these matters cannot continue.  What has happened here has been a case of squandering public funds by a semi-State body, gross mismanagement of the development of the capital structure and the building of the projects and mismanagement in the operational area.  We are told of the level of the Arklow losses which rose from £0.8 million in 1975 to £8 million in 1980.  Reasons are given as to why this happened.  The first reason stated in the speech by the Minister is in regard to changes in production technology in the fertiliser industry which made the manufacturing of phosphoric acid and compounds unprofitable. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>With the relatively recent investment in the fertiliser industry in Arklow, where people can see down the road to what may possibly happen in that industry, it is not a sufficient excuse, after such a major capital investment and after such an extremely short time to say, in a <i>blasé</i> fashion, that losses were due to changes in production technology and so on.  Of course, we support the semi-State structure. Most of these companies have done an excellent job and serve a distinct national purpose.  At the same time, one must consider the price that would have to be paid if any company in the fertiliser industry in the private sector here was involved in that type of capital investment and ran into a loss situation of £8 million in 1980.  In brutal terms, in the private sector it would mean bankruptcy because there is no fall guy at the end of the line to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>The second reason given, of increased competition from cheap intermediate fertiliser compounds, is again not sufficient excuse.  The third reason given for the losses being so high is overmanning.  Why should there be overmanning?  Overmanning is at the root of so many problems in industry today, where we do not have <Col N="1808" /> sufficient productivity.  We support, for obvious reasons, the £50 million which will be injected into this company.  This Bill pinpoints the fact that NET cannot pay their $80 million debt next week unless they get the £50 million.  This is a crisis Bill, not a fundamental appraisal of the committee's report.  There are so many areas of national interest demanding funds that in the future there must be much more critical control over where the money is going.</P>
    <P>There is room for great disquiet about the arrangements with the Kellogg company. This notion of a fee of about £6 million to supervise plant erection and the blank cheque to buy such a massive amount of machinery without penalty clauses has been unsatisfactory.  I do not know if the decision of the Minister to establish an inter-departmental committee will help.  The history of some inter-departmental committees in the past has not been all that great.  A committee within his own Department, under his control directly, rather than an inter-departmental committee composed of people each individually responsible to different Ministers, would be a better arrangement.</P>
    <P>I note that the company have closed Arklow Gypsum.  We see the reasons for that, because the company is out of phosphoric acid and compound fertilisers in Arklow.  Again obviously a commercial decision had to be made and presumably the right decision was made.  One can be extremely critical of so recent a decision concerning capital investment which put the company into this area and which now, after such an extremely short time, it is getting out of.  There are indications in the international fertiliser industry to suggest that if people in the company had been looking at the international scene and structures and what was likely to happen in the future in this industry these investments might not have been made in the first place.  The cost of the project, the original estimate being £63 million in Marino Point, escalated by about 120 per cent to £137 million.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of this debacle is incredible. There is also another a very interesting issue which is addressed to the <Col N="1809" /> fundamental viability of the project in terms of natural gas as the raw material which the company are using for much of their operations, regarding the price of this natural gas to the nation.  There are suggestions that an extra £30 million might have been lost last year if an economic price had been charged for this natural gas.  The whole notion of using natural gas at a subsidised price to shore up what would otherwise be an inherently inefficient industry, leaves room for question and, certainly, is an issue which I imagine the Minister will face up to.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the committee on the work they have done.  They have spelt out what has happened here.  On Kelloggs they said: &ldquo;The Committee has established to its satisfaction that there was a serious misunderstanding between NET on the one hand and Government and Government Departments on the other as to the amount of estimated capital cost.&rdquo;  On Marino Point: &ldquo;The Committee considers that the time taken by NET Management to transmit vital capital cost information to the Government Departments concerned, and on occasions the NET board, was too long....  From the Committee's examination of the evidence given NET Management were premature in proceeding with the execution of the project by issuing the Letter of Intent to Kellogg...&rdquo;  There is so much more that could be said.  The report makes valuable reading.  It is a classic document.</P>
    <P>It is said that this Bill should be before the House, but I appreciate the reasons for it.  The Minister was not here when I started my speech but let me just repeat that this party support the Bill.  Again, it is a crisis Bill so that NET can pay the bill on 29 May and so that the company's financial solvency remains.  That is why we are supporting the Bill.  There is room for great disquiet.  I wish the company well in the future and hope they turn the corner, but on the more fundamental points of control and the spendings of public funds, there are many lessons to be learned from this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LadyGoulding" hpid="Lady Goulding Lady Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several differences between State-owned concerns <Col N="1810" /> and private enterprise concerns which are truly astonishing in two senses.  The first is that they could scarcely be more simple to comprehend.  The second is that nobody seems to comprehend them.  Of these differences the greatest is that if a private enterprise concern sets up a productive activity, budgets for its capital costs, its running costs and its predicted profits and then proceeds grossly to overspend on capital, hugely over-employ and incur steady losses on sales, the outcome is straightforward.  It becomes insolvent.  In fact, it goes &ldquo;bust&rdquo;.  It may be tragic, but it puts fully paid to the whole stack of errors and, incidentally, sacks all those who were responsible for them.  If the activity is State-owned there is no such word as &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo;, still less &ldquo;bust&rdquo;.  All that happens is that the miscarriages, however complete, are regarded as normal to pregnancy and a happy birthday is contrived by the delightful formula called &ldquo;capital reconstruction&rdquo;. The equivalent of that treatment in a private enterprise company would be for the shareholders to attend a special meeting, receive from the board a proud display of the horrors already informed and then would readily absolve the auditors, the board, the management, the workers, from any form of blame.  They would then unanimously agree to subscribe for as much more capital as the aforesaid team proposed, as appropriate to keep them in the state to which they were accustomed.  What I seek to emphasise now, even before we come to the direct question &mdash; what to do about NET &mdash; is the iniquity of excusing inexcusable management and accountancy conduct, by the anaesthesing, by a State rigged system of bogus financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me turn to NET and apply these principles.  NET's first phase of history is contained in smaller figures.  It installed two plants of laughable inefficiency, operating a process which was then being ruthlessly written off by the big companies abroad, and erected them in a particularly unsuitable place.  It has taken almost 20 years for most people to recognise that this is the genesis of the Arklow story.  How does the Marino Point exploit relate to this record of achievement?  The <Col N="1811" /> answer is perhaps curious.  It is both good and ill.  Much technical experience had then been acquired by NET people, so that carefully chosen, advanced and very complex installations were selected and ordered.  Therefore, however desperate the present situation, and one's fury, one should be broad enough to recognise some resemblance to the case of the Sydney Opera House which, despite the national scandal of its cost, now exists as a national advertisement of grand dimension.</P>
    <P>But, two other considerations require our attention now.  One is recrimination, the other contrivance.  As to recrimination, one cannot be constructive backwards, but one has a duty to prevent recurrences.  What is Heaven's name are the excuses for allowing such monstrous extensions of plans and costs without doing what any reputable auditor would insist on doing to even the most exalted private enterprise firms &mdash; refusing to sign the accounts, or else qualifying them so censorially that they would be quite unacceptable to the shareholders in general meeting?</P>
    <P>The second recrimination &mdash; when NET defended themselves on the count, the final cost included much more plant than was originally planned.  How can such innocence be condoned?  Imagine a general meeting of a private enterprise company, where the board reported that it ordered twice as much as it needed, at several times the cost, and asked shareholders to be good enough to fill in their cheques and leave them with the secretary before leaving the meeting.  There is an unavoidable dilemma here and we should face it squarely.  One of two things, with certainty, happened.  The first is that the Auditor-General's Office was annually and grossly irresponsible in reporting no alarm at the cost of the figures.  This is an extremely improbable eventuality, because that office has the same probity and detachment but, alas, lack of authority versus Government, as has the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The alternative was that the reports were presented and the facts were given starkly to the shareholder, in this case a <Col N="1812" /> Minister.  This has been going on for a number of years and it is not this Government's fault.  This Minister did not like it, but concluded that the situation could hang on for another year.  Another possibility is that he was never properly briefed by his officers.  Even in this situation, however, very harsh blame can not be withheld from the Dáil and the Seanad.  However tardily and craftily the course of things was presented to them, they dreamily, in effect, crossed their arms and dozed off.  Now, immediately, we must turn to contrivance.  What are we to do?  Scrapping the whole Marino installation sounds very clearheaded.  Cut your losses.  Never throw good money after bad.  It is almost surely too narrow-minded. It results largely from the sequence that I have been sketching about fudging and covering facts for so long, so as to produce suddenly an overexcited feeling of scandalised alarm when, at last, the searchlight beam hits its target.</P>
    <P>Stated more calmly, we now possess an advanced industrial installation, though of inordinate cost.  Difficult as judgment is in this case, I would consider it sounder, under certain conditions, to lay the costly ghost and keep the plant fully fit. The first of my conditions must be the preparation and public issue of a White Paper, or the like, setting out clearly what shall in future be the only and exceptional conditions wherein the auditing, presentation and publishing of a State-owned company's results and commitments may differ from those of a private enterprise company.  The most evident exception would be where uneconomic production of services was authorised for social benefits. These must be quantified in advance and separated in result from the State accounts.</P>
    <P>The second condition is that the employment role at NET must be cut to the bone.  We have been told that cuts have been made already.  We may realistically be sure that they are not to the bone, perhaps not even near it.  A mentally high decimalisation is essentially a route to competitive costs and competitive products.  If it be allowed to become a cushion to standby employment, we are <Col N="1813" /> neck deep into false logic.  Redundancy money is the cheapest possible form in which we can benefit the invalid who calls upon us, so, let us have redundancy money paid in proper figures.  Closely connecting with this, another condition for granting the money called for is probably necessary.  It seems unlikely that, at any rate for a time, there will be adequate user demand, even including exports to permit the plan to work full year, full course and full employment.  Let it then be firmly pre-arranged that they shall work through only such period as allows their operation at full capacity, and staff efficiency.  Only in those periods shall full pay and other costs be extended.</P>
    <P>I conclude by emphasising the stark fact that if we vote more of the nation's wealth to NET &mdash; and I think, on balance, and on the conditions I offered, that we should do so&mdash;it is an act of critical trial. We should first make the strictest behest now that, at least until things are, as we hope, shipshape, regular reports shall be made by special delegations from the Auditor-General's office and these shall include a report of the subsidies to the company inherent in the price of natural gas being paid by the company as against the energy-related value of this gas on the open market.</P>
    <P>Finally, all these findings shall be relayed without any departmental cotton-wool to us, the nation, who are the shattered.</P>

      <P>I do not want to debate the major problems that have arisen in relation to the project which went 15 months over its time and which resulted in an increase of 116 per cent over the original estimate of £63.5 million.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister has played his part in trying to get at the reasons behind the delays and subsequent escalating costs.  I agree with the Minister's view that once the project had got under way and had been put in train, it had become extremely difficult to either monitor or abandon it.  I accept the Minister's bona fides in this.  He has done everything necessary or advisable in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was imperative that we took the gamble <Col N="1814" /> and a number of lessons have been learned.  The cost escalation arose mainly through delays in getting the Marino Point project off the ground.  Admittedly it was exacerbated by the trading losses of the Arklow plant, but there are two separate and distinct problems.  We are dealing with the question of delay in construction and the actual losses arising out of that.  That is a <i>de facto</i> situation and it cannot be rectified.  I believe in the right of Senator Goulding and other Senators to make critical contributions on behalf of the public on how things were handled and to highlight the facts surrounding the whole question of the construction cost escalations.</P>
    <P>The Members have a duty to question the quality of the personnel who were charged with the task of getting this particular project under way.  Whichever Government is in office there must be a continuance of examination.  I welcome the views on this which the Minister put forward on Second Stage in the Dáil and that he is pressing for more reflective studies and seeking specialist advice.  The Minister is looking at the problem with a great deal of honesty and attention under many headings.  I would ask that prior to any final decision being taken on the future of the company both Houses would have the fullest possible opportunity to debate the matter <i>in toto.</i> I take it that we will be kept well informed and that we will have the opportunity of having the widest possible debate.  That type of a debate is not suitable for this occasion where there is a time factor involved and, if the money is not coming across, we might be faced fairly quickly with a complete closure.  This is not the right place to do the knocking or arguing.  It is a debate for another area at a later stage under different circumstances.  Knocking is not going to solve the problem and it may not even help matters forward.  We have a problem here and must do something to get things moving in the most desirable way possible.  There is no alternative at this time but to assist in the best way possible, that is to enable the Bill to realise its purpose of giving formal guarantees for the medium term loan of £50 million and in helping to repay the bridging <Col N="1815" /> loan.  To talk otherwise is to suggest that we precipitate a closure of the company.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I got the full gist of Senator Goulding's speech, but its tone went close enough to that.  I was a little saddened to hear it.  We are talking about 1,500 jobs with some serious effects following for Kinsale and a threat to the national security of supply of a very essential commodity.  That is what we should keep uppermost in our minds at the moment.  Even though present signs may not appear to everyone to be very hopeful, to me they do seem hopeful.</P>
    <P>That there has been an expansion in the company, that they supply 85 per cent of the domestic market, that it is a major industrial chemical undertaking, that they have assets of £170 million and that they had a net sales revenue of £60 million in 1980 may not be the answer to everything, but they are hopeful indications, coupled with the Minister's assurance of further examinations and a fuller monitoring programme.  Given that situation, there is a great possibility of this company becoming viable.  If that viability can be restored, many redundancies will be avoided.  We have enough redundancies at the moment.  No matter how much redundancy money people get, it is destroying to be out of work.  If there are circumstances that permit us to allow that situation to be circumvented, where we keep people at work, then it is not nice to here anybody talking about increased redundancy payments.  Inevitably, by the nature and change of progress, we will from time to time have to discuss this question of what redundancy payments should be, but in circumstances where people have been already very hard hit, we should not talk about how we should buy ourselves out of our trouble by paying people extra money and getting them off the plant.  It does not begin and end there.</P>
    <P>The concept behind the establishment of NET was to provide nitrogenous fertilisers to supply our largest industry, the agricultural industry and to remove our dependence on imports.  Those are very important developments.  Nobody in this <Col N="1816" /> House or in the other House could deny the overwhelming success of those developments. One of the additional benefits is that it was our first major chemical industry and led to other developments in the chemical area.  A lot of people in the chemical industry have grown up on the ideas and experience obtained in this area.</P>
    <P>People in Arklow and Wicklow are going through hard enough times at present. We have already lost 138 jobs in the subsidiary company of Arklow Gypsum and £10 million of public funds in the last six months.  In the parent company, we have had redundancies of almost 400 people. This has all been done in an attempt to rationalise the position of the parent factory in Arklow, but I am a little disturbed. Arklow and Wicklow, in general, have suffered enough in this respect and even if we have to lean backwards, we should do it and I do not think we will be leaning backwards in view of the points that were made earlier on.  I believe that it is possible to make it a viable concern.</P>
    <P>There are 800 people not only in the Wicklow area but in the adjoining area of Wexford who are very concerned because their jobs are threatened.  The pressure we are applying by knocking the company may in fact be the means of inducing the people concerned to rationalise in such a way that they would get round the abolition of those 800 jobs. There may be pressure because here we are talking about not only the Arklow situation but about the whole question of the Cork project.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to everybody and not having anything against the Cork people, I do not think the people in Arklow should suffer any more.  They have paid a heavy penalty for whatever behavioural patterns the management have followed. There is no way now that the staff there should be asked to take any more drastic cut-backs.  It is nice enough to talk about redundancies, about rationalisation, about the best way to deal with people when they become redundant, but we are not talking about redundancy as such.  We are talking about the economy of south Wicklow and north Wexford. We are talking about a whole range of <Col N="1817" /> matters that have grown out of this project. Much has been built around it.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the effects for a moment.  There is the whole question of the ports in Wicklow and Wexford, the question of the employees themselves and their families, of shops, pubs and farms, of lorries hired to transport materials and of hotels.  We are talking about £500,000 every week already gone, taken out of the economy of south Wicklow and north Wexford and it is not good enough to be talking about further redundancies. Everything that it was possible to do has been done and I hope no more pressure will be applied in this particular area.  I do not mind people highlighting the problem.  They should go after them and do their public duty but when the Minister himself considers that there is a way of monitoring things and that the future of the industry will be looked at at a future date I do not think this is the time to do the knocking.  We should wait to see what happens and until such time as we can have a full debate on the full merit of the matter.  In the meantime let us do the right thing now, support the Bill and get it through as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would make this final plea.  There are no alternatives in this area of south Wicklow and north Wexford and the IDA should look at this area as a crisis area and see what immediate attention they can give to it.  I know there are great demands on them but I would make that plea to them.  The evidence is there that it needs special attention.</P>
    <P>To some extent I have been congratulating the Minister on his whole approach to the matter and on the way in which he has been sympathetic to the problem but that does not excuse the Government as a whole.  The Government must bear some responsibility for the position of NET today.  Because of their own economic policies, or lack of them, the value of the Irish pound has dropped drastically in the last few years.  This has happened at a time when NET had to borrow substantial sums in US dollars, Deutschemarks and so on, borrowings which had to be paid back in those currencies which over this particular period appreciated by <Col N="1818" /> 30 per cent largely because of the collapse of the Irish pound on the foreign exchange market.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too much on that area.  The main concern is that there would not be any undue pressure put now on the workforce who have suffered the penalty of losing their jobs.  I would make the appeal that there be no more pressure exerted in this particular direction regarding more cut-backs in jobs.</P>

      <P>This whole disastrous episode relating to NET points to the great difference referred to by an earlier Senator in relation to accountability in private enterprise and from time to time to the absence of that accountability where the people's money is involved.  I have some sympathy with the Minister in having to bring in this proposal.  Of course I support the provision of an additional £50 million to NET in order to save that industry but I have some sympathy with him because as he says himself the major expansion at Marino Point was authorised by the Government in 1974. We should learn from this sort of experience. It is an expensive lesson that there seems to be a lack of accountability in relation to capital expenditure in a major State body.  There was obviously a lack of experience and foresight in the signing of a contract for £63.5 million which ended up at £137.3 million.</P>
      <P>As a Senator said earlier, not even a multinational corporation in private enterprise would allow this to happen because the people who are appointed to executive and board positions have a sense of accountability and the sense comes right down to the success of their jobs and to the continuity of their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Minister and this measure but I would like to put one question which came up during the debate and that is how far are the Comptroller and Auditor-General's staff responsible for checking capital commitments in State boards?  This is a crucial question because when the people's money is being made available &mdash; and that is what you are doing when the Exchequer and the Minister guarantee borrowing &mdash; when the people's money is being committed in <Col N="1819" /> capital expenditure it is essential to ensure that all the normal safeguards that would be introduced by any outside concern would be applied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House long.  I just want to point out that apart from the national interest and concern generated by this debacle the questions are of particular interest to those of us who live in the vicinity of Cork harbour. Not only are we concerned about the employment question involved, as Senator Harte pointed out, but as one walks down by Monkstown on a Sunday afternoon and looks across at that gigantic plant across the harbour, one thinks that it is bad enough to have one's aesthetic sense offended and one's lungs polluted by these dark satanic mills but to reflect as well that one's money is going up in smoke is more than can be tolerated. But what else can be done?  I agree with those who say that they have to go along with the Bill and that there have been exhaustive investigations and endless hand wringing.  I do not intend to add to that except to share Senator Staunton's complimentary remarks to the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just one or two points that strike me as one who is very much an amateur in the field.  One is that throughout the pages of the Minutes of Evidence the NET people emphasise repeatedly the enormous financial charges that have arisen and that are now being serviced. Words like &ldquo;tremendous increase in borrowings,&rdquo;&ldquo;large increase in finance charges&rdquo; and &ldquo;the interest charges are now the worst factor&rdquo; are phrases which occur throughout.  For example, Mr. Crumlish, as reported at page 14, said that the major burden the company are stuck with at the moment is servicing their investment.  Mr. Conlon said that the company are borrowing money to pay interest on borrowings.  Deputy Lawlor made the observation that so far as he could see the financing banks were the people making all the profit out of this, that they were getting the interest on the money and because there is this underwriting by Government these institutions <Col N="1820" /> are prepared to advance vast sums of money continuously and reap tremendous profits.</P>
    <P>When the employee representative group circulated a brief memo on the critical situation they pointed out that the company's serious under-financing situation was highlighted by the loss of over £50 million for 1980 and that one reason for this was the financing charges of £27 million which was mainly interest on borrowing.</P>
    <P>I am simply making these observations to point out that although there has been much hand wringing about incompetence and industrial disputes and so on, no one seems to raise an eyebrow about these particular villians in the piece, and the pound of flesh that they continually exact at our expense.  Is it because the State is so used to paying vast sums of interest to international financiers that it cannot raise the question of the morality of this kind of parasitical leech-like activity?  Is it because the State itself is in &ldquo;hock&rdquo; because of the incompetence of Government that it cannot question this aspect of the crisis?  I sometimes think it is a great pity that there is not a joint committee of the Houses to investigate the mismanagement of Government.</P>
    <P>This extremely well-publicised episode has, of course, attracted all kinds of public scrutiny and has got much coverage on television and in newspapers and so on. Once again, predictably, it has raised the old denigration of public companies and of the public sector.  Predictably NET were a godsend to those who are continually complaining about waste of funds. We had indeed &mdash; surprise, surprise &mdash; a classic censorious contribution from Senator Goulding in which she took the lazy workers, <i>inter alios,</i> to task and gave a reasonable imitation of a kind of composite Marie Antoinnette and Margaret Thatcher.  I suspect that if NET have put in an appalling performance over the last several years that that does not necessarily mean &mdash; and the Minister's script sensibly makes this point &mdash; that all State companies are therefore tarred with the same brush.  One cannot possibly, for example, talk about Córas Iompair Éireann, which must perform a public service, <Col N="1821" /> or Aer Lingus which must, in the national interest, carry a disastrous loss-making trans-Atlantic service, and other public bodies, in the same breath as NET.</P>
    <P>I want to raise what seems to me to be a contradiction in the matter of departmental supervision of all this, because I take it that there are officials in the Department who keep a watchful eye on semi-State proceedings.  The Minister said today that he was aware that something was beginning to smell, if you will pardon the expression, in NET's operations as far back as three years ago, and that from mid-1978 he was keeping a periodic supervisory watch over the project in Marino Point.  In his reply to the Second Stage debate in Dáil Eireann he said, and I quote from column 2671 of the Official Report for 12 May 1981:</P>
    <P>... the worst aspect of this whole sorry affair was the Arklow Gypsum affair... It is the worst aspect because they lost a little over £9 million, which seems to be relatively small here but in fact is the more serious aspect of it.  I was not aware of anything even approaching the true situation in Arklow Gypsum Limited until March or April 1980.</P>
    <P>Am I right in thinking that there is a discrepancy here between the initiation of concern in one case in mid-1978 and in another not until the spring of 1980, two years later?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>The appalling background to this Bill is set out extremely well in the Joint Committee's recent analysis of NET.  Their report gives a most disturbing picture of the ineptitude of the board and management of NET and of their confused and irresponsible approach to the laying up of public liabilities. One wonders how they came to think it was their business to decide national social policy and keep on unprofitable activities and, indeed, undertake extremely doubtful new schemes of expansion for employment or other social considerations.  I thought it was a kindly aberration of the Joint Committee, in paragraph 13 of their report, to say that NET has been &ldquo;highly successful&rdquo;<Col N="1822" /> in meeting its first objective, namely &ldquo;that of providing Irish farmers with a continuity of fertiliser supply, particularly nitrogen, at prices competitive in relation to EEC prices.&rdquo;  This obviously needs to be qualified, and indeed is qualified later by the committee, by a recognition that the fertiliser was supplied only at a massive and mounting loss which adds to the State's liabilities.  As if these losses were not enough, NET added inexcusably, by its unwise Arklow Gypsum venture, a further £9 million to the taxpayer's burden.</P>
      <P>It is not my wish to go over this sad story or to be censorious &mdash; it is better treated as a caution to those who may be too enthusiastic about the contribution that State enterprise, or a National Enterprise Agency, can make to development of a viable kind.  Any other kind of development is a waste of scarce national resources and offers no solution of our employment problems.</P>
      <P>An emergency or interim payment from public funds of £50 million, as provided for in this Bill, is a serious matter, given the present state of the public finances.  But it seems that it is only the tip of the iceberg.  A table of NET's indebtedness published in the Dáil Official Report of 18 February last shows total borrowings by the company at the end of 1980 at £204,877,000.  Current losses are adding to this at the rate apparently of £56 million a year.  Even when the £50 million of debt due at the end of this month is repaid, will there not still be up to £200 million outstanding &mdash; all of it now to be covered by State guarantee? There is no assurance whatever that this liability will not also have to be taken over and met by the Exchequer.  The lesson from this is that we indulge a very dangerous belief when we think that a State company can borrow on their own account as if they were an independent private commercial entity and go into receivership if they fail, leaving the creditors to scramble for whatever the assets realise.  In reality a State enterprise is ultimately pledging the credit of the State and it seems that the State must accept an obligation to repay the debts in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister who <Col N="1823" /> needs a little time to decide the fundamental questions posed in paragraph 53 of the Joint Committee's report, particularly the second question &mdash; namely, &ldquo;is there a need, nationally, to secure the fertiliser requirements of the agricultural sector of the economy?&rdquo; This needs cool, competent and objective appraisal and I hope the Minister is satisfied that the inter-departmental committee will have all the requisite expertise at their disposal.</P>
    <P>This basic question has long roots, going back to the latter half of the fifties when, as I recall, the Department of Finance were fighting hard against the establishment of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory by the State for the simple reason that it was clearly of advantage to Irish agriculture to be the cheap dumping ground for nitrogen over-produced elsewhere. There was no assurance that our own nitrogen could be produced as cheaply.  These considerations seem to be still relevant.  I read in the committee's report that there is an over-supply of ammonia at present and we know from experience that we have so far been unable to produce fertiliser economically. I hope that, in any case, the Minister will assess most carefully whether there is anything in the security argument or, even if there is, what is the best way of meeting it &mdash; whether it could be met by a certain amount of storage or even by moth-balling the plant&mdash;putting it on a care and maintence basis&mdash;until it is needed, if there is no early prospect of its being made economic.  The loss involved at present in keeping it going must give one pause.  If a little light relief is permissable in this gloomy scene, I am tempted to suggest that, at a time of crisis, indeed even now, we might spread some of that surplus Lough Sheelin slurry further afield.</P>
    <P>I see again in this further report of the Joint Committee an expression of the dangerous fallacy about equity debt ratio which appeared in their reports on the Sugar Company and on Aer Lingus.  I had only a very brief time in the debate on the Aer Lingus motion to explain why commercial norms in this matter are irrelevant <Col N="1824" /> and inapplicable to loss-making State enterprises.  I appeal to the Minister not to be misled.  Interest on capital, as he knows well, has to be paid by someone. It is absolutely no good describing the current level of interest charges as &ldquo;crippling&rdquo; or indulging in the rhetoric that Senator Murphy treated us to a moment ago.  The fact is that if anyone is suffering from present interest charges, given the present high level of inflation, it is those who are lending their money, not those who are borrowing.  The people who are borrowing are not paying, in general, a real rate of interest.  Those who are lending money through deposits and otherwise are suffering a real loss.  Let us not indulge in the fancy that interest rates are crippling and must therefore be shifted to someone else&mdash;the taxpayer.  We are told of the enormous losses that would have to be faced &ldquo;in the absence of a capital injection by the State&rdquo;.  But what this really means is that a permanent subsidy is being sought at the taxpayer's expense.  The £50 million the State has to borrow has to be borrowed at current rates of interest.  It does not come out of thin air.  Even NET, not noted for the reliability of their forecasts, do not promise profitability of the Marino plant in the foreseeable future.  Paragraph 78 of the committee's report refers to a submission by the company that they are capable of returning to profitability by 1985.  But in the very next paragraph this projection is withdrawn.  The Joint Committee rightly warn everyone concerned about the company's tendency to overoptimism.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that I am as concerned as anyone about preserving and creating employment of a sound and lasting character.  I would, however, like to make a point which has some bearing on the social aspects of this question.  A once-for-all allocation of £50 million or so from public funds&mdash;the equivalent of one year's loss at present&mdash;would suffice at current interest rates to assure every one of the 800 employees at Marino Point an income of £10,000 a year for life.  I am not advocating this, of course, but one has to keep some sense of proportion when deciding how much scarce public <Col N="1825" /> money should be devoted to supporting even viable projects for the sake of the employment they afford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If one takes into account all that has been written and said about this company before the Joint Committee reported and since they reported, there is not a lot left to be said in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of points about this, however, that I should like to deal with. The first is the decision by the Minister to pay £50 million immediately to NET in advance of an in-depth examination. With regard to the order of magnitude of the losses involved in this company, we are inclined to lose our sense of proportion about millions and the figure 50 in relation to the hundreds of figures that have been exposed in this whole investigation does not look that big but, as Senator Whitaker has properly pointed out to us, it is an immense sum and the cost to the State is also immense.  I sympathise to a degree with the Minister in the predicament in which he found himself in having to make a decision to seek authority for this money and to pay it over in advance of the examination recommended by the Joint Committee, the need for which he agrees with.  I presume that while he has left the Bill until the committee reported nevertheless he has had continuing discussions with the management of the company concerning their future prospects.  I presume he has got some grounds for continuing to believe that this company might be turned around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit disappointing that the Minister did not give us any figures in relation, for example, to the first four months of this year.  We would like to see how the company have been performing so far this year under the new management. Also we would be entitled at this stage to have a projection from the company for the years ahead.  I know that in the report we expressed some doubt about the forecasting of the company in light of the fact that some projections, as we have said, proved to be seriously over-optimistic.  But one would imagine <Col N="1826" /> that at this stage in light of the publication of the report and the reservations that were expressed about its forecasting ability, a tighter look would have been taken by the company into the future and a realistic projection furnished.  I presume the Minister has sought, and I am sure has obtained, this projection.  It would be of considerable assistance to us in the House when debating the merits of this further grant to the company, to know what sort of projections the company are now putting forward and what sort of a future they see for themselves, because we are in the dark.</P>
    <P>The Minister was, I suppose, totally coerced into paying this money because it is required to meet a specific short-term loan which the company secured. Because the State is involved and the State's reputation is involved, there can be no question of not paying it.  If we were given no other reason than that we would have reluctantly to agree, but it would ease the pain of our agreement if we had more hard figures from the Minister, if any are available.  I would imagine that at this stage some should begin to become available.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we may have to face up to the previously unthinkable thought of wondering whether the plant in Cork and the company generally have a future at all.  Senator Whitaker raised the spectre of the plant going into a care and maintenance situation.  The Minister in the concluding stages of his speech used a sentence that is grim and he might spell out what is behind it a bit more when he is replying.  He said:</P>
    <P>The fact that a State company is involved will have little bearing on the situation if adverse circumstances such as these should occur.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in that the Minister was echoing also the unthinkable, that very fundamental decisions might have to be taken with regard to the future of this plant.  I would hope that that would not happen and that it would not have to happen.  Certainly the implications that such a decision would bring will have to be teased out and I hope that the interdepartmental committee which the Minister <Col N="1827" /> has set in train will do the fundamental teasing out that is so necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it would be altogether prudent for us to dispense with our own source of fertiliser and to rely, as Senator Whitaker suggested, on supplies coming from countries with a surplus and who want to dump the surplus. It would be very nice and very acceptable to Irish farmers if one could guarantee that for all time such dumping would continue but I would have some reservations as to whether we could expect such a thing to continue.</P>
    <P>I understood during the course of our sessions with the company that the number of manufacturers of this product in the western world is diminishing and that one of the advantages for us in this country with this new and highly efficient plant&mdash;technically first-rate we understand&mdash;is that it will leave us in a superior position to any other agricultural user in the west.  The competition in the future is expected to come from producers in the Middle East with their own feed-stock, developing their own chemical industries and producing this product.  I understand the competition from that source had an adverse effect on other producers in the west.  I do not know that it would be altogether wise for us to leave ourselves totally at the mercy of producers in the Middle East.  They may be in competition with each other, they may have a surplus and they have to dump their surplus, but on the other hand they may not.  I do not think we could risk our agricultural industry in that way. Obviously this is a factor that will have to be considered very seriously by the inter-departmental committee.  My personal view&mdash;it has to be a superficial view&mdash;would be that it is a risk the Government should not take and consequently that is an argument for the continuance of Marino Point.</P>
    <P>The other matter which emerges from this report and which is a lesson for the future is the level and frankness of communication between the management of State-sponsored bodies and their sponsoring Government Department and through that Department to the Government <Col N="1828" /> themselves.  It is extremely disturbing to read that at a critical stage of this development, at the very beginning when Government approval was sought, there was such a discrepancy between the understanding of the Government and the advising Departments on the one hand of the cost and the knowledge of the proposing company on the other hand.  The discrepancy was literally huge. If that discrepancy and misunderstanding had been removed, one wonders whether the green light for this project would, or could, have been given at all.  There was a very serious breakdown in communications at that critical time.  I do not suggest that there was any deliberate concealment in order to ensure that the project would get the green light.  Nevertheless, there was a carelessness about the presentation of figures which is reprehensible. It is imperative in any future developments by State companies that there be total and complete frankness between them and the sponsoring Department.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the NESC published a paper critical of the dampening effect which responsibility to Government Departments has on the initiative of those working in semi-State companies in calling for a freer hand.  In theory that is fine.  Initiative should get its head but, on the other hand, with the bitter experience of this venture one must qualify how much freedom is given.  Indeed it is odd that all the executives of State companies who came before the committee indicated that they were perfectly satisfied with the relationship which they had personally and which their companies had with the sponsoring Departments.  They were hardly too shy to tell us something different from what they told the economists from the ESRI.  There is a certain contradiction here but, in any event, even if they feel that the Departments impose too great an inhibition on their activities, in the light of the painful experience of this venture there will have to be, certainly at the stage when the new developments are being put forward, extremely careful control and extremely detailed investigation of plans which are put forward.  In retrospect it is extraordinary <Col N="1829" /> to think that the company were aware that this project was going to cost £60 million while the Department of Industry and Commerce, the IDA and the Government were under the impression that it was going to cost £40 million. It is an extraordinary situation and, while it is historical now, the Government and their Departments in the future must be extremely careful when analysing submissions made from State-sponsored companies.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 109 of our report, we indicated two key factors that had to be taken into account by the Government when evaluating the company's request for additional funds.  The envisaged growth in the Irish nitrogen fertiliser market is one of these factors.  I would like to know from the Minister the company's advice to him in regard to that.  I know that he is coerced into paying the £50 million to maintain the State's reputation. Nevertheless, it would be of interest to the House to know how the company sees the position with regard to these two factors isolated by the committee.</P>
    <P>Again, on page 41, in paragraph 109 of the report, we set out certain guidelines to be borne in mind.  I wonder if the Minister considered them, or will he leave them for consideration by the inter-departmental committee which is examining the whole scene?  It would be of interest to us here to be informed by the Minister in more detail than he did in his opening speech of what information he has got so far and what views he is forming on the problems which face this company.</P>
    <P>Another factor which we touched on in the report was the optimum use of the feedstock, the natural gas.  We have very few indigenous raw materials in this country and one so valuable as natural gas must obviously be used in the best possible way.  One of the criticisms that was made of the company was that its position is even worse than it seemed, because it is getting a hidden subsidy in the sense that it is getting the gas for less than its energy-related value.  I would not altogether go along with that criticism. The company first of all told us that it negotiated the price it paid the producing <Col N="1830" /> company.  If it was able to negotiate a good price, then why should it not get the benefit of it?  That is fair enough.</P>
    <P>In any event there is something contradictory in wanting to use an indigenous natural resource available to us and to pump it into the industry at an energy-related price when we blame the price of energy as being the cause of all our inflation. I made this argument in connection with Bord na Móna's application to charge an energy-related price for their turf.  What is the point in having a natural resource if we are going to jack up the price ourselves to the same level as the oil-producing countries charge for their energy?  It was argued in the other House that one consequence is that if we are selling our fertiliser abroad we are giving to a foreign consumer the benefit of the cheap price the manufacturing company is paying for the gas.  I do not know what is the answer to that.  We do not put up the price of the fertiliser abroad because it will not be competitive.  The other alternative is not to manufacture it at all. That, again, would have other economic consequences for the company and for the trading affairs of the nation.  If the company struck a good price for the gas it should get credit for it.</P>
    <P>The committee were satisfied that the plant which is now in existence at Marino Point is a first-class plant.  It is modern and is technically efficient.  There were some initial teething problems, but these are not unexpected in any new plant of that complexity.  As a resource to the nation it has something of extreme value. It leads me back to the other point, whether we will have to face the unthinkable, of putting the company on a care and maintenance basis and closing down this plant.  I do not think we should, because if that should happen the startup problems could be immense again. The expertise that has been assembled would be dissipated and there would be social hardship in that.  It has to be avoided.  The Exchequer has to pay a certain social price but this is inevitable in a developing country.  We have to pay a certain social price in many of our activities and NET should be continued for social, strategic and economic reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> The lessons that come out of what happened are clear to be seen.  I have no doubt that the Minister is aware of them and will take all steps to ensure that the full lesson has been learned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that a majority of the Members of the House in welcoming the Bill have taken the opportunity to indulge in a little plain speaking about the activities of a State-sponsored body some of whose operations have been described by the Minister as hair-raising.</P>
      <P>It is very proper that as Members of a Parliament who are responsible for voting large sums of money in order to keep these concerns going we should concern ourselves with the accountability or the lack of it by those to whom we give the authority to spend this money.  What we are talking about, basically, is public accountability; to whom should a State-sponsored body be accountable?  In the final analysis it should be accountable to the taxpayer on whom falls the burden of paying for these bodies, and who trusts his elected representatives to see to it that his money is spent wisely.</P>
      <P>The criterion for Government spending, whether it is on State-sponsored bodies or on anything else, surely should be the same that applies normally to private concerns, whether one is budgeting for an industry or for a family.  That criterion is that one cuts one's cloth according to one's measure.  If government spending is shown to be wasteful, how can ordinary people be expected to respond to exhortations from on high to stay within their budgets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Joint Committee on NET makes sad and shocking reading. Although their terms are more moderate than the Minister's, the words &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; and &ldquo;misunderstanding&rdquo; only serve to illustrate a long litany of waste of time and of money.  The Minister has to mount a fire-brigade effort to try to save something from the wreck.  At this point we have an obligation to ensure that the boards of semi-State bodies will not be allowed to assume that because they provide a social service they are being <Col N="1832" /> handed a blank cheque and can spend public money like drunken sailors.  This concept of a social service is arrogant and unacceptable to most taxpayers.  It has never been authoritatively defined or quantified by government, and this has resulted in what the NESC report on &ldquo;Enterprise in the Public Sector&rdquo; calls &ldquo;the confusion of social and commercial objectives within State-sponsored bodies&rdquo;. If it were possible to specify on tax demands how much of each pound goes on NET, CIE and all the other bodies, then the taxpayer himself would be obliged to sit up and take notice.  Until this happens the responsibility rests with Parliament, and I suggest that this responsibility can best be discharged by enlarging the powers of the existing Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies to allow them to monitor carefully the operation of these bodies, giving them far-reaching powers, including the powers of hiring and firing.</P>
    <P>I note with interest the Minister's statement in his speech that he is reviewing the general question of the relationship between his Department and the State-sponsored bodies to assess what changes, if any, are necessary in the light of experience of recent years.  I am more concerned with the relationship between the Houses of the Oireachtas and State-sponsored bodies.  I think a working committee composed of Members of both Houses is essential if we are to avoid a similar public scandal in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about this Bill, which we obviously have decided to welcome albeit unwillingly and gritting our teeth.  I would imagine that the very act of passing this Bill and giving this injection of funds to NET, which will go straight out of the country to pay a foreign bill, means inevitably that we will be back here another day giving more money in the same direction. That is why everybody here has felt it is important to make a contribution to this debate.  We are all very conscious of the fact that we have not heard the end of State involvement in NET.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it was described at the beginning of this debate, it is very definitely a crisis <Col N="1833" /> Bill.  It is quite astonishing to think that on 29 May the money that we are voting today will be needed to keep NET actually going at all.  We are passing this Bill with our eyes closed because all we have at the moment is an absolutely damning report from the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies about NET.  We have had some words of the Minister that he waited for the report of the committee and he assured us that he has been conducting an ongoing investigation with the company.  I hope that the fact that he decided to give this money means that that ongoing investigation has yielded something hopeful to change the picture, which is very black from what the ordinary observer can see.</P>
    <P>We are passing a crisis Bill to save the company from immediate bankruptcy. That is the main purpose of this debate today.  It is very sad to consider that NET, which began with such enthusiasm and hope and with such a very brave idea of establishing a certain strength for Ireland in the field of self-sufficiency in nitrogen for agriculture, now appears to everybody in this country as some kind of monster, something which is like a chain around the taxpayer's neck which cannot be shrugged off.  Whether we like it or not that is the general feeling about NET around the country.  It must be a great weight around the Minister's neck also.</P>
    <P>We should think about the people involved in this problem.  A factor which is very important to remember here is the health and well-being of a small town in the south of Wicklow and an area surrounding it in south Wicklow and Wexford, where there have been alarms, excursions and depressions.  Rumours and counter-rumours were rife in the town and in the area for a long time, and a feeling that the bottom was about to fall out of the economic viability of that town.  One of the reasons, I gather, why we are deciding to extend this rescue net to NET is that it may put at rest some of the worst fears of the people of that town, a town which came to life over the past ten or 15 years and which gradually emerged into an extremely lively and prosperous town full of very concerned people with a very fine community spirit. <Col N="1834" /> It was a great shame to go from meeting to meeting in that town and realise the degree of depression among the people.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned, there have been extraordinary, hair-raising stories about the kind of things which have been going on in NET.  I do not know if all of those stories are true.  I am quite sure some of them are.  I might mention one of the more hair-raising ones which I heard from three different sources and which I found it difficult to believe when I heard it first.  I found it difficult to believe when I heard it the second time but, by the time I had heard it three times, it seemed to me that there must be some rationale in it.</P>
    <P>It was that inside the NET plant in Arklow there was a room which was referred to by everybody as the office of the dead.  The reason it was referred to as the office of the dead was that four highly paid technologists went into that office every day.  There is no telephone in it.  I am not quite sure what they did all day.  I was told they played cards, or something, all day at some enormous salary. Because they were all on some form of contract they could not be got rid of and so there was this office of the dead. That is the kind of story I presume the Minister had in mind when he talked about hair-raising practices in Arklow.  If it is true that kind of thing is terribly depressing and disheartening for workers and management.  The practices of a management which would allow that kind of situation to arise must be questionable. It is very disheartening for workers who feel there is no direction coming from the top and that there is room for that kind of strange procedure.  It must be very hard for them to feel they have a motivation to make something succeed.</P>
    <P>In Arklow the families of the workers look for a scapegoat, and it is natural for everybody in this sad situation to look for a scapegoat.  Blame must be laid fairly where it really lies.  I would prefer to look forward, but it is of interest that in Arklow so many people become very locally patriotic or parochial about it.  They point the finger at Cork and at Marino Point and say if it were not for that debacle in Cork they would be all right today and <Col N="1835" /> would not have these worries.  A totally irrational resentment builds up against another part of the country because people are looking for a scapegoat, and it is perfectly understandable.</P>
    <P>The whole sorry story is, as somebody mentioned earlier, one of the most expensive lessons the Irish taxpayer will ever learn about our own democracy. Because it is a lesson, and because it is so expensive, we cannot say &ldquo;NET will never happen again&rdquo;.  We have to say &ldquo;This cannot happen again and, whatever is wrong with our system, whether it be inside the State-sponsored bodies, whether it is because of the way we run the Government, or whatever the basic underlying reasons are for all this, they must be tackled because otherwise we will have more NETs in the future.&rdquo;  It is a very painful lesson but it is one that must be taken to heart.</P>
    <P>When NET were being set up the siting of the company caused a very great furore at the time, but that is ancient history. One of the small prices&mdash;to some people it would not seem so small&mdash;paid for the siting of NET is the devastation to the foliage, the trees and the surrounding area.  They crouch near the Vale of Avoca like an enormous white elephant emitting smoke, fumes and mist which may be perfectly harmless.  I am told they are but they do not seem to be perfectly harmless to the foliage and the trees.  It is worth mentioning the environmental price we pay for large chemical plants which seems to be inevitable.  Obviously it was considered that the employment element in NET, and the benefit to the country, far outweighed the environmental hazards of siting the company.  It is important to mention that <i>en passant.</i></P>
    <P>I join in the compliments paid to the Joint Committee's report on NET.  Very few of us would be in a position to make a meaningful contribution to this debate were it not for that very comprehensive report.  In the report, while they range over a very wide area of causes, effects and conclusions, which should be required reading for every legislator, they are also constructive in their approach.  I should like to mention one <Col N="1836" /> particular paragraph in which they go into the question of employment; 800 people are still employed at NET and 800 families in that area depend on NET, and 800 families amount to a very important element in a small town.</P>
    <P>In the Joint Committee's report they note with approval that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board in the NET Board Resolution of 5 February 1981 has also undertaken to give sympathetic consideration to the provision of alternative employment to displaced workers in any activity which can be determined as viable.  To this end, the services of all appropriate Government Agencies will be fully utilised.  Furthermore, the question of the utilisation of any redundant equipment for other viable commercial operations will be fully and expeditiously examined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other Senators have said that the IDA should give special attention to the south Wicklow area in the light of the problems faced by NET.  I fully endorse the suggestion that workers who find themselves in this extremely uncertain situation through no fault of their own should get the first consideration of any Government agency in a position to do anything for them.</P>
    <P>The NET problem is an extremely valuable lesson to us all, a lesson which cost the taxpayers a great deal of money at a time when we are told money is extremely scarce.  We have to ask ourselves why this can happen and what can we do as legislators, as elected representatives, to make sure that this kind of thing cannot happen again.  One of the problems which caused the NET debacle was a breakdown of information between the board of NET and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism on the question of how much the Marino Point plant would cost, if it would cost £40 million or £60 million.  That is an absolutely staggering breakdown of information and I find it rather alarming, to put it mildly.  The Joint Committee on this point said:</P>
    <P>The Committee has established to its satisfaction that there was a serious misunderstanding between N.E.T. on the one hand and the Government and <Col N="1837" /> the relevant Government Departments on the other hand as to the amount of the estimated capital cost of the project during the critical period covering Government approval of N.E.T's authorisation to Kellogg to proceed.</P>
    <P>It is not, perhaps, the first time there have been breakdowns between Governments and the rest of the community.  We should ask if we are reasonable in asking Ministers for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in this rapidly developing country to carry on their shoulders the weight of responsibility they are expected to carry.  The Minister has my sympathy in this matter.  He did not enjoy going into the Dáil with this Bill and I am sure he has not enjoyed coming here with it today.  I do not believe that, in this day and age, our system is modern enough, or is properly designed, to cope with the kind of decisions Ministers are expected to make.  It is too much of a load to ask Ministers to carry.  I said it before and I say it again, that every Government Minister in a Ministry like The Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism should have a cabinet of his own drawn from outside the civil service to help him to make decisions.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear <Col N="1838" /> that there is an inter-departmental committee to study NET.  The Government are giving a great deal of money to the company, which rather constrains the deliberations of the Committee because they will hardly say: &ldquo;That was money down the drain.&rdquo;  It seems to me that is one more rather sad feature.  We have had several gates closed to us because of the exigencies of pressing debts which have to be paid.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, gritting my teeth I welcome this Bill.  I am sorry the taxpayers have to foot the bill but, for the sake of the future of NET, and the future of the workers and their families in Arklow and the surrounding areas, I am glad we are doing this, and doing it in time to give NET a breathing space leading to what we hope will be a very healthy recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the necessity for this Bill and I support it.  I want to take this opportunity to make a few points.  The report prepared by the Joint Committee on the State-Sponsored Bodies is very helpful like all the other reports.  I certainly welcome the development of these joint committees.  I find that the report is weak in that it does not help me to make up my mind about the future of NET.  It does not tell me what added value is being generated by NET and what added value per employee is being generated.  It does not tell me what competing groups in other parts of the country are doing in the terms of added value per their employees.  It is one thing to say that the trading profits are low or non-existent but it does not show me whether this operation is productive compared to other operations in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Japanese decide not to continue to invest in an operation of this kind they work to a criterion which is that they will continue to invest as long as the added value per employee, or per unit of investment, is in or around the world position, particularly the world market share leader.  If the report does not tell me that, I find it difficult to make a decision. Because of other preoccupations I have not had the time to do the work <Col N="1839" /> myself.  It is lacking in that, and because of that I fault the report.</P>
    <P>It tells us that the output per employee is about £20,000 compared to £40,000 in the UK, but that does not give me the figures in value added terms.  This company are turning over £60 million.  They are generating that level of income from their operation.  That is a sizeable operation. It took a sizeable investment to bring it about but, if it is important for us to develop our indigenous resources to a particular point, we have to measure it in terms of the value we add to those indigenous resources through the operations we set up.  There is a weakness there.</P>
    <P>I also find a weakness in a statement in paragraph 95 of the Joint Committee's report: &ldquo;The Debt: Equity ratio had slipped from 1.1 in 1974 to 1.9:1 in 1976, 5.2:1 in 1977 and 7.8:1 in 1978.&rdquo; It reads a little bit like the jargon of the business press.  In operations of this kind in Japan, a debt to equity ratio of perhaps one to ten will be quite tolerable where they are trying to build up market shares.  It means nothing to me that they talk about having a one to one debt to equity ratio.  I find that meaningless.  An interest cover of four to one would seem to me to be somewhat of a luxury in an operation where you are building up market shares based on an indigenous resource, particularly at a time when energy costs are consuming such a large proportion of the input costs.  I make that point because I find it difficult to come to a conclusion based on the facts before me.</P>
    <P>On the positive side of the report, it draws attention to the £5 million loss brought about by demarcation arguments. It is high time in the industrial relations scene, particularly when we are trying to build up industries based on indigenous resources, that the trade unions began to play their part.  The Minister referred to the question of the relationship between the Department and the boards of the semi-State bodies and said he is looking into it himself. Obviously there is some weakness here. The Cathaoirleach has already pulled up Senator Hussey for discussing this matter so I will not go into it.  I would point out <Col N="1840" /> that there is a development in other countries, like the US, at the moment where directors of companies are jointly and severally responsible for the decisions of those companies, and particularly the main investment decisions.  They are finding it more and more difficult in the US to get people to act as directors of boards because of this responsibility. Directors have to take out insurance to cover themselves against a loss situation. Directors of semi-State bodies might not rush in to take on these responsibilities if that development took place here.</P>

      <P>If Gilbert and Sullivan were alive today they would have the material for the greatest comic opera of all time.  It is not so comic when you look at the money involved for the State and through the State for the taxpayer. It is a very sorry story, a saga of disaster from beginning to end.  I was very intrigued by the Minister's statement that he said in the Dáil that his attention had been brought on numerous occasions to extraordinary and hair-raising work practices which apparently exist in NET Arklow plant.  I was wondering what these hair-raising practices could be, because in my lifetime about the only one who was capable of raising the hair on my head was one, Bram Stoker.  Senator Hussey told us &mdash; and this was a startling room called the office of the dead to which people retired, cut themselves off from the outside world, and played cards, or whatever people would play in such circumstances.  Now the company say to the Minister: <i>&ldquo;Domine exaude vocem meum&rdquo;</i> and the taxpayer must answer not <Col N="1841" /> in pounds or in thousands of pounds but in millions.  I wonder if in times to come NET will be regarded as the Dracula of the State-sponsored enterprises.</P>
      <P>We have been taught a very serious lesson.  I hope we learn from that lesson. It makes one ask oneself the question: &ldquo;Are we the type of people who, under State-sponsored auspices, can handle enterprises such as NET in which there is colossal capital investment?&rdquo; We are told 1,150 workers are involved.  My heart goes out especially to the workers who have been declared redundant.  I know a man who devoted his whole life to the Marino plant in Cork.  Now his life is in shreds and his ambitions are unrealisable. He does not want to be redundant. He wants to continue to work.  It is a very sad story.  I hope the lesson will be learned and that never again will such a disaster take place.  We will have to be on our toes all the time watching the State-sponsored bodies.  Had this been a private enterprise, I do not think there is any doubt that this disaster would not have taken place.  Having said that, I think the Government are right to give them this £50 million.  Two things are involved: the hope of keeping as many workers as possible at work and, as Senator Cooney mentioned, the desirability of being independent as far as our own resources and facilities are concerned for producing fertilisers to ensure that our agricultural industry will be up to date at all times.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the various Senators who have spoken. I will deal as rapidly as I can with as many of the points as I can.  Senator Staunton spoke first and inquired why &mdash; and he used this phrase &mdash; the loss for 1980 is expected to be £56 million and why the exact position is not known.  The exact position is known but the figures are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and until he specifies precisely what the loss is I cannot give the figure.  It is not unusual for the Comptroller and Auditor General not to have the figures available at this time of the year.  It does not matter greatly in this <Col N="1842" /> case, but it does in some others, particularly in some other more developmental boards.</P>
      <P>He also inquired why the committee I am establishing is an inter-departmental one rather than just providing supervision by my Department alone.  The answer is that the Department of Agriculture obviously have an interest in this matter because the likely usage of fertiliser and the type of fertiliser to be used in the years to come are of considerable importance in trying to plan for the future.  The Department of Energy, perhaps above all, have an interest because they are responsible for trying to achieve the optimum utilisation of the natural gas in the national interest and it would be quite unrealistic not to allow them their appropriate input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally the Department of Finance surely have an interest in a matter that has cost the taxpayer as dearly as this enterprise has and where there are, as of today, outstanding loans in excess of £204 million effectively in respect of which the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab, whether or not a formal legal guarantee is given, for reasons to which a number of Senators adverted.  Surely that is the kernel of one of the weaknesses of the whole system of public manufacturing enterprise in this country.  Once it starts it scarcely ever stops.  There can be no question of a normal liquidation where the creditors, particularly the banks, have to take their chance.  They do not have to take their chance.  I wonder whether the banks, for example, who have, almost uniquely in this country, the tremendous gilt-edged, copperfastened guarantee of lending to these State companies, would take that into account when they are asked to bear some element of risk in lending to other companies. I was rather taken aback to discover recently from the IDA, for example, that of the companies which started under the enterprise development scheme last year, 70 per cent of the loan capital had to be guaranteed by the IDA, otherwise the banks would not put it up.  You often wonder how any bank could succeed in losing out almost on any loan in industry <Col N="1843" /> in this country when they approach the matter in this way and when they have the bonanza of lending large sums of money to State bodies in the circumstances which I have described.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy inquired as to why the Arklow Gypsum situation was not picked up in the quarterly reports which I initiated in mid-1978.  They were not picked up by me until the spring of 1980.  The reason is that these reports essentially cover the Marino Point plant and the Arklow fertiliser operation and no details of subsidiaries were given in them in relation to such reports.  My Department, like any other, are dependent on what information the company chooses to provide. The quarterly reports have recently been extended, and we are looking at other ways of improving the information flow from the company.  With the limited staff resources that are available in a Department we are simply unable to duplicate what the management can or should provide in either this or many other companies.  I do not want to give the impression that I am expressing the view that the information flow currently being made available is inadequate.  So far as I can see it is adequate and has been for the last nine months of so. Equally assuredly it was not prior to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte referred to the difficulties that exist in south Wicklow and north Wexford.  I am aware that there are serious difficulties there.  One of the things that struck me when we looked at that area very hard six months ago when we saw what was coming up in relation to NET was why there was so relatively little industrial development in the area, apart from the old traditional industry of Arklow Pottery and its more recent spin-off, Noritake.  The reason, which was explained to me, and I do not doubt that it is right, was that it was impossible for anybody to establish what I would call normal industry, paying normal rates of pay, in the hinterland of the NET plant at Arklow because no normal industrialist could hope to compete with the wage rates that traditionally have been paid in NET.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> Senator Brugha made reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the difficulties that seemed to arise.  I dealt with that point fully in column 2677 of 12 May 1981 in the Dáil.  I do not think it is necessary to go through all that again fully, but we have had to look very carefully at the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who was established originally in the last century and certainly carried over into our own administration in the early twenties in circumstances totally different from those, for example, that we are discussing today.  It was never envisaged that there would be such companies at that time. While I do not doubt that the Comptroller and Auditor General's powers, functions and abilities are appropriate to his primary job of auditing the public finances, his very suitability and the suitability of his powers and functions for that job may render it difficult for him to deal as adequately as he would wish with the kind of problems that face a company such as this, particularly the sort of auditing that one feels perhaps should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A projection dated 4 March 1981 which was based on the implementation of the CCF rationalisation programme and on the making of an equity subscription of £50 million in May 1981, forecasts a movement into profit in 1984 of the small sum of £1.1 million.  There was an inquiry about NET's present projection.  It would be wiser to wait and see.  I have read many projections of the company and I can only hope that they are more realistic in the eighties than they were in the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's results for the first <Col N="1845" /> quarter of 1981 to 31 March are not audited, needless to say, but I do not see why I should not give them.  The net loss for the period after interest and depreciation charges amounted to £3.77 million, an improvement of £1.30 million against the budgeted net loss of £5.07 million for the period.  The interest charges for the quarter amounted to £6.5 million and depreciation charges were £2.78 million, giving a trading profit of £5.51 million before interest and depreciation.  Fixed costs were generally in line with the budget expectations for the period.  In the case of raw materials and electricity, there was a considerable saving on budget resulting from higher on-line times achieved on ammonia and urea production at Marino Point.  The budget had provided for two breakdowns per month for tube failure prior to the reharping of a reformer furnace since September 1980.  In the quarter under review only one tube failure incident occurred, which was a significant improvement in performance.  CAN production in Arklow was very consistent throughout the period and was some 14,500 tonnes ahead of budget for the quarter and some 18,000 tonnes ahead of the corresponding period last year.  There was a very brisk demand for nitrogen products for the months of January and February.  However, sales in March dropped back, particularly in the case of urea, due to unusually wet weather conditions and the effects of a price increase at that time.  However, budget prices are better and were achieved for all products sold in the first quarter.</P>
    <P>The somewhat higher degree of optimism I have expressed in relation to this company since December is, at least to some extent, justified by those results.  I have not got the results for the month of April in tabular form but they are in line with the first quarter results and are ahead of budget in terms of sales and prices obtained and the loss is smaller than what was projected.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney inquired about the fertiliser market situation.  There has been a tremendous growth in total nitrogen usage&mdash;that is straight N and N in compounds&mdash;in Ireland since the mid-sixties. <Col N="1846" /> In 1964/65 approximately 25,000 tonnes of nutrient N were used but by 1979/80 this had increased by a factor of ten to nearly 250,000 tonnes.  This growth was brought about by more efficient farming methods, the increase in cattle numbers and the more favourable economic structures resulting from EEC membership.  There is still considerable potential for further nitrogen consumption here.  For example, in the UK the application rate is twice as high as in Ireland, whereas in the Netherlands, where dairying is the predominant farming activity, it is four times greater than here.</P>
    <P>When NET were planning the Marino Point project in 1974, it projected that usage of nitrogen on the Irish market would increase by about ten per cent per annum, and these projections have proved to be broadly correct up to the present time.  While the current depression in the agricultural sector undoubtedly has had an impact on fertiliser sales, which dropped slightly in overall terms for the fertiliser years 1979-1980 and 1980-1981, some experts believe that the depression is levelling off and demand for fertiliser should pick up next year. The fall-off in fertiliser sales has not affected nitrogen to the same extent as other fertilisers, particularly straight phosphorous and potassium and compounds.</P>
    <P>The nitrogen application gives an immediate financial return to the farmer whereas P and K application may be deferred for one or two years without any obvious disimprovement in soil fertility. On the assumption that the market for straight nitrogen fertilisers increases at the rate of ten per cent per annum, the total output of NET's urea and CAN plans, that is approximately 250,000 tonnes of nutrient N, would be required to meet home demands for straight N by 1986.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Institute believe that NET may be over-optimistic in their forecasts, and they see NET having to continue to export urea up to the end of the eighties.  The Agricultural Institute believe that much will depend on how <Col N="1847" /> quickly the beef industry can recover from the present depression, as they believe that increased application of fertilisers mainly depends on the level of agricultural incomes.  Nevertheless, the Institute is confident that in the medium term further demands for nitrogenous fertilisers will continue to grow at a significant rate, perhaps levelling off at twice the present utilisation: that is 500,000 nutrient N tonnes by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>NET's marketing strategy in respect of urea is that the anticipated increase in demands for straight nitrogen in Ireland will be met through sales of urea produced at Marino Point, and the company is actively marketing and promoting this product.  The Agricultural Institute have carried out extensive tests on the suitability of urea for the Irish market and have come out strongly in its favour.  In the past there has been some doubt about the acceptability of urea to Irish conditions but, with proper application, the Institute believe that urea will ultimately form up to 50 per cent of straight nitrogen usage in Ireland by about the end of the decade. Indeed, urea which has been imported into Ireland for many years has been growing in popularity recently.  Over 80,000 tonnes were used in 1979-80 compared with 41,000 tonnes in 1977-1978. NET's production of urea amounts to 310,000 tonnes per annum.  NET has been successful in recent years in capturing a very significant share of the home market for straight nitrogen fertilisers: that is up to 85 per cent with the balance represented by imports, mainly from the UK and other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker raised the question of whether we, even at this stage, still need our own independent indigenous source of nitrogenous fertilisers.  Of course, we do not.  From the start we were presumably planning against a situation where there would be non-availability. So far as I know, we have only encountered that situation once since this company was started in the beginning of the sixties.  It is only fair to say, therefore, that the Department of Finance read the <Col N="1848" /> situation correctly in the late fifties.  It would not have seriously disrupted Irish agriculture if this company had never been formed.</P>
    <P>The same question can equally validly be asked today, and the potential disruption in the world is greater today than it was perhaps in the late fifties.  The likelihood of demand for nitrogen in new farming areas is greater now than it was then.  On the other hand, of course, the potential supply of ammonia is much greater as well.  There is no doubt about that.  Because the supply of ammonia is greater, the potential supply of nitrogen is greater.  On the other hand we are in the somewhat different situation from the happy days of the late fifties when nothing had been spent whereas today £200 million has been injected.</P>
    <P>Several Senators talked about the possibility of mothballing these two plants. I am sure if one were in the situation where you were a major multinational producer of nitrogen and ammonia and you had ten such plants or 15, as many of them had and you felt the need to mothball some of them, you would certainly give very serious consideration to these two.  On the other hand, this is a company which has no other manufacturing facility and if you mothball these, the company may, in part, go out of business.  I certainly hope that it will stay in business, but I am not going to keep it in business at what I would consider too high a cost to the taxpayer who, unhappily, has already paid more than his share.</P>
    <P>While the £50 million proposed by this Bill to be put in as equity is described by some Senators and other commentators as a short-term crisis re-injection of money to meet a liability that will occur on 29 May, nonetheless, I am of the view that, while if it is paid now rapidly in the short-term to meet that particular liability, and if the company cannot, after this further large injection, survive on it, I, for one, would be very slow to ask the Irish taxpayer to put more into it.  I think the company can do it.  As I said, the parameter of the projection that I read out was the investment of £50 million in this month.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute as I did in <Col N="1849" /> the Dáil to the efforts and dedication of the new managing director, Mr. Conlon. He is capable of bringing about the salvation of the company.  The results it has shown, while they are bad by anybody's standards, in the context of this company are very heartening and are a considerable improvement on what the position might otherwise be.  If Mr. Conlon gets the co-operation that one would like to see him get at all levels within that company, he can bring about the situation that I am sure all of us would hope can be achieved.  There are those who would say it would be better not to harp back to the problems and difficulties of the last five or six years in relation to this company, but if we do not do that to some extent we are increasing the chance of a repetition of it in some other area.</P>
    <P>Some emphasis on the way this company was run and the practices that were tolerated within it is no harm if it does anything to kill the notion that is widely prevalent in this country that any kind of State company is a bottomless pit and that it does not matter what attitude is taken up by those running it or working it because the taxpayer will at all times be there to bail it out.  In this respect, I would like to signify my agreement with what Senator Whitaker has said, that we must not lose sight of the fact that this £50 million is costing the Irish taxpayer a lot of money.  He has borrowed it, he will pay interest on it, and he will ultimately have to repay it.  Realistically, can he expect to get any dividend on this investment?  Would anybody in the private sector contemplate putting even £500 into such an enterprise?  Quite obviously he would not.  This company, its present situation and this legislation which arises out of that situation will, I hope, at least, be a milestone in the consideration of Irish public manufacturing and trading enterprise.  If it is not, and if the lessons of this unhappy saga are not learned widely, then we might well have to face the fact that Irish public enterprise in the commercial field does not work.</P>

      <P>Because this Bill, and the Industrial Development (No. 2) Bill both deal with changes in industrial development legislation, I propose, if the House agrees, to do as I did in the Dáil last week and cover both Bills in my speech.  As I pointed out in the Dáil, the principal provision of this Bill is to raise from £750 million to £1,500 million the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which may be made by the authority and the aggregate amount of grants which may be paid to the authority for this purpose out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The total amount of capital issued to the IDA at end April 1981 was almost £724 million and the authority's capital allocation for 1981 is £196 million.  This new limit will permit the IDA to carry out its functions after the end of this month, for a further three to four years.  I am also proposing in section 2, subsections (2) and (3) of the Bill an increase from £100 million to £125 million in the aggregate amount of loan guarantees which may be given by the IDA.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the IDA may pay grants and interest subsidies, give guarantees and take equity, without prior Government approval, up to the following limits:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  Total amount of grants in respect of fixed assets (purchased or leased) and the cost of factory rents for new industry, £2.5 million; (ii) Total amount of training grant, £2.0 million; (iii)  Maximum loan guarantee in respect of fixed assets for new industry, £750,000; (iv)  Maximum loan guarantee in respect of restructuring, <Col N="1851" /> £750,000; (v)  Maximum loan guarantee and interest subsidy (in the aggregate) the authority may give in respect of moneys borrowed for working capital under the Enterprise Development Programme, £300,000; (vi)  Maximum research and development grant, £250,000; (vii)  Maximum equity participation in a particular company, £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>These new limits take account of the erosion of money values since limits were last increased under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity today to deal with two aspects of industrial policy which will play an increasingly significant role in the coming years, that is research and development, and the small industry sector.</P>
    <P>Research and development are very important in ensuring the viability of any undertaking, small or large.  Overdependence on one product or a limited range of products can make firms vulnerable to market or technological changes. The new limit of £250,000 will, I am confident, lead to a much greater number of companies undertaking research and development programmes.  I would particularly enjoin Irish owned companies to maximise the use of this valuable incentive. It is in their own interest and in the long-term interest of their employees to do so.  Grants up to 50 per cent of total costs of research and development are available to all companies.</P>
    <P>While talking of research and development, it is worth while to mention two important developments in the past 12 months&mdash;the establishment of the European Research Institute of Ireland and the innovation centre for small industry.</P>
    <P>The European Research Institute of Ireland, which is now established in Limerick, is a contract research and development service based on large scale high technology projects.  The institute, a non-profit research company, will be run on strictly commercial lines.  It will actively market its resources and undertake research on behalf of clients in Ireland and throughout Europe.  It is aimed at accelerating research and development <Col N="1852" /> activity in Irish industry and it will be a major incentive in attracting high technology research and development programmes to Ireland and in developing international research and development markets.</P>
    <P>Last July I announced the establishment of an innovation centre for small industry.  This centre is currently located on the campus of the NIHE in Limerick. It will be relocated later this year in Enterprise House, which is now under construction at Castletroy, County Limerick. The function of the innovation centre is to introduce technology-based product opportunities to existing firms and to potential entrepreneurs.  Though primarily focussed on the mid-west region, the centre's facilities and systems are available nationwide and companies throughout the country should not be slow in availing themselves of its services.</P>
    <P>In 1967, the small industries programme in Ireland was launched to complement our efforts in attracting overseas firms to locate in this country.  Its major objectives were to generate new small industries, particularly those promoted by Irish entrepreneurs, and to help existing industries expand.  The success of this programme, and its increasing importance within the overall industrial development strategy can be measured by the fact that in 1967 projects approved under it had a job potential of something less than 400, while in 1980 the number of jobs approved was 11,500.  The importance of the contribution of the small industry sector can also be gauged from the fact that in 1980 the sector accounted for approximately one-third of all job approvals.</P>
    <P>There is need for a closer relationship between the overseas firms locating here and local small industry.  Most of these overseas companies are committed to purchasing in Ireland and it is up to local small industry to meet this demand. Indeed, the IDA's Project Identification Unit, in 1980, identified by product £70 million of imported materials / components required by manufacturing industry and, as a consequence, business worth more than £11.5 million was placed with Irish companies.  The result of this activity <Col N="1853" /> led to the setting up of 56 new projects, with potential of over 1,000 at full projection.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of industrial development with which I would now like to deal, relates directly to the second of the two Bills before the House.  To be successful in the job creation game, it is not simply a question of offering large amounts of soft money.  Such a policy might have an immediate impact, but the type of investment we would get as a result could be very short-term indeed.  Rather it is a question of utilising our natural advantages effectively and gearing our incentives to those areas where sound industrial and commercial growth will take place.  Accordingly, any new policy for job creation, to be successful, must be formulated on the basis of the following guidelines:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the expected direction of that future industrial and commercial development with the greatest growth potential;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the natural advantages available to help exploit these new areas; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the incentives required, if any, to boost the overall effort.</P>
    <P>Current developments in the manufacturing area, particularly in the computer sub-sector, together with changing patterns of employment in industrialised countries, indicate that the technical services sector will play an increasingly important role in the industrial and commercial life of this country.  While the services sector in Ireland represents about 50 per cent of total employment, the corresponding figures in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the United States are 58 per cent, 62 per cent and 65 per cent respectively.  Consequently, there is room for considerable growth here.  More important, however, is that we have now achieved a situation, thanks to the industrial development policies of the last 20 years, whereby some of the world leaders in high technology industry have manufacturing plants here. The time is ripe for the exploitation of this manufacturing capability and for bringing it a step further.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the Dáil, the growth prospects in the technical services sector are great.  But missing out on this <Col N="1854" /> growth will not simply mean that we stand still.  The sorry truth is that if we fail to build up the capability of providing technical services of the highest standards, we will soon put at risk much of our high technology industry.  So it is not just a case of maximising the spin-off benefits, but also a question of protecting the manufacturing base.</P>
    <P>The second guideline which I mentioned&mdash;natural advantages&mdash;indicates an Irish capability which did not exist 20 years ago.  The two crucial aspects in the development of the services sector are skilled&mdash;in the broadest sense of the word &mdash; employees and communications.  Our young people can thank us for providing them with the educational opportunities which enable them to become the best educated and most skilful generation in our history.  Not that they are any more talented than any other generation&mdash;they are simply afforded better opportunities. They will not, however, thank us if we do not have the foresight to provide them with worthwhile employment in Ireland commensurate with their skills.  What greater challenge do we have than to see that their ambitions are fulfilled?  What more damaging course to future generations can we follow than to deny our young people the chance of working at home? Furthermore, why let others be the principal beneficiaries from the massive investment in education made in this country over the last 20 years?  On the communications front, the Government's huge investment in dragging our 19th century telecommunication system into the 21st century is being pressed ahead with great speed.  The result is that the two critical components of a dynamic service sector are, or are almost, in place.</P>
    <P>The third point for analysis is the question of incentives.  Lest it be thought that, as was the case with capital grants to manufacturing industry, we are &ldquo;leading the way&rdquo; by introducing incentives for the services industry, I should point out that competition for international mobile investment in service projects is just as intense as it is for manufacturing projects, and possibly more so, since the services sector is regarded internationally as having very strong growth potential.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> While we could not hope to match the incentives being offered by richer countries, even if we wished to do so, it is necessary to provide some incentives which complement our natural advantages. When the IDA introduced their pilot programme for service industries in 1973, the incentives available were capital grants &mdash; which are not particularly appropriate or effective because of the low capital base normally associated with service industries &mdash; training grants and, in certain cases, export sales relief.  As the House will be aware, export sales relief has ceased to be offered from I January, 1981.  The IDA's service industry programme achieved a fair measure of success, with an annual average of 1,000 service job approvals between 1975 and 1980.  Over 2,000 jobs now exist in IDA backed service industries.  However, with the new incentive package which is the basis of this Bill, the Authority confidently expect annual job approvals to rise to 5,000 by 1985.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that the Industrial Development Authority may make employment grants available to service industries which, in their opinion, contribute significantly to regional and national development.  The essential difference between an employment grant and the normal capital grant is that the payment of employment grants relates directly to job creation and not to the acquisition of fixed assets.  For the initial year of the scheme, the level of employment grants has been fixed at an average of £5,000.  Half of the employment grant approved will be paid when the job is created and the balance will be paid one year later on certification that the job continues to exist.  A five year contingent liability period will apply to employment grants paid.  The Authority will have to respect the financial ceiling relating to aids for job creation stipulated for Ireland in the Co-ordination of EEC Regional Aid Systems &mdash; which is about £9,000 per job.  The average figure of £5,000 per job is estimated to be about half the annual salary cost of the type of person to be employed in an assisted <Col N="1856" /> service industry.  The aid is, therefore, being concentrated into the first two crucial years in the development of the project.  As training is a vital aspect in the development of service companies, training grants will continue to be used by the IDA as a major part of the incentive package for this sector.  The use of training grants has the added advantage that 55 per cent of these grants are normally recoverable from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>Before service industries can be approved for employment grant assistance by the IDA, it would be necessary for me to specify, by order, the service industries to which such grants may be paid.  EEC Commission approval for the scheme is required and accordingly the necessary orders will not be made until this approval, which has been sought, is received.  Furthermore, projects will have to be commercially viable, will have to have sound market growth potential and would not have been developed in the absence of employment grant assistance.</P>
    <P>Since the object of the scheme is to create high quality employment of a professional and technical character, this will determine the service industries which will be specified by order.  As about 85 per cent of job approvals in the existing but limited IDA service industry programme came from the engineering, architecture and computer services industries, these services will be specified by order and will continue to be intensively promoted.  Other target sectors for the IDA will be:</P>
    <P>&mdash; headquarter operations,</P>
    <P>&mdash; commercial testing laboratories,</P>
    <P>&mdash; medical care,</P>
    <P>&mdash; contract research and development services.</P>
    <P>This list is not exhaustive, but merely reflects initial priorities.  Other worthwhile sectors can be added later on.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks, I believe, the first step in a new phase of the development of our country.  When the pioneers of industrial development in Ireland laid plans for the promotion of manufacturing industry by way of grant assistance, they had precious little else available other than, perhaps, <Col N="1857" /> a willing but unskilled population which tended to equate the prospect of prosperity with emigration.  Given that starting point, we can see how successful our policies have been.  Our starting position under this new scheme is very considerably stronger, in that we have a high technology manufacturing base, we have a highly educated young workforce and our infrastructure is rapidly being brought into line with the requirements of the international service industry world.  The strides which we have made in manufacturing industry demonstrate what we are capable of achieving and I am confident that we are on the threshold of development and expansion in service industries on a scale which could not have been contemplated five years ago.  This advance cannot be regarded as a luxury but as crucial to the orderly and well balanced development of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these two Bills and I want to assure the Minister that both of them have the support of the Fine Gael Party, as they did in the debate in the Dáil.  They are not controversial in any sense, in contrast to the previous debate in relation to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, there are two sections in these Bills.  There is the run of the mill section relating to limits under legislation which have to be updated, the principal provision of which is apparently the raising from £750 million to £1,500 million of the aggregate amounts of grants and payments of a capital nature which may be made by the Authority.  This is obviously necessary because since the end of April, apparently, the IDA had expended £724 million under a legislative limit of £750 million, with capital allocated for this years running into practically £200 million. It is completely accepted that this new limit should run from three to four years without the necessity of the Minister in some Government&mdash;it may not be this one&mdash;coming into this House again. The other sections, again, are run of the mill.  Loan guarantees being increased from £100 million to £125 million is acceptable.  On total grant in fixed assets to an individual company, the limit having <Col N="1858" /> been £1.25 million under the IDA Act 1978, the proposed increase to £2.5 million is acceptable, the clear reason being escalating costs of capital equipment. Much of the business of the Cabinet may have been taken up in giving the necessary approval in this area, because the limit was unrealistic in this age of rampant inflation.  The training grants limit increase is acceptable.  The loan guarantees rates increase from £½ million to £¾ million is acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is not much, in that sense, that we can contribute to the debate in so far as these matters are concerned and we are in agreement.  The loan guarantees under the enterprise development programmes, the increase of £300,000 and the research development section, and the question of ITAX, for the same kind of reasons that relate to the maximum capital grant for a company are acceptable.</P>
    <P>The interesting part of these two Bills is not so much the run of the mill matters to which I refer but the question of the speech of the Minister of State who was with us and the speech which the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, made in the Dáil and his approach to where our industry is going.  There are just one or two points which I would like to make.  I agree completely with the innovation of the very important commitment to help the service sector.  My already recorded criticism is simply that this, and the previous Government, did not do this many years ago. For a great many years Governments in other countries have been chasing after major corporations which had the potential to expand in the service sector, which is quite unrelated to industry and has nothing to do with manufacturing industry, capital investment or fixed assets, but which has to do rather with technology, with personal skills, with human development.</P>
    <P>With the recent development in technical education in the regional and technical colleges and the National Institute of Technical Education, it is quite obvious that we have the skills.  Because we use English, an international language, and are a base between Europe and North America and for all kinds of reasons, it is an extremely interesting sector <Col N="1859" /> in which major developments of a startling nature can occur'.  It is true that other countries had been offering incentives in this field before this, which we had not been doing to any great extent. I approve completely of this introduction.</P>
    <P>The other point that I would like to make about this service sector has to do with population.  The country is appalled at much of what is happening in Dublin today.  There is rampant rapid development and an increase in population which the infrastructure is not able for in all kinds of ways, with roads and telecommunications clogged up and all that goes with them.  In this city a huge proportion of people are working in this sector in which we are now going to encourage further developments and investment from outside.  There will be a normal gravitation to service jobs, as opposed to manufacturing industry which might have a more regional base for other reasons, to our major cities.  The only <i>caveat</i> I would put on the thinking of the Industrial Development Authority in so far as this service sector is concerned, is that if the Government, through the IDA, are going to give grants to this sector, which I applaud, the danger is that unless there is some thought given to a regional basis for this grant aid, and if it is going to be done, for example, on the basis that the company coming in automatically get so much per job, which is what we are talking about here, a limit of £5,000 per job, and if automatically a company could choose to come into this city to do that, the danger is that undesirable developments could happen because you could get this rolling effect of a further escalation of the problems of this city without the provinces being given the opportunity to get into the question of balance.  I accept that in many of these service sectors we are talking about an area where a measure of sophistication is involved and it may very well be difficult to get them to go to very small towns or villages or to places that are isolated, but in the provinces we have the cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, for example.  A mistake will be made unless <Col N="1860" /> the Authority make some attempt to load the incentives to a degree in favour of the companies we are attracting getting out of this town and into the provinces.</P>
    <P>The Minister was thinking aloud in his Bill about the industrial development of this country, the past record and the present circumstances and the number of jobs which it is proposed should be created.  I suppose I can afford myself the same luxury.</P>
    <P>The only other singular issue I should like to mention is the question of energy. It is a matter about which I have had some personal experience in the past year or so.  One of the critical factors today in everything that is happening is energy. Some industries are going to the wall because of the escalating costs of energy, for example, the grassmeal industry and industries other than State companies which are prepared to use taxpayers' money to bail them out.  The grassmeal industry has gone to the wall because of the cost of fuel used to dehydrate the four or five tons of wet grass necessary to produce one ton of grass meal.  Equally, other energy-intensive companies are in critical circumstances at this time.</P>
    <P>The only point I want to make in relation to energy is that without ever talking about oil or about coal we have in the bogs of this country an energy resource which, independent of the importation of oil or coal, could float this country for 40 years in terms of all of its energy needs. Of course that is not going to happen. But the basic point I want to make in so far as the Industrial Development Authority are concerned is that there are new methods of using peat.  There are methods of burning milled peat in its raw state, without going through a manufacturing process, in boilers and furnaces for the purpose of fuelling industry.  There are other manufacturing products from peat such as pellets and other items.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case for a move to be made by the Industrial Development Authority to push outside this country to attract energy-intensive industries to come here on the basis that we have a native resource in these bogs.  In France and in other countries I know of companies <Col N="1861" /> that are located alongside bogs where they have their resource at first cost, without even going through the manufacturing process, being fed in to fuel these industries, which establishes a kind of viability in an energy-shortage age which is very significant and which can lead to major developments.  Very interestingly, nationally as well, it is an exciting idea, because where this country is concerned and where energy is the critical issue, the energy of which I am speaking is in the parts of this country which successive Governments have found it hardest of all to develop in the sense that we have this midland belt which is tending to have a lesser level of industrial development than have much of the east and some of the west of the country.  Yet we have this resource energy in this midland area.  In many parts of the west of Ireland there is blanket bog &mdash; from Kerry down to West Cork and which, again, is an energy base.</P>
    <P>It is time, in terms of this energy, to question to a degree what we are doing with this resource in the sense that in a previous age it was very sensible to develop it for electricity generation.  In a previous age one could hardly get rid of peat by giving it away.  But the coin has turned full circle and today the peat is at a premium because it is a fundamental energy.  The generation of electricity today, many people would argue, can more rationally be done by major plants such as the one being built on the Shannon with the importation in bulk of coal at reasonable prices and that is what electricity generation should be doing.  It is not altogether in the national interest that where the production of milled peat in Irish bogs is concerned, as much as about 80 per cent of that valuable fuel resource, which can be used indigenously alongside the bog for industry or for domestic fuel, is going into the power station to generate electricity.  There is a national issue here.</P>
    <P>Again, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, you have been very generous and have allowed me to go a little wide of the brief. The issue in so far as the IDA are concerned is that there is this resource and these new methods of using it and it is an issue which can be capitalised on outside <Col N="1862" /> this country to attract energy-intensive industries which would be absolutely viable in those very parts of the country in which we are trying to stimulate development. I particularly welcome the service sector of the Bill and I would greatly appreciate if the Minister of State would convey my remarks about the problems with which I am sure he will personally be very much in sympathy.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome these two Bills and the Minister's comments on them.  It is refreshing, following the debate on the last Bill on the difficulties of NET, to be listening to the details spelled out by the Minister of the successful development in the work of the Industrial Development Authority. Indeed that authority, who are, of course, a State body but not a profit-making one, have a very good success record.  It is not necessary to stress the emphasis the Minister places on the creation of jobs in the services industry having regard to the need for jobs for young people.  The Industrial Development Authority are to be complimented on the results arising from their project identification unit which identified products being imported and which subsequently created fresh business, creating an additional 1,000 jobs.  The difference which the Minister mentions between the percentage ratio of those employed in the services industry is very interesting.  In Ireland it is 50 per cent whereas in the United States and elsewhere it varies from 58 to 65 per cent.  This probbly relates to the sophistication of the respective economies, but it does indicate prospects of a greater job potential in these service industries here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with the comment made on the regional basis by the preceding Senator.  As we know, on the regional basis for allocating grants, prior to 1972 there was an exclusion of grants within the metropolitan area.  In the case of service industries there is a difference as I see it as against major industries.  The problem that the Industrial Development Authority have always had is to get the industry to site in Ireland, anywhere in the State.  Therefore the authority were up against the difficulty that if a major <Col N="1863" /> manufacturing industry wanted to site in a particular area, it was better to have it sited there than not to have it at all.  In the case of service industries, they are being created as a result of the major industries and therefore they are going to be here anyway.  Therefore the Minister might consider the question of whether it would be permissible and justifiable to identify areas other than major industrial areas in the context of the grant aspect for the creation of new jobs in service industries.  I welcome the two Bills and again congratulate the Industrial Development Authority on their success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the two Bills and particularly I am interested in seeing the development of the services side of the authority.  This is a very essential step. Any effort to assist the development of the economy must be welcomed, particularly so when we are faced with a very serious unemployment situation.  In dealing with the question of the IDA and the moneys that go towards them, we must hold out hope to the many thousands of young people who are to come on to unemployment as well as to those at present on the register and to the many people who have suffered because of redudancies. What we have here is a hope situation, and therefore it must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I wonder if it is possible to engage in a total analysis of what might be the real job creation or what might be the cost of the creation of each job.  I say this in the context of making an argument against the IDA, because without the full facts I would not attempt to do it, but at the same time it would be no harm if we talked about the matter a little.  I should like to mention, for example, the sort of situation in the west where prior to Wranglers being there and prior to their having decided to pull out, other people were in occupation of that factory premises.  So far as I can recollect, at least on two other occasions other people were in occupation there and were there with the assistance of IDA.  Again, here we have a situation where Wranglers have decided to pull out and where the <Col N="1864" /> assistance of the IDA is going to be invoked.  Somebody who works in the factory, who has first-hand knowledge of this development says that the workers have been trained twice or three times and are now about to be retrained again for some other sort of industry.  Someone like myself, an ordinary Joe, looking at things from the outside, is entitled to be a little sceptical as to whether it is possible for the IDA in their present state and with their present policies to create jobs that are really secure.</P>
    <P>I do not take the example of the Wranglers in isolation.  There are examples elsewhere.  One swallow does not make a summer but from the point of view of the ordinary man in the street, it is difficult to understand the whole situation whereby the IDA create a certain number of jobs but because people decide to pull out the Authority are called in again and create the same number of jobs in the same plant and so it continues.  This is why I speak of a full detailed analysis of exactly what value are we getting out of the money invested and what is the cost of the jobs that we can call secure jobs arising out of the investments that we make.  A factory worker would be justified in being sceptical about the whole thing.</P>
    <P>While I say that and while I say that it points to a lack of confidence by the actual incumbents of the factories that have closed down, I am not making the case of over all failure and I would not like to go on the record as such.  I am, however, making the case that I have to be convinced that excessive dependence on foreign investment or foreign development by private enterprise is the answer to the question of full employment. I have said this, and people will probably say that I am on my hobby horse again, but I make no apologies for that. I say it out of a life of experience.  I did not get it out of books or anywhere else, but I still clearly believe that private enterprise cannot provide the answer to the question of full employment.  I do, however, submit that it can provide half of the answer, and despite the reservations by the Government and possibly by some of my associates in Fine Gael who <Col N="1865" /> might have reservations about my views in this regard, I believe that there is no way in which it can provide the full answer, and for that reason I believe that public enterprise must provide the other half.  I can say this with all sincerity and make no apologies for it.  I will repeat it over and over again because no one has been able to prove to me that the private enterprise system since the setting up of the State in Ireland has been capable of creating full employment.  The State in these circumstances must in my view be taken out of the supportive role and play a more effective role.</P>
    <P>Since I am anxious to see the Bill passed I do not propose to develop this line of argument but given the opportunity on another occasion I will go deeper into the matter.  I propose to do that because it is a question which needs to be tackled on every occasion possible.  Perhaps many of us are afraid to face up to it.  However, I know the Minister himself has been through some very difficult situations with State-sponsored bodies and State enterprises and that, consequently, he may be cynical about my remark that private enterprise only provides half of the answers and that the State will have to be taken out of its supportive role and provide the other half.</P>
    <P>I really believe that there is an emergence of new attitudes towards the role and purpose of public enterprise and the creation of new institutions such as a State development corporation.  I talk about a State development corporation, not in the shape of the recent announcement in accordance with the national understanding but in the sense of something on the lines of what is in existence in Sweden &mdash; a kind of national planning commission.  I also say it in the context of a mixed economy.  If we think about this matter very seriously we must not be afraid to admit that private enterprise does not provide the cure for all our ills. This development towards taking the State out of the supportive role can strike the balance between the private and public sectors and can head us more in the direction of creating full employment.  I am not &mdash; and I would like to make this quite clear &mdash; denigrating the IDA's central <Col N="1866" /> policy and I am certainly not proposing that it be abandoned.  I am merely asking whether the liberal market economy works and provides the jobs that are necessary.  The only answer that I can give to that from my own life and family experience is that this sort of market does not provide the answer.</P>
    <P>We have, even now in this day and age, a population explosion.  We have no longer the safety valve of emigration which we had when we had a does of unemployment anyway.  We must begin to realise that there is a massive challenge to manufacturing industry.  The number of jobs needed to be created is well outside the capacity of the IDA central policy, which is based on private enterprise, to deliver.  They cannot do it.  They cannot cope with the creation of about 32,000 jobs a year having regard to the fact that they will also be working against job losses through closures and so on.  I do not think they can go it alone.  I am not advocating socialist planning in the old fashioned way as being the panacea to all our ills.  I am making a serious and genuine plea for an acceptance of the fact that when the plan of over-dependence on the private sector to do the job of creating full employment has been found not to work, we must make changes.  I referred here before to the whole question of the sixties when we had wonderful wages.  That was the best decade we have ever had in the context of incomes.  It was also the best period of manufacturing output, but at the end of the decade there was not one extra person at work.  I am not going to go right over it again.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it goes through quickly.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make, through the agriculturists may not agree with me.  Agriculture is a very important part of the economy.  We have all benefited greatly from it and many industries have grown from this industry. However, what has to be recognised nowadays is that our manufacturing exports exceed what comes out of agriculture so that the tide is changing and we now have to have a new look at the situation.  I would make that plea, not on the basis of a confrontation or of an ideology, but on <Col N="1867" /> the basis that I do not believe that you can actually develop to full employment on the basis of mere dependence on the private enterprise system.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there are great arguments against some of the State industries, in particular the services industry, but I do not think that we have gone into the area of the State manufacturing side of it and what the potential is in that area.  We are inclined to be afraid to risk it because I suppose when one looks back in history and looks at the whole question of Irish attitudes and when we go back to the question of the fellow years ago who took pride in really owning his own ditch, that attitude is still with us.  But many countries are like that and they had to break away from it and finally find their way forward.  We must have a mixed economy if we are to be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>After our somewhat distasteful and disheartening discussion earlier this afternoon on the affairs of NET, it is welcome and refreshing to be able to move to the top of the merit scale for State organisations and to welcome the provision by way of these two Bills of further finance and further scope for the operations of the IDA.  I regard the IDA as the most important development agency we have and also as an organisation which has been remarkably successful and efficient in performing a genuine and urgent national function, that of creating jobs.  It has been successful even against a difficult background both externally and internally &mdash; an external background of world recession, high energy costs, growing competition from developing countries in areas in which we were already engaged, like textiles, footwear, metal fabrication and so on; difficulties on the home front, especially the relatively high rate of cost inflation we have been suffering here in recent times.  That relatively high rate of inflation has been the major factor in causing the disheartening situation of very heavy job losses, to which Senator Harte has just referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point I would like to make is about the magnitude of the problem the IDA, <Col N="1868" /> indeed the Government, face in trying to create anything approaching full employment here.  A good measure of this is the calculation by the ESRI that it would need twice the rate of increase in manufacturing output over the period 1973 to 1980 to reach full employment within any reasonable period of years.  That being so, and considering all the difficulties we still have to overcome, I think it is appropriate that the IDA should move into the services field and try to supplement their employment creation on the manufacturing front.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention, and I think it is perhaps relevant to the question that Senator Harte raised as to the utility of the finance that is being provided through the IDA, that under the auspices of the National Economic and Social Council a very far-reaching study is in progress at present into our industrial development policy.  Naturally, that will cover the basic question whether the way we have been proceeding is the right one and whether the results are commensurate with the effort and the money we have put into achieving them.  I suspect that one of the things that will be found is that rather too much of our success has been in sheltered industry and sheltered services and that if we really want to gear ourselves to wider markets than the domestic market we will have to give more attention to breaking into the open market sector both in manufacturing and in services.</P>
    <P>I would not care to follow Senator Harte in any discussion of ideologies.  I am not committed to one or the other, but I think it is only fair to say that the difficulties in the world today are not confined to private enterprise economies or even to mixed economies.  They extend even to the completely centralised collectivist economies.  It is remarkable fact that all over the COMECON countries, as the whole range of eastern bloc countries is called, the growth rate has slowed down virtually to nil.  Even in Russia the growth rate only matches the population growth and there is a static situation.  I would not think that, from experience, there is any reason to believe that progress would be faster or that our difficulties <Col N="1869" /> would disappear under a different kind of direction of the economy.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the final point I would like to make.  If we really want to help the creation of jobs, and help the IDA, we will not do it just by grants alone.  We will have to give them a helping hand by trying to create an economic climate here at home favourable to the expansion of industry and services.  We do not have that when our inflation rate is so high.  So a basic requirement of any progress is that we move towards reducing our rate of inflation.  It is the high rate of inflation, as I said a moment ago, which is causing so many of the industries &mdash; hard won here &mdash; to pull out again.  I know many more are in danger.  Unless we do something to bring our rate of inflation down closer into line with that on the European continent we face a great risk of job loss, and that would make the task of the IDA virtually an impossible one.  Reference has been made to the asset we have in a more youthful, better educated, more skilled population.  That is undoubtedly a great asset, but we must contrive to use it by moving up the scale, advancing in technology, being more export-orientated, and adding more value in the production process at home so that we will retain jobs here and that those jobs will be better paid jobs because they are based on higher productivity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it important that every opportunity should be availed of to pay a tribute to the work and the contribution of the IDA consistently over the years to the industrialisation of our country or the greater portion of it.  I welcome these Bills, which one could say update existing measures and lay greater emphasis on the desirability of supporting smaller industry, particularly the services industry.  This, of course, has to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time I have subscribed to the view that we need a very mixed kind of industrialisation in this country and I stated this originally on a local industrial development committee.  That committee had high hopes of attracting a huge international or multinational concern to <Col N="1870" /> the town, and I think they wasted many years with those high ideas.  I welcome the IDA's policy of cluster factories, support the Irish entrepreneur, the small man with the ideas, and give him a chance.  Some may think that the employment of ten or 12 persons is very small, but nevertheless I think that those kind of industries very seldom go to the wall because everyone involved has a great interest in the enterprises.  Also, in a small concern all must pull their weight. Therefore, I am glad that the IDA are giving greater support to the small industry section, and credit is due to the personnel in the IDA for that but that is not to take from the splendid work of the IDA as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an old hobbyhorse of mine &mdash; my experience in regional development.  In the years when I was president of the commission dealing with regional development I visited every region in the Community.  Many of the member states have a system of enabling grants to ensure that small industries have the opportunity to avail of every possible European fund that is available.</P>
    <P>I should like to cite the situation here where so many people are debarred from benefiting from the FEOGA grants systems because there was no system up to now whereby the IDA would give a small IDA grant of at least three per cent.  This would put small entrepreneurs in a position to benefit from a 25 per cent FEOGA grant, especially in respect of agricultural-based industries whether it be meat processing, the utilisation of whole milk or milk processing.  I have been pressing the IDA and the Minister for a number of years to take another look at this situation.  There is certainly a market in the midlands for industrious, progressive and hard-working farmers and even co-operatives &mdash; two or three farmers getting together &mdash; to process their own milk, to make yoghourt and prepare small bottles or cartons of milk for schools.  The Commissioner for Agriculture is anxious that more whole milk should be used on the local markets.  If the packaging and the support are made available we would be doing the common agricultural policy a service by encouraging <Col N="1871" /> greater usage of those agricultural products on the home market.  This is necessary.</P>
    <P>The range of industrial activities that I am speaking about is the agricultural-based service industries or processing industries.  They cover not only milk, beet and grain but the entire range of commodities that would come under the FEOGA grants scheme.  I appeal again to the Minister to look at that aspect. Business people and farmers who have ideas, energy and skill and who are setting up these small industries should be given the benefit of a 25 per cent FEOGA grant to which they are entitled by law under the common agricultural policy.  I do not know why the IDA persist with their present policy in this matter.  I hope there will be a change of heart in this direction.</P>
    <P>As Senator Harte said, the job of creating employment in this country at the present time cannot be left to either the private sector or the public sector.  It is a job that everyone should be encouraged to participate in.  There should be greater co-operation between the Departments and the semi-State bodies in assisting in the creation of jobs.  I had occasion &mdash; out of sheer frustration &mdash; to write to a number of Ministers last year when there was the prospect of getting 50 or 60 jobs in a plant in the midlands.  Because of the nature of their business, the company required a telex and eight telephone lines.  I wrote to the Ministers for Energy, Industry and Commerce and Posts and Telegraphs in this connection but it was not possible to provide a telephone and a telex for a company who were establishing at a cost of several million pounds in a midland town.  The company had to wait for six or seven months before they could start business even thought the plant was ready to roll.  There is no excuse for this sort of thing.  Eventually the company got four telephone lines as a great concession; they could have either four telephone lines or three telephone lines and one telex line.  Perhaps there is something wrong with the service, but when one picks up the newspapers one reads that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1872" /> is saying that 1,000 new telex lines are being installed and that people can get them almost on demand.  It must be very infuriating for people who require the service and who experience such great difficulty in getting it.</P>
    <P>At present there is certainly a great shortage of job opportunities and there are many people chasing too few jobs.  If the private sector is to be expected to play a greater role in job creation, the old-fashioned concept of a profit at the end of the year must come back a little stronger into the economic thinking. While the semi-State organisations, or perhaps the Government Departments, are not concerned with making a profit and do not seem to be terribly worried about meeting and staying within economic guidelines, the private sector must certainly do so and cannot survive without the element of profit.  This is something which the whole country must realise. As far as the export markets are concerned, we must present our goods at a competitive price and we must also ensure that there is a profit for the producer. We must get back to this as a basic first step before we embark on greater industrialisation.</P>
    <P>We have to make up our minds on whether we are going to encourage into the country enterprises that may be looked upon as dirty industries.  We cannot have it both ways: we have to weigh up the overall benefits between employment and industries that cause inconvenience. This is an area where our planners come in.  When the IDA are acquiring or purchasing sites for industrial development, they should have regard to the location and suitability of the site <i>vis-ávis</i> proximity to residential areas.  I sometimes get annoyed with the IDA when I see them moving in to develop a site and bringing in not only the personnel to develop it but also all the materials, even though the same materials may be manufactured only a few hundred yards away from the site itself.  The IDA should have regard to the high cost of fuel and transportation which should be included in their accounts.  When there was development of an industrial site in Portlaoise everything from the personnel to the <Col N="1873" /> cement blocks and the kerbs was imported into the country, even though everything the IDA wanted for that site was manufactured in the country.  That was unacceptable, unnecessary and unfair to the population of Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>While I wish in supporting these Bills to support the IDA in their continuing efforts to provide more job opportunities in this country, I believe they should have a more flexible policy when they come to look at an industry they may have earmarked as being on the decline, for instance, the shoe industry.  It may be having difficulties in some locations, but nevertheless the total number of shoes manufactured here does not go near the numbers that are imported and are necessary to meet the trade demand.  I would hope that in cases like this the IDA would look very sympathetically at applications from Irish entrepreneurs who are able to produce both for the home and export markets even if it is in an industry that the IDA may consider to be in grave difficulties.  Every individual who has an idea, a skill or a product which he feels he can produce profitably and can sell at home and abroad is entitled to a fair crack of the whip.  All people who are in business should be treated equally.  I do not think the policies of the IDA should be discriminatory.  Every proposal that goes before the IDA should get a fair crack of the whip and grants for job creation should be dispensed equitably.</P>
    <P>I know the IDA take great care in vetting projects.  The relatively small number of projects that fail get great publicity but I do not think the thinking person is deterred by that.  The vast majority of the people in the country appreciate the work the authority puts into the task that the Oireachtas entrusted to them.  However, there are individuals throughout the country who feel quite aggrieved that the IDA for some specific policy reason will not support their ideas and give them the same chance as their neighbours to compete. I hope there will be a change of heart and perhaps a change of policy in this regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for their contributions and, in particular, I would like to thank them for their acceptance and praise of the work that has been done by the IDA in creating employment over the past number of years.  I will try to deal with some points raised by the speakers.</P>
      <P>First, I will take Senator Staunton's contribution with regard to services.  He made reference to having the IDA provide the jobs on a regional basis.  This is something that we will bear in mind.  We will try to ensure that the services will be provided on a regional basis and this will be kept in mind in the programme of job creation by the IDA.  The Senator also mentioned the use of peat and our own natural resources in relation to energy.  I agree entirely with him.  The Senator was too modest to tell the House that he has in a practical way demonstrated how this can be done in having peat used instead of oil in an industry which he himself has established.  I have also seen where the Western Health Board have done something similar in substituting bricini for oil in the boilers in one of the institutions in my own constituency.  This is a headline that can be followed by industrialists. There is advanced technology now whereby it is possible to use peat; I am sure the IDA are aware of it and that they will bear this in mind in their job creation programme and make industrialists aware of the resources we have in that respect.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Senator Staunton related to employment grants.  He stated that they would be limited to £5,000 per job.  That is not correct.  It is an average employment grant over a one-year period.  The IDA will be able to vary the assistance according to the area in which the service project will be located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte mentioned the question of grants.  He questioned whether we were actually getting value for money in relation to the grants paid by the IDA. In the particular instance he mentioned, the industry in Ballyhaunis where Wrangler decided to withdraw from the factory there, we are in the happy position that they have said publicly they are prepared <Col N="1875" /> to repay whatever State grants were given to them when they set up there.  It is fair to say that there are certain anomalies in relation to closures in that very often you see people getting redundancy payments and they are employed subsequently.  I do not know how one can get over that, but it is State money that is involved all the time.  I do not know how they can be dealt with, but I certainly see something wrong with that kind of situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to concur with what Senator Whitaker stated, that nationalisation of industry &mdash; and even here in our own country where we have semi-State employment &mdash; is not always entirely successful. There is a lot to be said for the system we have at the moment where a private individual with an investment will try to ensure that he gets value for his money.  In the long term it is probably the best system and the one which has worked most successfully.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker also referred to the recent NESC report.  This was referred to in the Dáil by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>During that time we have seen a dramatic switch in emphasis from agriculture to industry.  If we are to provide employment for our growing population we must continue to ensure growth in the industrial sector.  Despite the fact that the IDA had their most successful year in 1980 with 35,600 job approvals, we are still faced with a daunting employment challenge.  Because of the amount of State money involved, the time has now come for us to ask ourselves if we are getting the best possible return on our investment in industrial development and whether the policies which have served us well in the past are the most appropriate for the eighties and beyond.  For this reason the Government asked the National Economic and Social Council to carry out a review of our industrial policies. This review is nearing completion and I look forward to the conclusions of the council.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department are aware of the problems to be faced there and they are taking the steps they consider <Col N="1876" /> necessary to try to ensure that we will meet this challenge of providing as many jobs as possible for the eighties. There can be no argument about the merits of the Bills.  All sectors of the community must pull their weight as best they can to try to ensure that the necessary jobs are provided for our people.  There is no use having schemes provided, and the money provided by the Government and the IDA, if we do not have the full backing of every section of the community in trying to achieve our aim of full employment.  Again I want to thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give statutory effect to the taxation changes announced in this year's budget. In addition, statutory provisions are being introduced to improve the administration of our taxation system.  The Bill provides for improvements in tax allowances, excise duty increases, concessions on farmer taxation and also the incentives for construction of rented residential accommodation, toll roads and bridges and multi-storey car parks which I referred to in my budget statement.</P>
      <P>Before I itemise the provisions of the Bill, I would like to outline again the budget strategy which is being implemented by the Government.  We have sought a balance between the obligation to reduce the budget deficit and the need to promote employment.  It is essential that the deficit be reduced progressively and eliminated.  A sudden and sharp reduction in the deficit, however, would have undesirable consequences so our purpose is to phase it down gradually. We have accepted the obligation to bring down the deficit and we are working towards this objective.</P>
      <P>At the same time we have launched a programme of capital investment which surpasses all previous efforts to raise the productive capacity of the economy.  The 1981 Investment Plan mobilises a total capital investment of more than £1,700 million this year.  The emphasis is on strengthening our infrastructural services and this will produce two welcome benefits; in the short term it will provide a substantial boost to employment and, for the longer term, it will provide a firmer foundation for the development of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget strategy, therefore, is designed to support a high level of economic <Col N="1878" /> activity while at the same time imposing a greater discipline on our public finances.  This is the only rational approach in a situation of severe international recession where we have to absorb a huge increase in energy costs and where several traditional employment opportunities have been lost.  The alternatives were to continue spending without regard to the cost or to go to the other extreme and impose a rigid clampdown on public spending.  Either of these courses of action would have most undesirable consequences.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness at home and in international markets is a key requirement if we are to sustain a high level of growth and make the best possible use of the employment opportunities which are open to us.  We have to lower our expectations and settle for a more modest rate of increase in incomes.  As a contribution to this the Government have recently increased subsidies on a number of essential foodstuffs, and this will have a big impact on the cost of living index.  In turn, the Government expect that this will be reflected in a moderation of income increases in the period ahead.  We have the potential to recover much of the advantage in competitiveness that has been lost, provided we continue to improve productivity and adopt a prudent approach towards income increases.</P>
    <P>The international economic outlook is now more hopeful than it has been for a considerable period.  The general consensus is that there should be a gradual resumption of international growth in the second half of this year.  Inflationary pressures are also expected to ease, and this will help to foster confidence and to underpin the economic revival.  The EEC Commission expects that unemployment in the Community as a whole will continue to increase.  The prospect of growing unemployment is unacceptable to this Government, and this is why we have acted to reinforce, by domestic action, the expected beneficial effect of the international upturn.</P>
    <P>Our action has taken the form of a major fiscal stimulus to the economy, and this stimulus is coming through the massive increase in public investment provided <Col N="1879" /> for in our Investment Plan to which I have already referred.  As a result, the EEC Commission predicts that our growth rate this year will be about 2 per cent which will be the second highest in the Community.  It will also be higher than that forecast for the OECD area as a whole.  We confidently expect that accompanying this growth the rate of employment creation will accelerate in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Recent economic indicators show that the upturn in our economy is already well under way and that investment is increasing, the rise in the numbers unemployed has been halted and the numbers of short-time workers continue to fall.  This is consistent with the very encouraging recent performance of industrial output. The volume of output of manufacturing industry, seasonally adjusted, rose by 11½ per cent in January and February, a faster rate of advance than in any other two month period since 1975.  There are, therefore, solid grounds for optimism but, as I have already emphasised, we must be prepared to modify our expectations and accept that we do not have an entitlement to an uninterrupted improvement in living standards.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the individual sections of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for increases in the general and age exemption limits announced in the budget.  The general exemption limit is increased from £1,700 to £2,000 for single and widowed persons and from £3,400 to £4,000 for married couples.  The exemption limit is raised from £2,000 to £2,300 for single and widowed persons aged 65 years or more but under 75 years and from £4,000 to £4,600 for married couples in this category. Revised exemption limits of £2,800 for single and widowed persons and £5,600 for married couples will apply for those aged 75 years or over.</P>
    <P>Section 2 and 3 also confirm budget proposals.  They contain provisions for increases in the special PAYE allowance, the 35 per cent rate band, the one parent family allowance and a number of allowances for handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>Section 4 ensures that certificates from <Col N="1880" /> officials of the Revenue Commissioners will be admissable as <i>prima facie</i> evidence in legal proceedings for the recovery of penalties under the PAYE Regulations and section 5 provides a statutory basis for apportioning marginal relief where a married couple elect for separate assessment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to the new mortgage subsidy scheme for first-time house purchases. Its purpose is to ensure that the subsidy plus income tax relief will not exceed the amount of the annual loan repayments.</P>
    <P>Section 7 confirms that, in certain circumstances, tax must be deducted at the standard rate from payments made to sub-contractors by a person who is not a builder but whose business involves the manufacture, treatment or extraction of construction materials.  This is to clarify the definition of construction and associated activities for the purposes of the sub-contractor legislation.  The section also counters an avoidance device.</P>
    <P>In section 8 the scheme of residence-related relief is extended for a further year and in section 9 the time limits for claiming specified reliefs are extended from one to two years.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill provides for changes in the taxation of farming profits announced in the budget.  During the course of my budget speech I said that technical discussions were taking place between farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners on the question of income averaging for assessment purposes for farmers.  Agreement on the details of such a system has since been reached and provision is now being made for its statutory implementation.  In addition, I propose to provide for the tax exemption of the farming profits of charities.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for an optional scheme of income averaging for full-time farmers.  Under this scheme, tax liability in any year will be assessed on the average of profits for the previous three years. Once a farmer elects for averaging he will be assessed on that basis for a minimum of three years.  After that period he may change at any stage but tax assessments <Col N="1881" /> for the two years preceding the final year of averaging will be subject to review.</P>
    <P>Section 11 exempts from income tax the farming profits of charities with effect from the year 1974/75.  Charities engaged in farming have generally been unable to show that they satisfy the existing conditions for exemption of trading profits of charities.  I now propose that charities be exempted from tax on their farming profits where such profits are used solely for the purposes of the charity.  This means that there will be no liability to tax in the normal course on farming profits of institutions such as schools and hospitals and religious communities.</P>
    <P>The system for the payment of income tax by full-time farmers in two instalments which was introduced for 1980/81 is extended for a further year under section 12.  The first instalment of tax for 1981/82 is payable on 1 October 1981, and the second on 1 January 1982.</P>
    <P>Section 13 removes the restriction on stock relief for farmers under which relief is granted on the excess of stock over 10 per cent of farming profits.  Increases in stock values will now be completely free of tax.  Section 14, in Chapter III of this Bill, discontinues the resource tax with effect from 6 April 1981.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV relates to corporation tax. In section 15 there are arrangements for bringing forward by three months the date for payment of the second instalment of corporation tax as proposed in the budget.  I wish to emphasise again that there is no suggestion of any increase in tax.  The change is designed simply to bring the timing of tax payments by companies more into line with the arrangements for other traders generally.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is of a technical nature and it requires companies, when making returns of profits to the Revenue Commissioners, to include details of distributions received from other companies. This is necessary for the proper administration of the legislation on closely controlled companies and the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing industry,</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for an extension of the 10 per cent scheme to certain named activities.  These are fish farming, cultivation <Col N="1882" /> of mushrooms, ship repairs, certain design and planning services and service operations at Shannon airport.  In order to comply with EEC requirements, certain restrictions are provided for in the case of Shannon service companies.</P>
    <P>The contents of Chapter V deal with a variety of different and mainly technical matters common to both income tax and corporation tax.  Section 18 exempts from tax, payments out of the Employers' Temporary Subvention Fund which was set up last year under the terms of the national understanding.  Section 19 closes a loophole in relation to tax-exemption of income from patented Irish inventions to ensure that, as was the intention of the original legislation, only inventions on which the underlying work is carried out in the state will qualify.</P>
    <P>In section 20 provision is made for continuation of stock relief for a further year.  Section 21 corrects an anomoly in relation to distributions out of income granted export sales relief, while section 22 ensures that as regards the tax charge on loans by closely-controlled companies to their participators, such companies do not obtain unduly favourable interest treatment where they default on payment.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI introduces the measures, outlined in my budget statement, to encourage greater private sector investment in capital development.  In order to have the immediate effect of stimulating new activity these allowances took effect as from the day after budget day. The allowances are framed so as to provide investment opportunities for the private sector and at the same time represent reasonable value for the State.  They will run for a three-year period.</P>
    <P>There is a Government commitment in the national understanding for arrangements to encourage rented housing and comprehensive re-development by private property funds in major urban areas. In line with this commitment I announced in my budget statement that a special new allowance of 100 per cent would be introduced in respect of expenditure of construction of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>This allowance, which is provided for <Col N="1883" /> under section 23, and which will be setoff against rental income, will be available in relation to houses and flats within the size limits specified in the Bill and for which a certificate of reasonable cost or a certificate of reasonable value has been granted by the Minister for the Environment. The maximum size limits are 125 square metres in respect of a house and 75 square metres in respect of a flat.  The amount of expenditure allowable includes actual construction cost and site development, though not site acquisition costs.</P>
    <P>Section 24 makes the allowance available in respect of expenditure on the conversion of certain existing property into two or more residential units.  There is considerable interest in these tax incentives and I am confident that they will open the way for a big expansion of the rented accommodation sector and will make a most useful contribution to our housing programme.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for a positive incentive for the private sector in relation to the provision of multi-storey carparks, toll roads and bridges.  Section 25 provides for a 50 per cent initial allowance and a 4 per cent annual allowance on expenditure on the construction of a multi-storey car-park.  This allowance will be available under the normal rules, included in the Tax Acts, relating to industrial buildings allowances.  For the purposes of the allowance a multi-storey car-park must be wholly in use for the provision of car parking facilities for the general public.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides for an allowance of 50 per cent in respect of capital expenditure incurred by a private sector interest as part of an agreement with a road authority for the provision of a toll-road or bridge.  The allowance will be offset against the income accruing to the investor from such an agreement.</P>
    <P>At present, the 50 per cent initial allowance in respect of industrial buildings is available only to persons leasing such buildings direct to industrialists. Section 27 extends this allowance to persons leasing such buildings to State-sponsored <Col N="1884" /> industrial promotion agencies for on-leasing by them to industrial occupants. The expansion of this allowance will, I believe, facilitate private sector investment in the provision of advance factories for industrial use.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann two new sections &mdash; sections 28 and 29 &mdash; were introduced.  These sections, which are incorporated in Chapter VII of the Bill, are designed to counter tax avoidance schemes in the land development area.  As I explained in the Dáil, these schemes involve the operation of several artificial transactions between connected companies which are designed to deprive the Exchequer of the tax properly attributable to the profits derived from these developments.</P>
    <P>The schemes are becoming more common and, if not stopped, they will result in a loss of many millions of pounds to the Exchequer.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that schemes either already in operation or in the course of preparation would, if successful, involve a tax loss of the order of £30 million.  The measures now being introduced to curb this practice will apply in respect of accounting periods ending on or after 6 April 1981.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is concerned with customs and excise matters.  Sections 30 to 36 confirm the budget increases in the excise duties on alcohol, tobacco products, hydrocarbon oils and television sets. Some further changes are also included in these sections.</P>
    <P>I announced in the budget that I proposed to extend the excise duty on table waters to squashes and cordials, and this change is being made in section 37.  The original intention was that the rate of duty would be linked to the dilution ratio. In the event this proved impracticable and, on Committee Stage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann, I introduced an amendment to provide that the ordinary rate of duty on table waters should apply to squashes and cordials generally irrespective of the dilution factor.</P>
    <P>The present section also increases the rebate rate to manufacturers of table waters.  The present rebate is 12.4 pence of the first 20,000 gallons and 6.2 pence <Col N="1885" /> on the next 80,000 gallons.  It is proposed that, with effect from 1 March, a rate of 16 pence a gallon will apply to the first 40,000 gallons of production, and eight pence a gallon will apply to the next 80,000 gallons of production.  This change will be of particular benefit to the smaller manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Section 38 reduces the refreshment house licence from £50 to £10, with effect from 1 April.  I am introducing this change in response to requests from small guesthouse owners who are anxious to have the opportunity to serve wine to their guests and who claim that the existing licensing requirements for this purpose are too expensive.  Section 39 confirms an order whereby a small rebate of duty on beer was made in 1980 to brewers whose output for the home market did not exceed 175,000 standard barrels of beer in the preceeding year.</P>
    <P>Section 40 and 41 are concerned with certain duties on motor vehicles.  The budget day Financial Resolution increasing the annual registration charge on cars of 16 horse-power and under from £10 to £20 is confirmed.  This increase is limited, however, to £16.50 in the case of taxis.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains a number of value-added tax provisions.  Section 43 applies the low building rate of 3 per cent backdated to the commencement of VAT to prefabricated structures such as garden sheds.  In practice these structures have generally been charged at the 3 per cent rate rather than the standard 25 per cent rate, and the proposed new provision will confirm this.</P>
    <P>Section 46 in Part IV of the Bill deals with the liability to capital acquisitions tax in the case of certain marriage settlements and provides that a grandchild will be deemed to be the child of the disponer in such instances, thereby obtaining a much higher tax threshold.  I am introducing this concession in response to requests from the farming and legal bodies who submitted to me that the existing tax provisions impose an undue hardship in some marriage settlement cases.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill is concerned with stamp duties and provides for the continuation of three stamp duty measures which were implemented by Government <Col N="1886" /> Orders in 1980.  There is provision for changes in the legislation relating to conveyances made by way of sub-purchases in order to prevent the avoidance of duty by the abuse of certain reliefs.</P>
    <P>The conditions for the granting of stamp duty exemption for new grant-type houses are amended in order to take account of changes in housing legislation, and the stamp duty increase on cheques from one penny to three pence is being confirmed.</P>
    <P>The last part of the Bill, Part VI, contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>This Bill encompasses a considerable number of changes which provide for a more equitable and more efficient system of taxation.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept the Minister's commendation.  I do not know how it is possible to reconcile some of the language in the Minister's speech with the facts as they are authoritatively prescribed or set forth.  The Minister says there are solid grounds for optimism.  The Central Bank in their report say:</P>
      <P>Economic prospects for 1981 suggest that growth will be slow, unemployment will continue to rise for most of the year and inflation will remain at a high level.  The balance-of-payments deficit, a cause of great concern for the last two years, will widen still further and probably amount to one-eighth of Gross National Product.</P>
      <P>The Minister says, with regard to employment, that the rise in the numbers unemployed has been halted and the numbers of short-time workers continue to fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute say the increase in unemployment that has occurred since January 1980 has been very large.  Seasonally corrected, unemployment has continued to rise without interruption.  There has also been a very big increase in systematic short-time working &mdash; the majority of which is concentrated in manufacturing industry.  The poor growth expected this year would not suggest any reduction in <Col N="1887" /> unemployment on average.  The Minister says it is essential that the deficit be progressively reduced and eliminated.  In the Economic and Social Research Institute account of the year 1980, the current deficit is given at £547 million.  Earlier in May the Minister said it was essential that the deficit be progressively reduced and eliminated, but the Economic and Social Research Institute say the deficit of £547 million is forecast to increase to £755 million.  The Economic and Social Research Institute have no ambition to get re-elected.  Neither have the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister discovers grounds for optimism.  The Taoiseach addressing the nation on 9 January last year said:</P>
    <P>But taking us all together, we have been living at a rate which is simply not justified by the amount of goods and services we are producing.  To make up the difference, we have been borrowing enormous amounts of money, borrowing at a rate which just cannot continue. A few simple figures will make this very clear.</P>
    <P>He gave these simple figures.  In 1979 the shortfall was £520 million and we had to borrow in that year over £1,000 million. That amount is equal to one-seventh of our entire national output for the year. He said it was far too high a rate and could not possibly continue.  It continued and increased and, instead of eliminating the borrowings, we are going into a year in which prospective borrowing is going to increase very significantly.  The Exchequer borrowing for 1979 was at £1,009 million or 14 per cent of gross national product.  In 1980 the manifesto which was issued to precede the document which, no doubt, will be issued this week or next, told us in that year the proportion of the gross national product that would be borrowed would be 8 per cent.  The actual figure as determined in relation to that year by the institute was not 8 per cent but almost twice it, 14.7 per cent.  In respect of this year, in which the Minister tells us that the deficit must be progressively reduced and eliminated, it is proposed to borrow £1,735 million or <Col N="1888" /> 17.2 per cent of the gross national product.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance who preceded the present Minister for Finance, the second of the three Ministers for Finance we have had so far told us that he was going to curb the deficit.  He was going to resist increases in Estimates and severely restrict them.  We know the result.  The really terrible feature of our situation is that the Minister for Finance, in a Government which has been selected by the people with a massive majority, has totally failed in his duty.  He has completely failed to control the public finances.  Anything that is going to be issued on behalf of the Government in relation to this election programme has got to be found to be as discreditable as the document which led to their election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it strange &mdash; indeed worrying &mdash; that the first thing one has to do today, in debating the Government's financial policy, is to try to reassure oneself that the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach recognise in a practical way that a grave problem exists which urgently needs to be remedied.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, in the 1978 budget debate, the then Minister for Finance described the state of the public finances as &ldquo;shocking&rdquo;.  As a matter of deliberate policy, however, and when the economic circumstances were inappropriate, he significantly increased public expenditure and borrowing, promising that this was only a temporary feature of the Government's strategy and that total borrowing would be greatly reduced in 1979 and 1980.  To this end the deficit on current account would be &ldquo;drastically reduced&rdquo;. Neither the then Minister nor his successors fulfilled this promise.  Quite the contrary. Things drifted from bad to worse: the current deficit of £209 million for 1977 was enlarged to £397 million for 1978 but, instead of being reduced, shot up further to well over £500 million in both 1979 and 1980.  With all due caution, I have no hesitation in saying that the 1981 deficit will substantially exceed the present Minister's budget figure of £515 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest this be misunderstood as political <Col N="1889" /> criticism, may I make it clear that it is not only this Government that is to blame. The result of all the mistaken or wrongly-timed policies of the past decade, since deficit financing of current expenditure was first set up here as respectable, can be summed up by saying that, while it took 50 years for the State debt to top £1,000 million, it has been multiplied eight times in as few years.  If nothing is done &mdash; and even if growth improves and inflation abates somewhat &mdash; the national debt is likely to double again by 1985, with perhaps one-third of the prospective £18 billion debt of that year being owed to foreigners.</P>
    <P>Repeatedly, promises of reform have been made but not kept.  The intentions stated in successive budget speeches have not been realised.  Deficits which were to have been drastically reduced have, in fact, been increased.  The extra taxation or the cut in services which, according to each of the last three budget speeches, was to have been made to pay for any unplanned increases in public service pay has never taken place.  What is one to think of a system of financial control which makes a song and dance about budgetary arithmetic and then turns a blind eye to an upsurge of expenditure or a slippage of revenue? The words in this year's budget speech about the &ldquo;initial progress made this year towards bringing our finances into balance&rdquo; have a hollow ring.  Can the Minister provide any evidence of the progress achieved towards his declared purpose that &ldquo;the deficit be progressively reduced or eliminated&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I am sure that others besides me were led to believe that much of the extra money devoted to public capital purposes this year was to be found by reducing the current deficit.  The Investment Plan 1981 declared it to be an essential part of Government strategy that &ldquo;current public expenditure be restrained in order to provide the necessary resources for the capital expenditure indicated in the Plan.&rdquo; In the event, current public expenditure, even as budgeted for, shows an increase of 17 per cent on last year's total &mdash; including supplementaries &mdash; and the current budget deficit stays at, at least, the same high level &mdash; probably, indeed, <Col N="1890" /> much higher.  The necessary resources for the projected 36 per cent increase in public capital expenditure have to come entirely from extra borrowing.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the Government have virtually given up hope of reform and have either turned away from the mess or are pretending it does not exist. One may search in vain for any reference to the current budget deficit in the Taoiseach's latest Ard-Fheis speech, and at the IMI Conference in Killarney he gave the impression that public borrowing was for productive purposes and entirely justifiable in present conditions.  This obviously does not apply to the many hundreds of millions which are being borrowed to meet everyday expenses, a misuse of our borrowing potential which is inexcusable in a country still so much in need of development and so short of jobs.</P>
    <P>The mirror-image of Government borrowing &mdash; the balance of payments deficit, now about 13 per cent of GNP &mdash; is being described as &ldquo;manageable&rdquo;, which, in my view, it certainly is not.  I regard it as grossly excessive and unsustainable and likely, if allowed to persist, to bring down the international value of our currency.</P>
    <P>Those who are concerned about these adverse trends and want to see a sound basis for the nation's economic and social progress re-established are being denigranted as &ldquo;prophets of doom and gloom&rdquo;. I resist being placed in this category.  My positive interest in national development needs no advertising.  If I am critical of what is wrong, I am also constructive in pointing the way to renewed progress. Incidentally, I am not unduly perturbed &mdash; just annoyed &mdash; at being so often portrayed in the media as the ungrateful dog that bites the hand that fed him.  The magnanimous man who nominated me to this House knew he was not putting in a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; man but one who would consider it his duty to speak his mind on matters within his competence.</P>
    <P>So, let me devote the rest of my remarks to an attempt to outline a reform programme which would be to the country's benefit and would help to safeguard national independence and respectability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> I shall first repeat the brief summary of our position which I gave recently in Killarney. We are a country in which inflation, unemployment and the external deficit are all very high.  The Keynesian way out &mdash; even if theoretically valid and practically effective in such an open economy &mdash; is closed to us by the size of our external deficit and foreign borrowings. Drastic cutting of current public expenditure is not possible because of the weight of pay, social welfare and debt interest in the total.  It would, in any case, risk accentuating the unemployment problem and the recession.  This is not to say, of course, that additions to current expenditure should not be much more strictly controlled.  Monetary policy is thwarted by the Government's massive injections of new borrowed money into the system to meet its needs &mdash; the Central Bank can influence only one-third of the money supply.  In these circumstances, everything depends on realism on the incomes front.</P>
    <P>If we could secure this realism &mdash; if, as a former general secretary of the Labour Party, Brendan Halligan, advocated in Killarney, income increases were henceforth determined by what our exporting sector could afford &mdash; then a reform programme for the next four years with the following objectives would meet our needs: a programme to phase out public borrowing for everyday purposes, to increase public and private investment for productive purposes and to get better value for such investment.</P>
    <P>The overload of deficits &mdash; internal and external &mdash; must be lightened as world conditions improve.  Some improvement is expected by the EEC but it may not last long.  Unless we are competitive enough to take advantage of it, we will be in a poor position to face the exigencies of rapid technological change and new trends in world production and trade.  Unless, however, we keep moving up the scale in terms of quality, design and the amount of value added in the production process, we shall find it very hard even to maintain saleable output and jobs.  We need to increase both at unprecedented rates if we are ever to <Col N="1892" /> achieve full employment; indeed, a doubling of the 1973-80 rate of increase in manufacturing output would be needed for this purpose.  As I said the other day in Louvain: &ldquo;The only way to be ready for the turn of the world economic tide is to be more competitive and, by selling more goods and services, to create more self-sustaining jobs and raise real standards. Granted purposeful and responsible leadership, a reasonable measure of common purpose and social cohesion, and a peaceful environment, much could, I believe, be accomplished by our growing and younger population, now better educated and more versatile than ever before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was greatly heartened by Brendan Halligan's courageous recognition at Killarney of the vital link between an export-related rate of pay increase and the expansion of sales, output and jobs. To be fair, he set this in the context of other reforms, as indeed I do too, though with less faith, in my case, in a State Development Corporation or in the utility of the illusory device of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The reform programme I am suggesting is based on the adoption henceforth of realistic rates of pay increase.  We must be brought to realise that with a population growing at the rate of 1½ per cent per annum, with energy cost increases lessening the purchasing power of our exports, and with only slow and erratic growth in prospect in the world outside, our expectations of improvements in real standards per head will have to be modified. The Minister emphasised this in his speech this evening.  Expectations are still based on the exciting but alas transient economic buoyancy of the sixties.  They were unjustifiably inflamed in 1977.  The most difficult but also the most urgent policy problem is how to secure a smooth and effective adaptation of expectations and motivations to the new realities of life.  Adaptation is unavoidable, but we must try our best to ensure that it is not disruptive and wasteful.  Education, persuasion, truth, social fairness and leadership all have a part to play in this.</P>
    <P>As I see it, our present standards rest precariously on the import of resources in excess of what we earn by our current <Col N="1893" /> production.  Admittedly, not all the balance of payments deficit goes to support our living standards &mdash; some of it genuinely adds to productive investment &mdash; but the total deficit is much too high to be sustained.  If we assume that to reduce it within a few years to, say, £300-400 million would be a prudent objective consistent with productive use of the imported resources, this means that at the moment, with a deficit of 13 per cent of GNP as against a prudent 3 per cent or so, we are living about 10 per cent beyond our means.  The individual standards we are already enjoying would need to be filled in and made good by new current production over some years to come before we could say that we were earning those standards and could begin to have them improved.  Given that 1½ per cent of every year's increase in national output is now required to match the population increase, it is clear that a substantial rate of GNP increase would be needed to make good our present <i>per capita</i> standards and reduce our excessive reliance on imported resources financed by foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>The logic of this seems inescapable.  It is not a &lsquo;hairshirt&rsquo; policy that I am advocating but rather a recognition that we shall have to make do with our present range of shirts until a reform programme related to incomes and public finances re-establishes a sound basis for economic and social advance.</P>
    <P>Even if oil starts to flow in large quantities in a few years' time, we will still need to sell our products and services to maintain and increase jobs.  We will still need to be competitive.  Apart from this, I wonder have we as yet any good reason to expect an oil bonanza on a scale sufficient both to replace our total imports of oil and provide export earnings to cover the capital charges on oil development? I ask this question because even a bonanza on this scale would still leave us at present with a substantial balance of payments deficit &mdash; £300-400 million. And we must remember that balance of payments deficits tend to grow according as economic activity quickens.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit is a serious blot on our public finances.  Getting rid <Col N="1894" /> of it by degrees requires resolute and sustained action on both the expenditure and the revenue side of the account.  The curbing of the expenditure trend depends above all on moderation, realism, on the incomes front.  On the revenue, or taxation, side I would repeat two points I have made before.  As a person in the &lsquo;better-off&rsquo; category, I have expressed myself as having been uncomfortable in recent years in pocketing tax and rates reliefs which had to be financed by borrowing. I would rather Santa Claus passed me by.  I have also referred to the miserable upshot of all the changes over the past decade in taxes on accumulated wealth &mdash; namely, that the revenue now collected from this general source is only a fraction of what the old death duties would be yielding.  I would be against discouraging unduly the building up of capital but the inheritance taxes seem too liberal &mdash; at least outside farming &mdash; and I would be inclined to claw back more of this windfall from posterity and let them work to earn their own living standards.</P>
    <P>A few words on the need to get better value for investment.  Public expenditure of a capital nature is now running at over £1,800 million a year.  No one denies that it is timely and wise to build up our infrastructure with a view to raising productivity and competitiveness in advance of the expected upturn in world trade.  These are vital needs of the economy.  But when we have to borrow so much from abroad for this purpose, putting a heavy charge on future production, it is essential that we get more value for our outlay than hitherto &mdash; that we apply scarce and dear resources more effectively in both the public and the private sectors.  Professor Kieran Kennedy has drawn attention to the serious drop since 1973 in the productivity of investment of all kinds in the State.  As he says, &ldquo;Investment alone is not a panacea: there must be equal insistence on the quality of investment and the conditions necessary for its effective use.&rdquo;  There must also, in my view, be more saving of energy and more efficient use of other inputs.</P>
    <P>I hope to see the new interest in &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; of infrastructural investment lead not just to financial participation by <Col N="1895" /> the private sector but to the widespread introduction of more efficient ways of carrying out public capital works.  Noticing, as we all do, the greater zeal and efficiency with which people work in small groups on their own account, I look forward to more experimentation in the organisation of work.  It may be worthwhile to simulate in industry and in various public sector areas, such as forestry, road building, cable laying and so on, a contract system in which co-operative groups, with their own or leased equipment, would be responsible for providing a specified product or service at an agreed price and time and had themselves the opportunity, through their own productivity, of gaining and sharing a premium profit.  Whether this be the best approach or not, it is obvious that we urgently need to find ways of increasing interest and application at desk and work place, of relating effort and reward more closely, and of reducing the alarming loss due to absenteeism.</P>
    <P>The low level of productivity in many areas indicates how great is our unrealised potential.  If our management and work systems, our plant efficiency and industrial relations were geared to making up this productivity leeway, we could quickly re-establish a solvent and sound basis for progress in real incomes and living standards.  The rate at which these can improve depends entirely on the rate of increase in output per head.</P>
    <P>To sum up, for me the indispensable instrument of reform both of the public finances and of the economy is greater pay realism in the sense of reward related to productivity in the market sector of the economy.  Expectations have been unduly inflamed by vistas of high economic growth.  The harsh truth has been ignored &mdash; the failure of real income per head to increase more than marginally since 1973, when allowance is made for the rise in population and the fall in the purchasing power of exports over imports.  The over-size deficit in the balance of payments indicates that the community is living beyond its present means and must for some time rely on new growth merely to make good its present <Col N="1896" /> living standards.  Pay is so big a component of public expenditure and of production costs that without realism in this area no improvement is possible in the public finances, in the rate of inflation, in national competitiveness or in net employment.</P>
    <P>However, with realism on the pay front, a tight restraining hand on current public expenditure, some extra taxation, and measures to make investment outlay more productive we could look forward to a progressive reduction in the deficits both in the current budget and external payments, better value in terms of new assets and jobs for a lower total of foreign borrowing, and a return to health and growth in the national economy.  Our boat would not be waterlogged when the world economic tide starts rising again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Whitaker and I over the last few years have crossed swords on fundamental policy as far as our economic policy is concerned. Tonight he has certainly come out in no uncertain terms and given us a final hard serve and the question is, can we return the ball?</P>
      <P>Undue emphasis on the accounting approach to managing our economy is not what is needed at this point in time.  Because economics, as a subject, is not amenable to instant checks on whether theories are right or wrong, we must wait for history to show.  I am certainly willing to take the risk that at this point the balancing of the books approach, the accounting approach, is not what is needed.  All anyone needs to do is go around and look at the country and at the people, at the effects on them of education, at their spirit and you can see that this nation is going somewhere fast.  Our people have recognised the value of education and of the development of technological expertise and its application in modern industry, and this is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1967-1969, when I was involved in the setting up of the regional technical colleges, if I had then listened to what people were saying, we would not then have made the investment in those colleges &mdash; I have said this before in the <Col N="1897" /> House and I must build on my own experience. One has to recognise the need and not necessarily the demand.  Our present need is to build up world market share while the rest of the world staggers along, goes through a bit of a chicane, economically, and comes out of it and begins to grow again.  All the signs are there that the other countries the United States, Japan and Germany &mdash; the main steam-engines of the world economy &mdash; are beginning to roll again.  We need not necessarily have a 3 per cent balance of payment ratio or a 5 per cent borrowing ratio to enable us to take off with it.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that we should continue with these high levels of borrowing, or with the high levels of balance of payments deficit.  It is a question of timing and of nerves.  Certainly anything that I have read about people who pulled back at a certain time in the past when there was an advancing population coupled with employment problems manifested that those who preached the doctrine of balancing and accounting approaches have been proved to be wrong.  That is my view on the fundamental aspects.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of what Senator Whitaker has said with which I would agree.  The notion of a more rational incomes policy I could not agree with more, and I have been preaching that for years.  I agree with what Brendan Halligan bravely said in Killarney, that the unprotected sector of our economy should be the guideline for income increases.  I said over the years that income increases should go hand in hand with the increases in added value in our economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector.  It is one thing to say that and another thing to live in an economy where free collective bargaining is the principle and you are open to the stronger elements in the bargaining process winning out and setting the standards, and that has happened.  The answer that comes up in that regard is that we should not raise expectations too high.</P>
    <P>What should we tell the man who, in SPS International in Shannon, runs an automatic lathe and produces the same number of screws as his counterpart in Germany, Japan or Puerto Rico &mdash; that <Col N="1898" /> he should not aspire to be paid the same purchasing power as the man in Japan or in Germany?  Should we say that, or should we deliberately say we will damp down everything so they will not have those kind of expectations?  With the increasing world communications they recognise and need these very same individuals who run the same machines whose expectations are based on what they deserve in purchasing power for their labour input and their skill input.  It does not just come from Government only.  It comes from an educated population who recognise what is going on in the world and have expectations which are a function of their own comparative assessment of what others get in the world.  Damping down these expectations is not the business we are in.  We are in the business of lifting people up, of recognising the power of modern technology, of recognising that our economy depends on the development of our manufacturing industry in line with the increasing productivity of our agricultural sector. This is the sort of thing we have been trying to do over the past four years.</P>
    <P>As one of the people who was deeply involved in developing the manifesto which launched the present Government in 1977, I stand behind its principles.  It has nothing to do with undue raising of expectations.  As I said in the House some weeks ago, the principles on which our policy were based were enunciated in September 1976 in a 35 page document and were not brought out as a list of hand-outs to raise the expectations of the country.  They were based on solid, worked out, economic principles.  We are building our position in world market share and are borrowing at the moment to do it.  That is the way I see it.  I do not like to see borrowings being used to finance the current budget deficit and to the extent that that exists, I am completely at one with Senator Whitaker.  I would like to see our GNP growing faster every year than our population is growing. That is the basis of the policy and in terms of timing it is the right policy at the moment.  As a fellow member of the National Economic and Social Council I would agree entirely with the Senator if <Col N="1899" /> that went on too long.  This council have made recommendations to the Government on cutting back gradually those deficits and it is a matter of time.</P>
    <P>On the question of incomes policy, which I believe is behind it all, cost push increases are what basically cause our inflation.  In a small, open economy such as ours we have to be price takers as far as external trading is concerned.  Why not have a simple formula?  One which I gave in Killarney in 1975 was that our income increases should not exceed the average of our competing European neighbours, excluding the UK.  That is a simple form and if it could be sold to the trade union movement, if that could be sold nationally, then everything would come right. How one does that is a political matter and we must keep on persuading the system to adopt a rational procedure, a moderate procedure of that kind.  To say that we should keep our income increases in line with the productivity of the unprotected sector is to use economic words. The alternative is a firm format, that each year the income increases in this country should not exceed the average of the income increases of the previous year in other European countries.  If we can adopt that, we would get our economy in line very quickly.  I am against balance just for the sake of balance at this point in time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the Senators who contributed to the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill.  I have some points to make in reply to those raised by the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, Senator FitzGerald expressed reservations on the prospects for our economy.  I say to him that there are clear signs that the worst of the recession is finally over and the economy is definitely on the upturn.  I referred in my speech to the latest figures for industrial exports.  I referred to consumer demand in the other House last night and I said that, in two successive quarters, cement sales had <Col N="1900" /> shown a substantial increase.  This has always been regarded as a significant barometer in regard to our second great industry, the building industry.  We are all aware of the uplift in agricultural output. We are aware, also, of the tremendous increase in inquiries in the tourism industry.  Yes, I can assure the House that the indicators are all favourable at the present time.  The rate of unemployment increase has been slowing down and there are grounds for optimism here also.</P>
    <P>In considering our employment performance, Senator FitzGerald referred rather lightly and glibly to a certain document called the manifesto.  Let me remind Senator FitzGerald that we during our term of office, from April 1977 to April 1980, encountered a substantial growth in the labour force never previously recorded in this country &mdash; 80,000 of an increase.  Let me also remind him that in the period 1973 to 1977 the comparable increase over four years, as against the three that I referred to, was 14,000.  That indicates the success of Fianna Fáil policies in that manifesto and, indeed, in the positive actions taken by this Government.  Employment increased by 80,000 in those three years and I believe that this was a remarkable achievement by any standards.  I am also confident that this momentum can be sustained.</P>
    <P>I gave figures in the other House last night that IDA job approvals will rise this year to the record level of 40,000.  Last year the target was 30,000.  That target was very substantially exceeded, going to 36,000 &mdash; nearly 37,000.  This is positive progress.  The investment plan that I referred to earlier will have a major impact on employment.  Within the plan itself, it will create about 10,000 direct jobs and, of course, there is the spin-off in the supply services in allied industries. That does not cover the money within that plan to provide or promote further industrial development.</P>
    <P>In relation to borrowing, I have consistently explained the Government's concern and determination to reduce our dependence on borrowing.  We recognise, too, that it must be reduced.  We have moved in this direction in this year's <Col N="1901" /> budget and propose to continue this policy. Most sensible commentators will agree that to do this immediately would have very serious and damaging effects. particularly on our employment situation. As Senator Whitaker said, our young population is growing at a great rate.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford a policy on borrowing which does not have regard to the need to sustain economic activity and employment.  If we were to take drastic steps to reduce our reliance we would probably start off a recession worse than anything experienced in the mid-seventies or in recent years.  Senator FitzGerald doubts that we can achieve the targets set in the budget, but the figures for the first quarter of the year were on target and the pattern of receipts and issues for the quarter were in line with expectations.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker has also expressed concern about public finance.  He quoted from statements in 1978 about reducing our dependence on borrowing.  In fairness it should be said that we had no reason in 1978 to anticipate a recession of the magnitude of the world recession that was to come, a recession which was so much worse than anything experienced in the mid-seventies.  We could not have foreseen either that the price of oil would increase at an unprecedented rate. I may just say that the 1980 figure for the cost of our oil imports was about double the 1978 figure.  I do not think that anybody, no matter how farseeing, could have anticipated that.  When comments such as these are made, account should be taken particularly of the magnitude of the increase to which I refer.  In that respect the Government by their longterm policies have been endeavouring in every possible way, as has been explained so often by my colleague, the Minister for Energy, to reduce our over-dependence on imported oil.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker inquired what progress had been made to bring discipline to bear on our public finances.  I have already indicated that we are moving in the right direction and have highlighted the Government's concern about this. We have severely pruned the Estimates <Col N="1902" /> for current expenditure, and have been criticised for so doing.  We have, on the other hand, taken a deliberate decision to expand productive investment, a decision I will defend and say is a wise one, with our growing population, at a time of world recession.  We are increasing the investment this year by substantially more than 30 per cent.  I believe that this is the correct policy and the one which we should pursue.  It will pay worthwhile dividends in the longer-term, strengthen the basis structure of our economy, improve our exporting capacity, provide the extra and badly-needed infrastructure that for too long successive Governments in this country did not improve.  I refer particularly to telecommunications, road network and energy.  There are, of course, the very important social needs of houses, schools, hospitals and so on.</P>
    <P>I am also convinced that Governments in the past should have looked more closely during periods of recession at improving and strengthening our infrastructure.  The better that infrastructure, the more it will attract the investment necessary in industrial development. We have been extremely successful there, but we can even be more successful if our infrastructure is improved.  The value of productive investment cannot be overestimated.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Whitaker's assertion that competitiveness is of crucial importance.  We must be more competitive in price, quality and design.  I agree with the Senator that expectations of rising living standards must be modified. The Senator outlined what he described as a reform programme for the next three years but time does not allow me to go into these proposals in detail.  I certainly endorse his proposals which are in line with the Government policy for the medium term.</P>
    <P>In relation to the balance of payments and the problems facing us, I want to point out that all countries in the EMS are facing a similar situation.  Germany, which has had a payments surplus for so long and has long been cited to us as the ideal, is expected to be in substantial deficit for the second year in succession. If countries with balance of payments <Col N="1903" /> deficits were completely to eliminate them immediately the consequences would inevitably be a further serious world recession.  We, like other countries, must correct our balance of payments deficit, but must do it gradually. This is, of course, the course being pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware that time does not allow me to go into greater detail on this Second Stage of this Finance Bill.  However, I can assure the Senators who raised points to some of which I have replied, others which I have not covered, that this Government are on the right course.  I believe that the very positive indicators to which I refer, of improved growth and activity and a new vigour will become increasingly evident.  As a result of this Government's policies we have come more successfully than most of our European partners through a very deep recession and we, as a nation, can gain extra benefit from that upturn when it takes place later this year, as is expected internationally. Our growth rate this year will <Col N="1904" /> be in excess of 2 per cent.  Consider that against the EEC average growth rate of ½ per cent.  I believe our policies are the right ones to handle the present situation.</P>
