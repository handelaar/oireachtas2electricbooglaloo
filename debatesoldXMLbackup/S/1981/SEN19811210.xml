      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The closure of three of the Legal Aid Board's law centres to new clients.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment, and it will be taken from 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to convene the next meeting of the Committee of Selection, because important committees are appointed on the recommendation of that committee.  The last Seanad first met on 27 October and on 9 November the Committee of Selection were appointed.  Their first Report, presented to his House by the Leas-Chathaoirleach on 23 November, announced the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Joint Committee on Standing Orders relevant to Private <Col N="1276" /> Business, the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills and the Joint Restaurant Committee and Joint Library Committee.  So far in this Seanad the Committee of Selection have met only once and we have only one report &mdash; announcing the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; and if one takes into account the meeting on Thursday, 16 July when Senator Reynolds announced the Order of Business, we have met several times.  Do the Government consider the other committees irrelevant or are they waiting for the next Seanad to appoint them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I am very happy to be in the Seanad.  I welcome the opportunity to attend and I look forward to meeting the Senators on several occasions over the next four years.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the motion now being introduced is to seek the approval of Seanad Éireann for a draft order under section 4 (6) of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, to prohibit the employment of children between 14 and 15 years of age during school term except second level students participating in work experience or other similar educational courses arranged or approved of by the Minister for Education. A similar motion was approved by the Dáil on 25 November last.</P>
      <P>The 1977 Act defines children as persons under the school leaving age, which is at present 15 years, and prohibits their employment.  It provides, however, that children over 14 years may be employed on light non-industrial work outside school hours for limited periods during school term and for more extended periods during the school holidays.</P>
      <P>When this legislation was being debated in the Oireachtas there was considerable disagreement on the question of the employment of children during school term.  On the one hand there were those who argued compellingly that such employment would be detrimental to the children's educational development.  On the other hand it was claimed that it was economically necessary in less well-off families to supplement the family income.  It was also argued that work experience is a part of the development of the young person, particularly those who leave school at 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> The compromise agreed was that the provisions of the Act, which allow children to work during school term, would remain in force for only two years from the date of commencement of the Act unless continued in force on a yearly basis by affirmative order.  Affirmative orders were made extending the life of the provisions in 1979 and in 1980.  The provisions finally lapsed on 4 July 1981.</P>
    <P>Most educational authorities hold the view that it is not possible for children to work during school term and, at the same time, obtain the optimum benefit from the school programme.  I believe this to be the case and my experience as a parent confirms that belief.  I am proposing, therefore, to prohibit the employment of children during school term except in the case of those who are second level students participating in work experience programmes or other similar educational programmes approved by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I should mention, however, that children will still be free to choose to work during school holidays for the periods specified in the Act.  It is my belief that the changes now proposed will improve the legislation.  There are, in addition, problems as to the enforcement of the Act.  These are under examination, and I will make any necessary administrative or legislative changes to improve the enforcement arrangements.</P>
    <P>A campaign was mounted, when the Act was passed in 1977, to bring its provisions to the attention of all who would be affected by the legislation, especially young people, parents, employers, teachers, youth clubs and trade unions.  I believe a further campaign is needed, and I intend to undertake such a campaign when the examination of the enforcement arrangements is completed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I commend this order to the House.</P>

      <P>By accident I am the first speaker this morning.  This is not my portfolio, but due to the unavoidable absence of the Senator whose portfolio it is, I step in in the role of what one might call sop in ionad scuaibe.  My first duty is to extend a very hearty welcome to the <Col N="1279" /> Minister.  We wish him well in his work. He has a monumental task to get things sorted out, and from this side of the House we wish him every success in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>With regard to this order, everyone in the House will find it reasonably acceptable. If we cast our minds back to what we have read regarding industrial countries and the slave labour that existed down through the years, especially as far as young people were concerned, we will know of the dreadful conditions in Britain in which young people were forced to work in the mines; these were young children of both sexes.  If we read Dickens we are horrified of what we read.</P>
      <P>We have been emerging for some time from a totally agricultural country to an industrial country and such regulations are necessary.  Therefore, we at this side of the House welcome the order, and we have a few suggestions to make in regard to it but I am sure the Minister will give us his full attention.</P>
      <P>What is work?  On studying education down the years I was forcibly struck by a definition I got of &ldquo;play&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Play&rdquo; was defined by a professor as obair le saor thoil, in other words, work that you do of your own free will, for the pure enjoyment of it.  I presume what the Minister has in his definition of work would be where you work not entirely of your own free will but in order to earn enough money for specific purposes.  For that reason, I would like if when replying he would give us his definition of work with regard to this order.  In most households, especially among the farming community, boys and girls attend to various jobs which could be regarded as work, and very serious, important and useful work, and they enjoy doing it.  I live in the heart of a rural community, a milk district, and everybody in the farming family takes part in the business of milk producing, and they enjoy it.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in a paragraph in the Minister's address.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most educational authorities hold the view that it is not possible for children to work during school term and, at the same time, obtain the optimum <Col N="1280" /> benefit from the school programme.</P>
    <P>I can see the context in which he said that, but in my understanding of work done freely and for enjoyment, on the family farm, I do not see that that would not actually help the young person because it would be a break from his studies and that would be commendable. I would like the Minister to give his observations on that particular point.  Apart from that, I welcome the order and hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the welcome accorded to the Minister on his first appearance in the House and the welcome given to this measure.  It is a little difficult to respond to the Minister because his address has put in a most concise form and in a very comprehensive way what one would like to express on this measure.  He has approached this problem from a very rational point of view.  He sought to address himself to the major problem and at the same time has not adopted an approach which is excessively rigid, particularly with regard to the question of work experience.  There is little doubt that over the last two decades there have been many opportunities for young people to find employment of a temporary or casual nature and that this has been extremely attractive to them and their families, and it has become part of the culture of our country.  It was not the case to the same extent when many of those who are in this House at the moment were growing up.  At that time it was not easy for young people to find casual employment.  Many of those who were able to proceed to third level education or second level education often found that any employment they managed to get prior to taking up permanent employment was away from this country &mdash; in Britain or other countries further afield.  What has happened in recent times is that this kind of employment has been available in our own country and has enabled young people to supplement the family income.  It should be said here, and this is a relevant point, that often this has encouraged expectations among young people of a certain standard of <Col N="1281" /> living, a certain standard of income and a certain standard of personal expenditure often on luxuries and non-essentials and I am not in any way speaking in a puritanical way, which is now causing severe problems, because in an atmosphere in which this kind of casual employment is no longer easily available they find themselves with tastes and expectations which exceed their ability to realise them.</P>
      <P>The problem of exploitation of young labour, possibly not child labour but of young labour, is still with us.  It is fair to say that it has been most prevalent in the catering industry and licensed premises, where on one's frequent or infrequent visits to such places, one found oneself being served by very young people at a very late hour in conditions which in no circumstances could be described as healthy.  I welcome the Minister's intention to review and strengthen the measures necessary to monitor the legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the words &ldquo;institute of secondary education&rdquo; in section 4 means second level or post-primary.  I presume that matter will be cleared up.  I would also like to welcome the fact that the Minister has specifically made reference to work experience.  It is very important in this area that we provide the means for work experience.  I am speaking from a professional point of view as a guidance counsellor.  It is clear from my personal experience of young people trying to come to an understanding of themselves and their future development, that they should have an opportunity to encounter work outside school.  They should have as wide an opportunity as possible to experience work within the context of a work place.  This is an area secondary education in particular could have developed further.  The major point being made in this order is that young people find it difficult &mdash; or maybe teachers are more conscious of this than many young people &mdash; to give their full attention to and make a proper effort in their programme of studies if, at the same time, they are involved in tiring and demanding work outside the school.  The employment in which many young people are <Col N="1282" /> involved exercises an immediate attraction upon them which their studies often do not.  Again I am speaking as a guidance counsellor, not as somebody who is involved with the harsher administrative disciplines sometimes associated with the school but as somebody who is involved in trying to help young people to come to an understanding of the importance to themselves of their studies and educational development.  Faced with the situation in which they can acquire fairly substantial sums of spending money, the attraction of that spending money as opposed to academic studies which often seem remote, is often more attractive. The fatherly figure of the Minister for Labour has a function in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody could oppose this order in principle, but we ought to be aware of its limitations.  It is significant in what it does not say about parts of our society.  This is not to be taken as a criticism of the order.  I fully support it.  A thing can be right in principle and have the most extraordinary consequences; it may be right in principle, even if many people do not have the benefit of it.  Senator O'Connell talked about the disincentive to young people to apply themselves to their studies.  For many of our young people their home conditions make it impossible for them to study because they live in overcrowded conditions, maybe conditions of family violence, family dissension and so on.  We have to keep these things in their proper context.  There are other problems facing the majority of young people who work outside school hours in the age group of 14 to 15 years whom this order will not reach.  That is not saying that the order is anything other than right, but it is important that it should be seen for what it is. It is one gesture in the direction of a vulnerable group in our society.  In spite of my identification in the past with a certain charity, I would regard children as the most deserving group in our society because they are innocent.  They are there because society does not look after them properly.  Therefore, everything should be done to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases the children who will be <Col N="1283" /> affected by this order do not particularly want to be in school, see no relevance in school, and this order will not change that.  Their home environment is such that they could not study even if they wanted to.  In some cases it may mean extra pressures on them because they may be expected to earn an income. There is a case to be made for complete reassessment of the way children from some of our more deprived areas are educated, the type of schools they go to and what they do in those schools.  It is a fact that 24 per cent of our children leave school at 15 years of age&mdash;19 per cent leave at the age of 15 years, and 5 per cent leave before the age of 15 years, and the children who make up the 19 per cent are the most likely to be working.  We do not want to over-romanticise the effect another year at school would have on them.</P>
    <P>I wonder is this order going to be enforced.  I have yet to see a newspaper seller who looked more than 14 or 15 years.  Many of them are under 14 years. In any pub in this city on a Saturday, any time after half past nine or ten o'clock at night, one is liable to be confronted by a succession of children selling Sunday newspapers.  I do not know who employs them or who pays them, but not only are they not 15 years, they are not 14 years and some of them are barely ten years.  I do not know whether that is illegal.  I am not familiar with the legislation on child employment but &mdash; perhaps it is a special case &mdash; I have always found one of the most sickening things about Saturday night in Dublin is to see small children out in the most appalling conditions selling newspapers, usually with the figure of an adult &mdash; very often an unpleasant adult &mdash; somewhere in the background.  The rigours of the law for many of these children are seen more in terms of Loughan House than in protecting them from the godfatherly figures who manipulate them, particularly in the newspaper business. From my knowledge of Cork, there is an under-current attached to the selling of newspapers which most of us would not like to upset.  What I am worried <Col N="1284" /> about is that we might see this in oversimplified terms.</P>
    <P>If we are going to make an order like this I am anxious to know if there is provision to have it enforced in the areas that are most visible.  The two that come to mind immediately are newspaper sales and lounge boys in public houses.  Let us not over-state what is involved here. Most of the children who are affected by this order will not thank us for it and would probably leave school when they are 15 anyway.  We should not view it out of perspective.  It is a step along a long road if we are ever going to protect our children from the consequences of the sort of a society we have but it is no more than a step.  Nevertheless, it is a welcome one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister on his first visit as Minister to the Seanad and, like the other Senators who have contributed, I should like to welcome the proposals in this motion to approve the order.  I recall that in a number of previous debates in this House where the then Minister was bringing in a different order we had a considerable discussion on the need for greater enforcement of the measures to protect children and young people.  I recall that undertakings were given that examinations were being carried out.  I remember more than a year ago an examination was in the process of being carried out and at that time there was a considerable discussion in this House and a number of us referred to a very critical study which the youth section of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union had brought out where they had done some research into the employment of persons under the legal age.  They had shown, as Senator Brendan Ryan has mentioned, that a number of them were employed in pubs at unsocial hours.  The evidence they revealed appeared to show a pattern where in certain areas there was more observance of employing people under age than compliance with the law. More of the young people involved were being employed in situations the Act was intended to prohibit.  It was clear that there was a serious problem which the <Col N="1285" /> youth section of the union had identified. They published a very useful booklet on it and called for urgent action.  They pointed out that although there had been some evidence of inspection by the Department it appeared to take place during daylight hours.  The Minister at that time gave an assurance that there would be more inspection at night and at appropriate times when children under age might be employed and, to that extent, exploited.</P>
      <P>I accept, and, indeed, I am very sympathetic to the points made by Senator Brendan Ryan, who pointed out the reality for a considerable number of 15 year olds who leave on their fifteenth birthday or shortly afterwards or the early school leavers who leave before their fifteenth birthday.  The percentage is very serious for our society, but, nevertheless, the legislation is an important part of the problem.  Some other aspects of it we can discuss on the next measure to come before this House this morning.  It would be helpful to have on the record of the House some idea of the kind of examination that has been taking place in the Department, some figures, perhaps, on prosecutions that have been brought, if any prosecutions have been brought in recent months against employers and if, perhaps, the Minister in his reply would give details of the kind of campaign he envisages.  He referred to the fact that a compaign was mounted in 1977 and the evidence is that that campaign was not very effective, was largely ignored or was not brought to the attention either of parents or of children who were vulnerable. It would be helpful to know in what way it is proposed to re-publicise the terms of the Act and the precise provisions regarding the employment of young persons, what is legal and what is not legal and the element of exploitation.  This has to be done very much in a context of ensuring as a society that we do provide possibilities both for work experience, for structured employment and an education component of that for those who dropped out of the school structure either before 15 or at the age of 15.  They are the most critical group who deserve special attention from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> That group was considered, to some extent, in a debate recently in this House on the proposal to establish an independent examinations and curriculum board. However, they were only referred to in the context of the need for a more flexible curriculum, more opportunities for relevant courses and relevant approaches to education and training in schools, and the need for so many young people to change the whole concept of teaching and of education and to provide them with encouragement and structure whereby they can equip themselves for adult life in our society.  I would welcome information from the Minister as to the kind of examination which is being carried out by the Department and also as to the nature of the campaign which he intends to launch to re-publicise the protective provisions of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand the Minister's problem when he refers to the controversy which existed on the enactment of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977 and, in particular, section 4.  That section deals with the minimum age of employment and goes on to make provision that children who are 14 years of age but have not yet reached 15 years of age may be employed during school terms to a certain limited extent.  As I understand it this order proposes to prohibit this in the future.  From an intellectual point of view nobody can have any serious objection to the merits of that proposal except in so far as one might have doubts about the way in which the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977 is, in general, being enforced and also the extreme switch of emphasis that there appears to be in the complete repeal of the section.  I am speaking now specifically in respect of children who were 14 years of age but had not yet reached 15 years of age.  They were covered by section 4 (3) of the 1977 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, the position as far as those children were concerned is that they could be employed during school term for two hours in any day other than on a Saturday or Sunday and on a Saturday and Sunday they could be employed for not more than four hours.  There was a <Col N="1287" /> further clause which stated that the total period of their employment could not exceed 14 hours weekly.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that to go from that situation, which was controversial, to a situation where we are absolutely prohibiting in all circumstances the employment of a person who is 14 but not yet 15 is going very much in the opposite direction to what was in the legislation.  It is a pity that the legislation was not drafted in such a way that the number could be reduced to something like four hours a week, that a person could do a very minimum amount of work.  The legislation may not permit that kind of an order at present, and if it does not I well understand it.  We must look at this order in the context of a problem which has been referred to by other Members, that is the actual implementation of the provisions of the Act.  The various categories in that Act appear to be those in excess of 16 years of age, those who are between 15 and 16 years of age, those who are 14 but not yet 15, and those who are under 14.</P>
    <P>To the outsider it does not appear that the provisions of the Act in general are being adhered to by employers in general. There is a touch of unreality about the situation.  It is easy to talk about deprived children.  It is not only in respect of deprived children that it is not being implemented.  I suspect it is not being implemented in respect of a whole range of children some of whom under no possible criterion could be described as deprived.</P>
    <P>The problem about introducing further restrictive legislation, with which in principle I certainly agree, is that the actual enforcement of the general body of legislation becomes progressively more difficult. If there is not respect for the law any order which we might make will be more difficult for the Minister to implement. It is true to say that there is not an awareness of the law among employers or, indeed, among potential employees. It would be hard to expect it among potential employees in view of the fact that they are very young people.  In respect of employers they do not seem to take their duties under the Act seriously. <Col N="1288" /> The more sections of this Act that are not being implemented the more the legislation will come into disrepute and, eventually, will not be implemented at all. That legislation to a casual observer like myself appears almost to have reached that stage.  Successive Members have said that they have observed people who appear to be breaking the letter of this law from their position as outsiders looking at their employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended in so far as he has indicated to the House that he is going to pursue vigorously the various provisions to ensure that they are adhered to.  He may be giving himself an additional problem which is going to make the implementation of that order, and the other orders which have been made under the Act, all the more difficult.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to repeat that it does not appear to me to be necessary that one should go from 14 hours a week which in my opinion &mdash; I was not a Member of the House at the time and I am not criticising those who were &mdash; in the context of a 14-year old during school term seems an excessive amount of work, to a situation where he may not work one hour.  If somebody is doing his normal studies, or attending school even if he never studies, and doing 14 hours in addition to that that seems to be very big. However, to go from that to a situation where he may not even work for one hour appears to me to be throwing out the baby and the bath water together.  It appears to be a reaction to the fact that the legislation was drawn up in such a way that during school terms in particular the amount of work permitted for those who are 14 but not yet 15 was excessive.  I should like to encourage the Minister to ensure that the orders which have been made under the Act are rigorously adhered to and that prosecutions will be brought if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I know him to be a man of good disposition and no doubt he has the singularity of purpose to pursue the type of legislation that will be essential in the Department of <Col N="1289" /> Labour.  With a combination like that we will get legislation that will be most effective in this area.</P>
      <P>I should like to welcome the order in principle.  I am glad we have the distinction drawn between the work experience programmes because there is a great distinction between working in a factory or a lounge bar or whatever.  One is supervised and well run and the other is not supervised.  The young people in it are very vulnerable.  I agree with Senator Ryan about the problems that implementation will present.</P>
      <P>It has to be said that it is better for the education of children if they are not out working but we must face the facts.  Most young children in corporation housing schemes and in the inner city areas have to go out to work to help to provide for the family, even at 14 years of age.  In many cases in the inner city areas, and also in the housing schemes, children are told by their parents to go out to work to supplement the family income.  It is not a question of whether the child wants to do it of his own accord or not.  In many cases that is the position.  Some of the children do not attend school the way they should because their parents want them to go out to earn an extra few shillings to supplement the family income.  I do not know how extensive that is but if one applies this order in its most rigid sense, which is the way it should be applied if we agree with the principle of it, it poses the question of where do we go from here?  Will their circumstances improve?  Will they now have to try to find some other way to get money?  Even if they are only working for pocket money the parents cannot provide, will the situation arise where they might have to turn to some other way, perhaps a dishonest way, of trying to get money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that because my own experience was that I had to leave school at 12 years of age to work on a carrier-bike to supplement the family income.  At that time one did not choose whether one was going to go to school or not, one was just told.  As far as I can see, at over 61 years of age now, the facts have not changed. The emphasis and the locations have <Col N="1290" /> changed but the circumstances have not. This type of legislation is absolutely necessary. If we had a perfect society it would not be but I think it is necessary to bear in mind the points I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The funny thing about bringing in legislation is that one cannot get the coordination between Departments and Ministers.  It does not work that way and I suppose it is not practical.  But if we are going to bring in legislation to see that children are properly directed there is also the question of whether we are going to seek out the cultural and educational activities they need to steer them in the right direction.  There is a serious lack of amenities everywhere.  Housing schemes are very badly planned and there is nothing done in advance about them.  The whole question of the achievement of the full potential of children requires facilities. While it is necessary to introduce this motion and I support it wholeheartedly it is a shame that we do not have something running alongside it to the effect that we are going to put the skids under that but at least we can turn them in a different direction away from slot machine halls or pool halls where they can develop their own potential physically and mentally.  That is a dream I have had for a long time and, perhaps, one day it will come true.  I welcome the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank those who have contributed to this debate, and especially for the good wishes to me in the job I have to do.  I was struck by the fact that without exception everybody welcomed the order being made.  There were certain reservations mentioned and they were also mentioned in the Dáil.  I should like to say that when the affirmative order lapsed last July there was no restriction whatsoever on children in this age group working.  It was necessary either to bring back the previous arrangement or improve on it.  If we allow children &mdash; as was done in the past &mdash; two hours work per day during school term it is more difficult to enforce and to keep surveillance on it than having a total ban.  We would want, in the words of a former Minister, fields full of inspectors going <Col N="1291" /> around to know when children started work and when they finished.  At least if children within this age group are working during their school term they are breaking the law and the people who employ them are breaking the law.  The situation is much clearer in that respect. This restriction is necessary because it is damaging to their educational attainments to have them working for anything up to ten hours during their school days and four hours on Saturday.  It cannot be a help with all the other demands on their time and the pressures they are under with television in the home, sport and so on.  It means that less time is available for them to do work.  I would not agree with the comment that only children in deprived areas go out to work.  This is quite common at every level of society. I would not like anybody to think that this order applies only to the deprived areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cranitch mentioned the benefit of farm work for young children.  The regulations exclude children employed by their parents on a farm.  They also exempt work done on behalf of a father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, step-father, step-mother, brother, sister, half-brother or half-sister in the home. We all agree that every child should do some work around his own home and help with some of the chores.  It is of benefit to him.  I am thinking more in the area of going out and being employed by separate employers.  We want to prohibit that type of activity.  Several Senators mentioned the monitoring of the order. I am far from satisfied with the way this was done in the past.  The problem is simply that there are a very large number of children and, perhaps, we would like to have more inspectors doing this work. Nevertheless, I am aware that quite a good effort was made.  In the present year 1,717 visits were made to various establishments and premises from 1 January to 30 September; 443 visits were made to catering establishments, 482 to hotels, 618 to public houses, 78 to supermarkets and shops and 96 to other miscellaneous activities.  That represents a good deal of <Col N="1292" /> activity from the inspectorate.  Nevertheless, the real problem arises with enforcement.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which there is some legal difficulty.  I have been in contact with the Attorney General to see how the legislation can be strengthened because there is real difficulty in enforcement.  I am aware that very few cases, if any, in this area reach the courts.  Senators who have knowledge or interest in this area should contact me or officials in my Department.  I will be very willing to talk to them and hear their opinion on how enforcement can be improved.  This does not mean that the visits of inspectors to premises have not a beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan felt this affirmative order was only a gesture for the vulnerable group.  I hope to allay that fear.  It is intended to deal with children who are working, from whatever area or sector of society they come.  I am well aware of the work which the Irish Transport and General Workers Union have done in this area and I should like to add to the praise Senator Robinson had for the activity of Mr. Wall of that union.  It was well deserving and we are aware of the results of his studies.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to state that a very extensive campaign of information will proceed as soon as this order is confirmed.  It will take the form of information for schools and television, radio and newspaper advertisements.  I hope the media take up the details of this order and perhaps we will see some debates on television and radio about it. That would also be very helpful.  I am not satisfied with the enforcement and I intend to pursue this with the Attorney General to see that the enforcement is improved.  I should like to thank Senators for their contributions and their general agreement with what we are trying to do.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Youth Employment Agency Bill, 1981:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Youth Employment Agency Bill, 1981: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government 1981-86, <Col N="1293" /> contains as a major commitment the establishment at an early date of a Youth Employment Agency.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the agency has to be looked at against the persistent growth of youth unemployment in Europe since the early seventies.  This position obtains despite various policy interventions in favour of young people by Governments. There are, unfortunately, relatively few exceptions to this depressing picture and in 1980 the unemployment rates for the 15-25 year age group were as high as 15.1 per cent, 15 per cent and 24.8 per cent in the UK, France and Italy. In the seven largest OECD countries, youth unemployment accounted for a staggering 42 per cent of total unemployment.</P>
      <P>The best estimates of youth unemployment in Ireland are those available from the live register with the most recent figures being for November 1981.  On that date, there were 36,839 persons under 25 years of age unemployed.  This represents 27.6 per cent of the total unemployed. Our data on youth employment and unemployment are bad but I hope that a significant improvement will result in our information as a spin-off from the proposals which I will be putting forward later.</P>
      <P>Unemployment among young people is high because unemployment is high in the community overall.  The level of unemployment has risen rapidly in the present recession which began at the end of 1979.  By the end of November, seasonally adjusted unemployment was 58 per cent higher than in December 1979. Youth unemployment has risen even faster; while seasonally adjusted figures are not available, the actual number of unemployed aged under 25 is now more than 80 per cent higher than in January 1980.  Experience points to young workers faring relatively badly when there is a sharp, sudden rise in overall unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the present unsatisfactory position regarding youth employment, account must also be taken of the future demographic picture and its implications for the labour force.  The most recent labour force projections by the <Col N="1294" /> ESRI point to an annual average increase in the region of 1.5 per cent to 1.8 per cent in our labour force.  Around 65,000 young people leave our educational system annually and most look for work. Retirements from the labour force are nowhere near this figure.</P>
    <P>The implications for policy of the present level of youth unemployment and the expected labour force increase to which I have referred are many, but two major conclusions can be drawn.  First, even to keep the number unemployed at its present level means that we must create more jobs than are being lost.  Secondly, our labour force is becoming younger and those entering it have different qualifications, attitudes and aspirations from those who are leaving it.  I am not overlooking the fact that our middle-aged and older workers are faced with similar problems.  In the present difficult and uncertain economic climate the analysis which I have presented, particularly the sheer scale of the youth employment challenge, clearly points to the need for special solutions.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of our efforts to reduce youth unemployment must be a sustained attack on the scourge of unemployment at all levels in our society.  This requires continued growth in our exports of goods and services.  Increased exports are vital in view of the sharp deterioration in our balance of payments position in the last few years.  Export growth must also be the engine for the creation of new jobs which will be needed in the years to come.</P>
    <P>We will, of course, continue with the existing and new forms of job creation centred on the activities of the IDA and other development bodies and on the expansion of our productive capacity by increased sales in home and export markets. Research has shown that around 50 per cent of the jobs generated by the IDA are filled by young people.  The National Development Corporation when established will constitute a major new initiative of significant long-term importance in the task of increasing productive employment.  It is envisaged that much of the corporation's investments will be directed to the new growth sectors where <Col N="1295" /> progress in the past has been inhibited by a lack of risk capital, but profitable investments in the more mature industries will also be considered.</P>
    <P>Balanced and self-sustaining output and employment growth will do much to improve the youth unemployment situation. It will, however, still be necessary to adopt special measures to overcome the problems that are particular to young people.  There is a clearly identifiable youth labour market.</P>
    <P>A range of training and employment opportunities exist for helping young people arising from initiatives by successive Governments. The present position in relation to such schemes is that roughly 20,000 young people will be catered for in 1981.  The schemes concerned are the National Manpower Service work experience programme with 5,000 young people participating in 1981; AnCO's general training programme with 12,000 young persons, including 2,000 young apprentices participating; and the Department of Education's temporary grants scheme and the Department of the Environment's environmental improvements scheme with 1,000 participating. Allied to measures taken within the educational system, such as the introduction and expansion of pre-employment courses, these programmes constitute a sizeable effort to aid young people.</P>
    <P>I would make several points in relation to existing efforts.  Firstly, the continuing high level of youth unemployment indicates that more needs to be done.  Secondly, the schemes are not properly co-ordinated. They were introduced on a piecemeal basis in response to emerging problems, in many cases to meet what was seen as a temporary need.  Differences in allowances and wages between schemes, and lack of co-ordinated promotion of programmes, have led inevitably to a degree of confusion in the minds of those intended to benefit.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think it is fair to say that existing schemes do not have a sufficient impact on the position of disadvantaged young people.  Part of the problem has been one of identification of the young people concerned.  Teenagers with the <Col N="1296" /> most pressing employment problems may also be difficult to cope with in structured training and experience courses.  Programme sponsors have made considerable efforts to respond to these difficulties, but I feel that further initiatives are called for.</P>
    <P>These points serve to illustrate the need for the initiative being taken in the form of this Bill and the setting up of the agency.  I have discussed the proposed agency with, among others, representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers and I have taken their views into consideration in formulating the proposals before Senators.</P>
    <P>Certain conclusion can be arrived at from what I have been saying up to now. Firstly, we have a sizeable number of our young people unemployed.  Secondly, labour force projections point to a continuing situation of more young entrants to the labour force than retirals.  Thirdly what has been done up to now is not an adequately comprehensive and co-ordinated response to the problem.  It does not cover the entire transition from school to full integration in the workforce and it is of limited benefit to disadvantaged young people.</P>
    <P>The Government in their programme for 1981 to 1986 recognised these considerations and the need for special provisions to deal with the acute problem of youth employment.  The Government therefore decided to establish without delay a Youth Employment Agency to integrate and radically extend the schemes that exist under the separate auspices of a number of State enterprises. The Government intend the new agency to move as rapidly as it physically can to the point where an additional 20,000 young people will be catered for by existing and new schemes.</P>
    <P>I repeat this figure of 20,000 since some confusion arose in the Dáil over the number of young people to be assisted by the agency and the type of operations involved.  The argument has been that the agency will cater for much the same numbers of young people as in 1981.  I should like to put the record straight on these two points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> As regards numbers, it is my intention that about 40,000 young people will be catered for in 1982.  This will be an increase of 20,000 or, in fact, a doubling of what is being done for young people at present in 1981.  In addition, the agency will intensify their efforts on behalf of those who are more than six months out of work; it is among this group that the most acute problems of disadvantage are concentrated.</P>
    <P>These measures will be designed to ensure that no young person is left without some form of work, training or work experience within a relatively short period of having completed his or her education.</P>
    <P>I should like now to give the House an indication of my proposals for dealing with the problem.  The Youth Employment Agency Bill before us is intended to implement these proposals.  In brief, the Bill has two parts dealing firstly with the establishment of the agency itself, and secondly, with the collection of the levy.</P>
    <P>The first part embraces sections 2 to 14.  These sections provide for the formation and registration of the agency, their constitution as a limited liability company under the Companies Acts, their memorandum and articles of association, the board of directors, the holding of shares and the furnishing of balance sheets, the winding up of the agency and the usual provisions under which directors and employees of the agency cannot be Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or of the European Assembly.</P>
    <P>The levy to finance the agency and the schemes is dealt with in sections 15 to 26, the main points being the methods of collecting the levy and the channelling of funds to programme sponsors.  The European Social Fund will also be involved in the funding of the programmes concerned.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency must be competent and efficient and have a flexibility to contemplate initiatives and embark upon new departures.  With these considerations in mind I am proposing to establish the agency as a limited company. <Col N="1298" /> Approval of the Oireachtas to this approach is required in the legislation which we are now discussing.  Its advantages lie in that the agency can be quickly established and operative and can also have the flexibility not alone to assess, co-ordinate and expand existing activities to make a distinctive contribution in their own right towards alleviating the problems of youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>I propose to appoint a board of 11 members to direct the agency's operations. Two of these would be representative of employer organisations and two of youth interests.  In addition a representative from the Ministers for Education and the Environment respectively will be appointed, also two members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and, finally, three board members including the chairman, will be appointed directly by me as Minister for Labour.  I am confident that this board can make a most fundamental contribution through directing the activities of the Youth Employment Agency towards fully realising the objectives for which they are being established.</P>
    <P>The memorandum and articles of association of the company will incorporate the following detailed terms of reference:</P>
    <P>(a)  To review the effectiveness of youth employment, work experience and training programmes with particular reference to their impact on disadvantaged youth;</P>
    <P>(b)  to extend existing youth job creation, training and work experience programmes, while also providing for increased penetration for such programmes among disadvantaged youth;</P>
    <P>(c)  to arrange for assistance to be given to voluntary, social or community organisations to provide employment for young people where this is not possible under existing programmes;</P>
    <P>(d)  to arrange assistance for young people with the establishment of an enterprise in areas other than those in which existing bodies, for example, the IDA, county development teams and AnCO, operate; in particular the <Col N="1299" /> agency should promote, through education and publicity, the concept of self-help and enterprise amongst young people, either individually or in co-operative endeavours;</P>
    <P>(e)  to carry out and administer youth employment and training schemes where there are gaps in existing programmes;</P>
    <P>(f)  to co-ordinate and integrate the various schemes, ensure there is no duplication between them and, in this connection, to set general standards for the various schemes in relation to such matters as the ages, wages and allowances of participants;</P>
    <P>(g)  to identify areas outside the scope of existing programmes into which Government aid to young people could be extended, for example, agriculture and other primary activities;</P>
    <P>(h)  to consider the possibility of improving the access of unemployed young people to a range of educational and training courses in the private and public sectors possibly by means of a voucher scheme for eligible youth;</P>
    <P>(i)  to submit views, as appropriate, on educational policy and its effectiveness in preparing young people for working life.</P>
    <P>As regards the detailed activities of the agency, this will be a matter for decision by the board.  The composition of the board, representative as they are of a broad spectrum of society, will put them in a position to devise and implement new programmes where existing schemes are deficient.  The proposed terms of reference leave scope for such an approach.</P>
    <P>Equally important is the need to maintain and, indeed, improve the quality of existing schemes as they are expanded.  I regard this as being one of the central roles to be entrusted to the agency.</P>
    <P>I can see scope for the agency to take new initiatives in a number of areas.  For example, there are many new areas of social and community work emerging. <Col N="1300" /> The agency could take the initiative in looking at young peoples involvement in the growing field of child-care services, home care for the aged and similar activities. Assistance will also be given with the development of enterprises.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the question of new initiatives by the agency, I would like to refer to the assistance which the agency will give to local areas and rural areas. The register of young job seekers prepared by the NMS will indicate the areas where excess labour exists and where there is a need for assistance for young people.  The agency will then arrange for programme sponsors to come forward with the necessary programmes.</P>
    <P>I could envisage here the local organisation of an integrated series of activities which take account of local circumstances, in particular building education and training elements into all programmes including those now providing only short term employment.  This will involve cooperation between, for instance, local authorities, programme sponsors and VECs.  It is fair to say that existing schemes and arrangements do not cater for local areas and there is a clear need for the type of overall approach that will result from the activities of the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>The agency will also help rural areas. One of the terms of reference is to identify areas outside the scope of existing programmes into which Government aid to young people could be extended. Under this heading, I anticipate a concentration on employment in agriculture and other primary activities.</P>
    <P>In carrying out their activities the agency will, of course, be in continuous consultation with development bodies, including regional and local development bodies.</P>
    <P>The overall objective is to equip young people to enter working life, and to take emphasis off &ldquo;make-work&rdquo; schemes.  The agency's composition, and their ability to take an overview of the whole area of the transition from education to working life, put them in a unique position to make improvements to existing schemes and to devise new programmes.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also for the collection <Col N="1301" /> of a 1 per cent levy on all income.  It is my intention to devote proceeds of the levy as far as possible directly to the Youth Employment Agency in the normal manner.  I will make funds available to the agency following their submission of an annual outline programme to the Minister for Labour and subsequently following receipt of regular progress reports.</P>
    <P>The subhead in my Department Vote will also contain a provision covering the direct channelling of funds to youth training and employment programmes with the sanction of the Minister for Finance. This provision is intended to cover any difficulties which may arise in channelling funds to programme sponsors in 1982.</P>
    <P>I intend, for a number of reasons, to finance both the existing schemes catering for 20,000 young people and the additional schemes for a further 20,000 young people from the proceeds of the levy.  I considered financing the existing 20,000 figure from general taxation and the additional 20,000 from the levy.  I can say immediately that I cannot accept this proposition.  Such an approach would quite simply waste money, lead to a large bureaucratic structure and would, worst of all, lead to confusion about what we are doing.  I want a co-ordinated approach between what has been done in the past and what will be done in the future.  My present proposals are for a new start that will be cost effective, avoid duplication and give the best value for money.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Government's programme it is intended to defray the cost of the operations coming within the scope of the Youth Employment Agency through the medium of a 1 per cent levy on all income.  This 1 per cent charge will be collected by means of an appropriate increase in persons health contributions and the machinery used to collect the health contributions will also be used to collect the levy.</P>
    <P>Three different types of income are covered, referred to in the Bill as reckonable earnings, reckonable emoluments and reckonable income, all of which will be defined by me in regulations which <Col N="1302" /> will follow the precedent set in the case of health contributions.</P>
    <P>Briefly, all income to be levied will consist of income which is assessable for income tax.  Reckonable earnings will cover income from insurable employment. This category refers to the PAYE sector.  Reckonable emoluments will cover income from non-insurable employment and from occupational pensions. The non-insurable employment category refers to the self-employed, certain farmers, directors fees and so on. Reckonable income will cover income from all other sources such as income derived from the profits or gains from farming, income from investment and so on.</P>
    <P>Certain social welfare recipients will be exempt from the levy as will medical card holders who are not in employment, while for those card holders in insurable employment the levy will be paid by their employer.</P>
    <P>In addition, an amendment which I introduced in the Dáil yesterday excluded other social welfare payments now liable for health contributions.  Preliminary consideration is being given to exempting low-paid workers from payment of the health contribution.  Whatever is decided in that instance will be taken into account in deciding liability for the youth employment levy.</P>
    <P>In view of comments made by certain Opposition Deputies in the Dáil yesterday, I would like to emphasise in that section 15 of the Bill, which remains unchanged since the original drafting, makes it quite clear that the levy applies to personal income.  Corporate profits, not being liable to the health contribution, are not covered by the levy.  Personal income which is derived from profits, such as dividend, and income for investments, will of course be covered.</P>
    <P>A levy of 1 per cent on all incomes covered by the health contribution, with certain exceptions for medical card holders and social welfare payments, is expected to yield £63 million in a full year and £40 million from 6 April 1982 to the end of 1982.  Between April 1982 and December 1982 we would expect to receive £40 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> Social Fund receipts will depend upon the mix of programmes carried out by the agency.  In brief, we obtain from the Social Fund 55 per cent of our training costs and £11 per week per worker on a work experience job programme.</P>
    <P>I have given detailed consideration to the question of having a youth employment fund as suggested by some Deputies in the Dáil.  I rejected this idea, however, on the grounds of the complex accounting procedures involved and also because funds would not become available until somewhere towards the middle of 1982. I intend to have the agency in operation long before that date.  The method of financing which I have adopted is simpler. It provides for the payment of the levy on reckonable earnings and reckonable emoluments to be paid into the social insurance fund and from there to be paid to me.  Levy on income other than reckonable emoluments will be paid direct to me.  I will pay all the money into the Exchequer and it will become available to the agency in a subhead in my Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>The argument was made in the Dáil that the levy is an additional tax.  I would emphasise that the overall level of direct and indirect taxation will be set by Government in formulating their budget.  The existence of the 1 per cent levy will be taken into account when this is being done. In this sense the levy is not an additional tax &mdash; it is a positive step taken to identify a given amount of revenue as being devoted entirely to the important task of combating youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>The use of the moneys raised must be taken into account in looking at the impact of the levy.  I intend to improve the concentration of available resources on those most in need &mdash; young unemployed people in our poorer areas.  By this means, along with the exemption of social welfare pensions and other payments from the levy, I am ensuring that the effect of this new measure will be progressive.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the variation of the levy.  This provision is designed to allow for a reduction of the levy at any time should the proceeds be greater than <Col N="1304" /> is felt necessary for the operations of the agency.  Such a situation would come about with a reduction in the extent of the youth employment problem.</P>
    <P>I would add that an increase in the levy above 1 per cent cannot occur unless the Bill is changed in the Dáil and Seanad. The variation can only be made downwards.</P>
    <P>I accept that the agency will not solve all the problems of youth unemployment. There is, of course, the need to do all we can in the normal way to increase employment and so provide additional permanent job opportunities for our young people.  We will continue and intensify the traditional forms of job creation and our efforts to increase the productive capacity of the economy through increasing competitiveness.  On top of this the Government will be taking a major initiative in the establishment of a national development corporation soon. This corporation will be a major asset in the development and expansion of productive employment.  While the agency will be training and investing in our young workforce, the corporation will be ensuring that the exploitation of stable commercial opportunities in either the private or public sector will not be constrained by under-capitalisation or other considerations.</P>
    <P>There is a need to develop our manpower as well as to develop our capital structure.  Manpower is the area where we have a competitive advantage over other EEC countries.  Our young people are our future workforce and, as Minister for Labour, I am proud to have the opportunity of taking a new initiative in the development of this manpower.  The Youth Employment Agency, through increasing and improving the training, work experience and other job-creation opportunities available to our young people, will enhance our work force, make it more competitive and increase its earning potential.  This must be seen not only in the traditional sense of improving our position as a potential location for new industry.  The building up of the skills of our young workers will of itself contribute to job creation by our own people.  The work of the agency will, <Col N="1305" /> I hope, bring about an increase in the number of young people who have the capacity to start, manage and succeed in their own enterprises.</P>
    <P>These are the objectives of the Bill and I hope that the Senators will be able to add to the ideas and the work that will be done by the agency.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome sincerely the Minister to this House.  Though I am convinced that the Minister has the interests of youth at heart, I am concerned that we might be creating another monster and in the end have no better service for the children or the youth of this small country.  Is this Bill going to co-ordinate all the existing systems like AnCo, Manpower and services which the IDA might at the moment have for helping in the field of youth? Will it go further and take over all the youth services as we know them at the moment?  At present, of course, we have money from a Department other than the Department of Labour.  I am referring to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>At this point I ask the Minister for Finance, if he intends cutting back &mdash; as seems to be his style &mdash; not to do so in the area of youth services.  Though I have never been around the table of Government, and my chances of ever being there are rather slim, I would ask the Minister for Finance to give to the Minister for Labour the money he needs to look after, to give service to and back up to the youth of this country, on whom we put such emphasis.  We quote every week at meetings the numbers of people under 25 years of age.  It suits us at times to do so because we are actually talking about the number of votes in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Senator living near a centre, that the Minister visited last week, AnCO in Shannon, I still have reservations about the AnCO apprenticeship scheme.  In my 25 to 30 years in public life, but more recently because people are coming to me more, I have found difficulty in getting some of the youth, whom I know the Minister is concerned about, into AnCO. I am talking about youth I could stand <Col N="1306" /> over, who should have been taken into the AnCO centre for apprenticeships. Recently I have found also that having done the apprenticeship some of these boys and girls find a lot of difficulty in getting placements after coming out of the AnCO centre.</P>
    <P>I will make just a reference at this point to the NRB because it is a field in which I have directly served, totally as a voluntary worker for a long time.  I was glad to see that the percentage of placement in that section went up in the last year by 30 per cent.  The interesting thing about these young people, who have the unhappiness of not being too well and have to be placed, is that they have taken the initiative, maybe with my assistance or with somebody else's, have been placed and have come out quite well because of being given a chance.  We have been able to place them in jobs directly afterwards.  It might be important to say this.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware of it.  While I am referring to those people and while I do not want to single them out from the rest of us &mdash; this is something on which I have strong views &mdash; maybe in his own time the Minister might ensure that we have an additional scheme to deal with that particular section of youth.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what will become of the £200,000 which the Minister for Finance has announced will be available?  Will there be £500,000 next year?  I have close association with the youth services.  I went into that field when it was not glamorous or vote-catching.  I decided to do this a long time ago, when they were really pioneering, when people went into the youth field to help these kids who had problems.  Will this Bill swallow up the funds that come directly for the reconstruction of youth centres as I know them down in the country?  I have personal experience of the one in Ennis. If I am not making myself clear I will speak to the Minister about it again.  I am a little worried that, because of the tremendous voluntary commitment by the people in an area &mdash; again we have the situation where in one area there is total commitment to deal with this problem and then in another area there is not and I accept that the Minister has to make <Col N="1307" /> laws for all the country &mdash; this Bill might be seen, because perhaps it has not been explained to them up to now, although they may understand more clearly when the Bill becomes law, as a voluntary withdrawal from this service.</P>
    <P>My only son qualified as a teacher and, rather than go into the classroom straightaway, he went into the youth field I am referring to.  He worked at half the salary for four years because of his total commitment to youth and to the problems as he saw them.  Another mother might say, &ldquo;Look, you just get in there and teach&rdquo;.  I did not do that.  I let my son do his own thing.  I have no regrets because he gave a lot to them.  When the Minister brings in legislation will he knock out of the field this kind of person who is serving directly with the child or the youth that he seems to be concerned about?  Will he knock that person and the people who work around that particular person?  I might be swinging away from the Bill now but somebody will correct me if I am.</P>
    <P>I have felt that our educational system for a great many years, and indeed under my own party's Governments, has put too much emphasis on the academic side of education and not enough emphasis on the vocational or the technical schools, as they were known down the country.  I have advised boys and girls, after the intermediate certificate, when I saw their standards, to move into the vocational schools rather than head for just one honour in the leaving certificate and have no job after that.  I am glad to say that we have at long last educated ourselves and the public to accept the tremendous role that vocational schools have played in this country.  In recent years I have been proved right that we did not have enough people with technical or vocational education and had too many academics.  This is correcting itself and I think we may now be heading for more of a balance.  I ask the Minister to tell us how many he will appoint to the board.</P>

      <P>The Minister is the boss <Col N="1308" /> regardless of what names come before him.  I accept that there is a National Youth Council of Ireland and there are all these various bodies.  I understand the Minister is a very busy person but maybe there is somebody in his Department who might be good enough to take a look at who his three nominees should be.  I find that sometimes there is a dreadful gap between the man at the top, who is trying to administer something, and the person in the field who is actually working out what Ministers try to bring in in a Bill. which may never work out the way he originally intended it to do the day he initiated the legislation.  I think the Minister understands what I am saying.</P>
      <P>A very hard look could be taken at career guidance in our schools, because we do not have a proper career guidance system.  I have girls coming to me every day hoping to get into the field of nursing, and I find that they have not done science and chemistry.  Of course, you have to have science and chemistry now to get into any of the hospitals.  I know it is not the Minister's Department but we are talking about youth and we are talking about giving them jobs, so he might talk to the Minister for Education about taking a look at the career guidance system that exists at the moment.  As a public representative I am certainly not happy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government have decided to establish without delay a youth employment agency.  This is getting back again to what I said earlier. Does this mean that the Minister is putting all the present services in the youth field under this Bill?  I have already referred to the voluntary and social community organisations and totally committed people.  That is the only way I see it at all levels, having served for such a long time in the mentally handicapped field. I resent any member of my party or any other party bringing politics into that particular field.  I would like to feel that we would not play politics with this very important Bill we are discussing and I do not intend to do it.  I think I have said what I mean.  I may not have said it in the fashion that Senators Gemma Hussey and O'Connell would, but I have said it <Col N="1309" /> and I will come back again, possibly at a later Stage.  The Minister might take note of some of the remarks I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. G. Hussey Mrs. G. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. G. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak very briefly in welcome of this Bill.  First of all, I would like to echo other Senators in welcoming the Minister to this House for the first time.  It gives me particular pleasure to do so as he is a constituency colleague of mine, I congratulate him on the work he is doing so energetically and I wish him well with it.</P>
      <P>This Bill, it seems to me, is an imaginative and timely one.  It is an immensely practical measure and is one which initiates a new organisation and, at the same time, co-ordinates what has already been done in this field.  Such co-ordination is manifestly necessary for various reasons which the Minister stated.  He mentioned some of the extremely well-meaning and indeed practical work done by the National Manpower Service work experience programme, by AnCO's general training programme, by the temporary grants scheme of the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment's environmental improvement scheme.  These are all very good schemes started at different times, as the Minister said, to meet particular needs. It is manifestly time that co-ordination was begun in all these efforts.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an in-depth speech and there is not much need to go into too much depth at this Stage of the Bill.  I would like to make a few remarks about the prospect of unemployment as it affects young people.  Nothing can be so worrying to society in general as the prospect of any kind of hopelessness setting in among young people.  This is a very real danger for many young people.  It is damaging to themselves and, of course, damaging to the future social prospects and economic prospects of the country.  It must be a feature of unemployment which gives us enormous pause for thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this Bill, of course, we must recognise the unique Irish situation, the demography of Ireland and the fact that despite the envy felt by many European <Col N="1310" /> countries about our enormous young population and the richness that could give this country, in a time of economic recession as we are facing now it is an extra and an extremely severe headache. We have, of course, a young, well-educated population, which is eminently employable.  That gives us an advantage over many other countries. The situation is quite the reverse in West Germany where there is an enormous number of people about to retire or retired, and this is creating its own probleams. We have, among other problems, the challenge to face up to youth employment.</P>
    <P>It is right to do what this Bill basically sets out to do, to ask the community lucky enough to have an income to contribute to the future of the country in this very real and down-to-earth way. Because of the very difficult economic circumstances we must use our imagination to raise specific funds for this work. As if, indeed, the community needed an extra reminder, we had a very dramatic television programme last week about a Dublin suburb which laid bare very many unpalatable facts.  Among them were the results of unemployment among young people.  We heard of young people who, for want of stimulation, for want of some kind of pride in themselves or sense of achievement, roam around the streets at night seeking to destroy, who doss down in abandoned cars, who terrorise old people and bully young children.  These people fill us all with a sense of guilt, a sense of anger in many cases and a sense of helplessness.  We should also remind ourselves that if these young people get the habit of not working stagnation will occur, stagnation of willpower or stagnation of mental stimulation, which is an extremely serious long-term problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to one other major concept in this Bill, which I welcome very much, that is the concept of identifying a particular given amount of revenue from one area and directing it specifically to tackle another area.  It seems to me that this is an important and very much under-used concept in the general running of the State's finances and one which, I believe, should be very much <Col N="1311" /> developed.  It is a fact that people in general, and the business community in particular, feel a helplessness at the size of the youth unemployment problem. They see it as an intractable problem. They feel something should be done and they would like to do something.  They feel it is impossible to make any kind of real inroad into the problem.  They are worrying about the implications for the future of youth unemployment, yet they are not happy that the general taxation system is working in that specific area.  I believe that to have made this progress towards imposing this 1 per cent levy and directing it specifically to the Youth Employment Agency is the sort of road we should be travelling.</P>
    <P>That sort of concept could be used in other areas.  I hope that on other occasions we might see certain new capital taxation being directed specifically at poverty projects.  I would like to see this concept developed of taking a particular amount of income from a particular group and directing it towards another group and getting rid of vagueness and sense of frustration on the part of the taxpayer who cannot see exactly what is happening to his money.  However, because it is specifically raised for this purpose, it places an extremely grave onus on the Minister and the Government to make sure that this money will be efficiently used and will be seen to be used efficiently.  I am sure the Minister does not need me to tell him that.  He must be aware of it and ensure it is done right.  Because of this concept of directing specific money to specific tasks, this Youth Employment Agency will carry a lot more with it than just the work it will set out to do&mdash;it will carry a lot of our hopes about a new system.</P>
    <P>In passing through this House Bills setting up new agencies, we take the opportunity to make suggestions about the boards of directors of these organisations. It would be important that people of proven entrepreneurial skills should be included on this board.  The Minister mentioned the question of self-help and productive work.  It would be a pity if a board were to be set up which did not <Col N="1312" /> include one or more people who have shown themselves to be people who have developed skills and have created new competitive products, because this will be the absolute basic necessity for this country.  I take the Minister's point that one could include child care, home care of elderly people and so on in this scheme.  I would applaud that, but it must be specifically directed towards productive work.</P>
    <P>No discussion of youth unemployment generally should be concluded without a reference to the problem of young female unemployment and women's employment generally.  I would ask the Minister to give a breakdown of the figures he gave in his speech relating to the live register of youth unemployment for November 1981.  There were 36,839 persons under 25 years of age unemployed. I would like to know what the breakdown of that is as between men and women and what percentage of male and female employed that breakdown represents.</P>
    <P>Not only are women still grossly behind men in earnings in the workforce but they suffer a wider range of discrimination in the benefits available to them when they are unemployed.  Therefore, I strongly urge on the Minister, when he is appointing his board of directors, that a specialist in the problems of female employment and education be appointed to that board.  That would be an absolute essential on any board which sets out to tackle the problem of youth unemployment. The employment patterns among women are changing.  The employment demands of women are changing.  They must be recognised and faced up to.  I ask the Minister to remember specifically that fact when he is appointing his board.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill.  I hope all Senators will give it a welcome and pass it speedily through the House, because the Minister has said he hopes to have the agency's work begun very quickly.  I hope it will not be long before this House will be debating a report from the new agency and that it will be a report on which we can congratulate the Minister again, as much as we wish him well now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity <Col N="1313" /> to speak on this very important Bill.  In the main thrust of the Minister's speech I could not help but note that every second line is inextricably bound up with education.  He has, quite correctly, identified this and the problems which exist in the present educational structures <i>vis-à-vis</i> the large number of youth in the country today and the huge potential.  Many of us in public life from time to time stand up at dinners, social functions, cumainn meetings and so on and pay service &mdash; in many cases lip service &mdash; to the huge natural human resource that we have, the very large young population. It is only lip service and pious talk if there is not something very definite and concrete done about it.  We are quite unique in Europen in this particular problem. It is both a blessing and a problem. It is a blessing because it is such a huge natural resource which if channelled, utilised and fully explored correctly will lead to a great change of feeling in our country in the years to come.  If it is not channelled and utilised correctly the people who have responsibility towards young people will find we have failed.  There should not be any disagreement about the Youth Employment Agency Bill.  If one were to go into any street in Dublin today, stop people, do a mini-survey and ask people, &ldquo;Do you agree with giving 1 per cent of your income to provide jobs for young people&rdquo;, most of them would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  Perhaps this is a point for Committee Stage but I have a reservation about this whole system in regard to the exact amount of the 1 per cent levy which will go into the exact pigeon hole which will be labelled &ldquo;jobs for young people&rdquo;. I would like to put that on the record. When the Minister is replying perhaps he will give us more details of the precise nature of this.  I am anxious that there should be precise accountability in regard to the 1 per cent levy, which the people will be generously contributing, and know exactly where it will go.  It must go for the purpose intended and not into a giant purse from which it may be drawn for other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the lack of preparedness in young people for the transition from school to the workforce.  We <Col N="1314" /> all speak many times of this and about all its angles.  I referred in a previous debate, on education, to this matter with reference to the schools-industry link programme which was pioneered by the Manpower Consultative Committee during the term of a former Minister for Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  This was very welcome and I believe the evaluation process which is going on now into that particular programme and will soon be completed will prove that it was a most valuable process.  I have said before that I was involved in that scheme in a very direct way as a teacher in my home town of Athlone.  I was a member of the pilot project committee there.  It was most successful in that it helped to bring about a realisation among young people and among parents that industrial life was not something that was to be seen as a last resort for young people leaving school, that there were all sorts of areas of employment open to young people and that this was one that should be explored fully.</P>
    <P>This manpower consultative sub-committee will have performed a very valuable role if it reflects attitudes to industrial employment which will prove that there are areas of employment open to young people other than the safe traditional jobs that have been the norm in Ireland.  This is historical here and I expect it dates from post-Famine times. There has been an emphasis on the safe white collar jobs that will have the pensions, the jobs that will be nine-to-five and where the future is guaranteed.  We are at a crossroads now in employment and in life generally in Ireland with regard to this.  Just as the people who weathered the industrial revolution throughout Europe many years ago went through many crises, we too will have that experience before we come to grips fully with the existing situation.  There are not enough jobs for young people or for any age category.  It is a great crisis at the moment and the Minister has correctly identified that this is bound up with the whole question of unemployment, not just youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>All young people today are given a very fine education, thanks to the free <Col N="1315" /> post-primary scheme and the various other advantages that have accrued to young people.  The young people leaving school today are articulate and well read, they are very aware and very perceptive. This is as it should be, but because they are so their aspirations are high and we have encouraged those aspirations.  Then they leave school and go for training or for higher education or some other area of life and they find that suddenly they are not employable, even though they have been brought up to believe that you play, then you go to school, you work hard and get your exams and then you get a job.  Life is not turning out like that and the young people whose intelligence has sharpened and whose attitudes and perceptions have sharpened through their education will find their idealism very much let down.  I would fear for the channels that that idealism might be directed into if we do not try to fulfil their ambitions and their aspirations.</P>
    <P>Many of us talk about too much emphasis being placed on the academic side and say that there should be more emphasis on the technological side.  I fully agree and I have spoken many times this way myself but I would sound a cautious note here.  We must not forget that in the future there will be more and more leisure time and we must not lose sight of the academic side of education because it more than anything trains people to use their resources to develop their own characters and their own minds and to deploy themselves in various fields.  This will be very important in the era of increasing leisure we will be facing.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the existing agencies for youth employment are not doing their best or have been found in some way to be wanting.  I would think that this is not the case.  The Honourable Member of the House of Commons, Mrs. Shirley Williams, visited Ireland last year and came to our town and Senator Fallon and myself in our capacities as local representatives had the privilege of meeting her. She was with a work study group from the OECD countries investigating how Ireland coped with youth unemployment. I was very interested, therefore, <Col N="1316" /> on the eve of the Crosby by-election to hear her say on television that she had visited Ireland and had found the existing youth employment schemes here far ahead of other European countries.  Perhaps she was appealing to the Irish voters in Crosby &mdash; I do not know if there are many of them &mdash; but she did state it quite clearly and that this report would be coming out shortly.  She had found the Irish experiments very worthy of note by other countries and ahead of other European countries.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute to the Manpower agency, the consultative committee and the AnCO schemes for the progressive type of pioneering work that they have undertaken in those fields.  On the occasion of her visit, Mrs. Williams also spoke about the need for the development of initiative and enterprise in young people.  I notice that the Minister has also referred to it in his speech.  I would call it a fostering of the spirit of what we would call long ago &ldquo;sturdiness&rdquo; in people, a reliance again on their own spirit of survival and initiative.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a swing back to the idea that small is beautiful in business, in schools, in housing schemes, in every area of life because the large form has been found to be unwieldy and bureaucratic and not very much in touch with people.  I would like to see developed in young people a spirit of enterprise and entrepreneur-like skills, a development of those types of skills whereby they will see opportunities and ways they can expand themselves.  America has very much gone into this field and it surely is the land of the big.  If they are thinking small in educational schemes and work schemes it is very much to be noted and, perhaps, copied.</P>
    <P>I would echo the Leader of the House when she spoke about the need for parity in job opportunities for women and men and for young boys and young girls. When the Minister is appointing nominees to the board of this new agency I hope he will consider appointing some women to it, not women for women's sake or not token women but women because they have many of the skills that will be needed.  After all, they are over <Col N="1317" /> 50 per cent of the population.  Any woman has a range of skills; she is a time and motion expert, an educationalist and an activist and all sorts of things.  I would hope that the Minister would look at this aspect when appointing nominees to this board.</P>
    <P>Still in the field of education but bound up with the employment agency, I note that recently the Shannon curriculum development unit have been involved in a very important community-based learning project.  The programme has been called the &ldquo;spiral&rdquo; programme and it aims to develop in young people the spirit of enterprise and sturdiness that I have spoken about and which is so very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently when speaking in the Dáil on these and other related matters said that AnCO were now recognised as a European body with powers to initiate young workers' exchange schemes.  Youth mobility is a very important aspect of youth employment and as we are more and more part of Europe so we will be more and more into this field. Whilst long ago emigration had a nasty ring about it and if you left the shores you usually did not come back, the future mobility of young workers and workers of all types within the European Community would be a very great advantage in learning what is going on in other countries, coming back and applying what has been learned to this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the main thrust of the Youth Employment Agency.  I would ask that the 1 per cent levy be deployed precisely into the employment of young people.  I note that we will be receiving a report on this Youth Employment Agency in time to come and therefore we can monitor it. I would not like it to go out from either House of the Oireachtas or from anyone that this is the panacea for all youth ills. It cannot be because there is no immediate remedy.  Neither would I like it to go out that what has gone before in the field of youth employment has been to no avail.  I have not said that anybody has said so but a general trend could be identified as meaning that.  In my own capacity I have found the Manpower agency and AnCO of wonderful help in the training <Col N="1318" /> of young people.  I would think there is closer liaison to be built up between the Department of Labour and the Department of Education in this field.</P>
    <P>One reservation I would mention.  The Minister said that this 1 per cent levy is to be taken in accordance with the precedent set by the health contribution and that corporate profits are to be exempt. I wonder why corporate profits should not be taxed for this purpose.  Perhaps it is something that can come up on Committee Stage but it is a point which struck me.  The axe is going to fall very heavily on the middle class in the very near future if we are to believe all the speeches that we read lately and I wonder why corporate profits could not be taxed.  Businesses have a very great stake in this country and I am sure if approached they would be more than willing at least to investigate the idea.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects one could talk about in this debate and I hope on Committee Stage to have the opportunity to speak again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and take this opportunity to congratulate him most sincerely on his performance as Minister in the period he has been in office.  I would like in particular to congratulate him on the speed with which he has got this Bill before the Oireachtas.  It is a complicated measure and has major implications and certainly it is difficult to think back to any previous occasion when a measure of this kind came from inception to implementation as rapidly as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of youth unemployment is, as we have all said, profoundly serious. Indeed in many parts of the country it is reaching the point of crisis.  As the Minister said, almost 37,000 people are registered as unemployed, according to the latest figures.  Presumably there are some thousands more in this situation, given that at least some young people do not register as unemployed because it is not financially worthwhile to do so.  There is, of course, a constant flow of young people off the register and it is difficult therefore to put any accurate figure on the level of long-term unemployment <Col N="1319" /> among young people, but one must assume that it is rising and that the figure of 12,000 long-term unemployed among those under 25, which the Minister quoted in his Dáil contribution, will tend to rise.  In addition there are many thousands of young people in employment which comes nowhere near meeting their expectations as citizens and in which they find themselves subject to abiding frustrated.</P>
    <P>The result of all of this is not only the obvious loss of potential production to the economy which unemployment represents.  It is not only a personal crisis in the lives of the individuals concerned, which is self-evident, but it is a problem also of the potential for substantial and dangerous alienation among young people from their own society which, in turn, has the potential to develop into a major social crisis, particularly in our urban areas, some aspects of which we have already noted and are aware of.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us represents an urgent response to this set of crises.  It is not a final solution in the sense that it does not purport to offer lifetime employment to the young people who will benefit from it.  That is not its intention.  It is, however, an indication of seriousness on the part of the Minister and the Government about the problem of youth unemployment and it is an attempt to begin to come to grips with it before the potential social crisis falls upon us.</P>
    <P>If the agency is to succeed &mdash; and I believe it will &mdash; two preconditions will need to be meet. One is that the agency must work within the context of the proposed national plan, that is to say, there must be some linkage between what they are doing and what the Government are proposing in terms of the creation of worthwhile long-term employment for the people concerned.  It must therefore, be linked into the whole business of national economic policy.  Secondly, it is important &mdash; and the Minister also alluded to this very clearly &mdash; that the projects engaged in, apart from the training projects, must be concerned not simply with taking people off the live register but must attempt to provide employment <Col N="1320" /> which is seen as being valuable by the people concerned, whether in terms of value to society or in terms of adding something to the wealth which we create as a people.</P>
    <P>I like particularly the idea of support for co-operative enterprises organised, run and developed by young people in the commercial area.  That is a profoundly important idea and I hope the agency will place great emphasis on supporting the development of this kind of enterprise because it has the merit not only to provide support and employment for young people but, presumably also, to enable them to make a useful contribution to wealth creation.</P>
    <P>The only concern I have noted on the part of the Opposition has been to do with the 1 per cent levy and I note that the Leader of the Opposition Party in the Dáil said that this was a form of taxation and he had great reservations about it as a result.  It is a form of taxation and quite straightforwardly so.  It is earmarked taxation and it is less than honest of him to suggest that it is possible to engage in this kind of operation without putting a price on it.  Apart from the need to fund the operation, it is important that those of us who are employed realise that the question of coming to grips with the problem of youth unemployment, or unemployment generally, is not cost free. Therefore it is valuable in bringing home to us that there is a price which we all must pay if we are to come to grips at some point with the problem of unemployment generally.  His concern at the levy was rather cheap and I do not know whether he pressed an amendment last night or voted against it.  It seems to me to have been a less than honest contribution on his part.</P>
    <P>The Minister is absolutely right to place this agency in the context of broader economic policy because, at the end of the day, the agency can make a contribution of a temporary kind only to providing employment for individual young people.  It cannot of itself provide them with long-term worthwhile employment. Therefore it must be seen as one part of a range of economic policies designed to come to grips with the problem <Col N="1321" /> of joblessness.  The question is how we go beyond this and come to grips with long-term worthwhile employment for an expanding population in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to throw out a number of proposals, none of which is particularly novel but which seem to me to be critical if we are to link this agency into the broad business of economic development and planning for full employment.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in particular which seems to me to be worth referring to again.  I am aware that most conventional economists would not see much point to it&mdash;but as time passes we may have to turn to something contained in the Labour Party's election programme, despite the fact that it did not meet with any resounding response from the populous generally.  It is worth mentioning again as something which is not of direct relevance to the Minister but presumably of relevance to the Government.  A crucial macro-economic problem we have now is the balance of payments deficit and unless this is corrected swiftly and substantially we do run the risk of the devaluation of the pound with all the adverse economic circumstances which would flow from that.</P>
    <P>The Protocol to the Treaty of Accession to the European Community negotiated in 1972 should be invoked for the first time here and should not be left dormant.  The Protocol was negotiated in response to Labour Party's criticism that the economy could not withstand full free trade in the short-run.  It provides for possible exceptional measures by this country to protect our vital economic interests in the event of a serious economic crisis.  It is difficult to conceive of a situation in which the economic crisis could be much more serious than it is now.  Therefore, the idea of the temporary import surcharge of 10 per cent on selected consumer goods from other countries in the Community is worth considering and I suspect will be even more worthy of consideration next year.  The import value of these consumer goods in 1980 was £1,100 million and such a surcharge would apply to about half of these imports and would last for one year only <Col N="1322" /> at the full rate.  It would be phased out over the subsequent years of the proposed national economic plan.</P>
    <P>The objectives behind this idea would be, firstly, to ease pressure on the balance of payments, which is a crucial requirement now; secondly, to generate a switch of demand in sensitive industries such as parts of the food processing industry, clothing, footwear, furniture and other household goods industries in order to protect jobs while domestic costs are being brought under control; thirdly, to prevent devaluation of the IR£ inside the EMS with the consequent inflationary effects which that would have, and, fourthly, to provide a source of revenue to the Exchequer in the short-run.  These derogations, if they were to be considered or pursued, would, of necessity, have to be agreed by the European Community. Given that the aims of the proposed national plan are to cut inflation, current borrowing and the payments deficit, the Community would look more favourably on this course of action than might otherwise be the case.  This proposal does not mean that I or Labour advocate an abandonment of the letter or spirit of free trade or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to imply that the problem of youth unemployment will only be dealt with in the long run through measures of this kind and that the present Bill is fundamentally linked to this and other matters, which I hope to refer to briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said by several speakers in the other House that we need to get down to the business of economic planning in a serious fashion.  I am pleased that the Minister for Finance said recently that it is intended to move on this matter in the first month of the new year.  This is of critical significance.  It is not possible to deal with the problem of employment in a small open economy such as ours without a clear commitment to economic planning, not of the kind which was par for the course in the sixties and early seventies, that is to say, planning which <Col N="1323" /> is concerned essentially with projecting forward outcomes on the basis of given policies.  Rather we should move towards directive economic planning.  In this regard, I welcome also the commitment of the Government to institute at an early date a National Economic Planning board and I would urge that this be done prior to the publication by the Government of their own planning objectives.  It is only by involving the relevant interest groups in the development of the plan itself that the prospect of success and of fundamental change in our approach to planning can come about.</P>
    <P>I would like to support Deputy Higgins in the Dáil when he said that we must begin to think about whether we can do things entirely differently in the area of economic policy.  Is it possible for us, for example, to jump through stages of economic growth on the classic model and to short-circuit many difficulties which have been experienced in other countries? Maybe this is possible, as I believe it is, and hopefully the planning board will be concerned with having a look at this too.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation will play a crucial role also in the area of providing viable long-term employment for the people whom this Bill is designed to help in the short-term. It is critical that the State become the motivating power in the development of industrial policy here.  I do not think the private enterprise sector, and certainly not the domestically-owned sector, is capable of providing the range and numbers of jobs which we require and we must face up to this reality.  We have to face up to this reality once and for all, and we have to unleash the National Development Corporation, adequately financed, within the context of a national economic plan and social control of investment as an alternative, complementary element to the work of private enterprise.  Indeed, it is questionable whether private enterprise exists in any meaningful sense, given the range of subsidies and incentives which are available to it now.  That, too, should be looked at.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two final points <Col N="1324" /> on how we might plan for unemployment. First we need to have a look at industrial strategy.  The Telesis Report is with the Government or with the Minister for Industry and Energy and I look forward to the conclusions which will emerge from the Government's consideration of this report.  It can be argued that perhaps our industrial incentive system is too liberal, that we are not getting value for money.  The parts of the Telesis Report which were leaked seem to imply this.</P>
    <P>We must undertake a fundamental review of industrial strategy within the context of the proposed national plan. We must face up to the reality of incomes as a deterrent to employment.  It is not the main deterrent to employment creation as is implied frequently by commentators, but it is a variable in this area.  In the kind of society we have, which is essentially unplanned, acquisitive and to do with the inter-action of self-interested groups, to achieve appropriate income adjustments over time is unlikely to happen, this is to say, income adjustments over time which are optimum from the point of view of employment creation.</P>
    <P>I would argue that the time has come for us to seek to politicise the trade union movement generally to the point where they begin to see the relevance of tradeoffs between income and other potential political gains.  That idea has been part of the thinking behind national income agreements over recent years and it must be developed and brought along.  It is probable, given a lot of persuasion, that we can reach the point where incomes will be traded against things like employment, like growing participation in ownership by employees in their enterprises, like housing programmes, like equitable taxation and eliminating poverty and so on.  That will happen only when the trade union movement is politicised and has political objectives.</P>
    <P>I heartily welcome this Bill.  It is a major innovation which is going to make a significant contribution to handling the short-term crisis we find ourselves in.  The measures it proposes will, indeed, be needed indefinitely for alternative groups, and are profoundly welcome. <Col N="1325" /> The Minister is absolutely right to place it in the context of national economic policy generally, that is to say, it is one part of a set of measures required if we are to get to grips once and for all with the problem of unemployment, particulary in the content of a rapidly rising population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has just come to my notice that I have been most discourteous. There has been a succession of Ministers here this week and I did not welcome any of them or congratulate them on their appointments.  If anybody felt I was being discourteous it was purely an oversight as a result of my inexperience.</P>
      <P>This is most welcome legislation.  However sceptical I may be about the capacity of our present economic order to deal with the fundamental problems in a society where some of the underlying assumptions of the market economy no longer apply, that is, that an increase in price will necessarily encourage extra production until you get an equilibrium between them, and energy will become progressively more scarce, energy is the staple raw material of our economy, and no matter what price is put on it we cannot produce more than is available. Land is another one of those things.  I may be sceptical about the general assumptions on which our economic order is organised, but nevertheless, the Bill is most welcome.  It is a Bill of what can only be described as noble objectives. The short Title talks about establishment, development, extension, operation, assistance, including financial encouragement, supervision, co-ordination, integration, either directly or indirectly, of schemes for the training and employment of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that somebody should talk about the experience of unemployment, particularly for a young person, because we tend to see it in numbers.  If any public representative stands up and talks about poverty and mentions the unemployed to a group of solid Irish citizens, the unfortunate reaction you will get in many cases is that most of them are dole scroungers living off the State, fiddling the dole, who could get work if they <Col N="1326" /> wanted to.  This is a particular myth which has been assiduously fostered particularly by spokesmen for industry, employers and those who control the decisions about investment and the direction of the economy.  When people talk about the disincentive benefit or value of unemployment benefit I can never figure out if they know value or the the rates of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  They pick isolated examples and generalise.  This contributes enormously to the personal humiliation of one who is unemployed.  The absolute devastation, especially for young persons, of spending a year or two years after they have left school unemployed and without a job is compounded enormously when this sort of appalling, prejudicial and bigoted headlines appear in newspapers regularly with the authority of people in society who do know better, of that I have no doubt, but who are taking the ball on the hop and trying to loosen up the labour market by introducing greater flexibility in terms of supply and demand, the cost of labour responding to the demand. Obviously, they see the welfare system as one cushion which protects people from accepting lower wage rates.  There is a widespread belief in our society that the unemployed are scrounging off society, that large numbers of unemployed people are drawing the dole and making a fortune.</P>
    <P>There may be some individuals like that because, unfortunately, we are not a society with the highest standards of honesty.  We tend to take things like financial matters a little bit easily.  Therefore, I am sure there is some dishonesty in this area.  However, the humiliation this sort of campaign has produced for young people is something nobody talks about.  A young unemployed person in the atmosphere and sort of hostility shown towards the unemployed, must feel that he has failed.  Therefore, any attempt to bring us beyond this sort of failure complex to give young people a sense of purpose is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The experience of unemployment, as our unemployment exchanges are organised, must contribute to this humiliation &mdash; the &ldquo;no loitering&rdquo; signs, the fact that <Col N="1327" /> they are never painted, the long queues, the fact that you sign a receipt before you get the money, a very interesting administrative practice which is fairly standard in employment exchanges, sign the receipt and you get the money &mdash; are all good ways of making sure nobody gets anything out of the way, but the personal humiliation involved is enormous.</P>
    <P>The Bill is most welcome in its objectives. Particularly welcome is the interesting idea the Minister put forward of encouraging young people to set up enterprises.  On the basis of experience of attempts to set up community-based co-operative enterprises, the agency will want to have an enormous amount of clout and be able to knock a lot of heads together.  I refer in particular to an experience in Connemara with the initial assistance of the Combat Poverty Programme. There was an attempt to set up a co-operative mariculture project which would have produced £9,000 a year for each family involved in west Connemara. The project was economically viable but never got off the ground because the various State agencies involved broke the hearts of the people concerned by referring them from one agency to another. This has been documented in one of the briefing documents made available at the Kilkenny poverty conference.  It is a scandalous indictment of the ability of our State agencies to co-operate with each other, to co-ordinate a project and to fund and facilitate a project in an area which had nothing before but which was trying to build a productive enterprise based on the natural resources of the area, that is, the sea.  It failed because local morale collapsed in the face of the incredible obduracy and inflexibility of various State agencies, not one of whom could accept they were responsible.  If this agency is to get involved in encouraging enterprise I hope it recognises that enterprise decisions must be reasonably well thought out and reasonably quickly taken.  At the same time, I welcome the emphasis on enterprise.</P>
    <P>Politicians, and I include myself, are getting more frightened of young people because they are living in a different culture. <Col N="1328" /> They have now virtually their own radio station or stations and the vast majority of young people listen to a different radio station from the older generation, with a different emphasis on news, current affairs and a much greater emphasis on less weighty matters.  My general impression is that most politicians do not understand young people. Going on the blandishments offered to young people, some people seem to feel that putting one or two nominees of the National Youth Council on a State agency will appeal to all young people. The majority of young people do not belong to youth clubs or anything like that, particularly the vast majority of disadvantaged youth.</P>
    <P>We are becoming a nation of two cultures, an older culture and a youth culture, and we will have to realise our young people see the world very differently, see the world in different values and from a different perspective.  They are immensely and almost universally cynical about politicians, the political process and the capacity of politicians to understand them, to respond to them, and to produce anything that can do anything about their present dilemma of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is a particular indictment in our society that we do not know the scale of youth unemployment.  The National Manpower Consultative Committee &mdash; even such a weighty and prestigious body &mdash; can do no more than make a stab at the problem of youth unemployment.  All we know is the number of young people on the register.  For a large number of young people living at home it is not worth their while signing on because they would be entitled to about 70p a week after their income for living at home is taken into consideration.  It is a terrible indictment on us that we do not know how many young people are unemployed or how many young people are in need of employment.  The Minister said that that number should be identified better as a result of this Bill.  It ought to be an objective of the Bill to try to determine the numbers of unemployed young people.</P>
    <P>It is true that among our young people <Col N="1329" /> 24 per cent leave school at the age of 15 years or lower.  I cannot quantify this, but presumably they leave marginally illiterate, some almost totally illiterate.  They are not eligible for any sort of social assistance at 15, and they are probably not eligible for anything other than a short-term job which they lose as soon as they come to adulthood because when they were employed they were young and could be paid a much lower rate.  Once they come to the stage when they expect adult rates of pay, or marginally higher rates of wages, they lose their jobs. Obviously, they are unskilled, even in the basic skills of life.  I doubt if we even know where they are: in many cases they are probably lost without trace into the general economy.  Many of them, I suspect, end up in prison.</P>
    <P>We have to face up to a fact.  If we do not do something which is big, continuing and successful about youth unemployment we will have a problem of urban violence on our hands.  We have a problem of urban violence at present but it is not organised and does not involve confrontations with the State or its agencies. We have the problem of vandalism, thieving and that sort of violence, but sooner or later it will develop and extend into a confrontation with the State and its agencies by disaffected young people who have a right to be disaffected, who have no right to be violent, and who will see the State and its agencies as a further repression on them, adding to the accumulation of poor education, unemployment, poor facilities, the humiliation of the labour exchange and so on.  I do not think there is any point in pretending it will not happen or that if we do not talk about it it is less likely to happen.  We will have a problem of violence similar to, possibly more serious than because of the proportions in our population, what has happened in Britain if we do not do something now.  The objectives of this Bill would meet those criteria.  I have some reservations about whether the Bill will meet its own objectives, but it may well happen.</P>
    <P>I am very unclear about the procedure by which the good intentions in the Title will be translated into action.  Will the <Col N="1330" /> agency have funds and by the decision and the determination of where those funds will go, influence all the other agencies, or will it have direct legal authority to tell bodies like AnCO and various youth agencies and other people, what they must do?  The range of objectives and tasks being allocated to the agency is enormous.  I am not clear about how it is proposed to translate those objectives into action and I would welcome some elaboration on that from the Minister.</P>
    <P>If we are to have this agency and if it is to be able to translate those objectives, there is a danger that we will end up with another highly centralised body.  I am not clear what is proposed.  If this agency is to have between £60 million and £100 million for youth employment projects, is it the allocation of this money or the assessment of projects that it will control or will it have legal authority to tell people what to do?  I am worried that if it has all that authority, we will have another centralised agency through which various procedures will have to be passed.  I am not particularly experienced in reading legislation, so I may be misunderstanding it or I may have missed something and I would welcome correction. I should like to know if consideration has been given to how the objectives will be translated.  I would be worried that we will have another layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>There will be two representatives of youth.  I am sceptical about helping agencies which have only a token representation of those whom it is intended to help.  I am also worried that the representatives of youth might have very little in common with unemployed youth.  Unfortunately, I doubt if the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will nominate three young trade unionists.  My experience as an active trade unionist is that congress tends to be represented by middle-aged people from the senior bureaucratic ranks.  Perhaps the Minister, who has a detailed experience of the trade union movement might persuade them on this occasion to nominate young active trade unionists, or possibly to find somebody involved in the unemployed young people's action groups to serve on the <Col N="1331" /> agency.  Otherwise, the cultural gap, between those who are running the agency and those who are supposed to be helped by it, will be enormous.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the Minister's thinking as to the choice of representatives of various Departments.  A larger representation of youth would have been appropriate and representation of Government interests could have been cut back because I do not think a number greater than 11 would be functional.</P>
    <P>There was, and still is, a considerable controversy about the levy.  Some people suggested quite vigorously that the whole function of this levy and of the Bill was to draw together all the various agencies that are providing work experience and training schemes for young people and to fund them out of the levy and thus save the State the current expenditure on those agencies.  I was very glad the Minister mentioned that as a result of the Bill an additional 20,000 young people will be drawn into various schemes and projects. That goes some way towards assuring me.</P>
    <P>I was very worried when the Minister said that, as far as possible, he would devote the proceeds of the levy to the Youth Employment Agency.  There is that disturbing caveat: &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo;. Does that mean as far as the national budgetary situation will permit? Is it as far as the Minister for Finance will permit?  Is it as far as money is available at the time?  &ldquo;As far as possible&rdquo; could range from &ldquo;as far as administrative problems would permit&rdquo; or &ldquo;as far as the national budgetary situation would permit&rdquo;. I would like to know what &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; means.  Does it means as far as administrative procedures will permit? I am very worried that we are setting up an agency to spend money that is already being spent, that we are raising revenue to pay for what is going on at present.  I do not understand how much money this agency will have at its disposal.  There are about 20,000 young people currently benefiting from various schemes and the Minister tells us another 20,000 will benefit from the schemes which he hopes will spring from the new agency.  He mentions £60 million in a year.  If the number of <Col N="1332" /> young persons involved is to go from 20,000 to 40,000 are we talking about £60 million, £100 million or £30 million?  Is there a projection of the sort of funding the agency will have at their disposal? Will it be close to £60 million on current figures, or more or less?  I am worried because of the phrase &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo;. Does the Minister have at his disposal the costs of the schemes currently being utilised by about 20,000 young people?  I have no objection to the levy.</P>
    <P>If I should get the opportunity between now and the budget I could happily say that people in a certain income bracket, like most of us in this House, ought to pay more direct taxation because we can afford it.  There are one million persons in our society who are needy and poor &mdash; I am not particularly enamoured with words like &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; and &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo;; &ldquo;poor&rdquo; is better, straighter and is an attempt to spur people's consciences.  One million people are poor and those who are reasonably well-off ought to be expected to pay more.  I support this principle but I do not believe it will happen; I believe those in the middle will pay more.</P>
    <P>I am worried not about the levy but about the way it is intended that it should apply.  I do not think the exemptions are particularly generous.  People who do not have social welfare pensions, for instance, public service pensioners, people on low incomes and the vast majority of the female labour force in industry who earn on average about £70 per week, unless they qualify for a medical card, will be paying the levy.  I do not believe there are many pensioners who are well off.  Even people who have good private pensions are not well off.  It would have been more generous if all people over 65, and on pensions, were exempted <i>en bloc</i> from this levy.  There will be a lowering of living standards for the elderly as a result of this levy.  It would have been more humane, administratively easier and more just if everybody over 65, whatever income, were exempt. It would be preferable that the small number of people in that bracket who are very well-off would be included in the exemption rather than penalising people <Col N="1333" /> who are on the margin of £40 to £50 from various pension schemes and so on.</P>
    <P>That is my view.  It may not be as radical as people expect but I believe old people, whatever their income or their living conditions, have enough problems without having to worry about further State levies.  I do not believe the revenue collected from old people by this levy will be substantial.  It would have been simpler and more generous to exempt all people over 65, whatever their source of income.</P>
    <P>I understand the logic that as the levy is based on health contributions corporate profits could not be included.  That is logical but I do not think it is equitable. I know that dividend payments will be covered by the levy.  The argument from industry eternally is that corporate profits are used for reinvestment.  Are they? How much of them is going into reserves to preserve their conservative concept of an adequate level of reserves?  I am not persuaded that all undistributed profits are automatically reinvested by various agencies.  Financial institutions could have had a 1 per cent. levy on profits directed towards youth employment. They are vocal and influential whenever this is suggested.  In the interests of equity and patriotic acceptance of lower standards that those institutions tend to appeal for from the rest of us, such a levy should have been introduced.  I am not under any illusion that it would raise a vast sum of money but equity does matter.  It matters in terms of persuading people that an objective is being set and being pursued. Even at this late stage I would again suggest that corporate profits ought to be included in this 1 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's frequent reference to the problems of poor young people.  I know the Minister used the word &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; but, as I said earlier, &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; to a certain extent qualifies the problem and makes it sound less unpleasant than poor young people.  He mentioned a concentration of the efforts of the agency in poorer areas.  I would be grateful if he elaborated on that.  Has he thought out in detail how this should be done?  I suggest that a literacy scheme <Col N="1334" /> among poor young people would be one way of doing this in the sense that on a one-to-one basis the better educated unemployed young people could be used by the agency to work on literacy schemes with the less educated unemployed young people from the poorer areas.  I believe that literacy &mdash; this is an objective or a philosphy that is shared by most of the revolutionary movements around the world &mdash; is the first priority when dealing with all the problems of social decay.  It is extraordinary that the first objective of the Cuban revolutionaries &mdash; seeing that I have set myself up as an authority on the Cuban revolution &mdash;was to extend literacy.  It is also the case in Nicaragua, as Trócaire pointed out in their interesting document on that country where that target, to a large extent, has been achieved already within two or three years.</P>
    <P>The extension of literacy is an area on which this agency could concentrate some of its efforts.  Literacy schemes must be on a one-to-one basis.  I know there is a problem about designating certain areas as disadvantaged or poor areas, but it would be useful to designate areas, inner city areas, and indeed, on the basis of the NESC report, many of the large public authority housing areas, where there would be special emphasis and special funding and, possibly, greater flexibility. We must reach the real poor young people, those who are outside youth clubs, outside schools, outside the labour exchanges &mdash; I mean outside in the sense that they are not regarded as eligible or else are living at home and their income would be determined on the basis of what they are getting at home with the result they are not eligible for any substantial benefit.  An extraordinary level of flexibility, which is not characteristic, unfortunately, of most State agencies, is needed if we are to rescue that section of our young people who are virtually lost to society.  Senator Hussey earlier talked about the programme on Finglas.  I believe there are large numbers of young people in the position described.  If we are to rescue them, sitting down and saying: &ldquo;here is our agency, come to us&rdquo;, will not do.  If they are not rescued, they <Col N="1335" /> will provide the roots of much more serious problems in our society later.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  This is obviously complex legislation.  It was an achievement to get it into the Oireachtas so quickly and at a time when the Minister was taken up, at least in recent months, with other weighty matters.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill having great potential.  I am still not clear as to how the objectives will be translated into action.  I should like to be reassured that the levy will be devoted not just as far as possible, but almost entirely, to the project and that it is not just a means of paying for existing schemes with a bit more on top.  I hope the youth representatives on the agency will be really representative, at least indirectly, of unemployed youth and not of employed comfortable middle class youth.  I welcome the Bill.  I am very happy with it and I look forward to seeing the first report of the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill very strongly as an indication of the commitment of the Government in this area and also as an indication of their determination to press ahead with their joint programme and with the social priorities of the parties in the Coalition Government and their other supporters.  I should like also to welcome what Senator Honan said with regard to the importance of adopting a non-partisan attitude to a measure of this kind.  As a novice, and junior Member of the Seanad, I can say that we do have an opportunity in this House of adopting such an attitude and thereby benefitting the community as a whole.  I welcome the Bill because it is a matter of the gravest urgency that we address ourselves to the problem of youth unemployment.  We should do so not just because, as a number of speakers suggested, and, indeed, as I intend to say, it is a matter of the general economic and social health of our community but because in this area we are talking of fundamental human rights, the right to work and the right to an income, whatever the latter means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome these measures as an earnest <Col N="1336" /> of the Government's determination to attack the problem of youth unemployment. However, there are certain reservations that I have of a general nature. When I utter these reservations I want to make it clear that I am not in any way criticising the Government as such or the Minister.  This is, as has been said already, complex and very important legislation that will remain after the Government and the Members of the Seanad have gone.  It is fair to say without any adulation that it is a measure that will always be associated with the Minister's name, something which he will be able to pride himself on in future years.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the reservations I have.</P>
    <P>It is possible that those reservations may be misunderstood not through lack of ability on my part to communicate what I am trying to say or, indeed, lack of clarity in my own mind about these issues, but because some of the issues which arise out of this measure and in the general area have not really been addressed by anybody to any very effective extent in the mainstream of politics here.  The dimensions of the problem of youth unemployment are such that it will not be solved by conventional methods within the conventional social and economic system.  No Government in the history of the State has created &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; in any year or set of years the number of jobs which would be needed each year over the coming decade to keep pace with demand let alone remove the backlog.  Furthermore, we are faced with this task at a time not only of major recession but when very far-reaching technological changes are threatening the entire rationale of many traditional areas of employment.  Nor has anybody come up with an answer to the fact, known to all public representatives but increasingly documented in a scientific fashion by researchers, that a substantial proportion of our population, estimated varyingly between one-third and one-quarter of the total, have missed out on whatever affluence was achieved in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate my conviction that the Government are proceeding with <Col N="1337" /> the greatest urgency and priority in this matter within the context of what is permissible, in our political climate.  It is my conviction that conventional methods have failed in this respect and will continue to fail.  They will continue to be inadequate because our concepts of work, income and employment reflect neither socio-economic reality nor moral and philosophical necessity.  The concept of income which we have is tied to the concept of work.  That concept of work is tied to a concept of employment.  What precisely do we mean by work in this context?  I do not intend to argue this at great length or in very great detail because it might well be felt that this is more a philosophical question or a semantic one than one that may be addressed directly to the purposes of this Bill.  What do we mean by work?  Do we mean, in effect, a licence to receive an income, a licence to belong to what might be described as the incomed classes? What do we mean by employment?  Do we not mean by employment working for somebody else?  When we talk of an employee are we talking of somebody who is being employed and, therefore, is having, as it were, something done to him or to her?  When we talk of an employer do we mean that person, that entity or that organisation who is doing the employing and, therefore, doing something, as it were, to somebody else? What, in fact, do we mean by the concept of a job?  What do we mean when we talk about somebody not having a job?</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of this problem on which some other Senators have already touched is the moral stigma in our society of not having a job.  Those of us who have had any contact with people who have been unemployed for a substantial period, or even for a limited period, those of us who have studied the experience of areas such as the northern part of our country where some people are unemployed for very extended periods and, maybe, unemployed for their entire adult lives; will begin to appreciate the importance of this state of being unemployed as it affects the self-respect and the status in society of people in this situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> Reference has already been made in this debate to the criticism which is addressed by some of us to those whom we perceive as abusing the social welfare system.  Some of us, not necessarily the same people, also abuse those who at the other end of the socio-economic scale are seen as converting to their own use substantial sums of money and substantial resources, without apparently involving themselves in this thing called work whatever it happens to be.  What precisely do we mean by work?  Is it a task? Is it a licence to be part of the moneyed classes, part of the incomed classes in our society, to be part of those who have as opposed to those who have not?  Is it a licence to be respected by society?  Is it a licence to avoid that stigma which goes with the concept that somebody who does not work or who has not got a job is somehow morally responsible for that state and, consequently, is less of a human being than those of us who are employed?  When we talk about work should we not be talking possibly about a task to be done, but a task to be done for whom?  For somebody else so that they may reap the major part of the fruit of that labour for some amorphous organisation? Why should we work?  Should it be to get an income?  Should it be as an outlet for the particular vocational direction of our own personality?  Should it be for other people or for the community?</P>
    <P>It seems that what possibly could appear to be an abstruse, philosophical and semantic argument here is central to our whole approach to the problem of employment, not only the problem of employment but the whole problem of our economy and the manner in which that economy comes out of its present crisis.  Here I should like to refer to an experience which my family, my immediate neighbours and I have been encountering for some weeks and which we expect to be encountering for some time to come.  On the road where I live there are very ancient gas pipes which have now reached a stage where they must be replaced.  They are, one might say, redundant.  In the process of replacing those pipes the connection between my house and the sewerage system of the city <Col N="1339" /> became disjointed.  It took two weeks to get it reconnected with the rest of the city in this very important administrative, biological and social connection.  The road continues to be affected by this process. All the services which have any connection with the road are involved.  We imagine, without any exaggerating, that this process is unlikely to be finished before Easter.</P>
    <P>Before the Chair intervenes to ask me the connection between this chronicle of suburban Dublin and the Bill, I shall try to establish such a connection before he brings the full weight and majesty of his position upon me.  What I am talking about is the concept of work which we have.  I am talking about the concept of work in particular which public servants have, the concept of work which people in public organisations such as the corporation, the gas company have, the concept of how they should address themselves to the tasks for which they are paid.  If we were to bring consultants into this field to consider the job that had to be done they would probably say: &ldquo;That job could be done within a certain number of weeks, not months&rdquo;.  In the type of discussion we have in this area the next phrase after such a statement would be to suggest that all that kind of activity should immediately be handed over to the commercial sector, to the private sector, where it would be done more efficiently and more effectively.  That is not the issue.  That is not the point that should be made here.  The point which should be made is that there is very little incentive for people involved in that kind of activity to carry out the task that is before them with the greatest efficiency and expedition because, I suggest, they believe that were they to adopt such an attitude to work and to the completion of work they would be putting the security of tenure of their jobs at risk.  The consequence is that throughout the public service and every aspect of our common lives, in society we find situations in which work, in the sense of task, is not being completed with the greatest efficiency and expedition and with the least expenditure.  Consequently, the resources which we might be <Col N="1340" /> able to devolve towards the creation of more employment, towards the provision of social welfare on a larger scale, are wasted and a large number of our people are involved in what is in effect a misuse of our national resources, with the result that a smaller but substantial number of our population are at the same time deprived of their fair share of what is available.</P>

      <P>I shall.  I suggested it might possibly be misunderstood not purely as a result of my lack of clarity and ability to communicate but because we are talking about what is a fundamentally different approach to the basic concepts which lie at the whole provision of employment, a whole public and Governmental approach to the question of employment.  We have created over the course of the past couple of decades a society in which concepts of employment and jobs have a certain meaning.  We have, at the same time, allowed to develop in our society what is rapidly becoming a permanent sub-stratum of people who are deprived, under-privileged, poor and are increasingly alienated. In our approach to the provision of employment we have tended to concentrate on the creating of jobs.  It is interesting to note in this context that some years ago in any discussion on employment or jobs there was a concept of full employment which was frequently mentioned. That concept of full employment is not now mentioned to the same extent. It is interesting to speculate upon the reasons why.</P>

      <P>In the area of full employment one might mention the fact that during the course of the previous administration a certain number of jobs were created which had no real function in terms of the economy.  They existed purely for the creation of some statistics and the removal of others.  There is a <Col N="1341" /> danger that in any kind of measure we take over the coming years &mdash; this is a national problem which transcends the parties &mdash; we would approach the creation of employment, the meeting of this problem of unemployment in a similar way, that we would find ourselves for the convenience of statistics &mdash; it may be political convenience and expediency &mdash; creating so-called jobs which have no function, which make no constructive contribution to the economy, which do not meet the vocational need of people to find expression for themselves, and which divert an income of a kind to them but do not do so in the most constructive way.</P>

      <P>The Chair is very reluctant to interrupt the Senator but the main principle of the Bill is dealing with the Youth Employment Agency. While I appreciate that what the Senator is saying is relevant in some instances the Chair is of the opinion that the Senator is going rather wide.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair on this and I shall try to conclude as rapidly as I can.  However, the Chair, during the course of the debate, has permitted similar latitude and a detailed discussion which might be more appropriate to other Stages of the Bill. However, I accept the ruling of the Chair and will proceed to draw my remarks to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>We will make no serious impact on the problem or avoid the wider consequences of failure in this area until we move towards a public philosophy which is radically different from that which is the basis of the present consensus in our society.  Only when we start from the concept of human dignity and the right to achieve that dignity, and not from the other end of the scale, will we begin to move towards a solution which will be rational, democratic and just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road on which we are now travelling is a road towards disaster.  Senator Brendan Ryan has already referred to the kind of disaster that faces us, a disaster <Col N="1342" /> that has already struck the northern part of this country &mdash; and we would be very unwise to assume that the origins of their troubles are exclusively in tribal warfare or the conflict of different brands of nationalism.  What we have recently been hearing about Finglas and all the &lsquo;Finglases&rsquo; in the southern part of the country and what we witnessed on our streets during the summer are warning signals which we will ignore at our peril.</P>
    <P>We must welcome this Bill.  We must welcome the positive commitment of the Government towards youth employment and the commitment of the Minister himself to this.</P>
    <P>We must consider the Bill in the context of the economy, in the context of employment as a whole and in the context of the attitudes of our society towards employment.  We must realise that it is an interim measure.  Until we move towards a different concept, a different understanding of what faces our community in this area, in particular the demographic time bomb which lies beneath us, this measure will turn out to have been an interim measure which, gallant and brave though it may have been, will not have proved to be sufficient to cope with the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill very much.  It is about time that the people faced up to their obligation to create employment for what I regard as the best natural resource available to us, namely, our young people.  However, I have certain reservations about the way we intend to tackle this question just as I had reservations about the way it has been tackled up to now.  In the part of the country where I live there is a huge aluminium project in progress.  There are something in the region of 5,500 people working there, many of whom are young people just out of school.  This means that by the time they leave the job they will be 21 or 22.  This job is on a phase down and not one apprentice was taken on there.  A Government agency should become involved to ensure that young people would have the opportunity of working on a job of that size, getting the qualifications rather than having foreign investors <Col N="1343" /> and foreign people with modern methods taking over large jobs from us. Another example is the proposed gas link from Kinsale to Dublin.  We have not got the qualified people for this job.  The contract has been sent abroad.</P>
      <P>In regard to the agencies that are under our control at the moment, the National Manpower Service and AnCO, we have been falling down for years.  I brought this matter before Kerry County Council some time back in connection with the reconstruction of old or disabled people's homes and various other local authority projects.  It should be possible to employ young people in local authority projects and to give them the opportunity of acquiring a trade.  This would seem to be the key to full employment.</P>
      <P>The AnCO scheme falls very short where you have a crash programme of young people going into AnCO for perhaps six or 12 months and then being handed over to the National Manpower Service who try to find employment for them.  This is totally wrong.  The programme should last until the person becomes qualified or until such time as the agency could place that person in a position where he could finish the necessary training to give him a trade.  This is where we are falling down rather sadly. The faster we work at this the better it will be for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other areas in which a lot of research is needed.  For instance, there is a certain amount of industry in which there is fear of modernisation, where the trade unions and their members oppose any type of modernisation because of the fear of losing jobs.  I feel completely different about this.  If we become more efficient we will produce more, have more to sell abroad and in turn the industrialists will have more money to invest and, consequently, to create more products.  In this way employment would increase.  That has been proven many times in different industries and it is high time that the trade unions realised this, got on with the work and became more efficient.  I worked once in New York city where one million people were employed in the particular <Col N="1344" /> section I was in.  There was a lot of paper work involved and when computers were introduced there was hell to pay.  It was said that unemployment would increase and so on.  What happened was that much greater efficiency was achieved and now there are two million people working in that sector.  That just goes to prove that if you become efficient your ability to use the resources at your disposal increases and you can, therefore, create much more employment.</P>
    <P>Another area that would need to be tackled is the food industry.  The greater part of the food we consume is being imported.  We should not put all our interests into agencies such as AnCO or the National Manpower Service and so on.  We need to diversify our interests to see if, in the long term, we can create full employment.</P>
    <P>The levy of 1 per cent which is mentioned is a tax.  One cannot call it anything else.  The question is, will it stop at 1 per cent?  Next year it might be 2 per cent and the year after it might be 10 per cent. This will take the incentive away from the middle-class workers who are under severe pressure at the moment in trying to live a normal type of life.  While the middle-class people would not mind paying this levy of 1 per cent, I would not like to see it increased in the future.  Looking at the overall programme I would have to say that I welcome this Bill with open arms.  The Government of the day will have to take radical steps to ensure that our young people can stay in their own country, work in it and build it.  For too long they have been building up other countries for other people.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  As a Labour Senator I give it a particularly warm welcome because youth employment was an issue on which great emphasis was laid in the Labour Party's policy programme in the last election. It is clear from the response in constituencies at the doorsteps that this measure is one which addresses itself to a very real need.  Whether talking to youngsters themselves or to parents it <Col N="1345" /> was clear that there was both the sense of urgency that a different scale of approach was needed to this problem, and also that there was a willingness in the community to make a contribution, that those who were wage earners in the community should make a contribution by way of an investment in our young people and in opportunities for those young people.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his introductory speech gave an idea of the scale of the problem. It cannot be emphasised often enough that this scale, and indeed the whole nature of the challenge, is completely different from anything of which we have historical experience since we gained independence.  As the Minister said, around 65,000 young people leave our educational system annually and most look for work.  So we have a very significant number of young people&mdash;far more than there are people retiring form the work force, or than we could even in the best periods of our previous historic experience expect to create jobs for.</P>
      <P>Not only should we have a very clear perception of this new and dramatic challenge to us, but we should also be aware that the demographic structure in Ireland is perceptively different from the demographic structure in the other member States of the European Community.  This became very clear when the Commission of the European Communities proposed measures at community level in relation to youth employment and sought to assess the necessary investment for that. When the Joint Committee on European Community Secondary Legislation examined these proposals and related them to the Irish context it looked at the figures and had considerable assistance from the Department of Labour, from Manpower and from other agencies and reported on it.  What was very clear, but what still may not be perceived sufficiently either by politicians or by policy makers on the ground, is that whereas in other European Community countries the graph of growth of young people begins to taper off and decline in the mid-eighties&mdash;around about 1985&mdash;for us the pattern is one of constant growth right to the end of this century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> We are not talking about coping with a short-term immediate problem that arises out of whether one Government has borrowed more money than it should, or whether another Government is putting too much emphasis on foreign borrowing. It is not a problem of that dimension at all.  It is the greatest single challenge facing us as a people; facing us in the context of an island which up to recently had not experienced a growing population and which has a very high growth projection, carrying right on to the end of the century.  I particularly welcome this Bill as an important permanent measure established in the context of an overall structure&mdash;it is only part of that structure&mdash;showing a commitment to ensuring that we provide the resources, opportunities and the ability to contribute and to participate for the bulk of the young people who are going to be a factor coming through each year in very large numbers right to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the permanence of this measure.  It is not a short-term measure.  It is not an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to solve an immediate crisis.  It is a step being taken as part of what I believe is still only an evolving social policy and commitment.  I would very much like to see that social policy and that commitment deepened and strengthened.</P>
    <P>There have been&mdash;both in this House today and in the other House&mdash;a number of very lengthy and very interesting contributions on the problem for young people in our society.  Some have identified the two cultures that are emerging, whether it be a culture of an older population which still has all the reins of power and control over the situation and this growing young population which is not encouraged to or able to participate in the structures of society, and becomes alienated and develops its own norms and its own values; or whether it is the other way of looking at this cultural gap, the gap between those who are employed and those who are unemployed, there is a very large overlap between those two.</P>
    <P>What I believe we should do when examining the proposals in this Bill is to make the necessary commitment as a society to the structured opportunities for <Col N="1347" /> young people to have as a result of this measure the initial opportunity provided when they have been out of work for a certain period or are not involved in the educational system, but that the commitment to them continues, so that they do not just have a temporary facility and then they once again are dropped out of the structures of our society.  Therefore I would like to see this measure&mdash;I think this is the Government's intention&mdash;as part of an overall national and social plan, as part of a commitment by us to change by what I call a quantum leap: to change very dramatically the way in which we create opportunities and distribute income in our society.</P>
    <P>I am going to make a fairly brief contribution, because it is better to concentrate on certain aspects of what is a very broad and a very important and serious problem.  I am going to consider two issues.  One involves the considerable potential for creating greater equality between young boys and girls in the course of implementing this scheme, and the second relates to a defined area where I believe there is a great potential for employment creation within the scheme.</P>
    <P>Taking the first issue, the Minister has indicated who the directors of the agency will be when it is registered as a company under the Companies Act.  I would hope that there would be very close liaison indeed with the Employment Equality Agency.  I do not know whether it is necessary or even desirable to have a specific institutional link with the Employment Equality Agency but I would like to see very close working relations with the members and staff of that agency, together with a very deliberate policy that young boys and girls who are going to be encouraged to take part in and for whom this scheme is basically created will avoid role conditioning, resist conditioning by parents of children, resist children's own built-in conditioning of which they still get quite a lot in our school system and in their family backgrounds. There should be a very conscious attempt to use the considerable financial resources that are going to be allocated to make that kind of breakthrough.  Let <Col N="1348" /> us not only provide an opportunity for a job, with the discipline, skills and training that that may import, but also let us use it as a basis for creating a greater sense of equality of potential contribution, equality of assessment of ability, equality of responsibility by our young men and women.</P>
    <P>The second general area that I would like to focus on is the whole area of our physical heritage and environment.  It is a potential area of enormous significance in providing work, potential projects, in allowing participation by young people. This is an area which should be explored in depth for its job potential for young people.  I am aware that this is already being done in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  There was a report in this morning's papers of a project in Dingle, an archaeological dig being funded by the Employment Fund and involving young people.  That is a good example of the potential.  It is particularly significant because there is not a county in Ireland that does not have a rich archaeological resource and share of the national heritage.  It is one of the things that are reasonably dispersed throughout Ireland.  Therefore, it is possible to build on the physical assests that are there.  It is possible to create the kind of employment which interests young people, in which there is a considerable amount of job satisfaction.  It is satisfying to young persons.  Even if the labour involved is not very skilled, they would rather be involved in either an archaeological dig or a cleaning up of a particular building associated with our heritage, if it is related to the area they live in, the contours of that area, the historical perspective.</P>
    <P>Not only is there job potential in that, there is further job potential in recording the heritage: in drawing, in planning and in all kinds of areas where we do not have a proper record of our physical heritage. We do not have a proper indentification in some cases of the wealth of that heritage. All of this is very productive work because it leads to a greater sense of pride in a locality, the great potential for tourism, a greater sense of the potential of the locality.  Each county area could address itself to the potential in that <Col N="1349" /> county.  There is potential in each town for employment of young people in creating an awareness of its treasures, in having a record and having the opportunity to develop the potential of our physical and natural heritage.</P>
    <P>If that can be the approach which we adopt when seeking to provide opportunities under the Youth Employment Agency, I believe that we should also try to bring in another value.  It is a value again related to the kind of young people who are growing up now in our society, whom we should be encouraging to develop in this particular way.  We hope that the general level of education of our young people is better, despite a number of problems particularly at second level in our education system.  We have, as was mentioned in this House already this morning, far too high a percentage who drop out either before the age of 15 or shortly after their 15th birthday.  Nevertheless we are educating a population with higher expectations, a higher level of educational ability, greater self-awareness even self-confidence, and yet we do not allow them to participate actively in the exercise of some power in relation to themselves and some control over their own environment and future.</P>
    <P>It would be very important to introduce this element in the kind of projects and the kind of schemes that are evolved, which presumably will cover a very broad spectrum, with many different kinds of schemes and projects and work opportunities. In each case we should try to build in the value of active participation, of control even, if possible: control through co-operation, co-operative ventures, control through giving responsibility to young people for the work that they are doing &mdash; a responsibility which means that they are accountable for the calibre of the work, for getting the work done, for reporting on it, for analysing it, maybe for drawing conclusions for further projects from it.</P>
    <P>We must avoid any impression that we are engaged in the business of providing one-dimensional temporary jobs for morons or young robots, who are to come along and fill those jobs because we say so.  We must address ourselves to the <Col N="1350" /> aspirations, to the potential and to the enormous contribution that young people can make if they are allowed to make it.  If we have that as a basic value, if we are prepared to share power with young people in the course of giving them better employment opportunities, and a better chance to show the contribution that they can make, then we will be forced to share even more power and to listen to the young people in our country.</P>
    <P>This is absolutely vital because of the demographic structure, of the preponderant number of young people in our society.  If we do not share power with them, or give them a realistic way to participate, if we do not allow them to decide to do something differently from what we the politicians or bureaucrats might have thought was the way to do it, we will switch too many off altogether. We must be prepared to take risks in transferring substantial power and resources to young people themselves in their local communities, under some kind of overall control, supervision and accountability as we are talking about public money and the need for some monitoring.  This element is an important one: the value of exercising some responsibility and some influence on the project itself and on the job.  If we can import that value it is more likely that the various kinds of jobs and opportunities which are created through this Bill will be more long term.  It is more likely &mdash; if we are prepared to engage and harness the commitment and the contribution and the intelligence and the ability of our young people &mdash; that they will see a second stage and a third stage, that they will create out of the nucleus of what has been placed in their way, the possibility of further things.  We will develop the energy and the potential of our young people which at the moment we are so dramatically and seriously failing to do.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would hope that the Minister, or the Minister of State, would indicate when replying to the debate the ways in which the Government might see the possibility, first of all, of importing this deliberate element of planning for greater equality as forming part of the scope of the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Will it have a firm and well-thought-through commitment not just to provide jobs in a neutral context but to have a conscious awareness of the need to broaden the horizon particularly of girls and parents of girls as to the possibilities for them?  Secondly, could he indicate whether it is intended to explore in a very detailed way the potential of our physical and natural heritage for job creating and for instilling a sense of community, of history, of the potential of a locality, the resources of that locality in our young people as one of the many areas to be looked at?  Thirdly, is the whole approach to be framed on the basis of emphasising the value of power-sharing with young people who are going to be involved?  We must be prepared to take risks by handing over some control of the way in which a particular project will be carried out, rather than insisting that either the agency or a local authority will decide exactly how it will be done.  Wherever possible, let it be the young people themselves who have a very large say in how the particular work will be approached, how the particular project will be carried through.  Will they be encouraged to explore the potential, for further downstream or secondary activities and opportunities?</P>
    <P>All these values are extremely important if we are going to avoid what I would almost call the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; of dependency.  We must avoid the danger that this Bill, which has involved a commitment to public financing, financing from the Government's resources and financing more particularly by the citizens of this country through the levy on wages and salaries, turns into a measure which reinforces dependency, the danger that it would create short-term jobs of an unimaginative, unfulfilling and undeveloping kind for young people with the result that those involved would benefit only for the short-term period of the particular job but would not find that it gave them much scope for going on and participating actively and creatively in their own environment with future prospects for jobs or even for fulfilling work.</P>
    <P>Indeed, this raises a broader and <Col N="1352" /> deeper subject.  In the kind of future which is upon us, if I can put it that way, we are going to have to re-think the whole idea of jobs and employment as such, and we are going to have to develop the skills of our society and the contribution that can be made by individuals by placing more emphasis on ensuring that those skills and contribution can be harnessed, used and developed than we are on the old classification of those who have a job and those who do not have a job.  That is a broader issue raising a philosophical argument that perhaps could be made at another time or another place.</P>
    <P>I certainly feel that this concept of self reliance is the most important value to be incorporated on the ground, in the numerous ways in which schemes will be implemented and relied upon by either public or private agencies, by youth organisations, by voluntary bodies or whatever.  We must build in for young people themselves local control, direct participation in decision-making and in any future analysing, reporting on and evaluating and drawing conclusions from the way in which the various projects are or are not working, are or are not suitable to be further developed or to lead to other areas of work or development.</P>
    <P>If we have the courage to incorporate that as a very clear political value, then I believe we will be beginning to address ourselves to the enormous challenge of allowing our young people to share power with us in the Ireland which is their future.</P>

      <P>Before I deal with the provision of this Bill, I <Col N="1353" /> would like to say a few words about its history and background.  The Bill was presented to the Dáil by the previous Government in April of this year.  It passed its Second Reading in the Dáil on 5 May last and at that time was given a general welcome by speakers from all the main parties.  It lapsed when the Dáil was dissolved prior to the General Election. When the Government came into office the opportunity was taken to give very careful consideration to suggestions made in the meantime by various interests, including fire service staff interests, professional bodies and so on.  When the Bill was restored to the Dáil Order Paper at the commencement of this session a number of amendments were put down to meet such suggestions and generally improve the Bill.  The most important of these was the introduction of a new section 16 providing for the establishment of a Fire Service Council which would be empowered to provide services for and on behalf of the Minister and fire authorities.</P>
      <P>Two main factors have influenced the evolution of the present Bill.  One was the need to improve the organisation and powers of the country's fire service to meet present-day and future requirements. The other factor was the need to strengthen and update the legislative provisions relating to fire safety.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill need to be set in their proper perspective and to do so it would be useful to have a brief review of the development of legislation governing the fire service up to now.  In the nineteenth century fire legislation was largely confined to the Town Commissioners Acts and this had two important implications.  Fire fighting powers were the preserve of urban authorities and were adoptive rather than mandatory. Even though Part VIII of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 gave both urban and rural authorities an implied power to maintain fire brigades, this power was still adoptive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary object, therefore, of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, was to introduce a statutory requirement to provide fire cover right across the country.  This it did <Col N="1354" /> by imposing an obligation on all sanitary authorities to make reasonable provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in their areas and for the protection and rescue of persons and property from injury by fire.  Sanitary authorities were free to discharge this obligation either by themselves maintaining a fire brigade or by arranging with another authority to provide this service in their area.  The 1940 Act also laid down the basis of a fire prevention system by introducing the concept of a potentially dangerous building and providing for the service of a fire precautions notice in respect of such a building.</P>
    <P>Although the Fire Brigades Act, 1940 was a comparatively brief measure, it enabled local authorities to establish an effective fire fighting system and to operate considerable controls for the prevention of fire hazards.  Accordingly, although the present Bill proposes to repeal the old Act, its main provisions are being re-enacted.</P>
    <P>Much has happended in the past 40 years to warrant a radical review of fire service legislation.  Industrialisation has progressed on a scale never contemplated in 1940.  We have also witnessed vast technological change and we have in recent years seen the trend towards increased urbanisation and the growth in residential, service and amenity development consequent on our expanding population and increased economic activity. Another factor is that changes have taken place in the methods, scale and style of construction, including introduction of new building materials.</P>
    <P>All of these factors placed new and increasing demands on the operational fire service, in terms of fire cover, equipment and training and also increased the need for adequate standards of fire safety in buildings, especially where a risk to life might be involved.</P>
    <P>The need for a thorough assessment of the capacity of our fire service in the light of its increased responsibilities was recognised when the Minister for Local Government appointed a working party in November 1972 to advise him on the questions of fire resources, fire prevention measures, legislation, financial <Col N="1355" /> implications and on staffing and training arrangements.</P>
    <P>The main report of the working party was published without Government commitment in July 1975, and it contained 39 recommendations grouped into five broad categories: the operational service, fire prevention, staffing structure and qualifications, training and miscellaneous and transitional matters.  There were also five minority reports.  Action has been taken on virtually all of the recommendations of the majority report.  Most of them have been or are being implemented.</P>
    <P>The report made a number of recommendations relating to legislation.  It suggested a review of the fire fighting provisions of the 1940 Act, the placing of an onus on persons in control of premises to which the public have access to guard against the risk to life from fire, the need to have a comprehensive system of inspection and control of buildings and so on.</P>
    <P>An important recommendation in the report was the one which suggested that each local authority should prepare an assessment of the strength and adequacy of the local fire service.  During 1976 my Department asked local authorities to undertake these reviews and their reports which were received in the following years, together with the report on the fire service, provide the background to most of the provisions included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The reviews of course dealt primarily with purely local problems, for example, the adequacy of local arrangements, equipment, staffing and so on.  While the reviews are not always as comprehensive as might be required ideally, they have served their purpose in pointing the way in which the local services must be improved and developed.  My Department are following up with individual authorities points arising in the reviews. Generally the role of the Department is to advise, assist and encourage the local authorities as far as possible within the resources available to secure the necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>This co-operative approach, which respects the essential features of our local <Col N="1356" /> government system, was envisaged by the 1975 report and has been accepted by successive Ministers, rightly in my opinion. I mention this because an alternative suggestion sometimes heard is that the Department's approach should be to carry out sworn public inquiries into the manner in which many of the individual fire authorities perform their functions, to be followed by disciplinary and other actions as directed by the Minister.  I could not accept such an alternative approach.  I think the proper approach is the co-operative one indicated throughout the 1975 report and put into practice by my predecessors.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the detailed provisions of the Bill.  The Bill itself is divided into four Parts containing groups of sections dealing with preliminary and general matters, the organisation of the fire service, fire fighting and fire safety requirements and, finally, consequential financial and administrative arrangements. Part I is concerned with preliminary and general matters and contains a number of standard sections dealing with commencement of the Act, definitions, the procedure for making regulations and certain orders, offences and penalties, expenses of the Minister and repeals.</P>
    <P>The main substantive provisions of Part I are the repeal by section 8 of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, and the now obsolete Cinematograph Act, 1909, the provision for offences and greatly increased penalties for offences which are specified in section 5.</P>
    <P>Summary and indictable offences are treated separately.  A person convicted of a summary offence will be liable to a maximum penalty of a £500 fine and/or six months imprisonment.  Indictable offences, which may arise from failure to comply with the duty placed on persons having control of certain premises by section 18 (2) or failure to comply with the provisions of a fire safety notice under section 20 or fire safety regulations under section 37, will be even more severely punishable by fines of up to £10,000 and/or imprisonment for up to two years.</P>
    <P>These penalties represent an updating of the penalties contained in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, and also reflect a <Col N="1357" /> determination to ensure that people are not exposed to fire hazards as a result of the carelessness or lack of responsibility of the owners, occupiers or other persons in charge of premises.  This determination can also be seen in the provision for trial by jury where serious offences are concerned.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is concerned with the organisation of the fire service.  The main feature of this Part of the Bill is the proposed concentration of all fire functions, both fire fighting and fire safety, in 35 local authorities to be known as fire authorities.  The 35 fire authorities provided for in section 9 are the 27 county councils, the four county borough corporations, the borough corporations of Dún Laoghaire and Drogheda and the urban district councils of Dundalk and Athlone.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain the reasons for this proposed change.  First, let me outline the existing position under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  Responsibility for both fire fighting and fire safety was, formally at least, assigned individually to each of the 87 sanitary authorities.  In practice, however, all the boroughs and urban districts with the exception of those mentioned above, Dún Laoghaire, Drogheda, Dundalk and Athlone made arrangements with their respective county councils for the provision of a fire brigade service.  Therefore, the proposal to assign fire fighting functions to the 35 listed authorities only recognises the <i>de facto</i> position which has obtained for sometime.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of fire prevention functions is somewhat different. Under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, and a number of other enactments these functions have generally been vested in all 87 sanitary authorities.  While statutory agreements have been made by a number of urban authorities to have these fire safety functions carried out by their county councils, formal arrangements of this kind have not been the general rule.  At the same time, most urban authorities have relied on county councils, partly at least, to provide them informally with the expertise necessary <Col N="1358" /> to discharge their fire prevention functions.</P>
    <P>In view of the existing position and because I believe that some rationalisation will strengthen the organisation and efficiency of the fire service, section 9 provides that there shall be 35 authorities: section 10 spells out their functions, section 11 provides for the transfer to fire authorities of the main fire safety functions vested in local authorities and sanitary authorities under other enactments, and section 17 provides, where needed, for the transfer of any staff or property dedicated exclusively to fire prevention work from borough or urban districts to the relevant fire authority.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House recognises the importance of the relationship between fire safety and planning control and especially the need to ensure a full fire safety input into the planning decisions of urban planning authorities which are not fire authorities.  While I know that it is normal practice to seek fire safety on planning matters, I feel that there should be no doubt on this point and accordingly section 13 will allow a fire authority to advise a planning authority on the exercise of its planning control functions.</P>
    <P>The fire fighting functions of fire authorities, which are set out in section 10 are largely a re-enactment of the corresponding provisions of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  A general duty is placed on fire authorities to make provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in buildings and other places, to establish and maintain a fire brigade and make adequate provision for reception of and response to calls.  Fire authorities are expressly enabled by section 10 to make arrangements with each other for the joint discharge of their functions and to enter agreements with any other person or body either to provide or to avail of services.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires fire authorities, as far as reasonably possible, to give assistance to one another.  The present Bill, however, does not itself authorise the making of agreements between fire authorities for the performance of the functions of one authority by another, and, indeed, it actually drops a provision <Col N="1359" /> to this effect which was contained in section 2 (3) of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940. This is because local authorities now have adequate general powers to make agreements for the performance of functions of one authority by another under section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1955. However, subsection (6) of section 10 of this Bill gives the Minister a reserve power to direct fire authorities to make agreements under the 1955 Act where this appears to him to be necessary. Where agreements were made under the 1940 Act by local authorities who now become fire authorities, these agreements will be deemed to have been made under the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>It is as well at this stage to deal briefly with the additional powers related to the fire fighting functions of fire authorities which are spelt out, especially in sections 25 to 31.  Section 25 allows a fire authority to carry out or assist at operations of an emergency nature whether or not a risk of fire is involved.  This provision gives statutory recognition to the role of fire authorities in assisting at non-fire emergencies. Section 26 requires fire authorities to prepare fire and emergency operations plans.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 develop the provisions of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, regarding control of operations at a fire, section 27 designating and defining the person in control at an incident and section 28 giving this person wide ancillary powers.  Subsection (9) of section 10 also deserves mention here: it gives a fire authority power to send a fire brigade outside their own area or outside the area of any fire authority, for example on to a marine structure, and ensures that they will have all the ancillary powers in section 28 when this is done.</P>
    <P>Section 29 makes it clear that the functions of sanitary authority to provide a water supply also include the provision of a water supply for fire fighting and the provision and maintenance of fire hydrants at such places as required by the fire authority.  The section also places a duty on a sanitary authority to consult with a fire authority and take agreed measures where the latter consider that <Col N="1360" /> reasonable provision has not been made for water supplies for fire fighting purposes. Section 31 makes it an offence to interfere with, damage or obstruct a fire hydrant.  Subsection 10 of section 10 places a duty on fire authorities occasionally to conduct a survey to examine the location and adequacy of the water supplies for fire fighting as well as fire hydrants and fire fighting equipment. Section 30 makes it an offence to give a false fire alarm or to cause one to be given.</P>
    <P>Returning to Part II of the Bill, section 15 is concerned with training and places the primary duty of training their personnel on the fire authority.  However, it also empowers the Minister to assist them in performing this function, whether by providing central training courses and facilities, conducting examinations or granting financial assistance.  Indeed my Department are already providing assistance on these lines and this provision gives suitable statutory recognition to this work.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill, to which I referred earlier, provides for the establishment of the Fire Services Council with the role of providing services for and on behalf of the Minister and fire authorities. While the full range of services to be provided by the council would be set out in an establishment order to be made under the section, the section itself spells out a number of specific services which the council would be empowered to provide at the request of the Minister.  The first of these relates to assistance with fire service training.  While my Department have given considerable assistance already in this area through organising central training courses, the programme needs to be expanded and developed as a matter of urgency to give the maximum assistance to local fire authorities in improving the efficiency of the fire service.</P>
    <P>The production of guidelines and standards in respect of many aspects of the fire service is also necessary in order to promote efficiency and standardisation. Again my Department, with the help of <i>ad hoc</i> groups representative of fire service and other interests, are doing <Col N="1361" /> a certain amount of work in this area. Much, however, remains to be done and I consider that existing arrangements need to be developed on a more formal basis.  The council is, therefore, being empowered to assist with the preparation of guidelines, codes of practice and draft fire safety regulations.  These documents would still of course require my consideration and approval but their production could be much more expeditious if the research, drafting and consultation were entrusted to the council.</P>
    <P>The council would also be empowered to organise research and to carry out investigations into fires or into operations of an emergency nature under section 25. In addition to the existing powers for establishment in appropriate cases of a tribunal of inquiry to inquire into a fire or other such incident, I consider that there should also be a less formal procedure available for use in appropriate circumstances which could quickly produce an account of the fire or incident and the lessons to be learned for the future.  As a result of points made during the debate on this section in the Dáil, it was amended to provide that the council could carry out an investigation wholly or partly in public and suitable powers were included in relation to such matters as entering and inspecting lands or buildings, taking samples and requiring evidence to be taken on oath.  I expect that these powers of investigation would be used by the council as informally as possible.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains fire fighting and fire safety provisions and I have already outlined those related to fire fighting.  The fire safety provisions of the Bill embody an important new principle in that they place a clear responsibility on persons having control over certain premises to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises.</P>
    <P>Section 18 introduces this obligation and specifies the type of premises concerned. Broadly, all premises to which the public have access fall within the scope of the section, which also requires all persons on such premises to conduct <Col N="1362" /> themselves in such a way as not to expose any other person to danger from fire.  I regard this as a very important provision of the Bill and it will, I hope, result in greater emphasis by property owners themselves on preventive action.</P>
    <P>The Bill also strengthens the powers of fire authorities to take action on potentially dangerous buildings.  Strong powers already exist in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, to deal with such buildings.  However, sections 19 and 20 will clarify and widen the powers of fire authorities to issue fire safety notices, which can require closure of a building, closure until certain things are done or the imposition of certain requirements without involving closure.  Section 21 deals with appeals against notices.  Fire authorities will have a separate power in section 23 to apply to the High Court for an order restricting or immediately prohibiting the use of land or buildings where there is an especially serious risk to life from fire.</P>
    <P>Fire authorities will, of course, continue to have available to them the opportunity under various other codes, including the Licensing Acts and the Public Dance Halls Act, to ensure that adequate fire precautions are taken in such premises and section 24 ensures that they will get adequate notice of court applications connected with licensing and related legislation. Section 37 will give the Minister a reserve power to make regulations prescribing precautions to be taken in premises covered by section 18, to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The remaining major provision of Part III of the Bill is section 22.  This widens the powers of inspection contained in the 1940 Act and gives substantial powers to a person authorised by a fire authority. The authorised person will be able to inspect, require information, conduct tests, take samples and so on and the fire authority itself will also have power to require the provision of plans and other information.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, with the exception of section 37 which I have already outlined, deals with miscellaneous matters of finance and administration.  Section 32 will allow the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, to make <Col N="1363" /> annual or other grants to fire authorities towards the expenditure incurred by them in providing a fire service.  This provision will validate the scheme of 50 per cent State subsidy on loan charges arising on capital borrowing for fire services which was introduced earlier this year and which will greatly assist fire authorities in providing new stations and equipment where these are necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 33 allows for grants to persons or bodies engaged in fire research.  Section 35 is another financial provision and it makes it clear that, with the exception of urban authorities who are fire authorities in their own right, the expenses of fire authorities will be apportionable equally over county and urban areas.  The section also entitles a fire authority to charge users or beneficiaries of its services.</P>
    <P>Section 34 makes provision, familiar in local government legislation, for the furnishing of information by fire authorities to the Minister, while section 38 is a technical measure clarifying the means by which notices under the Bill may be served.  Section 36 adapts a provision of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, so as to give immunity against legal proceedings for recovery of damages arising from the failure to discharge any of their functions under the Bill to the fire authorities, sanitary authorities and the Minister.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I wish to emphasise that this Bill is only one of a number of measures being pursued by my Department with a view to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the service. This is not the appropriate place to go into detail as to the work being undertaken other than to mention it in broad outline.  Most of the work arises from the recommendations of the report on the fire services and includes such matter as an increased capital provision for the service, together with a 50 per cent subsidy on loan repayments, the provision of central training courses and financial assistance for central training, the preparation of guidelines for the fire service, the promotion of fire prevention education through the Fire Prevention Council and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> This Bill now provides a statutory framework for many of these activities and I am confident that, with the assistance of the Fire Services Council and the co-operation of the fire authorities, persons in control of premises and the general public, we can make even greater progress in gearing the fire service to meet present needs and future demands.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will preface my remarks by wishing the Minister of State well in his post.  The need for upgrading of the legislation relating to fire is very evident, especially over the past number of months with the constant newspaper headlines in regard to the Stardust tragedy. Irrespective of the outcome of the tribunal on the disaster, it can be clearly stated that some of the evidence given by the fire officers at the tribunal showed the need for action regarding the fire service.</P>
      <P>There is obviously a very definite limit on how much the various fire authorities can afford to spend on the fire service. Even though we all accept the importance of a good fire service, I suppose we also have to keep in mind the Department's other crying needs in respect of housing, health, education and so forth. It is, therefore, particularly important that money spent on the fire service be spent to the best possible effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that comes to mind is what constitutes the most effective measures against fire?  I think the answer is obvious and that would be the absence of fire outbreak.  In this matter there is no doubt that prevention is better than cure.  Every possible measure should be taken which would reduce the incidence of fire outbreak and the need to summon fire brigades.  There is a great tendency at present to spend massive sums of money on modern, highly sophisticated automatic detection and alarm systems, especially in public institutions.  While the provision of such systems is desirable where the risk of fire is great, those systems are often fitted as if they were able to control the fires themselves and solve the problem.  Very often the systems are fitted at great expense to reduce the risk <Col N="1365" /> of fire occurring.  Fire prevention should always take precedence over alarm systems, no matter how modern they are.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the draft building regulations even on an unofficial basis was a good move by the former Minister to make fire prevention more effective. It is essential that there be as little delay as possible in getting the regulations introduced on a formal basis.  It should be emphasised that the draft regulations with regard to fire and other matters is very much a specialised document.  It is important to ensure that all small builders and private owners are made aware of what type of construction or finish will be accepted.  It would be important that booklets would give details of the suitable and acceptable construction and that they be made available.  While there is an onus on us all to obey the law there should be an onus also on the law to put it in simple terms so that no confusion would arise.</P>
    <P>Much of the pressure could be taken off the fire service by the application of plain common sense and a little expenditure. For example, many of our serious fires arise from the use of some modern wall linings and finishes.  Many of those finishes have a very high rate of flame spread.  Their use should be discouraged and people should be made aware of the inadvisability of making wide use of these materials.  I have no recollection of any public warning against the use of such materials.  It is generally accepted that they are widely used in the reconstruction and refurbishing businesses.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of education regarding fire which could yield worth-while results would be the simple method of mentioning at meetings the risk of fire and explaining to the audience the exits and the fire precautions which are available. It is very important, especially at large gatherings, that people be made so aware.  It might cause a bit of a scare but it would indicate to people the problems that might arise.</P>
    <P>As our economy acquires more industries, especially the more sophisticated ones, some of them using problem chemicals, the demands on our fire service will become greater and so will the need for <Col N="1366" /> specialised training.  It is essential that a suitable type of person be recruited for the fire service and such type of people would be recruited only if they could see a worth-while career structure in the service. The impression of no training in the service was given at the recent hearing and it could hardly be calculated to attract recruits, much less ones of the calibre required.  If the services is to meet the demands on it in the future, then that position must be changed.</P>
    <P>Section 15 states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of a fire authority to make arrangements for the efficient training of the personnel of its fire services.</P>
    <P>That sets out the responsibility clearly and simply.</P>
    <P>Apart from many modern high flame spread materials that are currently in use, the switch from oil to solid fuel and to the plug-in type electric heaters will also inevitably result in more fire outbreaks. The only real barrier against outbreaks in such circumstances is an awareness of the risk of fire.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to comment on the fire service without paying a particular tribute to the part-time fire brigades which provide a fire fighting service throughout country areas.  These dedicated crews carry out their various occupations until alerted in case of fires.  They provide a remarkable service and should be given the best possible training and equipment.</P>
    <P>A frequent complaint after a fire is that the water supply at the scene was not adequate.  I am glad that section 29 (2) requires that where a reasonable water supply has not been provided the sanitary authority shall consult with the fire authority as to the measures required and shall take such measures as may be agreed.  This is a desirable Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his appointment to the Department of the Environment.  I wish him well and hope that he will be there for another four-and-a-half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly welcome the Bill and I am <Col N="1367" /> sure the Seanad agrees that it is timely. This Bill was moved prior to the general election and had a Second Stage reading in the Dáil.  The motive behind it is to strengthen the law in relation to fire services. The original Act was referred to in the Minister's speech.  It is now approximately 40 years old and there have been many changes since.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced by the last Government and was welcomed by everybody.  I have no doubt that it will serve its purpose.  The present Minister for the Environment made one change and that was to provide for the establishment of a fire service council.  There are a number of minor changes and amendments but that is the major change and it will be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>The Bill clearly brings within its ambit other legislation dealing with dangerous substances, dancehalls, office premises and the Safety at Work Act.  These are all essential and I have no doubt that there will be greater protection against fire.</P>
    <P>The basic function of the fire authority is to provide a prompt, efficient service to extinguish fires as quickly as possible. A number of brigades operate within the country.  We have in the built-up areas whole-time firemen and in rural areas, part-time firemen.  Like Senator Leonard I would like to compliment these, particularly the part-time firemen in rural Ireland who have done a great job and have not been over-paid.</P>
    <P>I had the experience of being a member of a part-time fire brigade.  The reason I joined was that at that time Leitrim County Council gave training to people who were interested in fire fighting in order to protect their own property.  A number of people in any fair-sized town used get instructions from the county council.  Naturally they received no payment, but in the event of fire there were in public buildings, such as the courthouses, a number of hoses and branch pipes and everybody within that town area could make the connection to try to get water into the area that was on fire as quickly as possible.  For that reason I want to thank the part-time people.  They <Col N="1368" /> did and are still doing a great job.  At present they are being trained in the use of breathing apparatus which is essential but which can be rather difficult equipment to use properly.  It is very important to deal with major fires, particularly where there is danger of death.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point which I would like to make very strongly concerning the whole question of inspections. The normal procedure was that somebody who was the owner of a dance hall, disco or hotel applied for a licence at the end of the year and the fire officer carried out one inspection.  He then gave the licence to operate for the coming year.  I have no evidence that he went back there to see how these premises were being operated.  We can look at two fairly recent tragic fires, the Stardust in Dublin and the hotel in Bundoran, County Donegal.  One thing that has emerged from the reports is that doors were certainly locked in one case and in the other the doors were sealed up.  I have no doubt that if these places had been inspected regularly at least a number of people would have been saved in both fires.  I am not prepared to say that everybody would have been saved, but I am quite satisfied that a number would have been.  For that reason it is an essential that the fire officer or somebody else should have a look at these premises over the year.</P>
    <P>Recently I happened to be at a dinner dance and I would say the hall was capable of holding 400 people.  I would estimate that about 250 people were there. A number of people came in late to the function and a table was set up for them at one of the exits.  That is completely wrong.  I suppose if I were a good citizen I would have gone up to them and told them to put the table somewhere else. There was plenty of space across the hall for it but it was the easiest place to put it. Maybe we would all do the same; maybe it was done without thought.  For that reason I think that inspections should be carried out on all these places.</P>
    <P>We have the question of the dangerous chemicals.  I feel that there will have to be far more attention paid by the Department of the Environment to spillage.</P>
    <Col N="1369" />
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is unfortunate that it comes before the House basically as a result of a tragedy. Too often legislators seem to follow rather than lead.  The Bill basically updates the earlier legislation on fire safety and co-ordinates the fire services which up to now were fragmented to a large degree.</P>
      <P>The first thing one must do is compliment the voluntary fire officers from all over the country who with very little training and very little co-operation from employers and often very little co-operation from the general public maintained a fire service which was adequate to a reasonable degree.  Because it was of a voluntary nature delays could occur which meant that on occasions fires which might have been minor in nature did get out of control because voluntary people had to be called from their jobs.  It is becoming increasingly essential throughout the country that fire services should not be of a voluntary nature and that we should have at least a number of trained, permanent fire personnel in each fire station. In a city like Kilkenny it is virtually impossible during the day for a member of the fire service to travel from one side of the city to the other to get to the fire station.  We have in Kilkenny a small number of permanent fire officers but we are still basically looking towards the voluntary firemen for the bulk of our service.</P>
      <P>The problems that have arisen in the two major fires where death occurred in the past two years could have been multiplied many times but for a little luck. We have had fires in Dublin, Cork and Limerick in which a large amount of property was burnt, but luckily there were very few people trapped or killed. The fire service must take a lot of the credit for the prevention of the spread rather than the actual damping down of the fire itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the results of this Fire Services Bill is that the public will be made more aware of the need to look at fire safety services.  This does not apply only to public buildings or buildings which are used by large numbers of people.  A large number of fires occur in homes each year which could be prevented.  Fire brigades <Col N="1370" /> throughout the country have to meet many calls because coming up to winter people do not clean their chimneys.  Virtually every day there are fire brigade call-outs by householders which could be avoided if they had had their chimneys cleaned at the beginning of winter.  It would cost very little and it would definitely save a lot of money and anxiety.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that quite a number of housing estates throughout the country have joint attics and there are four or five houses under the one roof.  We have been very lucky that there has not been a spread of these fires, particularly in local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The public should be made aware that it is up to them to insure themselves against the damage which can be caused by fire.  Too often we find after a fire that the local authority have the house insured but the furniture in the house is not insured.  The fact that this Bill is going through the House will give some publicity to that aspect.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the transportation and storage of chemicals and goods of an explosive nature.  This worries many people.  A train going from Waterford to Galway passes through Kilkenny, Tipperary and Limerick.  In the major urban areas there would be provision for helping out if there was an explosion or a leakage, but in the smaller towns on that route money has not been provided to the local fire services to provide the type of emergency fire-fighting equipment which is needed for gaseous or chemical explosions.  This worries people who are living close to railway lines.</P>
    <P>We have widespread use of bottled gas and transportation of bottled gas in open trucks with very little protection, often with only one chain or one preventive rail around them.  These trucks are being parked in the middle of villages and towns.  We have been very lucky that nothing of a serious nature has happened due to the transportation and storage of bottled gas in the middle of small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a big part to play in fire prevention in ensuring that public buildings are not allowed to be <Col N="1371" /> built or used in narrow streets which modern fire fighting equipment cannot reach.  There are dancehalls built at the end of lanes, cinemas which are built in side streets.  Then the public double park at night and there is no way a modern fire tender could gain access to these streets.</P>
    <P>Old people's homes and hospitals for elderly people are generally built off the street.  I dread to think what would happen if we had a major fire in one of these homes.  The local authorities are very well aware of the problems that these buildings pose.  Unfortunately the general public, and the motoring public in particular, are very slow to realise that if they double park in a narrow street they could be the cause of a very serious fire spreading. They would laugh if one told them that they could be the cause of a fire.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate, irrespective of whether we pass this Bill or not, that people are going to congregate in halls which are not adequate for the numbers admitted.  I was listening to a radio programme one morning and heard of a girl at a pop concert in Dublin; somebody whipped off her hat and when she tried to retrieve it somebody jabbed her with a needle which was full of some sort of drug.  She ended up in hospital.  The point is not the fact that somebody stuck a needle in her arm but that people were jammed packed into the hall.  There was no way that adequate fire prevention methods could get that crowd out of that hall.</P>
    <P>Young people who go to pop concerts to enjoy themselves are being packed like sardines into halls from which if there was panic they would have no way of getting out.  Pop concerts in Lisdoonvarna and Macroom are not the best places to send children but at least they are out in the open air and there is no way they could be caught in a fire situation. I would prefer to see a child of mine at one of these outdoor pop concerts rather than stuffed into a hall like a sardine. That type of operation will have to be looked into very carefully.  Unless people are prepared to spend time inspecting these pop concerts, the Bill itself will fail.  One could look at the <Col N="1372" /> dungeons, as they call them, in Leeson Street and other places.  If there was a fire in one of those places there is no way people could get out of them.</P>
    <P>Fire prevention is a costly business. Industry in Ireland is going to have to get involved in a co-operative manner with local authorities to provide adequate fire services for their own particular industry. A major industry which could have potential problems should in conjunction with the local authorities provide their own fire fighting service.  This is the case in other countries and I do not see why it could not be the case here.  It might be costly but it would not be impossible.  In certain sensitive industries where there might be problems there has been co-operation on the lines I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>The courts which license public houses and dancehalls or any places where the public gather in large numbers should have at all times a report from the local fire services on the adequacy or inadequacy of the exits from these places.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one that we welcome and it is very necessary, but it is only in the implementation of the Bill that it will either do or not do the job for which it is set up.  I sincerely hope that when one looks at the background of this Bill one realises the problems that can arise because of delays in implementing legislation. There have been talks about bringing in this Fire Services Bill for the last nearly 15 or 16 years and, unfortunately, it was not until we had a major tragedy that the Bill was finally brought forward.  Too often legislation like this which, on the surface, might not seem very important, or might be held back because there are more important and more urgent items to go through the Dáil and Seanad, can be put on the long finger. I sincerely hope that the lesson has been learned and in future, when there seems to be a need to introduce legislation on any particular item, it should be introduced and not postponed, as this Bill has been, for so long.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their kind welcome to me on <Col N="1373" /> my first appearance here as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. I also thank Senator Leonard, Senator Reynolds and Senator Lanigan for their contributions to this Bill.  There is a general acceptance of the necessity for this Bill and it is important that it have a speedy passage.  I took a few notes of the points raised by the Members and I want to deal with them very briefly.</P>
      <P>Senator Leonard said prevention is better than cure and I agree with him. That has been spelt out clearly in the Bill and we must concentrate on that aspect. My Department have had consultations with interested parties, including the building and construction industry, about the controlled system to administer the building regulations.  I might add that there is a new Bill coming before the House dealing with building regulations. It will include the recommendations made in this Bill which, I agree, is very important.</P>
      <P>The Minister hopes to bring the necessary legilsation to give effect to the building regulations before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  I do not think it would be proper for me to discuss the contents of that legislation at this stage but I want to give an assurance to Senator Leonard that the points he raised will be dealt with in that Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards the points raised by Senator Reynolds when he spoke about carelessness in places where the public congregate, he mentioned dancehalls and other areas of that sort, in reading through this Bill he will find that aspect is being taken care of.  What is being put into effect in this legislation is what we have, unfortunately, learned from some very tragic occurrences over the past year or so.  I agree wholeheartedly that this is an area which must be dealt with.  I accept the point that among the public, there seems to be an unawareness of the dangers and hazards of fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department are at present examining the need for Irish standards in the fire area and especially in the context of the fire safety provisions of the Bill.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards were asked in August last to <Col N="1374" /> undertake the work necessary to prepare an Irish standard for upholstered furniture used in places of public assembly. This was also mentioned by Senator Leonard.  This work is already under way and it is hoped that a standard will be ready early in the new year.  This standard could be given legal backing by regulation under section 37 of the Bill.  The possibility of preparing other standards is being pursued with the IIRS.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Members who have contributed to the debate.  I want to impress on Senators the necessity to have the Bill enacted as soon as possible.  I can assure the Seanad that as soon as this Bill is enacted, every effort will be made to put it into operation.  It is very necessary that controls be tightened.  This is a very comprehensive Bill.  While the transportation of dangerous chemicals is not a matter for my Department, I accept the point made.  It is a matter for the Department of Labour and I understand that recently, legislation was introduced to deal with that very dangerous activity.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope this Bill will deal with the problems we are tackling at the moment and that it will be accepted.  I want to thank Senators very sincerely for their contributions.</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;, in line five, page five, includes any person having any estate or interest in premises.  Later in the Bill certain duties and certain notices can be served on the owners of a building.  It appears that a person who has a very minor interest in a building, and who has no control whatsoever over it, could be under an obligation to do things under the Bill that he would not be entitled to do under ordinary law.  I want to bring that point to the attention of the Minister because I intend raising it later.  I have no objection to the definition but a person who owns a ground rent to the building could have obligations under the later sections of this Bill which he would not have the capacity to carry out.  This is where the problem arises.  I want to give the Minister early warning that I will be dealing with that under sections 20 and 21.</P>

    <P>Is it intended that section 4 would make it an offence punishable under the succeeding section: in other words, could somebody be charged with an offence under section 18 (2)?  Is that included in the definition in section 4?</P>

      <P>(a)  in the case of the council of a county, the administrative county, excluding any borough or urban district, the corporation or council of which is for the time being a fire authority;</P>
      <P>We will take the situation where there is only one fire brigade which operates within a county and there is an urban council or a corporation in that area and a county council.  The county council, according to this Bill, is the actual fire authority.  Is there not a danger that if somebody feels the corporation is the functional body to get in touch with, there might be a delay in getting to the fire brigade?  There seems to be a conflict. Why do we not have, say, the corporation or the county council, or the corporation and the county council, as the fire authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that this will not affect the fire brigade.  This is a central provision in the Bill establishing, as it does, the concept of a fire authority. Under subsection (1) the status of fire authority will be enjoyed by all county councils and county borough corporations and by Dún Laoghaire Corporation. In addition, those other urban authorities who at the commencement of the section are maintaining their own fire brigade, that is Drogheda Corporation and Dundalk and Athlone Urban District Councils, will also become fire authorities. Subsection (2), however, will allow the Minister at any time by order to withdraw the status of fire authority from any of the last three authorities.  Subsection (3)  defines the functional area of fire authorities and subsection (4) provides the references in other legislation, for example, in the dangerous substances regulations.  The now obsolete fire brigade authorities of the 1940 Act will be construed as references to the new fire authorities.  I can see the point made by the Senator, but I cannot see it having any impact on the fire brigades.</P>

How much thought, if any, was given to the question of regional fire services, based on the McKinsey Report on the organisation of local government? <Col N="1378" /> They believed a regional fire service was very important.  This is a little bit of a puzzle.  McKinsey said the regional fire service would be the only one that would have suitable organisation and finance to bring the services into proper condition for the eighties.</P>

      <P>When we get down to the actual funding of joint operations between two county councils, or between <Col N="1379" /> a county council and a fire authority in another county, it may be that the provision of moneys in one county is greater than the provision of moneys in another. When a bill is coming from one county to another, one authority might feel the charge is too much.  Conflict has arisen in the past because fire brigades were under the rates system.  If the imposition for fire services was much higher in one county than another, there was conflict.  Will there be a means of having, throughout the country, a general charge for the provision of fire services as between one authority and another?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of section 16 was inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil. There are two aspects I would like the Minister to consider.  Section 16 (4) (c) provides that any person who fails or refuses to comply with any requirement of the council or an authorised person shall be guilty of an offence.  While it could be open to interpretation that the court will so interpret it, in view of the fact that the remainder of that section is couched in terms of reasonableness, why is it not &ldquo;fails or refuses to comply with any reasonable requirement of the Council or an authorised person&rdquo; rather than just &ldquo;any requirement&rdquo;.  If they ask him his date of birth, it might not be a reasonable requirement, but under this section, he might be under an obligation to give it, and if he did not he would be guilty of an offence. I think it is purely a drafting point but the Minister is giving a great deal of authority to this council to create a new class of criminal offence.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (d) reads:</P>
      <P>to take evidence on oath and for that purpose to administer an oath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Minister's advisers satisfied that that is sufficient authority to give the council, without spelling it out any further, and whether the refusal to give evidence is sufficiently dealt with by the following subsection which deals with a person who obstructs or impedes the council?  That amendment was introduced at a late stage.  Does it adequately spell out who is to administer the oath, the circumstances in which it is to be administered, the question of the person being adequately represented while giving evidence under oath?  It is a very serious matter to give authority to the Fire Service Council.  It is one thing to give them authority to investigate, but it is another to give them authority to administer oaths and become a kind of mini tribunal and mini court.  That is what the Minister is doing by giving them the authority to administer oaths.  Obviously, a person can be asked anything under oath.  If he answers falsely he will be guilty of perjury, and if he refuses to answer he will be guilty of an offence under subsection (4).  Again he would be <Col N="1381" /> subject to one of the penalties outlined in section 5.  I would like to ask the Minister about those two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point is a drafting matter.  We were advised that these are powers that similar investigating authorities would have.  This is in order as it applies to similar legislation.  The Senator mentioned the other powers of the council.  Subsection (3) spells out the powers the council may use at their discretion when investigating a fire.  These include powers to inspect and take samples on land or in buildings, require the provision of documentation, the giving of evidence before the council and taking evidence under oath.  The council will have discretion whether to hold the investigation wholly or partly in public.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a very serious matter.  When you are talking about something as serious as the provisions of this Bill, and dealing with tragedies and fire hazards, it is necessary to have those powers.  The general public will be satisfied, once the investigation is carried out, that it was a complete investigation. Those powers in that section are necessary in order first, to carry out a detailed investigation and, secondly, to convince the public that there is nothing under the carpet, and that there is a detailed investigation into the powers preventing the fire.  I agree with that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems that arises under this section is that once you start giving powers to administer oaths to something like the council, there is a possibility that the investigations the council are going to carry out could develop into a public sworn inquiry, as happened with the Stardust Tribunal. The Minister has the power to set up such a tribunal and to have such an investigation, but I would not like to think that the Fire Services Council's investigations will become so public or so intricate that we will have a battery of lawyers involved for months on end dealing with the investigations. These kinds of inquiries are very limited in nature and very costly to mount.  They are a reserve power of the <Col N="1382" /> Minister and he can introduce them when necessary.  I anticipate that the Fire Services Council would carry out a much more thorough investigation but one which would not have the formality the other had and which gave rise to a colossal amount of expense.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am not going to push the Minister on the matter, but he might like to look at subsection (4) (c) which makes it an offence for a person to fail to comply with any requirement of the council.  It should be &ldquo;any reasonable requirement&rdquo;.  It is a small point, but somebody eventually is going to be charged before the courts with an offence under this section and he is going to raise these points.  If we have not looked at them properly, we might find that somebody who deserves to be found guilty will be found not guilty of an offence, because the section is drawn too widely.  I am not seeking to take away powers, but I am seeking to have the powers drafted in such a way that when it is necessary to charge somebody with an offence he will be found guilty and will not get away on a technicality.  That is very important too.  That is the spirit in which I am putting it before the Minister, not because I disagree with the section, because I do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Senator O'Leary's fears on this point may be groundless.  In subsection (3) we look not at the position of the person answering the question, but the position of the person asking it.  In section 16(3) (c) there is a restriction to relevant information.  It may well be that the court would find that, unless the information was relevant, the person would not be guilty of an offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to clarify something for me.  Subsection (2) (b) states that the fire council assist in the preparation of guidelines, codes of practice, standards of regulations relating to fire safety.  It seems to me that there is something missing in that the role of the fire council may not be well enough defined because nowhere does it seem to <Col N="1383" /> express &mdash; maybe it will come out in the reply &mdash; the need for a national training centre or for the Department to be made responsible for drawing up a national training manual, national standards on the equipping of the brigade, rank structures and so on.  I am not clear on what will happen under that subsection.  Perhaps paragraph (c) will take care of it to some extent in that it undertakes or arranges for research in relation to fire or fire safety matters.  That does not deal with the matter I raised, the training matters, the training manual and the question of standards of equipment and fire brigade rank structures and so on.</P>

The best example is where a witness refuses to attend a court there are powers to deem that an offence under the Bill.  It is hoped that the powers, such as the reserved powers, will be used infrequently. It is hoped it will not be necessary to use them.

Is it intended that they will look at the question of a national training centre for firemen, for example?  Firemen have to update their skills and so on.  We will now have a central fire council and I should like to know who is going to be responsible for updating the skills of the firemen and bringing them up to date on modern techniques, new training methods and so on.  On the national scene I should like to know what sort of a manual will be prepared, if it will be prepared?</P>

Therefore, every building would be covered.  It is like the lady in America who went to dry her cat in an infra-red oven.  The cat was burned and the lady brought the company which made the infra-red oven to court because they did not specifically state that one was not to dry a cat in an infra-red oven.

      <P>One of the problems is that surely if one uses the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; generally one then has to say, &ldquo;excluding a dwelling house occupied as a single dwelling&rdquo; because dwelling houses are not included at all.  The second problem is that one then comes to something like an oil jetty.  Is that a premises? It obviously is not a premises in the ordinary everyday English sense of the word. Having said &ldquo;premises&rdquo; one really has to define what &ldquo;premises&rdquo; are.  It does not get one any further.  One might get away with stating &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, but at the start of the Bill one would have to give a list of what one meant by &ldquo;premises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It comes down to the same thing in the end because in no way, under ordinary terminology, would an oil jetty within the meaning of the Dangerous Substance Act, 1972 be a &ldquo;premises&rdquo; in the ordinary sense of the word.</P>
      <P>There are also other things which in ordinary everyday usage might not be considered a &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.  There is the exclusion of our own private dwellings, any dwelling used as a single dwelling.  I know it makes it more difficult to understand but at the same time it is necessary to make the thing comprehensive.  I support the Minister in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only two further points to make on the Bill and the one I wish to make in relation to this section is probably the more serious.  I am worried about what a potentially dangerous building is.  This provision may have been lifted from the 1940 Act.</P>
      <P>In that Act a potentially dangerous building means any building which would in the event of a fire occurring therein constitute a serious danger to life for any of a number of reasons.  One of the reasons is the fact that large numbers of people habitually resort thereto or are accommodated therein.  That is, obviously, a dancehall or something like that.  Obviously, a large number of people go to a dancehall and, in the event of a fire, that would constitute a serious danger to life.  That is not saying that it is overcrowded or anything but there would be a serious danger to life if it did go on fire even if it was never overcrowded. This definition is used in section 20. According to that section a fire safety notice can be served on any person who has a potentially dangerous building.  A potentially dangerous building as defined by the first part of this section is, in fact, any building to which a large number of people habitually resort.  It does not have to be an excessively large number of people, but any building to which a large number of people resort is capable of definition as a potentially dangerous building.  Consequently, it is capable of having a fire notice served on it and of it being closed down.  That is not logical.  It should have something to do with the fact that the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; would be used, where there is an excessively large number of people habitually on the premises and it has one of the defects listed.  A series of defects is listed.  Section 19 (1) (a) can be interpreted as meaning any large building in which there are a large number of people habitually present. That could be so defined and be the subject of a fire safety notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only problem I have with <Col N="1388" /> regard to that section.  It is a serious question of definition.  If a dancehall which is licensed to take 1,000 people, which under anyone's definition is a large number of people, has all the proper facilities for such a number of people, at the same time, because it has a large number of people in it, it could be defined as a potentially dangerous building.  Even if all fire exits were right and everything else, a fire safety notice could be served on it and it could be put out of business for no other reason than that there are a large number of people habitually there. It appears to me to be a rather peculiar definition of what a potentially dangerous building is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the point made by Senator O'Leary I should like to state that it is precisely what it was in the 1940 Act.  The parliamentary draftsman felt there were some loopholes in that Act which needed to be tightened up.  On the point about a dangerous building an owner would have a right to appeal to the courts.  The section clarifies the matter by adding the list of reasons which might make the building seriously dangerous to life in the event of fire.  For example, the absence of adequate appliances for fire warning and extinguishment, the flammable nature of the materials used or contained within a building, the condition of a building, power, lighting, heating and ventilation system.  It is an effort to determine and define clearly what is a dangerous building.  Having said that, I want to add that if it is defined as a dangerous building the owner would have access to the courts to appeal against that.  It is necessary in the Act.  It is a tightening up of the regulations in that section of the 1940 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) (h) is:</P>
      <P>the fact that a fire therein would be likely to spread rapidly within the building or to other premises.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) (a) is:</P>
      <P>premises consisting of a dwelling-house occupied as a single dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such premises are not included as a building <Col N="1389" /> under the section.  If one looks at local authority houses built prior to 1945, while they are single dwellings they were built in blocks of six to eight and there is a common under-roof area.  Therefore, each of these single dwellings, even though they are single dwellings as described in the Bill, are joined together and should, I suggest, be included under subsection (h).  They are being excluded elsewhere in the Bill but because of the way they are built and the fact that they have joint attics there is a potential danger there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned to the Minister that I would be bringing up the question of an owner.  &ldquo;Owner&rdquo; is defined at the start of the Bill as being any person having any estate or interest in the premises.  Basically, that includes a ground landlord, or a person who is the owner of a mortgage on the premises. <Col N="1390" /> That person under section 20 can be served with a notice.  The notice can, under section 20 (3), impose obligations. Section 21 states that a person on whom a fire notice is served may within 14 days appeal against the notice to the District Court on one of a number of grounds.  If one owns the ground, owns a £50 a year interest, and has given a lease for 999 years to somebody on the property, the following are available as defences: one is not the occupier of the building or land &mdash; obviously one is the owner; that the building is not a potentially dangerous building &mdash; let us assume that the building is, in fact, a potentially dangerous building; that the notice is unreasonable because of the improbability of fire &mdash; if it is a dangerous building that would not be available; that compliance with the requirements of the notice would involve unreasonable expense &mdash; obviously that is not a point at issue, or that the notice specified an unreasonably short time for complying with its requirements.  It is not available to the person, on the other hand, to say that he is not the owner of the property or is not in control of the property.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about this.  If a person had an interest in the ground rent of a property he would go to court and there is a list of five things that he could offer in his defence none of which would solve his problem.  Therefore, he would be found guilty.  Obviously, the court would exercise its reasonableness and say this is not within its control.  I do not see any reason why there should not be an additional defence open to him to say that the nature of the owner's interest in the property is such as to preclude him from conforming with the notice. Obviously, if he had not the legal power to go in and do the thing how could he be found guilty of an offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is valid.  I have every sympathy with the Minister trying to get the Bill through today.  This is the last point I have to make but it is absolutely ridiculous to leave it out of the Bill because mortgage companies and persons who have given long leases on properties can be served with a notice.  They have no capacity to comply with this <Col N="1391" /> notice and still they would be guilty of an offence if they do not.  That is, in my opinion, bad law and the Seanad is here to try to stop bad laws being enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of entering into a confrontation with Senator O'Leary on any legal matters.  I am advised that while the notice is being served on the owner there is nothing to prevent the authority serving notice on the occupier.  The authority will have to take within reason a decision as to whom the notice will be served on.  At this stage it is not intended in any way to make any alteration or change but I give an undertaking to the Senator that local authorities will be advised on that point.  It is something on which one has to depend on the discretion of the authority as to who is the appropriate person on whom the order must be served.  It is covered reasonably well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me the opportunity of raising on the Adjournment a matter that has come to my attention with some regularity during a number of years.  I refer to the question of free legal aid.  I am sure most people here would agree that it was a pity the provision of civil legal aid, which is what I am talking about here, was not really conceded by this country but was extracted out of us by the European Court on Human Rights.  As a citizen of this country I found that embarrassing since it relates to something that was obviously of fundamental importance. However, a legal aid board was set up. Criticisms were made at the time about the means test being inadequate and the initial number of centres was criticised as were the restrictions on the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Legal Aid Board for 1980 was issued last week and, to my great concern, the chairman of the board announced that three out of the seven centres are currently closed to new clients except for emergencies.  Unfortunately, I searched the report but could not find in it any definition of an emergency. Therefore, I cannot be too precise about how many emergencies they deal with. But what clearly comes across is that the present extremely limited service is grossly overloaded, so much so that they have had to close these centres.  They mention that, as things stand, with the present level of service, the present level of staffing and the present number of centres, this pattern of intermittent closures to new applicants until the backlog <Col N="1395" /> is dealt with will be a feature of the board's activities in the future.</P>
    <P>The law, they say, is open to all; but so are the doors of the Shelbourne Hotel so long as one can pay.  The law is supposed to be open to all and I understood that was the function of the Legal Aid Board. The history, as outlined by the board, is that they proposed an extension to 21 centres last year, because that was their assessment of the minimum number of centres that could give proper coverage, and they sought £1.9 million from the Government of the day to do so.  The Government allowed only about half that sum, £0.95 million and, therefore, the plans for an extension to 21 centres had to be put in abeyance.  I have come to learn already that, in parliamentary terms, nothing is ever decided against; it is just put on the long finger, and the finger gets longer or shorter depending on the state of public finances.  In other words, nothing worthy is ever decided against.  The proposal to extend the service to 21 centres was put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>More ironic from my point of view was the fact that the board then conscientiously made further plans on the basis of the funds allocated to them.  They advertised for further staff and they say in their report that they were satisfied with the number and quality of applicants for positions.  Then they were told that, because of the embargo on public service recruitment, they could not fill the posts they had advertised.  It all adds up to a fairly sorry history.  Nobody can put it better than the board themselves have put it in the concluding paragraph of their report, where they say, in relation to the future, that if the funds provided for 1982 are insufficient to allow for a reasonable level of expansion, the consequences for this completely new service will be extremely serious.  They say that seven law centres are simply not enough to provide a nationwide service, that the pressures now being experienced by the staff in some centres are such that, unless the board can open additional centres and recruit more staff, they will have to close centres to the public temporarily <Col N="1396" /> from time to time to alleviate those pressures and to enable arrears to be cleared. They go on to say that this will mean the denial of legal advice or aid to persons for whom the scheme was intended, because in many cases delay in dealing with applicants means just that and that, if the scheme continues with the low degree of priority that apparently is being allocated to it, with restrictions on recruitment and on funding, they will not be providing even a minimum legal aid service.</P>
    <P>It is important, since it would appear that the service of the Legal Aid Board is being cut back, to identify where they are working.  The overwhelming number of cases dealt with were in the area of matrimonial and family law.  In the short period from August to December 1980 they dealt with 391 matrimonial and family law problems.  That introduced unique arrangements where both sides of a matrimonial problem were involved, whereby solicitors from two different centres had to be utilised in order to avoid any embarrassment.  The centres are so enormously scattered that there were solicitors travelling from Galway to Sligo or from Sligo to Galway in order to provide this kind of minimum privacy and to avoid embarrassment.  The obvious waste of Exchequer funds in this sort of anomalous arrangement needs no further comment.  It will continue for as long as the centres are so scarce.  Apart from the obvious injustice that is apparent in the board's report, it would bother me if this was an indication of the general approach to restrictions and cutbacks in the public service generally.  We have a number of very eloquent assurances from the Taoiseach and from various Government members that, whatever changes, cutbacks, additional taxation and so on that are needed to rectify the crisis in public finances, they will not be at the expense of the most vulnerable, the least articulate and the poor in our society.</P>
    <P>At this stage everybody is aware of matrimonial problems.  If one considers the fact that in seven centres, which had only limited publicity, almost 400 matrimonial problems were dealt with in the very early stages of these law centres, one <Col N="1397" /> gets some idea of the extent of this problem. The text of the board's report makes it clear that the number of applicants was rapidly building up as the law centres became known.  This has had to be stopped.  There is obviously a huge area of human misery which at least was beginning to be alleviated by the limited service that these boards provided.  This appears to have stopped, if it has not actually started to contract.  What bothers me is that those concerned are obviously an inarticulate group who do not complain if they do not get legal aid.  They are probably the sort of people who are least capable of looking after their own interests, who are least capable of speaking up for themselves.  It is, therefore, an area in which cutbacks could be made in a politically painless fashion because there will not be any real retort from those who are deprived of the service. The Legal Aid Board obviously will speak up but those who are suffering from those cutbacks will just carry on, enduring hopeless marriages and hopeless family violence situations, irrespective of what we do or say in this House.</P>

      <P>It is not just a question of cutbacks.  They were never adequately funded.  That point should be brought out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not disagree with Senator Robinson.  I was just talking about the Legal Aid Board's report, but of course she is right.  They were never adequately funded.  They are inadequate. The board wanted a trebling of the number of centres to provide at least the minimum service.  This was not granted. The public service recruitment embargo has been imposed on a service that never really got off the ground.  It would appear that there is no intent to extend this service. It would appear that the victims of this cutback are going to be the most vulnerable, are going to be the least articulate, are going to be the poor.  It would appear to me that that contradicts the Government's assurance that this group in society will not be a victim of our present economic circumstances.  I am very glad the Minister is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> I would appeal to the Minister and to the Government to ensure that we get a a properly funded legal aid system.</P>
    <P>The board apparently are talking about £2 million to £3 million to fund 21 centres and, presumably, to staff them reasonably adequately.  That would not be completely adequate.  The means test seems to me to be unrealistically low and some of the other provisions of the scheme seem to be a bit hair-raising in spots. Some other controversies that have arisen are a bit hair-raising, also.  Nevertheless, 21 centres would be at least a major step forward.  They would not be enormously expensive and they would help to alleviate a huge amount of human misery in an area where we tend to be very coy, that is in the area of matrimonial disputes and family problems.  We tend not to want to face up to those problems in our society.  It is very easy to ignore them and I think they will be ignored and will continue to cause enormous suffering, enormous pain and agony because of what appears to be a decision not to expand, extend and support properly the Legal Aid Board.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to reconsider this apparent policy decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Ryan and to other Senators that when it is stated that three of the Legal Aid Board's seven centres are actually closed at the moment the exact position is that the two Dublin centres and the Cork centre are unable at this point to take on new cases other than emergency cases which I will clarify for Senator Ryan.  He seemed in some doubt as to the exact meaning of the emergency situation.  It would appear that where there are cases involving physical violence, where an immediate court action is required to prevent the development of an irretrievable situation, the law centre will facilitate the very unfortunate person in that predicament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing clients at the law centres are being dealt with and new clients at this moment are being informed that the law centres cannot deal with their cases and cannot take on new cases.  However, <Col N="1399" /> the Legal Aid Board estimate that they have found it necessary to turn away about 100 new clients from the Dublin centres in a period of a week.  The board estimate that the temporary restrictions on taking new cases will continue until the beginning of January in the case of the Cork centre, and until the middle or the end of January in the case of the Dublin centres.  A similar situation arose around this time last year when the Legal Aid Board found it necessary to restrict taking on new clients other than emergency cases for some weeks from about the end of November.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that most of the new clients of the Legal Aid Board in Dublin and Cork will have to wait until January or February before their cases can be taken on.  I can assure the Senator that the Government are concerned that there should be delays in dealing with clients at any of the Legal Aid Board's law centres. The Government are acutely aware of the need to provide adequate services to the public from these centres and also to expand the existing level of services in so far as is economically possible.  I share the Senator's concern about this matter and I take this opportunity to stress my own personal commitment to the provision of an adequate legal aid service.  It has been said already that the legal aid service as set up has been shown to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>I have taken it on myself to review the legal aid scheme.  In fact, I was waiting for the Legal Aid Board report as a basis for reviewing this scheme.  I am aware of the complaints which have been made pertaining to the means testing, to the inadequacy of the number of law centres and also to the restrictions imposed by the scheme in relation to the type of actions which may be taken on.  The Legal Aid Board in their annual report for 1980 remarked that the pressures now being experienced by the staff in some centres are such that unless the board can open additional centres and recruit more staff they will have to close centres to the public temporarily from time to time to alleviate those pressures and to enable arrears to be cleared.  Personally I find <Col N="1400" /> that situation unacceptable.  I can assure the Senator that from the Government's point of view we will take every step to ensure that there will be no recurrence of this situation.</P>
    <P>At this very time the position is being examined by the Government in the context of the 1982 Estimates and I am optimistic that there will be an expansion of the service.  I am hoping that as a result of the review of the service we can look at the faults within the system and examine them to see what remedies are necessary. I will certainly be recommending those remedies to the Government in the hope of an early implementation.  It has to be accepted that the scheme, like any scheme which has been in existence for a short time, will have growing pains and the difficult task facing me at this point is to identify the areas where those growing pains are manifesting themselves at the moment so as to eliminate them as quickly as possible and thereby have a proper legal aid scheme, a scheme which, as Senator Ryan has fairly remarked, was imposed upon us by the European Court.</P>
    <P>I can say with a certain degree of optimism and in deference to Senator Ryan's possible understanding of the Government's approach to the cutbacks and having regard to the economic climate which we are experiencing, that there will not be cutbacks in the service and that we will have expansion where necessary.  In the general review of the legal aid scheme I would hope for an early implementation of any recommendations which are put to me.</P>

      <P>I have one question and it is in relation to the review of the scheme.  It is extremely important that this review should take place as a matter of urgency but I would ask the Minister to consult with a number of other bodies, with FLAC for example, who have very valuable experience, with legal practitioners and with many organisations like Cherish, AIM and Women's Aid, who have experience of the difficulties that people have encountered, difficulties in relation to the means test and to the nature of proceedings.  Although the report of the legal aid body is important <Col N="1401" /> it is only one view and one perception of the problem.  It would be very valuable to get an input from other individuals and bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>To reply briefly &mdash; lest Senator Robinson should have misunderstood me &mdash; I waited until the Legal Aid Board presented their report as I felt that would be the correct procedure.  I have had meetings already with people from FLAC, with various professional bodies, <Col N="1402" /> with Cherish and with other organisations involved in the type of work which the Legal Aid Board are doing.  Now that we have the collective comments I hope to be able to go ahead, carry out this review and look at the weaknesses of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.45 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 16 December 1981.</P>
