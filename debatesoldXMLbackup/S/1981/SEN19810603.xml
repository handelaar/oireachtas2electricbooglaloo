    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies for being somewhat delayed. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1980, to enable Bord na Móna to make grants out of funds to be provided by the Oireachtas, to encourage more extensive private development of bogs for the production of turf for fuel.</P>
      <P>The increasing scarcity and cost of imported energy makes it imperative that our indigenous energy resources be exploited as fully and effectively as possible. Bogland is a primary energy resource which offers an immediate prospect of more extensive development for fuel purposes; it is therefore an obvious source for attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation under which Bord na Móna acquire and develop bogs has been and will continue to be the major contribution of turf to fuel and energy resources.  Bord na Móna's record <Col N="2086" /> of good planning, effective organisation and growing scale of output of turf products for electricity generation and for household fuel markets is impressive.  It is my intention that Bord na Móna continue to develop and increase their production.</P>
    <P>The board's new briquette factory at Littleton, County Tipperary has recently started production.  It has an annual production capacity of 130,000 tonnes and when fully operational will provide direct employment for 120 workers, with a further 210 out on the bog producing the milled peat required for the manufacture of the briquettes.  With this new plant, the board's total briquette production capacity is now of the order of 500,000 tonnes annually.</P>
    <P>A new briquette factory is planned for Ballyforan, County Galway.  This is expected to start production in about four years time and will employ about 220 directly and about the same number on the bog.  This extra capacity will increase briquette production to about .75 million tonnes annually.  Bord na Móna have purchased to date some 70,000 hectares of bog for the production of turf and turf products.  The third programme of the board which commenced in 1974, will increase the board's acquisition of bog to about 80,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many smaller tracts of bogland which could contribute significantly to our energy requirements. Many of these would be of little interest for development under the large scale operations of Bord na Móna.  But their value could be very considerable and I believe that they could be capable of economic development by private interests for the production of fuel.  Surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais indicate that there is a remaining area of bog of about 1.1 million hectares, comprised of relatively small bogs spread throughout the midlands and western areas of the country.  It is estimated that about 50 per cent of these boglands would be capable of development for fuel production. Essentially, the Bill is designed to get such of these boglands as are capable of economic exploitation for energy purposes into production as fast and efficiently <Col N="2087" /> as possible through the involvement of the private interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in no way intended to down-grade or prejudice the primacy of Bord na Móna as the key instrument of policy in the development of turf resources.  Indeed, it is because of the confidence I have in the board's expertise and because I know of their dedication to ensuring that all the bogland of the country is carefully used and not wasted or rendered useless by bad work methods, that I am proposing in the Bill that the administration of this private scheme be given over to the board.  The Bill also provides for a role for the expertise in the various counties in the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The main obstacle to private development of bogland for the production of fuel is the substantial development costs involved, and the cost of modern mechanical turf cutting machinery.  This Bill is intended to provide financial assistance towards both of these.  One of my chief concerns is to ensure that the now valuable resource of bogland is developed in a planned and careful way.  An efficient scheme of private bog development requires the observance of standards of operation.  Cost is a major factor in orderly development.  Drainage, including outfall drainage, access roads and efficient turf cutting machinery can amount to a financial investment which could impose an excessive burden on private developers, even allowing for the improved market for turf as a fuel.  Given this situation and the inescapable need to exploit our domestic energy resources as fully and effectively as possible, it has been decided to introduce a scheme of grants on the lines proposed in the Bill to encourage more extensive private development of bogland for the production of turf for fuel.</P>
    <P>To minimise the risk of the destruction or wasteful use of bogs in the growth in turf production which these financial incentives are intended to achieve, the Bill provides for delivery to Bord na Móna of a bog development plan with the grant application.  The plan must contain such information as the board may <Col N="2088" /> require.  Essentially, the purpose of this requirement is to enable the board to assess a project and to make grants upon terms they consider appropriate to ensure orderly development, including proper regard to the subsequent use of the cut over area.</P>
    <P>However, the board may dispense with a development plan where an application relates to a bog development adequately indicated on a plan received by the board in relation to another application or in respect of minor works or minor equipment for a proposed development on a bog which is being worked.  I should, perhaps, mention also that the requirement to deliver a plan to Bord na Móna will not apply to persons seeking grant aid for machinery to cut turf under contract. Such contractors may have no direct connection with the bog area being cut and could not be expected to prepare a development plan.  As I said earlier persons at local level with knowledge and experience in connection with bog development will have a role in the administration of the scheme.  I have in mind here county engineers, county development teams and others with acquired expertise.  Specifically, I see this expertise as being of particular immediate value to the board in regard to the examination of bog development plans and perhaps even in the preparation of such plans.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, included a provision in the Bill which enables the board to appoint persons to examine and approve, or indeed in some cases prepare bog development plans.</P>
    <P>Turf production by the private sector at about 1 million tonnes per annum&mdash;313,000 tonnes approximately of oil equivalent&mdash;represents a saving to the economy of the order of £47 million in oil imports.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to give any firm indication of the likely effects of the proposed scheme in terms of increased turf production by private interests.  But given suitable harvesting and other conditions it seems that an increased output of upwards of 500,000 tonnes annually would be a reasonable estimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> Realistically, it must be acknowledged that this additional output may not be got in the first few years but the potential is there.  As to employment, it is reasonable to assume that the anticipated increased activities in private bog development as a result of the scheme will mean extra jobs in areas where job opportunities are relatively scarce.  Mechanised methods of bog development and turf extraction are essential for economic exploitation, so that, initially at any rate, additional employment as a direct result of the scheme may be limited.  But when the scheme is fully operational employment should be provided for upwards of 800. Some of these jobs will be of a seasonal nature but will fit in with the work pattern in the areas concerned, where farm work, which also has an element of seasonality is the principal source of employment.</P>
    <P>Likely expenditure under the proposed grants scheme is not readily estimated at this stage.  Essentially, expenditure would depend on the number of acceptable schemes for grant assistance for private bog development coming forward and of course the amounts involved. Development costs will depend a lot on the physical characteristic of the bog being developed, terrain, drainage required and accessibility, and until there is some experience of the working of the scheme a firm estimate of the cost of funding it is not possible.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Central Development Committee (CDC) currently operate a scheme under which grants are made available to private operators towards the cost of turf cutting machinery.  It is planned that the CDC scheme will be absorbed in the wider scheme now proposed.  The local improvements scheme operated by the Department of the Environment through county councils provides grants for the improvement of non-public roads.  Most of the schemes relate to roads serving the local agricultural community but a limited number relate to access roads to bogs.  Minor drainage works, including those which serve a bog, also come within the local improvements scheme but such schemes form a very minor part of the total works undertaken.  Roinn na Gaeltachta <Col N="2090" /> provide grants to cover the cost of certain roads in Gaeltacht areas.  Such grants are not specifically designed to aid bog development but they have in the past been used for this purpose to a limited extent.  It is not intended that the scheme now proposed should replace any benefits available under either the local improvements scheme or the Roinn na Gaeltachta scheme.  However, the extent to which grants may be available for access roads under these schemes will be taken into account in determining what grant assistance should be made available under the proposed new scheme.</P>
    <P>The memorandum circulated with the Bill explains its purpose and that of its various provisions.  I will, therefore, confine myself to the more important provisions in the Bill and to those which I think might benefit from further elaboration. As I have said, there are two main strands to it.  First, those who own or have a lease of bogland or a right of turbary over it will, subject to an approved development plan for it, be considered for grants for development works and for bog development machinery, including turf cutting machines.  Second, persons wishing to cut turf, such as contractors, will be considered for grants for turf cutting machinery.</P>
    <P>The Bill indicates those who may apply to Bord na Móna for a grant towards the cost of a proposed bog development. Applicants must be either the owner, which includes the lessee, of the bog or have a right of turbary over it.  It is proposed that the board will administer the grants scheme and will have full discretion except in a situation where a conflict of interest between the board and the applicant might be a consideration.  The Bill lays down procedures for dealing with a proposal by the board to refuse an application in those circumstances.  This, I see, as a necessary assurance for bog developers.  I am satisfied that Bord na Móna would not act in an arbitrary or selfish way so as to put their own interest first and block an otherwise worthy provate development.  I have provided this safeguard, however.  The application and all relevant documents have to be referred to the Minister, who may confirm the board's proposal to refuse the <Col N="2091" /> application or direct it to make a grant, having previously consulted the advisory committee, the establishment of which is provided for in the Bill.  It should be noted that referral to the Minister is confined to the so-called conflict of interest situation; otherwise, as I have said, the board have total discretion.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a grant of up to 60 per cent for projects sponsored by co-operative groups, formal and informal, and for grants of up to 45 per cent in any other case.  Essentially, the higher rate of grant for co-operatives is to encourage owners and turbary right holders of small bogs, of which there is a preponderance in the country and which, though individually too small for economic exploitation for fuel purposes, represent a considerable total area of our boglands, to come together to develop such boglands for fuel purposes.</P>
    <P>Of course, the persons concerned are in general smallholders with limited financial resources and I think the House will agree that the more generous grant proposed here is justified and, indeed, necessary to ensure that all such boglands that are economically exploitable for fuel purposes are brought into production as fast and efficiently as possible.  Indeed, failure to secure the participation of the small bog owners or turbary right holders in bog development schemes would significantly reduce the input to our energy needs from this indigenous resource and, to that extent, the proposed measure would be far less effective than otherwise would be the case.</P>
    <P>It has been decided not to attempt, at this stage, to cover questions of bog ownership or rights, or to deal with acquisition or allocation of bogland, or with amalgamation of turbary rights held in small plots, or with division of commonage to facilitate turf production.  These are important aspects; they raise difficult and complex issues which would require far-reaching measures.  Accordingly, it was felt that the introduction of a priority measure, as this Bill is intended to be, should not be held up while these complex issues are being pursued.  I do not see the ownership question as a potential <Col N="2092" /> source of difficulty in connection with the operation of the proposed scheme. Indeed, the availability of grant assistance towards the cost of approved bog developments should be an inducement to those concerned to settle in a spirit of co-operation and to their own advantage, ownership and rights problems in relation to bogs, where these exist.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House as a measure which provides a basis for the encouragement of more extensive private exploitation of the country's turf resources as a means of reducing our dependence on imported coal and oil which this year is expected to top one billion pounds.  Comments and discussion on the Bill up to this have been favourable. It has been well received on all sides, and has generated widespread interest in the turf-producing areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcome this Bill and also welcome the Minister to this House at this busy time when he can find time off to come to talk to us.</P>
      <P>In principle, this Bill is very welcome. I am not aware of any Bill that has gone through the Oireachtas recently with such a consensus.  It is obvious from the Official Report of the Dáil that the Bill was welcomed on all sides of the House in principle, and we support it.  It is, as the Minister said, extremely necessary that the smaller size bog should be developed because since Bord na Móna became involved on behalf of the State in the developing of our bogs their development has been to a very large extent on the large midland bogs and with certain exceptions on blanket bogs in north Mayo and Donegal.  To a very large extent it has been a very worthy development. The board have pioneered in an area that was very doubtful 30 or 40 years ago when the Turf Development Act was processed in 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy with hindsight today to suggest that the task was easy, but it was in an age when energy did not have the value it has today, when oil was very cheap and when the function of the board on behalf of the Government was to develop bogland resources which were regarded probably as less than valueless <Col N="2093" /> at that time.  They pioneered in this industry and developed an international reputation around the world where bogland is of significance.  People from Russia, Finland, the US and Germany hold the board in the very highest regard.  In talking about this Bill and this further extension of turf development it would be appropriate to put on record the State's appreciation of Bord na Móna for the pioneering work they carried out in earlier years which makes the further extension of bogland activity capable of being brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>There has been an entirely inadequate appreciation of the contribution that can be made by our marginal bogland to the energy needs of the country at this time. An Foras Forbartha estimated recently that if the marginal boglands were developed, independent of any other source of fuel including oil, they could keep this country self-sufficient for about a 40-year period.  The scope is immense when you look at the facts from the recent survey which pointed out that there are one million hectares&mdash;about 2.5 million acres&mdash; of bogland half of which it is estimated could be exploited for fuel development. That amounts to 1.25 million acres of exploitable energy.  If one relates that to the production of milled peat, for example, with an average yield in the blanket bog of about 60 tonnes per acre, it will give a potential of about 75 million tonnes of milled peat per annum over a 30-year spell which in turn would be the equivalent of about 10 million tonnes of oil or about 20 million tonnes of coal.  This puts into perspective how extremely important it is that this indigenous and extremely valuable energy resource should be developed.  It is regrettable that it has not happened before this because for some time we have been talking about developing these bogs.  However, I am very glad that at this stage it is coming to fruition and I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the Bord na Móna issue but, of course, the problem really relates to management and delegation, semi-State issues and issues that relate to the private sector.  There is obviously a limit to the size of bog to which the State through a semi-State company can <Col N="2094" /> address itself due to factors that have to do with overheads, capital and all the other factors that relate to industry of which we have seen many examples in many other areas.  If you are talking about marginal bogs where you have 100-acre units, 500-acre units or 2,000acre units isolated from areas where Bord na Móna are working it would be impractical for the State to try to urge Bord na Móna to get into the management and development of such bogs.  It is not going to work, due to the State structure of overheads and all that goes with that.  This Bill is extremely important because it is coming into the area of support for initiative from the private sector or from the co-operative sector to develop these boglands.</P>
    <P>With the establishment of Bord na Móna under the Turf Development Act, 1946 we are now coming back to one of the primary functions for which they were set up at that time.  The board have a function which they have not been carrying out to a great extent.  Part III, Chapter I of the Turf Development Act, 1946 says:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Board&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to produce and market turf and turf products&mdash;</P>
    <P>which of course they have been doing.</P>
    <P>(b)  to foster the production and use of turf and turf products,... </P>
    <P>In terms of that paragraph (b) the board will have an extremely useful role to play now that this Turf Development Bill is becoming law.  A function of the board, apart from the question of they themselves as a board carrying out works and development and the harvesting of turf and milled peat on Irish bogs, will be a very necessary consultative role.  If people in the co-operative movements or from the private sector are to get into professional development of these boglands they are going to need professional advice.  On our doorstep in this country Bord na Móna are geared to do this, and I am presuming that when they are setting up the section of the board to administer this scheme as intended by the Minister, they will also see themselves in the board <Col N="2095" /> as having a consultative role to play in having a section which can help the private sector or the co-operative movement in terms of advice on the type of development which should be carried out on these bogs.</P>
    <P>In this country to a very large extent, apart from turf cut by the sleán, which is still done a great deal, we have seen recent useful developments with turf-cutting machines.  We are beginning to mechanise the bogs.  Another development in recent years is the Lilliput machines which can be attached to standard tractors and thence can go out on bogs and cut at a very substantial rate and increase dramatically the level of output per hour in comparison with the old fashioned methods.  There are other methods of production of milled peat which again will be necessary on many of these bogs if we are to get professional development there.</P>
    <P>I would like to broaden the scope of my remarks to talk about some points of energy development.  There is room for a certain amount of disquiet about national policy at present concerning peatland development in the sense that in a previous age when it was the board's function in extremely difficult times and in an age of cheap oil to develop bogland, there was an extremely useful national role to be played by the ESB.  The ESB as the generator of electricity could absorb a huge proportion of the milled peat produced in the bogs for electricity generation.  When the ESB were doing this up to three or four years ago the shoe, economically, was very much on the other foot in the sense that they were helping both the national economy and Bord na Móna to absorb such a huge proportion of milled peat for which the board would have had difficulty in finding a market in this country.  It is not many years ago since Bord na Móna found it difficult in some seasons to find a sale for their turf.  The full circle has been turned to the degree that the board today are not producing an adequate amount of fuel for the domestic market.  The domestic market has to be supplied, to a very large extent, by imported fuels in the <Col N="2096" /> form of imported oil and imported coal. This means an enormous increase in the cost of fuel to the consumer, if he is not fortunate enough to live in the west of Ireland where he has bogland or is fortunate enough to get briquettes from Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>There is another important national factor as well in so far as the peat resource of this country is concerned. There are vital industries today where the cost of energy, which traditionally has been oil, has put many companies out of business. If you are in an energy intensive industry today and if you are using the traditional source of energy, oil, it has become such a critical factor that it has put industries to the wall and is continuing to do so.  It has done it, for example, in the grassmeal industry and an industry which I have been associated with, the seaweed industry. Unless there is a fundamental shift to solid fuel, that industry will go to the wall.  It has practically crippled the glass-house industry, and the horticultural industry, where subsidies had to be introduced to help industrial consumers.</P>
    <P>It is time for a change in policy.  The energy resource we have in our bogs, apart from being a domestic fuel and a fuel suitable for electricity generation, is also a perfectly suitable source of energy for industry.  An infinitesimal proportion of industries in this country are using peat as a source of fuel.  It is since the oil crisis that all of these problems have developed and, of course, we cannot expect the wheels of State to move overnight.  They move a little bit slower than the private sector.  All of this has really turned into a revolution.</P>
    <P>It is sensible policy by Bord na Móna today that about 80 per cent of milled peat production is going into electricity generation and only about 20 per cent is used as a raw material for the production of briquettes.  Milled peat in its raw state off the bog, without even going through the stage of being produced into briquettes is used in some other countries very successfully as a source of fuel for industry.  I will not be technical, but there is a system called a fluid ice bed system. For example, in Finland, a country which <Col N="2097" /> does not have any oil and coal, major industries such as the paper and pulp industries are using this fuel as their source of energy and it is proving to be much more economical than imported oil or imported coal.  This indigenous source of energy, in this age of very high priced imported energy should be a factor in solving the problems the IDA apparently have had in attracting manufacturing industry&mdash;for example, to the midlands. We know there has been a lot of satisfactory development in the west and in the east.  One of the cries one hears in the midlands is that they are caught in between and have not had this level of development.  This energy could be used to a much more significant extent than it is at present, for example, by the Industrial Development Authority in promoting industry in this country.  These types of industries located right beside the bogland ensure an indigenous cheap fuel for the future, something which I think is very valuable.</P>
    <P>Apart from the midland issue, in so far as the west of Ireland development is concerned, where we have blanket bog from Donegal all the way down to west Cork, if this source of energy is tapped it makes possible viable energy intensive industries along the western seaboard and makes for a positive advantage for the location of certain industries there in comparison with the east coast, south east or southern locations.  The Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann factory in Tuam is probably the largest industry in the west of Ireland.  I understand that their equivalent needs, it they were to use peat, would be about 12,000 tons of briquettes a year.  It is interesting to note that the complete supply of energy for a company such as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta in Tuam could be produced annually from about 400 acres of bog.  It shows the potential there is when, in this age of expensive energy, this country has this rich indigenous source of energy.  It is illogical to have such a huge proportion of the national resource of milled peat going into electricity generation&mdash;77 per cent as against 23 per cent.  There is a need to re-examine this policy and have a better order of priorities.  The kind of <Col N="2098" /> thing I am thinking about is the recent major ESB generating development in the Shannon basin.  In that case coal will be imported in very large quantities in huge ships with bulk offloading into the generating station.  I approve of that completely because it is a relatively cheap means of producing electricity.  This generation of electricity on coastal locations from imported coal in very large carriers at an economic price points to where the future should lie.  Peat should be a resource for the domestic market and, particularly, for industrial development.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill for a number of reasons.  If you want to get the private sector or the co-operative movement into bog development you simply will not be able to do it unless there is a State scheme, because attractive as it might seem to be to produce energy, there are all kinds of problems concerned with the acquisition and development of bogland. It will not be a generator of cash flow for three, four or five years, because drainage has to take place, levelling has to take place, roads have to be built and harvesting machinery has to be got for the bogs.  If there is to be industrial development of peat resources factories have got to be built.  People in the industrial world and the co-operative world going into this field are going into an area which will absorb a great deal of funds over a number of years before there is any cash flow at all.  Obviously, therefore, a Bill of this nature is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I would like to put to the Minister some of the remarks that were made in the Dáil concerning the levels of grant.  The Bill states that the co-operative movement should get grants of 60 per cent whereas other sectors, be they limited companies or individuals, should get a 45 per cent grant.  There is an anomoly here.  I know the Minister has made the point that the co-operative movement represents, to a large extent, self help among farmers in developing a bog resource and that they deserve a larger level of assistance.  Over the years the private sector has been very successful in a great deal of this type of development.</P>
    <P>There have been certain problems in the co-operative movement.  I am not <Col N="2099" /> suggesting that the grant level should be any more than 45 per cent: the point I want to make is that a more even-handed report would suggest to me that whatever grant level is available, be it 45 per cent or 60 per cent, the broadest terms should be available to those who wish to avail of the scheme and who have plans which are acceptable under the scheme.  The distinction is not a very good idea.  It does not seem to have been an original thought in so far as this Bill is concerned because the Central Development Committee in their scheme of grants over the past three to four years, through which they assisted certain projects on boglands such as the purchase of turf cutting machines, had this identical idea of a 45 per cent grant for the private sector and a 60 per cent grant for the co-operative movement. This apparently has been copied and inserted practically word for word into this Bill.  I think it is a carry-over from the development committee scheme.</P>
    <P>Another point in relation to the Bill, apart from the grant level, is the question of the administration of the scheme and we note that the Minister is giving this function to Bord na Móna.  No doubt from a technical point of view they will be extremely competent in administering it because of their basic knowledge of Irish bogs.  From an administration point of view there is a structure there that can be used to do it, but one of the aspects that might not be all that satisfactory is that if the private sector is getting into certain developments on bogland there may well be certain circumstances where there would be a conflict of interests.  The Minister in this Bill is, if you like, the final court of appeal in the sense that should the board refuse to grant aid to a scheme submitted to them the court of appeal is the Minister.  The Minister is empowered under this Bill to appoint a committee to investigate such claims, but I do not know if that will be altogether satisfactory and it would seem to me that the Minister for Energy of the day to a large extent would be guided in terms of the fitness of things as seen by the board to which he has delegated this duty or this responsibility.  I would think that the <Col N="2100" /> individual appealing to the Minister in a case which has been turned down by the board might be on a very sticky wicket because the natural will of the Minister might well be to back up Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>On the composition of the independent board to be established by the Minister to help them, if you like as a devil's advocate in looking at the thing, presumably the nomination of all of these members is at the will of the Minister: there will not be vocational representations, for example, on this board.  I do not question in any way the integrity of the Minister, but depending on the composition of this board, all kinds of issues could arise.</P>
    <P>A point I would make on this Bill, which no doubt is going through this House today, is that it would have been more fitting if a group such as the Industrial Development Authority, for example, had been asked by the Minister to administer the scheme.  Of course they do not know boglands and there would be many broad areas of industries in which they would not have a specialised record, but they use consultancy services. It would seem to me that a body as objective as the IDA should be delegated by the Minister to administer this scheme. They could do so very competently and could use the services of Bord na Móna in a consultative role, and they could use the services of people involved in peat-land development in other countries to balance up views that exist here.  This is just my personal view.</P>
    <P>One or two other points before I conclude include matters concerning the purchase of bogland.  Farmers in some cases sell to Bord na Móna or to others because they wish to sell bogland; in other circumstances they are not keen to sell for reasons that have to do with their heritage and the fact that they see this land as theirs and do not see why it should be compulsorily acquired by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the nation is to have this development of turf, the nation obviously must have some system under which Bord na Móna can get hold of this bogland, because if the State does not get hold of the bogland it cannot be developed in the first place, and we would not <Col N="2101" /> see the remarkable developments that have happened, particularly in the midlands, under Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is about acquisition.  There is a compromise between these two situations and it is very simple.  It is all right for the farmer to say that he does not want to sell to Bord na Móna because it is his land, but of course the State has to develop that resource.  It is all right for Bord na Móna to say that they need that bogland to develop energy, and unless the board have compulsory powers the greater interests of the nation will not be served. The very simple compromise which happens in some other countries is that there may be a State fuel agency such as Bord na Móna interested in acquiring bogland. They do not have compulsory powers. What they tend to do if they want such bogland is that they lease it.</P>
    <P>Leasing is a very interesting option where bogland is concerned because it means that the State's interest is served in the sense that if Bord na Móna, for example, were to get into the business of leasing bogland that bogland would be drained and levelled and the energy skimmed off and used in the nation's interest.  On the other hand, the farmers' interest would be served because if that bogland is leased farmers will get a proportion of the value of the milled peat every year for a 20 or 25 year period, which is a few bob coming into the kitty for virgin bog which is 95 per cent water and which farmers cannot develop unless they drain and level it.  Bord na Móna serve their function under the Minister by producing the fuel, but what makes the scheme of leasing advantageous for the farmer or for three or four farmers who might own a commonage is that from their point of view they are leasing to Bord na Móna or perhaps to some other agency in the certain knowledge that their bogland, when the peat has been taken from it and when it is down to about one, two or three feet above the sub-soil level, is going to revert to them, maybe not to themselves but to their sons or their daughters or their in-laws.  I think, therefore, that that is important, rather than going on forever having <Col N="2102" /> major bogland development, taking thousands of acres from the farming community and ending up with the cutaway bogland fit for farming purposes but with the farming carried out long-term by a board established in the first place to produce fuel and not to get into the farm game.  Looking to the future, therefore, the possibility of leasing is something that should be considered.  In the light of a recent court case where one farmer took Bord na Móna to court on this very issue of the acquisition of land, I think leasing as an option holds out a certain future that serves the various interests involved in this.</P>
    <P>I have said what I wished to say other than to congratulate the Minister on his initiative in bringing in this Bill, and I re-echo the consensus there was among all parties in the Dáil and which I am certain there will be in the Seanad.  There are a few other comments we might like to make but we will make them during the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <P>The present energy crisis provides a very suitable climate to call for a more widespread individual and co-operative interest in private turf development.  There will be many hours of daylight during this present summer when people will have the energy usefully to engage in winning turf and providing fuel for the coming winter.  The scarcity and cost of energy resources promote the idea that anybody who has the time to engage in this kind of exercise between this and the winter will be engaging in something in the nature of a patriotic endeavour.</P>
      <P>The Minister's figures here are very interesting and prove the value of the effort to win turf.  The figure of 313,000 tonnes of approximate oil equivalent in the winning of one million tons of turf in a year is equal to £47 million in oil imports.  If it is possible to increase this by upwards of 500,000 tonnes we would have a substantial saving in import costs in addition to providing upwards of 800 jobs at a time when jobs are very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all welcome this Bill because it provides a mechanism whereby private <Col N="2103" /> owners and co-operatives can be enabled to produce schemes for Bord na Móna in order to extend turf development.  I doubt if any of us or any of those who can remember back to the beginnings of Bord na Móna could have appreciated the value of the contribution of the board since their foundation many years ago.  I compliment Bord na Móna for the work they have done.</P>
    <P>It is right that the development of this scheme should be placed under Bord na Móna because naturally they have the experience and they are best qualified to study any applications that may come to them.  However, I also think it is wise of the Minister to include a provision whereby, in the event of any conflict, application could be made to the Minister who would consult before deciding whether or not to direct the board to approve of an application.  It is understandable that a semi-State board may be a little jealous of its own involvement and that therefore there should be a provision of this kind.  I welcome this provision which will, so to speak make it unnecessary to apply it and it does away with any danger of any private applicants being refused.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell me what his reference to recommendations regarding cutaway areas in the case of private schemes involves?  What would the board have in mind as regards the use of the cutaway areas?  Can the Minister tell me what sort of developments the board is engaging in at the present time with its own cutaway areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to put down any amendments even though our own party had submitted a considerable number of amendments in the Dáil and for some reason they were not pursued or moved.  In the interim I wonder if the Minister has had a look at them and if he has taken notice of them in his Second Stage speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make comments of a specific nature because I am interested in the fact that the Minister says in his speech that they want to keep Bord na Móna as the primary body responsible for the overall <Col N="2104" /> situation.  There are one or two points that are rather puzzling but perhaps at the end of the day the situation will be clearer.</P>
    <P>On balance this is a good Bill.  It recognises the need for the improvement of marginal bogs and recognises that this depends on grant-aided schemes.  Is there any good reason why Bord na Móna could not be given grant facilities in the area of the development of peat lands and cutaway bogs?  Is there any reason why Bord na Móna, who have done a very substantial and a very successful job over the years, should not be allowed to qualify for the grants for bog development on the same terms as the grant-aided entrepreneurs?  If we are anxious to enable the board to extend development of the marginal bogs should we not have made provision in the Bill for the same measure of grants to Bord na Móna as is made available to private developers? If this were provided for in the Bill it would enable Bord na Móna to continue developments in areas where deep bogs have been exhausted and where marginal bogs could be exploited. I do not know if the Minister has given any consideration to this area.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill should be modified so that the Minister, in looking at the grant-aided development plans for private interests, could not discriminate against Bord na Móna proposals which are not grant-aided, especially proposals in respect of employment.  They have done a very good job over the years in protecting employment.  It seems that section 2 of the Bill in its present form has not taken account of proposals which Bord na Móna cannot put forward because they are not grant-aided and which would be a very substantial contribution towards increasing employment.</P>
    <P>The question of the county councils' involvement in promoting peat production could have been taken into consideration and they could have qualified for the same range of grants.  That does not appear to have happened.  Particularly in the present state of the country in regard to employment and so on, the county councils could have played a major role. Many remote boglands could and should <Col N="2105" /> be exploited by county councils.  During the Emergency I understand turf was produced by county councils under the county production schemes, which could be revived if the Bill was suitably amended.</P>
    <P>There is an advisory committee which it appears the Minister would be obliged to consult in making decisions in relation to conflicting interests as between Bord na Móna and private entrepreneurs or grant-aided entrepreneurs.  I feel as a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and because we are involved in the social content in the national understanding, that when we are talking about the question of jobs and so on it is desirable to have a nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on that advisory committee.</P>
    <P>If amendments, could have been dealt with in the other House we would have sought that the grantee should include county councils because they have experience in peat production.  We would have sought to give Bord na Móna permission to make application to the Minister for Energy under the same conditions as private enterprise.  We would have expected that Bord na Móna, and the Minister, would be obliged to discourage private enterprise intervention if it is detrimental to employment in Bord na Móna or detrimental to any development plans of the board.  I have not been able to develop that argument to the effect that it is detrimental, but it seems that if one starts grant aiding entrepreneurs and making matters a bit loose, things have a happy knack of developing in such a way that the primary body begins to take the secondary role.  That is the reason I make that observation.</P>
    <P>On the question of directions from the Minister to Bord na Móna I should like to know why they should not be laid before the Oireachtas like many other directions are.  The question of the grant aid to entrepreneurs being directed to the areas of peatlands which may be unsuitable for development by Bord na Móna by reason of size or remoteness is another area where the Minister should have gone a little further.  In my comments I have covered the question of what is actually <Col N="2106" /> wiggling us, the question of Bord na Móna not having the same opportunities of getting into the grant-aided situation and also county councils not being brought into a much fuller role.  After all, we are talking about the development of our energy resources.  County councils have experience.  When one looks back at the record of Bord na Móna one will see that they are masters of the art and they should be given a greater opportunity to compete and to see that their situation is not eroded by the value of help given to grant-aided entrepreneurs for further development.</P>
    <P>We do not intend to put down any amendment.  The Bill is, on balance, a good Bill, but I should like to ask the Minister to make some observations on the points I raised.  We are concerned about the whole question of energy.  It is very desirable that the Bill be brought in now and while I have been critical of many things I should like to compliment the Minister on a lot of things that are in it.  Our views, if adopted, would have improved the Bill.  If there is a good reason why they were not included I would be grateful to hear it from the Minister in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  Indeed, any development at this time when nationally we need to tap any resources we have as regards the production of additional national fuel for home consumption is to be welcomed.  The price of oil and other fuels which we are importing has a very severe impact on all the commodities within our State that we use from day to day.  There is a greater awareness of the need for some alternative national fuel and to utilise our national resources to the full.  In the coming decade our own resources and our policies will have to be reviewed with a view to providing as much fuel and energy in our own State as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Staunton covered a very comprehensive range in this debate.  Coming from the same region I endorse all that he has said.  He has a great grasp of what is required, especially in regard to the western region.  He may have omitted a few points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> I want to speak on the acquisition of turbary rights.  The failure of the Land Commission, or indeed any body, to acquire further turbary rights for turf development in the western region will have to be looked into as a matter of priority.  Farmers in my area utilising the old traditional method of sleán cutting are unable to get sufficient turbary rights and bog plots to have their own private supplies.  The new committee being set up by the Minister must ensure, with design engineers, that the new tracts of bog will afford the new bog developer the necessary access for high production with technical, mechanical machines.  Such machines are coming on stream, are being designed and patented and while some of them do not give the desirable output they are good experiments.  New plots should be designed so as to take all modern technical machinery with a very high output.  We will have to have them for future bog development, especially in the western region.  It is sad to see coal being brought, so to speak, to Newcastle. Many tonnes of turf are being transported from Longford and Offaly to Mayo, Galway and Sligo where we have such a vast amount of blanket virgin bog that could be developed with modern techniques to produce the requirements of the Connacht region.  It is a waste of fuel, energy and haulage to have to buy at an exorbitant price commercial loose turf that is being produced by Bord na Móna in the midlands.  That should be curbed and it is something the Minister should give serious thought to in doing something about the provision and acquisition of suitable tracts of bogland.  That land is there in abundance and is being acquired by people from foreign lands for other types of development.  There should be a certain liaison with the Forestry Division when acquiring land for planting as to the type of bog they require for forestry as against the type of bog required for bog development.</P>
    <P>Drainage is important.  I say now what I said to the Minister privately on previous occasions.  The outlets on these major tracts of bog will have to be deepened, the water courses, rivers, loughs <Col N="2108" /> and streams will have to be deepened to give proper outfall to the major development of the bog that will be acquired in the eighties.  Most of the bogs in the west were cut, but the remainder holds the best quality turf.  However, because of lack of drainage we had to cut over the best of the turf and what we got on the top was not of the same quality as that left in the bog.  With proper drainage that could be utilised to give the best quality turf.</P>
    <P>We should get down the gravel so that transportation of the product of the new development would be much easier. Roads are very essential.  These, together with drainage, are the first priority in any bog development.  If people are to be able to get in and extract turf from large tracts of bog, whether in a dry state or in the cutting, they need to have easy access on roads designed properly to take the traffic of the eighties and of the years that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see the CDC devoured in this takeover.  They did a good job and a lot of research on the type of machine suitable to the bogs we have here.  I understand that unless one buys an Irish made machine at this point one will not qualify for a grant.  If one buys one of of these Japanese machines or machines that are being designed to give greater output and which are not Irish, I understand no grant is being made available and co-operatives and private entrepreneurs that are trying to get into turf development are at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that there is some safety valve in relation to applications for these grants in that the Minister will have the final say rather than Bord na Móna because it might well be that there would be a certain unwise screening of applicants with a view to competition and otherwise. The fact that the Minister will have a say in the final decision in regard to applications for these grants is a welcome safety valve, in my view.</P>
    <P>As Senator Staunton said, briquettes could be sold.  The market is here in Ireland.  They are not available in any shop in the west.  They may be available on one day a week and if one is not quick to be there and have the purchase carried <Col N="2109" /> out on that particular day, they are not available at other times.  Bord na Móna could do more to provide us with commercial loose turf plus additional briquettes. There is a market here and Bord na Móna could do a lot more.  While they are mainly producing power for generating stations, there is a large market to be tapped in that field.  It would reduce the amount of imported coal if we could produce sufficient briquettes and commercial loose turf.  There is a need for a major briquette producing factory in the west.  If transportation costs can be cut to a minimum because of the location of the manufacturing unit in the Connacht region, it should be possible to give that region briquettes and loose turf at a price that would be suitable to the people in that area.</P>
    <P>There should be some sort of review into the type of heating system that now operates in our institutions throughout the State.  During the emergency in the forties and fifties when we were unable to get sufficient energy from abroad we had to revert to a very primitive method of production and in those days we produced sufficient turf to keep the furnaces in the institutions of this State ticking over.  In this day and age that should not be too hard to do.  We have this virgin national resource and it can be utilised. We could convert our furnaces to use this type of fuel.  This would give a vast amount of employment in rural areas and would add to the off-farm employment for small farmers along the coast and throughout the whole western region. Turf-fired furnaces can produce and, according to statistics have produced very high quality heating at a minimum cost. We can do something in that field.  It is something that would give a measureable amount of employment at a time when employment is needed in those areas.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill every success and compliment the Minister for bringing it in at this time.  He said at the outset that it is subject to review and that we are on a trial spin.  We will have teething problems, but nevertheless, the Minister has plenty of power in the Bill to change in midstream, if necessary, to ensure that this venture is profitable at a time when <Col N="2110" /> we are awaiting the flow of oil from the Porcupine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <P>I also wish to support this Bill.  Because of its importance I would like to compliment the Minister on the forceful work he has done in his Department. The importance of this Department ranks only next to the Department of Finance in the impact it can make.  The Minister deserves a lot of the credit for putting the energy problems and the options which are available to both private and public enterprise here to the people in such a forceful and intelligent way.  He has made a great success of his Department.  I hope this success will be continued because of the tremendous importance which energy now plays in our national life.  I can make this nonpolitical comment as an independent; if I was a member of a party it might be interpreted in a different way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I am pleased to speak on this Bill because it marks a part of the evolution of thinking on our semi-State bodies, because this Bill specifically links the public with the private sector.  That is an important new way of thinking that we are coming to appreciate. It can be applied in many other areas in the semi-State sector and it may be one of the ways of solving some of the more intractable problems in the semi-State sector.  It is pleasing to see that this policy is enshrined in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are all sorts of ways of linking public and private enterprise and this Bill deals with one very specific case in which a public body are empowered to give grants to private developers.  The thinking is in the right direction.  It is the sort of thinking that has many applications to the whole range of our semi-State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters that was mentioned is the connection with forestry and the involvement of the Forestry Division in the development of cut-over bogs and particularly in woodland development in which the Industrial Development Authority have played a major role. There again the whole emphasis is on <Col N="2111" /> linking the private developer with the public sector.  This is important and will be accepted as a major step forward in the evolution of our semi-State side.</P>
    <P>There are a few points to which I should like to draw attention.  The Minister referred to putting the emphasis on co-operative development because many of these small bogs are not economic for Bord na Móna to develop.  If the various owners of the turbary rights can come together and work an actual or a loose form of co-operation they will find it profitable to develop, given the grants that are available to them.  It is right for Bord na Móna to have the actual operation of the scheme with the <i>caveat</i> that the Minister can, if necessary, intervene in the case of conflict.  Many people have already paid tribute to the pioneering work, not only in the development of our turf lands but also in the development of the appropriate machinery to work these turflands, that has been carried out by Bord na Móna since their inception.  This is a large organisation which, at peak time last year, had more than 6,000 employees.  The board are coming into their own in an era of expensive energy.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the problem of the development of cut-over bogland. Bord na Móna have done interesting experiments.  I notice from their last annual report that they have planted 80 hectares in their biomass project and that that is developing.  We anxiously await the finds of this first experiment.  Also they have allocated 400 hectares of cutaway bog which by 1983 will be planted with short-rotation forestry.  These schemes are of tremendous importance. Perhaps the Minister will make some reference in his summing up speech to what will be the situation when these bogs have been developed by the private operators. When the turf has been cut off what will then happen to these boglands?  Will they still be developed privately under the Bord na Móna umbrella or will the board directly do the development?  These cut-over boglands are now recognised as a very important resource.  They can be used for the growing of biomass, for dairy farming, and for forestry, depending on <Col N="2112" /> the type of land one is talking about.  An added impetus to turf development is the fact that cut-over bogland is not now just a wasteland.  It can be all put back into some important agricultural or agricultural-industrial use.  So far as farming is concerned, as one of the speakers mentioned, the reclaimed land could be leased to farmers.  It could be leased by the board or it might well be sold off in various sections.  Bord na Móna are not in the farming business and farming should be carried out by private interests. Perhaps it is a question of leasing the land or selling it off, but it is important that the whole of the cut-over bogs come back into production in another side of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference in his speech to minimising the risk of destruction or of the wasteful use of bogs.  That is a wise precaution and the board are to have a look at the development plans and approve them or not, as the case may be. This is important.  We always want to see red tape kept to a minimum but we do not want the type of cowboy development that can take place if the private operator is given a free hand.  It is a question of finding the right balance, cutting down the red tape and yet keeping some sort of control on the development of the bogs.  Legislation in one of the Fisheries Acts comes into play here because the drainage and outfall drainage from bogs now has to be worked out with the fishery authorities.  We cannot have outfall drainage ruining spawning beds in important fishing rivers.  That is something that occurs here and which would have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In common with the other Senators I welcome this Bill and consider it to be an important step forward in the development of our turflands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor Doolan Professor Doolan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Doolan</NameTxt>
      <P>During my summer holidays as a boy, on my uncle's farm in Kilshanny, County Clare, I had the task and the pleasure of spreading and footing the turf and of bringing it home by way of donkey or horse and cart.  That traditional method of providing fuel for the typical Irish family farm has been dwarfed by the winning of turf, particularly <Col N="2113" /> by Bord na Móna, in thousands of tons by methods far more technologically advanced by machine and in milled form. One salutes the achievements of Bord na Móna.  One might apply to the Irish scene what the poet in the Bible applied to the desert, about making the desert bloom in that it can be said the bogs of Ireland, long despised, have become significantly productive.  We now address ourselves to another phase of this development.  In doing so, we salute Bord na Móna's achievements in the past, and in my own part of the country more recently the very significant developments on the Galway-Roscommon border are to be referred to and welcomed.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill seeks to enable Bord na Móna to make grants out of funds to be provided by the Oireachtas it seems to me to be appropraite to examine the context in which we as Members of the Oireachtas are being asked to permit Bord na Móna to make grants.  It seems to me this can be justified only if there are sound economic or social grounds for doing so.  The basis for presenting this Bill to the House is not on social but rather on economic grounds.  There is a slight reference in the Minister's speech to certain social aspects, but in the first instance what is sought here should stand on its own feet, looked at from a strictly economic point of view.  Accordingly, I am going to address myself briefly to a number of the economic considerations which must be considered before grants are made for this scheme that is envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, the asset itself which is proposed to be won, turf, it is not something that can be thought of as wasting. The question before us is not only whether grants should be made to assist in the development of the winning of this particular asset but why it should be done at this particular time, because I submit it will not be a wasting asset.  It is there to be won in years to come, but we now seek in the Bill to bring this forward, to win more turf now and to win it by providing what is effectively a subsidy to private interests.  It seems to me that it is only justified if those interests would not <Col N="2114" /> otherwise exploit the assets which they have at their disposal and that it is only by providing a subsidy to them that this will take place.  We have to answer that question before we are really justified in providing public funds to see that an asset is won and that it would not be won without these subsidies.</P>
    <P>I just want to refer to what I might call a deontas mentality which one must be careful not to encourage, whether it is in the area of agriculture, industry or turf development, where it is only with additional State encouragement that interests are provoked into developing something they have available to them to develop. It seems to me the very antithesis of real Sinn Féinism that to develop something one inevitably in the first place looks to some other source and the State to provide funds to carry out that particular development.  It is only if the development would not otherwise take place that we are really justified in providing these funds, funds which the Minister in his speech refers to as being necessary because of the substantial costs that are involved and the cost of modern mechanical turf-cutting machinery.  I am not making judgments that this kind of Bill should not be put before us or that funds should not be provided in grant form but the questions I raised must be answered to our satisfaction before we can lend our full support to the measure before us.</P>
    <P>There is one final question which has already been referred to by Senator Staunton which I would like to put in the following terms.  If one is looking at this Bill and considering the economic justification for it, the distinction between grants of 60 per cent for groups as opposed to 45 per cent in other cases may have more of a social than an economic justification, because almost by definition a group will address itself to a somewhat larger scheme than that which the average individual would address himself to and certain economies of scale will act to the benefit of the group.  In strictly economic terms the differential between the two levels of grants is a question that needs to be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="2115" /> should like to thank the Senators who welcomed the Bill and for the various points they raised, which in the main could be described as constructive criticisms. With regard to a point raised by Senator Staunton, the answer is yes, I envisage Bord na Móna having the role of giving technical advice especially to co-ops, whether formal or informal.  I would specifically regard that as a function which Bord na Móna would carry out.  As the Senator said, they have technical expertise which should be made available in this way.  I was interested in the general observations on energy policy which Senator Staunton made.  I am tempted to follow him but I will resist because I would be straying rather far from the terms of the Bill.  However, his observations were of considerable interest.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the higher grants being given for co-ops, whether formal or informal, as against individuals or companies, the point at issue is one which has been raised in one form or another by other people, including the very last point made by Senator Doolan, although he approached it in quite a different way.  First, I should say that I am advised that 200 to 250 acres of bogland is about the minimum on which one can effectively utilise mechanical production.  As we all know, in this country a great bulk of ownership and turbary rights relate to much smaller areas.  Consequently, if we want to get the benefit of mechanical production of turf, which is what we want to get, because the object of this Bill is to produce more turf, we want to get it by encouraging the mechanical production of turf and, taking account of the general pattern of ownership and turbary rights, we have to take steps to encourage joint and co-operative development of bogland.  It is as simple as that, and that is the primary reason for the higher level of grant for co-ops, formal or informal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to make one point?  I take his point completely but, if the co-ops are getting into the larger acreage, he is giving <Col N="2116" /> them a big advantage over the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a problem we might worry about if and when it occurs.  The House will be well aware that we are a long time away from large scale co-ops working on a huge scale in the production of turf.  If that situation arose, I would see it in the first instance as a plus in the sense that the object is to produce more turf.  If it resulted in unfair competition, that would be another day's work and we would have to look at it, but there is no fear of that for quite some years to come.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Staunton is mistaken in assuming that the Minister for Energy, whoever he might be, would be inclined in the case of an appeal under the Bill to back Bord na Móna automatically.  What is envisaged is that, although he is not bound to take the advice of the advisory committee, he would normally take the advice of that committee.  I should say perhaps that it is envisaged also that the members of the committee will be drawn from the best available expertise.  The committee will be broadly based to reflect the many social and economic aspects of bog and land use and certainly will not be loaded in favour of Bord na Móna.  I envisage one representative of Bord na Móna on the committee.  It is right that there should be such a representative to present the point of view of Bord na Móna, but the committee will not be dominated in any way by Bord na Móna.  It is a mistake to assume in such cases that the Minister will automatically be inclined to back Bord na Móna.  I would hope that the Minister would have available to him disinterested advice from the committee and that he would act on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staunton's suggestion in regard to leasing by Bord na Móna rather than acquisition in fee simple, which is what they have done up to now, is interesting. He had quite a number of good arguments in favour of it, but there are arguments against it as well, as I think the Senator is well aware.  I will have a look at the Senator's suggestions.  He will appreciate that I do not wish to go too <Col N="2117" /> deeply into this topic because of the possibility that there may be a court case pending.  There was a court case recently and there may be an appeal.  I do not wish, therefore, to go into too much depth on that.  I take the points raised by the Senator and will examine them.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator Brugha in the tribute he paid to Bord na Móna.  On the question he asked in regard to the use of cutaway bog, perhaps I could refer the Senator to the interim report of the inter-departmental committee to consider the possible uses of Bord na Móna cutaway bogs issued in May 1979 and which brought the position up to date at that time.  Perusal of that report shows that the matter is extremely complex and that, in fact, the experts are not at all agreed as yet on what is the best use of cutaway bog.  The real answer probably is that there is no best use as such.  It should be realised that there are differing qualities in cutaway bog in different parts of the country.  The composition is different depending on the subsoil, and so on. In some cases horticulture may be the right answer and in other cases agriculture in the sense of cattle grazing, or crop development, or biomass.  Some other developments are being examined.  The truth is that we do not know yet what is the ideal and optimum use of cutaway bog.  That work is being pursued by the various experts available to us, including An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pursue the points made by Senator Harte because he may not be aware that the amendments in the other House which were put down by his party, and to which he referred, were moved although not spoken to on behalf of his party.  They were moved and I spoke on each one of them and set out my views in that regard.  I do not think there is any point in my going back over that ground again.  If the Senator is interested he will find it in the record of the other House.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Senator O'Toole about new types or sizes of turf holdings, that is another version of the point I was making earlier about the size of holding necessary to make economic use of mechanised turf extraction, that is, 200 to 250 acres.  I want to assure Senator <Col N="2118" /> O'Toole that there is liaison with the Forestry Division and, indeed, it has been increased in strength in recent times.  I accept fully that that liaison is important, and becoming more important by the day almost, as the development of bogland for fuel purposes becomes more important.  There are some difficulties and some conflicts of interest which arise, but the liaison is becoming more and more close, and I do not think any insuperable problems will arise.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Senator O'Toole that the cost of draining rivers would normally be outside the scope of this Bill.  It is only in cases where such drainage is a necessary or integral part of the overall bog development plan that such works would be eligible for consideration for grants, and then only to the extent necessary to develop the particular bog.</P>
    <P>Also on the question of producing more briquettes in particular in the west, I should like to reassure Senator O'Toole that, as I said in my opening speech on Second Stage, a factory for the production of briquettes has been erected at Littleton, County Tipperary, and went into production last month, I think.  Plans for another factory are on the drawing board.  The site for it is being located. Boring is being carried out to identify the precise site but it will be in Ballyforan on the borders of Roscommon and Galway, as Senator Doolan mentioned.  With the production from those two factories, the present output of briquettes will be more than doubled.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator West for his kind remarks and for his welcome for the Bill. With regard to the developments on cutaway bog I refer him to the report I have mentioned.  With regard to what is going to happen to cutaway bog left after the provisions of this Bill have been applied, by definition virtually all the bog in question will be privately or co-operatively owned, but at least it will not be owned by the State.  I assume therefore that in the absence of any further developments the cutaway bog will revert to the individual owners or the co-ops and the use to which they will put it will depend on their own view of the situation <Col N="2119" /> and presumably on the best technical advice available from Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Doolan that the primary purpose of this Bill is economic rather than social.  It may and I hope will have social advantages, but that is not the purpose of the Bill.  That will be an incidental bonus if it happens.  The basic economic purpose of the Bill is to produce more turf and fuel from within our own jurisdication to give a greater security of supply and to reduce the drain on our balance of payments for imported energy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if we waited many years we might discover whether, with the rise in the price of fuel, that would be good enough to produce a spurt from the private sector as distinct from Bord na Móna to produce more turf.  We cannot afford to wait that long.  I cannot say that there are specific studies available which would show the level of these grants being so calculated as to ensure the increase in turf production we would like to see.  The best estimates that we are able to make suggest that these grants are necessary and will continue to be necessary for some years at least if we are to get the private sector to realise anything like its potential for the production of turf. When one considers it is estimated that there are approximately one-and-a-quarter million to one-and-a-half million acres of bog in private ownership which are capable of development for fuel, one realises we have a huge natural resource which, under present economic circumstances and in regard to the present trend in the energy field worldwide, it would really be criminal of us not to encourage its production.  That is the basic thinking behind the Bill which I hope will be successful.</P>

The Minister's purpose might be better served if there was, for example, an amendment which would suggest that the 60 per cent is available to a qualified society developing 200 acres or less, which would meet the Minister's point and still protect the competitive aspect that might arise in the case of the larger acreage.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the committee which the Minister of the day is going to appoint to advise him in relation to the performance of the function assigned to him by section 2.  I take the Minister's point that the committee will be broadly based and with vocational interests.  The Bill apparently gives the Minister powers arbitrarily to choose all the members of that committee without, for example, specifying the vocational groups which it might be reasonable to suggest should be on it.  I am merely making the point, and the Minister with whom we are dealing now would establish a broadly based committee with good intent.  However, the Bill leaves the Minister of the day with too wide a scope should he decide, for his own purposes, to establish a committee of a certain type or flavour, for example.  It might have been wiser to have included clauses spelling out that the Minister would have a member of that committee from, for example, Bord na Móna, from ACOT, from the County Development Committee. <Col N="2122" /> Had it been spelt out, his interests might have been better served.</P>

      <P>Senator Staunton has made a very strong point here on an important aspect of this Bill.  I am sorry that I was not present to welcome it on Second Stage as others welcomed it.  The Bill establishes our bogs as a great natural resource and not something of which we would be ashamed.  There was a period in Ireland when the word &ldquo;bogman&rdquo; meant an uncultivated person and it is fortunate that at present one of our greatest poets.  Séamus Heaney, regards the bogs as his finest metaphor for the exploration of our ancestral past.  He has turned the old cliché of Ireland being a bog into something honorific and admirable. It is also interesting that the Boomtown Rats group has a performer in it who rejoices in the name of Pete Briquette. Within the context of the Bill, if there is to be a committee it should consist of not just people appointed at the Minister's dictate.  It would give the committee considerable force and strength if there were to be somebody from Bord na Móna, from An Foras Forbartha, and from An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>This Bill has brought a new perspective into the whole question of the development of bogs.  I listened with enormous admiration to Senator Staunton.  He is the man who has visited bogs everywhere over the known globe.  For the first time in the history of the House, we have a globetrotting bogtrotter, if I might put it that way, in Senator Staunton.  These few points have been flippantly made, but meant with great sincerity.  The Minister should, perhaps, entertain the possibility of having one or two designated nominees, or categories, for that committee mentioned under section 7.</P>

      <P>I will not attempt to follow Senator Martin into the rarefied atmosphere into which he ventured in company with the Boomtown Rats and others. With regard to the point about this committee, let me try to put it into perspective. I would hope that this committee would never have to operate.  It will only operate where there is a conflict of interest <Col N="2123" /> between Bord na Móna and somebody who has applied for a grant, where Bord na Móna refuse the grant on specific grounds that are provided for in the Bill. If it happens, then the committee will advise the Minister.  It is interesting that Senator Staunton and Senator Martin differed regarding possible nominations as to who should be represented.  If every other Senator in the House gave his views, we would have even more bodies mentioned.  That is one of the reasons why we did not specify this in the Bill. You could tie yourself down in a way that would be quite unsatisfactory afterwards. I have, however, endeavoured in what I have said in both Houses, to put on the record the general principles that we envisage being behind the setting up of this committee.  The only specific body mentioned as being represented is Bord na Móna.  I just referred to the general principles on which we would base membership, but did not mention any other specific body.  That is the best way to approach the subject but I repeat that I hope this Committee will never have to work.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I just want to reiterate that I accept that the Minister is acting absolutely in good faith when he talks about a broad-based committee of which Bord na Móna would be a member. The facts are that we are here enacting legislation that goes into the Statute Book.  The Minister may not then be the Minister for Energy but I shall not develop that point at this time.  A situation where all of the members of a committee may be appointed arbitrarily by the Minister makes for bad law.  I take the Minister's point, of course.  Senator Martin's views and my views may be different, but it is not the function of the Minister to make these basic decisions in legislation.  It may not be good law but, presumably, it can be amended at some later stage.  We have semi-State committees, for example, and vocational appointments to many of these semi-State boards, and what are loosely described as political appointments in all Governments, some of which are good, <Col N="2124" /> some very much less than good.  To develop it to an extreme, the Minister could arbitrarily appoint seven of the boys to this committee, should he so choose.  It is not good law.  There will come a stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8(2) specifies that the amount of a grant made under this section shall not exceed, in the case where the applicant is a qualified group or qualified society, 60 per cent.  What has the Minister in mind as a qualified society, or how many people could make up a group?  Two or three individuals could come together and make up a group to qualify for the higher percentage, whereas if they went individually for development they would qualify for only the lower percentage, which is 45 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would refer to section 1, he will see there a definition of qualified society, which means an industrial and provident society registered under the Act of that name of 1893 which has for, or amongst its purposes or objects, the provision of turf for fuel.  A qualified group is defined as meaning a group consisting of not fewer than three individual persons as regards which the board is satisfied that there is in force for the time being an agreement, in a form approved of by the board and to which <Col N="2125" /> each member of the group is a party, whereby it is agreed by the group to do either or both of the following: (a) by purchase, lease, hire or otherwise to acquire, or acquire the use of, turf development equipment and to use the equipment for the production of turf or turf products for fuel, and (b) to develop a bog for the production of turf or turf products for fuel.</P>
      <P>Now, if the Senator is concerned that perhaps just a few people could get together and call themselves a group, thereby qualifying for 60 per cent instead of 45 per cent, it will not be quite that simple.  As I have indicated, each member of the group would have to have signed an agreement which has been approved by Bord na Móna binding them to carry out the kind of purposes set out in the definition.</P>
      <P>One point raised in the other House was that of a man who had a right of turbary and who might group with his wife and child and thereby get the higher grant.  Of course, they would not be contributing any additional turf, or right of turbary.  Each person would have to be contributing, for the agreement to be acceptable to Bord na Móna.  The object of the exercise is to get a large enough section of bogland to make it an economic proposition, particularly for the use of mechanised methods of winning turf.  A device simply to get a higher level of grant would not be acceptable and will not be accepted by Bord na Móna in executing this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to raise on section 8.  One is very simple and I think it was answered in the Dáil, but I need clarification of it, and the other is a little technical.  Section 8 talks about machinery for the extraction of turf for fuel.  The word &ldquo;turf&rdquo; in this Bill covers all types of fuel products, including milled peat.  Is this correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point is more technical and it might be a little unfair to ask the Minister to spell it out now.  In the production of milled peat <Col N="2126" /> there are methods by which implements can be used &mdash; they are basically the implements used by Bord na Móna &mdash; but the mechanised unit, for example, engines and tracks, is not part of the machine.  Therefore a subcontract is arranged, so that if one were developing a bog for milled peat, one would have the implements and would subcontract to the local agricultural contractors to carry out the towing of these machines in the milling and harvesting seasons.  These types of tractors need to be special in the sense that they may need to be geared with half tracks for this type of work.  If an individual, a company or a co-operative were developing a bog and a subcontracting element was involved as an integral part of the policy of the company, are the people to whom the subcontract was given, for example, the local agricultural community, eligible for grants on the equipment they need to do this job under the scheme envisaged by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator said, the question he is raising is rather technical. It may be that it would be necessary to go into detailed consultation to get the precise answer he requires and it is not possible to do that across the floor of the House.  I can only enunciate the general principle involved.  Grants are available either to contractors or to other applicants, of the kind found in the Bill, in respect of machinery.  Where the machinery is designed and intended by the manufacturer for the production of turf, or where what is involved is the addition to a machine, say to an ordinary tractor, of an attachment designed and intended to be for the production of turf, the attachment will qualify for a grant, whereas the tractor will not.  They are the general principles but I do not think I can answer precisely the specific problem the Senator raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be complimented on his sensitive response to the representations that have been made to him by the many voluntary women's groups to provide adequate protection for the victims of family violence. As anyone who has had any dealings with these groups knows, they have considered that the time limit for barring orders of three months was totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister first proposed to extend barring orders by the insertion of an appropriate section in the Courts Bill, recently debated in the House, but he rightly decided that the urgency and importance of the matter deserved a separate debate.  This response by the Minister to this very real need will be welcomed. Family violence runs the whole <Col N="2128" /> gamut &mdash; from an occasional Saturday night black eye to aggravated sexual assault.  In so far as this Bill is lacking in any one thing, it is that it does not provide that the subject of a barring order be referred to marriage counselling, to psychiatric treatment, or to psycho-sexual counselling for help.</P>
    <P>There are many married couples bringing up families today whose marriages are basically sound but whose social and economic environments leave a lot to be desired.  They are struggling, many of them in quiet desperation, unable to cope with social deprivation, unemployment and lack of housing facilities.  Expressions of violence in situations like this are frequently a cry for help and one to which a caring community should respond. There is usually a long history of distress, economic or otherwise, in such cases.</P>
    <P>One must also be concerned at the number of young people conditioned by the media to over-emphasise the importance of certain aspects of the marital relationship who find themselves unprepared for the daily responsibilities of marriage and express their sense of inadequacy in violent behaviour.  Violence in marriage may become part of a continuing pattern.  Young people become accustomed to their parents' violence and do not regard it as abnormal and we need to be able to categorise violence if we are to treat the social problem.</P>
    <P>At the same time we have the duty to protect the victims of such violence in a realistic way so that they can freely and safely apply for and obtain a barring order.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for a protection order designed to protect the members of the family during the period when the application for a barring order is awaiting hearing, a period when the family is most vulnerable to threats and pressure from one source or another. Section 7 confers on a member of the Garda the power to arrest without warrant anyone in breach of a barring order or a protection order and section 8 increases the penalties for breaches of these orders while on bail.</P>
    <P>These three provisions in the Bill before the House should serve to make the law as foolproof as it can be for the <Col N="2129" /> battered wife who seeks release.  The enlargement of the jurisdication under which barring orders are made will make it easier to obtain access to the court, but when we are talking about protection we should be concerned also to protect the rights of the husband who because of a domestic squabble may find himself without a roof over his head.  The ordinary husband who gets married, buys the house and proceeds to settle down and raise a family is not a wife-beater nor does he become a wife-beater overnight and he may regard this Bill as a somewhat draconian measure.  It is a Bill designed to give protection to a family in crisis but it should be remembered that a mischievous claim for a barring order would only serve to bring the law into disrepute.</P>
    <P>While the measures contained in the Bill should help the battered wife to seek and obtain the relief she needs, we still have the problem of children at risk.  The report of the Women's Aid organisation shows the horrific effect of family violence on children who are harmed physically and psychologically and who, saddest of all, grow to accept such violence as part of the normal pattern of family life and continue it in their own marriages, thus closing the vicious circle. Although Women's Aid have looked after a total of some 15,000 children in their refuge since it opened in Dublin in 1974, their report emphasises that many women are reluctant to claim the relief of the law because of their financial dependence upon their husbands and so their children are the prime victims of violence in the family.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would be concerned about the battered baby syndrome and here one would hope for a concerted approach by various Departments concerned with the care of children, in particular the Departments of Health and Justice.  There is a danger where responsibility is divided that it would be passed from one Department to the other.  One sees, for example, that illegitimate children who are eligible for adoption come under the aegis of the Department of Justice while legitimate children who may not be adopted and may only be offered for fostering come under the care of the <Col N="2130" /> Department of Health.  Our Constitution is committed to the equal cherishing of all children but looking at the law it seems that children brought up in a normal family environment are more equally cherished than those who are not.</P>
    <P>While the Women's Aid organisation have mentioned the very large number of 15,000 children and 3,500 women who have applied to them for protection, these numbers are only the tip of the iceberg because many women do not seek the relief of the law.  They do not do so because of financial dependence, because they fear that there is a social stigma attached to family violence, because if they live in a rural community there is nowhere they can go for protection. Many of them do not wish to admit that their marriages have failed.  We really have no adequate statistics on the number of people who are suffering in this way.  I would repeat the comment I made on the Second Stage of the Courts Bill that it is a very sad commentary on the way we interpret the constitutional commitment to the needs of the family that so many of the Bills going through the House, including this one, are concerned with the need to protect the individual members of the family from one another.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to the problem is a very sensitive one and let us hope it will be effective.  I would hope for an equally sensitive response to the present urgent needs of the Women's Aid organisation who have endeavoured over the years to provide a place of refuge for such women and their children.  It would be a pity if their work were to come to a full stop because of public indifference and lack of funds.</P>

      <P>I got the impression that it was a shared view in the other House or the other Chamber that there was a limit to the extent to which the sanction of law could improve the unhappy marriage and the Minister said that in his opening address to the Seanad.  He took the view that there is a limited extent to which the law could in this fashion of force help to correct things that were going wrong in the married state.  Certainly I agree with that.  Senator <Col N="2131" /> Cassidy's view, which was also expressed in the Dáil, is that there may be room for development of a more positive public attitude with regard to assisting people whose relationships have become as unhappy as the miserable conditions which lie behind and justify this Bill. However, in relation to this Bill and all Bills of this kind in relation to the family we should have a very definite policy in enacting any legislation of finding out all the facts, having a positive attitude towards discovering how extensive are the unhappy relationship in this society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the existence of an article in the Constitution with regard to the indissolubility of marriage in no way frees society from its obligation to discover all its own ailments.  Having said that, I do not think it necessarily follows from such figures as are brought to our notice from the analyses of various voluntary bodies and others who have done some private research in this area that the solution to the social problems indicated by these evils necessarily lies towards making provisions for the dissolution of any given marriage.  The decision on that depends upon the performance by the secular society of its duty of having proper laws, laws which are based on facts, which are objectively analysed and interpreted.  It would be a mistake for us not to recognise that there are two forces making for misinterpretation of the facts with regard to marriage here. One is the expression of the Christian institutional view with regard to indissolubility, the view predominating within the church of the majority of people of this State as to the social importance of the maintenance of marriage as distinct from any spiritual matter.  Viewed from that standpoint there will be a desire not to know that there are many cases which perhaps, if we were doing our duty as legislators, might compel us in certain circumstances to say that we cannot do this duty, and not make provision for the dissolution of marriage.  That might be the conclusion of an honest interpretation of the facts and we would have to follow that logic if we were doing our duty.  But we need not anticipate that an <Col N="2132" /> honest interpretation of the facts would necessarily lead that way.</P>
    <P>There is the other force in that we must face the fact that we are passing through a feminist revolution in which much historic oppression expressed in our laws and social attitudes is being thrown off. From the standpoint of people who want a revolution one cannot easily get as objective an analysis of such facts as those who are supporting the just cause and involved in inspiring the revolution. There may be a tendency to exaggerate but obviously from the figures the Minister has given us as to the number of barring orders which have been made, there are cases which justify the intervention of the law in any form that society judges it should take.</P>
    <P>On the Christian position with regard to marriage, there does not seem to be any doubt at all that the view of Jesus as expressed in the Gospels and as interpreted in an unchanging tradition was very demanding in relation to marriage. For the Christian there is no escaping the implications of that, but I wonder whether sufficient attention is being given to what may be at the heart of that demand as we mostly talk about it.  We have put insufficient emphasis on the fidelity side to the demand that one should be faithful as God is faithful, that one is true to one's work, that one keeps one's promises.  This matter of a promise in relation to a future life and commitment to the person is not one which one as a Christian can without grave guilt, breach.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not claim it to be a very large measure but it is necessary that we look at what is proposed in the Bill. As I will move amendments to this Bill, I agree with Senator Cassidy that in making laws we cannot make assumptions that are in any way unfair to parties against whom complaints are being made.  We do not have provision here for an <i>ex-parte</i> application for an injuction. The Minister has refrained from going to that point.  But we have provision for an interim injunction proposed to be called a protection order in respect of which it is possible that a spouse who is in most <Col N="2133" /> cases the husband, will be left with a proper sense of grievence if he has to live through a period during which there is a prohibition order and before there is a barring order in which it will appear that he is the guilty party.  I am not satisfied that the proposed law with regard to making these prohibition orders is adequately protective of the aggrieved spouse and that there is sufficient provision to ensure that he knows before the application for the barring order is made that he is the subject of a prohibition order.  I am unhappy about the language in section 4 and I will be proposing an amendment to it.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains a very grievous provision with regard to an erring spouse, that he may find himself liable to arrest without warrant in respect of a prohibition order.  If I understand the Bill as it stands he may possibly not know about it for all sorts of unhappy reasons.  He may be on a skite during which he may be violent or abusive but he may not know that after he thought all his trouble was over since last Friday, he can be arrested without warrant.  I am unhappy about the possibility that there would be a liability on the Garda, under the existing provisions of the Bill, if they exercise that power of arrest, for damages for false imprisonment.  That is something on which it is necessary for me to propose an amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 8 which provides for sentences of imprisonment for offences against barring orders being consecutive, I am not satisfied that &mdash; it may well be that I am wrong incidentally but I propose to put down an amendment to be corrected on it &mdash; reading this section and the section in the original Act and the Criminal Justice Acts that are referred to in subsection (2) it necessarily follows, as a correct interpretation of these various sections that there is in fact an extension only of from three to 12 months.  There is some doubt in my mind as to whether if the provisions of this Bill became law they might not in fact leave a husband guilty of an offence in a position in which he would be liable to go to jail for more than 12 months.  If we are proposing to have that as law let us so <Col N="2134" /> enact.  If there is the slightest lingering doubt about the possibility that it should be so, if we do not intend to have it so, let us eliminate the doubt.  With regard to that, I will just draft an amendment in my own language, not that of a professional draftsman's, to make that clear.  I have no doubt that my language could be improved when I offer it to the House. But I am sure the House would feel that if we are extending it from three to 12 months, and only to 12 months, we should indubitably so do.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision on expediting the procedures for dealing with these cases &mdash; which is obviously perfectly proper &mdash; I will be asking a question on Committee Stage which arises from an amendment which I am sure in itself is unconstitutional to include in the Bill because, as I put it down, it provides that rules of court as a definite matter of the Bill shall be made within six months of the coming into operation of the Bill. Otherwise we will have a section which simply says: the rules of court may make provision for expeditious hearing &mdash;&ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; but, in this case, is that as far as the Legislature, with a limitation on its powers in relation to the courts can go? It may be that that is as far as it can go. But if it can go further we should say: &ldquo;Quickly, please, make your rules, so that any cases that come before you are heard as quickly as you, knowing your facts, can determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am a little unhappy about the absence of any provision in the Bill making it clear that &mdash; as I presume there is no doubt &mdash; both the provisions for prohibition orders and for the extensions of imprisonment from three to 12 months apply only to acts committed after the coming into operation of this Bill, that they do not relate to acts committed before the passing of this Bill, whenever that may be.  There is an Article, I think it is Article 15 of the Constitution, which says that you cannot &mdash; I have forgotten the precise wording of it but it is more or less to this effect &mdash; make an act a crime which was not a crime at the time it was committed.  It may be that is breached.  Whether the language of the Constitution is sufficient to save that situation <Col N="2135" /> I do not know but if the provisions of that Article were not sufficient to save it &mdash; which I think they are not &mdash; then we should have a clear section to that effect.  I can develop my views particularly on the amendments when we get to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to rape, when we were debating the provisions of the Criminal Law (Rape) Bill &mdash; which is now the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981 &mdash; I pressed a certain view with regard to this question of proceedings for rape being brought in respect of intercourse by a husband with his wife.  My view &mdash; incidentally irrespective of any question about the indissolubility of marriage &mdash; is that we should be enormously hesitant about any greater intrusions than we need make into that area.  Indeed Senator Cassidy made a &mdash; what is the word you use when you are saying somebody is frightfully good &mdash; splendid contribution on the whole matter and enlightened a lawyer on some aspects of the law.  She drew attention to something that, as a matter of law, already a prosecution for rape can be brought where there is a non-consentual act of intercourse after a decree of judicial separation.  That is now Irish law.  I think, and I said on the Second Reading of the Criminal Law (Rape) Bill &mdash; and I propose to put down an amendment on this Bill &mdash; to the effect that the rule which provides that a wife impliedly consents to sexual intercourse with her husband, in a husband and wife situation within a marriage, should not apply where there is a conviction of an offence under the barring order law. There should be no implied consent by a wife where there is a barring order conviction given.  I intend to introduce a new section to that effect and I would be very interested to have the reaction of the House to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Bills before us &mdash; the Family Law Bill and the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill, 1981 &mdash; prompt me to say that if we, as a State or a society, are to continue as we do to take responsibility for the institution of marriage I do not <Col N="2136" /> think our responsibility can continue merely with the issuing of a marriage licence, full stop.  We have got to consider the need and the responsibility of the State to provide some form of counselling services, family courts, all probably useful instruments for the maintenance and upholding of the family and family life.</P>
      <P>So far our legislation in this area has been purely legal and legislative rather than based on a sense of responsibility and care for the family.  I hope that the Minister, his Department and the next Dáil and Seanad, will give much deeper thought to our responsibilities in this area for the tragic situations and unhappy relationships that exist.</P>
      <P>How far the State should go in relation to family protection in intrusion into family life is a matter for very deep consideration. That is not to say that I do not welcome the measures which have been introduced.  The Criminal Law (Rape) Bill, 1980 has been passed and we have these two measures.  We have seen enough of the abuses of the family itself to realise that we have a responsibility and the Minister is trying to fulfil that responsibility, at least in part, in these measures.  The women's organisations who have been promoting changes in legislation are to be complimented in that they have focussed attention on areas in which there has been fairly obvious discrimination and injustice to women, particularly in the area of the family.  Not being a lawyer I am not competent to comment as Senator FitzGerald has been doing on the sections to which he has been referring.  All I see in the legislation is that where formerly a garda in reply to either spouse in a marriage appealing to him would say, &ldquo;It is not my business to interfere between a husband and wife,&rdquo; now if there is to be any involvement it has to be stated.  so far as the State is concerned there is in ordinary life the right of an individual, be it an abused wife or anyone else, to protection and also in some cases the right of children to protection.  There is finally the right of the family itself and the obligation to uphold the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone a considerable distance in the legislation before us &mdash;<Col N="2137" /> the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill, 1981 &mdash; but we have learned enough over the past few years to realise that we have a greater responsibility than simply the issuing of a legal marriage licence.  If marriages are breaking down to the degree that they seem to be and if we seek to maintain those marriages, then we may be required to ensure that the granting of a licence should be conditional on what most of the churches would call preparation for marriage.  That area is not involved in this Bill and I will not pursue the matter but we may need to direct our attention to it for future legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill on the grounds that it abolishes two conventions in our society in relation to marriage which are now archaic and which ante-date an age when men and women have chosen to be regarded as autonomous individuals within society rather than individuals who hope to find their definition and meaning as human beings merely within a marriage bond.  I will be a little more explicit.  The section dealing with breach of promise of marriage abolishes a convention which existed in a world where women depended very largely for their definition as human beings upon eligibility to be married and if that hope was held out for years and years and then withdrawn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for the welcome they have given this Bill and for their constructive comments on it.  They are dealing here with a very sensitive area of law.  My main concern has been to provide a positive and effective response to representations that the existing legislation was in need of improvement.  As I said in my opening remarks the provision in the 1976 Act regarding barring orders was a considerable innovation at the time.  Senator Cooney was Minister for Justice then and that Act was highly effective legislation, but in the meantime it was discovered that there were certain inadequacies.  The purpose of the Bill before the House is to remove certain difficulties that have emerged over the years in the operation of the Bill, and to strengthen it in some respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1976 legislation was discussed in both Houses on a non-party basis.  I appreciate very much that that precedent has been followed in relation to the present Bill.  No person, least of all myself, pretends that this Bill or any legislation can be expected to deal satisfactorily with each individual case of domestic violence. It provides the necessary statutory basis for intervention by the courts and by the police, where matters have got to the stage where the safety and welfare of <Col N="2139" /> a spouse or children are seriously at risk. The voluntary agencies concerned have asked for this Bill.  Their request has been granted in more than adequate measure. They consider that the Bill is necessary and would be useful in protecting spouses and children.  This is also the view of those consulted in the preparation of the Bill, people with considerable experience of marital discord and violence.  I am confident that the penalties provided in the Bill will act as a very definite deterrent to violence where domestic discord may arise.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy was concerned about making available the necessary finances and so on.  I should like to state that whatever is required to ensure the efficient operation of this legislation and, indeed, as I have stated in connection with the Courts Bill, the necessary moneys, staff and facilities will be provided. Senator FitzGerald has claimed that the Bill is not a very important measure.  I accept that every section may not be important but there are some sections that are very significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not interpret the Senator's comments as in any way minimising what is intended in the Bill.  Two important aspects of the Bill are the extension of the maximum period for which the District Court may make a barring order, and the new provision for a protection order.  These are two very significant changes in the old law.  It was only after some years' experience of the operation of the 1976 Act, which was a very valuable and innovative piece of legislation at the time and which at that time put us ahead of some of our European colleagues in this area of law, that we considered it necessary to introduce this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matters raised by Senator FitzGerald &mdash; the Senator said he was putting down amendments &mdash; I will deal with them on Committee Stage. The Senator referred to the background <Col N="2140" /> of some of the proposed amendments in his contribution on Second Stage.  I am sure he will be giving a more expansive view of the justification for any change he might wish to see.  For that reason, I propose to deal with them in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the desirability to rehabilitate spouses against whom barring orders had been made where they are found, for instance, to be suffering from psychiatric illnesses.  I should, first of all, stress that the 12 months specified in section 2 (4) is the maximum limit for a District Court barring order.  Senators will appreciate that to bar a spouse from the family home is a very serious matter.  It is to be expected that in only relatively rare cases would the circumstances justify the making of an order for as long as 12 months.  In most cases it would probably not exceed six months.  I do not think, therefore, that there would be much scope for rehabilitation of spouses during the period when barring orders are in force against them, although I have considerable sympathy for the sentiments inspired by the suggestion made by Senator Cassidy.</P>
    <P>In fact, the court welfare service of my Department does a considerable amount of reconciliation work in family law cases. These cases are frequently adjourned by judges and justices for the purposes of reconciliation under the guidance and advice of a welfare officer where both parties agree.  The actual operation of barring orders may also be supervised by welfare officers, provided the parties agree.  The question of compulsory rehabilitation of a respondent spouse who, for instance, has a drink problem is another matter.  All the courts can do in such cases is to offer advice to the person concerned and try to use persuasion. They cannot compel the person to have treatment.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also referred to the possibility of breach of a barring order through inadvertence, and subsequent arrest.  The point has been made as to whether sufficient safeguards exist to ensure that only a person who knowingly contravenes a barring order or protection order will be liable to arrest and charge. <Col N="2141" /> This postulates a situation where the respondent spouse might contravene an order through inadvertence and be arrested in consequence.  It also poses the question of whether the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be inserted before &ldquo;contravenes&rdquo; in the first line of subsection (1).</P>
    <P>It is considered that there are sufficient safeguards built into the Bill to ensure that such a situation will not arise.  At first, in the case of a barring order, the respondent will receive the initial summons to appear and in the usual case will be present at the proceedings and will know the outcome immediately.  If the respondent spouse is absent, section 4(1) provides that a barring order or protection order will take effect only on notification of its making being given to that spouse.  Then, under section 5(1), the respondent spouse must in all cases be given a copy of any order made by the court.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the practical safeguard that a garda would virtually never contemplate making an arrest in a barring order case without first warning the respondent spouse to desist from a contravention, under threat of arrest if he did not do so.  Finally, as a matter of law, the doctrine of <i>mens rea</i> requires a guilty intent, or at least recklessness on the part of the offender before he can be convicted of an offence &mdash; subject to exceptions, for example, in the case of offences of strict liability which do not apply here. For all these reasons, it is clear that there is no need to make any further provision to deal with the possibility of a breach of a barring order or protection order by inadvertence.  I regret that the description of the Bill on the monitor was such that it might have misled Senator Martin. Nevertheless, I think it was the other Bill he intended to speak on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commenting on the detailed provisions of the Bill I should like to refer to remarks in the national press attributed to Senators Robinson and Hussey on the occasion of the publication of this Bill, to the effect that the Bill represented <Col N="2144" /> a reversal of a previous Government approach, in the words of Senator Robinson &ldquo;a double somersault&rdquo;, &ldquo;a change of heart&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These statements and earlier newspaper reports, which were denied at the time, that the Government had decided to introduce a Bill which would give a right of action for adultery were totally without foundation.  This Bill represents the first and only set of proposals on the subject adopted by the Government. That there can be no doubt on this point is clear from the record.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice stated on the occasion of the debate on the Private Member's Bill introduced in the Dáil in March 1980 and on a number of other occasions, that he did not propose to make proposals to the Government on the basis of the working paper &mdash; Working Paper No. 5 &mdash; 1978: &ldquo;The Law Relating to Criminal Conversation and the Enticement and Harbouring of a Spouse&rdquo;&mdash; published by the Law Reform Commission but proposed to wait until he had received and considered the final recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission's final recommendations on the subject are contained in their recent first report on family law.  The Government, having given the matter careful consideration, came to the conclusion that it would be preferable, on balance, to abolish the actions for criminal conversation and enticement without replacement.  Section 1 of the Bill contains the provisions necessary to give effect to that decision.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that the action for harbouring of a spouse should be abolished and section 1 also gives effect to that recommendation. As I said in the Dáil, the fact that the Government have not accepted the commission's recommendations in regard to criminal conversation and enticement of a spouse in no way minimises the very important contribution that the commission have made to the consideration of the whole question.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 9 of the Bill provide for the abolition of the action for breach of promise of marriage and for various questions in relation to the property of persons <Col N="2145" /> whose agreements to marry have been terminated.  These provisions follow generally the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in their Working Paper No. 4 &mdash; 1978: &ldquo;The Law Relating to Breach of Promise of Marriage&rdquo;, and their first report on family law.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that an agreement to marry shall not have effect as a contract under the law of the State and that no action for breach of such an agreement may be brought in the State, irrespective of the law applicable to the agreement. The section will have effect in relation to agreements whether they were entered into before or after the passing of the Act but will not &mdash; under subsection (2) &mdash; affect any action commenced before that date.  This section differs in one respect from the commission's recommendation. The commission proposed to abolish the action only in respect of agreements entered into after the passing of the Act. This proposal could have resulted in actions for breach of promise being instituted long after the Act became law.  The Government took the view that once the basic decision to abolish the action was taken, it should apply to all agreements to marry including those made before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that where a wedding gift is given by a third party to either or both parties to an agreement to marry, it will be presumed, if there is no evidence to the contrary, that the gift was made (a) to both parties as joint owners, and (b) subject to the condition that it will be returned on request if the marriage for any reason does not take place.  The presumption that such a gift was made to both parties as joint owners will have relevance not only to broken engagements but also to cases where the marriage does take place.  Thus the question of ownership of valuable wedding gifts will be settled for the purpose of any dispute that might arise later in regard to matrimonial property.  The present law appears to be that wedding gifts by third parties are retrievable if the marriage does not take place, but there is no presumption of joint ownership.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes provision in relation to gifts of property, including the engagement <Col N="2146" /> ring, between engaged couples.  If the marriage does not take place for any reason other than the death of the donor, it will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the gift was given on condition that it be returned on request.  If the marriage does not take place because of the donor's death, it will be presumed, again in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the gift was given unconditionally.  This provision is in accordance with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission who adopted the general principle that the law should remove any consideration of responsibility for the termination of the engagement from the determination of whether these gifts are returnable.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is concerned with the property of engaged couples.  Subsection (1) provides that, where an agreement to marry is terminated, the same rules of law as apply to the rights of spouses in relation to property in which either or both has or have a beneficial interest will apply in the case of engaged couples in respect of any property in which either or both of the parties have a beneficial interest while the agreement was in force.  The effect of the subsection will be that previously engaged couples will be treated in the same way as if they had been married so that in the determination of property question any rules of law developed by the courts in relation to married persons regarding contributions to the acquisition or improvement of property will apply to previously engaged couples. Subsection (2) provides that section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, which enables an application relating to the determination of questions between husband and wife as to property to be brought in a summary manner before the Circuit Court or the High Court, shall apply to disputes between parties to an agreement to marry which has been terminated in relation to property in which either or both had a beneficial interest while the agreement was in force.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 provide for the making of orders by the court where one party to an agreement to marry that has been terminated has received a substantial benefit, other than a wedding gift, from <Col N="2147" /> a third person, or where a party to an agreement to marry or another person on behalf of that party has incurred expenditure of a substantial nature in the expectation that the marriage would take place.  Wedding gifts are excluded because they will fall under section 3 as I have mentioned.  In the case of an application under section 6 or 7 the court may make such order as appears to it just and equitable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the jurisdiction of the courts in relation to applications under sections 6 and 7 and section 9 provides for a limitation period of three years in respect of proceedings to enforce a right conferred by the Act where an agreement to marry for whatever reason has been terminated.  The period will begin to run from the termination of the agreement to marry.</P>
    <P>The third matter dealt with in the Bill relates to the consent of a minor spouse given for the purpose of section 3 (1) or section 9 (2) of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  Section 10 provides that such consent whether it was given before or after the passing of this Act will not be, or be taken to have been, invalid by reason only that it is or was given by a person who has not or had not attained the age of majority.  The need for this provision has arisen, in relation to house purchase loans, in the following circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) of the 1976 Act provides that a conveyance of any interest in the family home without the written consent of the other spouse will be void except in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>One consequence is that lending institutions, when dealing with applications for house purchase loans from a spouse, need the written consent of the other spouse to the conveyance of the house as security for the loan.  Lending institutions have refused to accept the consent of a spouse who is under the age of 21 years, the present age of majority, as a valid consent for the purposes of the section and the result has been, in the case of an adult applicant for a house purchase loan whose spouse is under 21 years, that proceedings have had to be instituted with a <Col N="2148" /> view to obtaining the court's authority to give the required consent on behalf of the spouse.  The effect of section 10 will be to obviate the necessity for such proceedings. I might add that the view taken by the lending institutions in this matter, that is that the consent of an under-age spouse was not a sufficient consent, was confirmed by a recent High Court decision.</P>
    <P>Besides the immediate problem relating to the consent of a minor spouse in relation to the conveyance of a house, a similar problem could arise in relation to the consent of a minor spouse under section 9 (2) of the 1976 Act to the disposal by the other spouse of the household chattels.  Section 10 covers that situation also.</P>
    <P>Before I leave section 10 I would like to refer to the complete misinterpretation of the section in the other House by Deputy Keating.  I replied to the points made on that occasion by the Deputy but in view of the fact that a number of newspapers gave prominence subsequently to the Deputy's contribution I think it necessary to refute again what the Deputy said in relation to section 10.  The Deputy claimed that what we are doing in this section is facilitating lending institutions by taking away a right which an under-age spouse already has, the right to repudiate a consent given while he or she was still a minor.  The whole point at issue however, is that under-age spouses have not been in a position to give consents at all in the situation in question because the consent of an under-age spouse was not regarded as a sufficient consent for the purposes of the 1976 Act and lending institutions are not and have not been accepting such consents in the case of applicants for house purchase loans and would not do so in the future unless the law were changed.  Therefore, rather than doing something detrimental to under-age spouses, we are doing the direct opposite: we are making it possible, in the case of a married couple one of whom is under the age of majority, to obtain a house purchase loan without having to go through the courts.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports suggested also that the section had implications for other <Col N="2149" /> areas of the law and that the rights of young persons were being fundamentally altered by virtue of this section.  That is not correct.  This section, as I have already indicated, deals only with the question of consents required for the purposes of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  I think it right that I clarify again the position in view of the fact that the newspaper reports I have mentioned might cause confusion in the minds of the young people whom the section is designed to help.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this Bill should deal with the question of the legal incapacity of persons under 21 years to be party to a contract to purchase a house or to obtain house purchase loans.  In this regard let me say that it was never the intention to deal with the contractual capacity of minors in the present Bill. The purpose behind section 10 as I have said is to deal with a separate, specific and important problem arising from the operation of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  While I have every sympathy with the difficulties of minors seeking to buy houses, it would be undesirable to deal in the present Bill with only one aspect of minority.  Any legislation dealing with the question of the general contractual capacity of minors would have to deal with other legal aspects of the status of minors as well as the age of majority itself.  As the House is aware, the Law Reform Commission have published a working paper on the age of majority and are at present preparing a final report on the matter which will include a draft Bill giving effect to their recommendations. The basic recommendation in the working paper is to reduce the age of majority to 18 years or earlier marriage which, if accepted, would enable persons of 18 years of age, or of a lesser age if married, to enter into binding contracts including mortgages.  I understand that the commission hope to furnish their final report quite soon.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to advert to the fact that the Law Reform Commission's first report on family law contains recommendations in the very important area of matrimonial property. These recommendations and the remaining <Col N="2150" /> recommendations in the report, other than those being dealt with in this Bill, are being considered separately.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily welcome all the erosions of antiquity but I certainly welcome section 1 which abolishes the criminal conversion action and all that was involved therein. The Law Commission Report in regard to section 2 is quite acceptable, the abolition of the breach of promise action, but I think the Minister will have to give more consideration to the Government's decision to abolish the breach of promise action in relation to promises made before this becomes law because, as I see it, however you view the existence of the law with regard to breach of promise cases the fact of the matter is that the actions, the claims lie on the basis of the right in the law, a right which, if there is a promise to marry before this becomes law there arises with that promise, assuming due proofs by the parties concerned or other parties, a right.  I know of no power in this Legislature to abolish that right.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in respect of the provision for the abolition of breach of promise action, while absolutely welcome and entirely right, in so far as it proposes to abolish a right of action in respect of a promise enforceable now at this moment vested in somebody, possibly in the jurisdiction in respect of which we are making law, I do not think we should enact such a law as would abolish that right, irreespective of the statutory period of limitations, which incidentally might be the way in which the Government would wish to go about correctly dealing with the problem.  There seems to be no reason why it would not be a proper regulation in regard to right of property Act, the limitation period in relation to the rights of enforcing existing promises to marry which are abolished by this Bill should be cut down to something quite modest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of language in the Bill which may be right but which I am a little unhappy with.  I do not know whether we have sufficiently set <Col N="2151" /> forth in it what a wedding gift is.  A marriage is a public act and an agreement to marry may be very private.  What is a wedding for the purposes of a wedding gift?  Where is the wedding taking place? What is the position of somebody who accepts a gift, who is in fact intending to marry someone, and the gift as far as he knows is now complete but he does not know that the person who is giving the gift knows that what he thought was a matter that was private between him and the dame was in fact the motivation for the gift from the third party.  So far from his owning it as he thought, he does not own it.  It is subject to revocation by the person who makes the gift.</P>
    <P>A gift, as I understand it, is made when something is given by the donor and accepted &mdash; and it must be accepted &mdash; by the donee.  The condition for revoking it can be expressed but if we are going to statutorily impose it, let us at least define very closely the circumstances in which a gift which would otherwise transfer the property completely to the donee, because he accepts it, in fact will not transfer it to him because there is something called a wedding gift involved in the affair.  Surely we have got to go a little further and have it provided that that request is enforceable if, and only if, he knew of the wedding and if, but only if, that was the motivation.  I know there is a presumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  I take it that there is a presumption that it be joint.  That is a rebuttable presumption because it is proper that a donor could say he is giving it for one person.  That is a matter of proof, there is only a presumption, but in the absence of that kind of thing being said it seems to be a fair presumption that it should be a gift to the two.</P>
    <P>However the presumption seems to arise if there is something called a wedding gift there.  It seems to accept that there is a public wedding and that the gift is clearly related to the wedding and then the presumption arises.  But maybe it is not so.  It may be a quiet little ceremony with as little notice as is required by the law to be given and maybe not in Ireland at all.  I am not <Col N="2152" /> satisfied that this is as it should be.  I certainly think we should take Committee Stage of this Bill on the same day as we will be taking Committee Stage of the other Bill.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's point about consent. The gifts of minors are avoidable but not void.  They are all right unless the minor says subsequently that they are wrong.  They are not empty and null. There is a technical point being coped with here which is the important part of the section in that it gets rid of the necessity to go to the court to get a consent in the case of a minority where there is a more money raising operation involved. That seems to be entirely right.</P>
    <P>Minors are involved in the purchase of houses and the raising of mortgages. Problems have undoubtedly arisen in this area in relation to raising money because of the language of the existing section.  I know that the Law Reform Commission have also referred to this question of the disposal of household chattels.  What human circumstances are we improving by facilitating the disposal of household chattels in the case of a minor spouse?  It is perfectly clear that the property cannot be bought unless that property is going to be available as good title for the lending agency involved.  It saves the trouble of having to bring the court in to decide whether the minor should consent. If the minor does consent the Law Reform Commission have recommended that there should be this provision.  It is fine that we will facilitate that and that the consent of the minor is all right for the purposes of the mortgage or perhaps the resale or something of that kind.  Why are we facilitating particularly the sale of household chattels?  This seems to me such change of the general law to which the Minister has referred with regard to minors.  But I would like to know the particular social improvement which is being effected by the proposal that the law should be changed from what it is at present with regard to the consent of a minor on the sale of household chattels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little one can say about the actions for criminal conversation and enticement except to <Col N="2153" /> agree with the Minister that they should be abolished.  They are about as relevant to human relationships today as a medieval chastity belt.</P>
      <P>The only significant thing about this is that the Minister has not accepted <i>in toto</i> the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The recommendations of the commission were that the action for criminal conversation as at present constituted should be abolished but there should be created in its place a new action for adultery that may be taken by either spouse for the benefit of the family unit. They make a similar recommendation about the action for enticement.  It is significant that the Minister has rejected these recommendations because to accept them would be to involve the Legislature in pronouncing moral judgment on people's private behaviour and I do not think one should have laws on our Statute Book which seek to regulate people's morals, particularly sexual morals.  After all, it has never been the custom of our courts to award custody on the basis of the guilt or innocence of a parent.  In fact, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, operates on the basis that the prime concern is the benefit of the child.  It does not concern itself with the moral turpitude of the parents.</P>
      <P>In this regard it is interesting to look at the English experience.  The Common Law action for criminal conversation was abolished in England in 1857 but an action for damages for adultery to be taken by the husband and not the wife was substituted, an action somewhat similar to the one that the Law Reform Commission recommended here.  It was not until 1967 that a working paper of the English Law Commission recommended the abolition of this action.  The English Law Commission Working Paper No. 9 said in their report that they were:</P>
      <P>inclined to the view that damages for adultery and the action for enticement should be abolished altogether and not replaced; that, however, they felt that this was not a question on which they at that stage ought to have given a firm opinion because it was a matter for the moral judgement of society generally</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2154" /> In fact, the only thing that can be said in favour of this action for adultery &mdash; and it is suggested in the Law Reform Commission Report and elsewhere &mdash; is that such an action would afford financial benefit to what has become a single parent family.  But it is generally felt by women's organisations that such an action involving public washing of dirty linen is not advisable and there is hardly any point in replacing the action for criminal conversation which reduces the marital relationship to one of pounds, shillings and pence should be replaced by an action which does precisely the same thing.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say about this Bill except that I would hope the Law Reform Commission would make recommendations on more serious matters, matters of domicile, nullity, and illegitimacy which are matters of very much more consequence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse everything that Senator Cassidy has said.  There is one point that I would like to put to the Minister which I do not think has been put so far.  I am not sure which of the two Bills it comes under.  It seems to me to be under one or the other. I hope the Chair will bear with me as I state it very briefly anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most difficult things &mdash; and here I agree entirely with Senator Cassidy &mdash; is the whole question of domicile and the house.  I will put it in the most concrete terms imaginable.  Let us suppose that a decree <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is granted and a couple break up.  At this stage the marriage is all over.  The woman gets maintenance and, say, custody of the children.  She is living in the family home and she owns it and she has the children. The husband must pay to support her. The case costs, say, £3,000 in the courts and the husband claims inability to pay. In such a case the High Court can actually take the house and sell it to cover the costs.  I have in mind two cases that I know of in which this kind of thing has happened, or at least has been threatened. I am wondering whether either of the Bills before us covers that.  I am not a lawyer and I am sure that on Committee Stage Senator FitzGerald as well as the <Col N="2155" /> Minister may have something to say about that.  That is a really serious point. I completely agree with Senator Cassidy when she says that the suggestions of the Law Reform Commission that adultery should be made an offence seems to me an offence in itself.</P>
    <P>The second thing I would like to say is that the Bill is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister and the Government for bringing it in.  It is an interesting exercise in law.  It is not the purpose of law to make people good.  There is a famous case that Sir Patrick Devlin, now Lord Devlin, refers to, a case in South Africa which had to do with some boundary or a mearing business between two tribal landowners.  At the end he said to the man who had been found guilty that he could punish him and force him to make restitution but that he could not make him an upright man.  The law cannot do that.  That is the purpose of religion and moral teaching and other agencies. That is why the law should not meddle in family matters except where there is protection of the individual right involved.  That is where, of course, the right of a wife not to be beaten by her husband, or <i>vice versa</i> comes into being. In other words, these two Bills together have replaced the more ancient concept of family law which was enshrined in the concept of a pair of hobnail boots and a poker &mdash; George Bernard Shaw, by the way; I did not invent that glittering phrase.  The main point about it is that family law is based on the concept that all law should be based on, that is, the rights that are inherent in the individual, whether male or female, black or white, Catholic or Protestant, Jew, Presbyterian. Only on the rights of the individual can law be properly based.  This is why this law in a way is a minor watershed.  It sees the wife and husband as individuals, not one the chattel of the other.  The two matters it concerns itself with are interesting in that respect.  Breach of promise of marriage was based on an old concept. But it was based on the notion that is often set out in the English novel in the nineteenth century that the woman has only one serious decision to make, that <Col N="2156" /> is, whom she will marry.  If one reads the novels of George Elliot and Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell one will discover that the heroine in these novels has only one choice to make &mdash; whom she will marry.  Her whole life is based on whether she makes the right choice in marriage. After that it is all decided.  She gets her revenge of course by rearing her children and aiming them like cannon against society afterwards but that is neither here nor there.  To that extent she was not autonomous.  Her destiny was stitched in to male destinies and choices of a marital kind.  It is understandable, therefore, that a breach of promise of marriage would be a very important aspect of that society.</P>
    <P>We can rejoice that our daughters nowadays do not have to submit themselves to that kind of humiliation.  They can be autonomous people.  They can choose to marry or not to marry as they wish.  This Bill recognises that.  It recognises it in terms of that breach of promise of marriage on the one hand and this very voluptuous activity called criminal conversation which I have often been tempted to engage in.  Apparently the delight of that activity is now being removed and deoderised and disinfected by the Minister in this law.</P>
    <P>The biggest fault about that notion of criminal conversation was that, first, it was based on this ridiculous notion that the woman was somehow or other a chattel and therefore a kind of sex object, an inanimate object, just an object of desire. But of course the other side of that was that she never could be because she was a human being and therefore it was possible for her to enter into collusion with her husband in order to manipulate this law.  In other words, the law of criminal conversation is the classic example of the law trying to do what it cannot do &mdash; to make one an upright man or an upright woman as the case may be.  All the law can do is punish or protect but it cannot improve us.  It must realise its limitations. That is why I like these two measures.  In a sense they show us to some degree as coming of age and in those terms I would like very much to welcome them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the case I opened with, which was a very serious one, what is the <Col N="2157" /> position ultimately if after the wife has won the whole thing, got maintenance, got her children, got the house, and the lawyers want their money and the husband is unable to pay?  Can they take the house from the woman in order to get their fees?  I would love to know that.  Perhaps it is unfair of me to ask the Minister to answer that now, but perhaps he can answer it.  I am told that that is one of the really serious difficulties under which this legislation will be operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill removes from our Statute Book forms of action which are clearly out of time with modern ideas and in some cases have been sources of very serious offence to women. I refer in particular to the action for breach of promise, the abolition of that, and the abolition of criminal conversation. Apart from this, section 10 has very practical relevance for young married couples buying houses where one of the spouses is under 21 years of age.  I would like to thank the Senators for their welcome for the Bill generally.  Senator FitzGerald expressed a personal view that he would not wish to see all the antiquities of law abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a functional and a practical thing to do what we are doing because as Senator Martin has stated, action for breach of promise is going to be considered in the context of the very luminous women whom he referred to.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald also suggested that wedding gifts should be defined.  The Law Reform Commission did not consider it necessary to define a wedding gift and I do not accept that any difficulty can arise from the absence of a definition.  It will be a matter of fact as to whether the gift is a wedding gift or not and I do not anticipate any difficulty in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the breach of promise action, if section 2 abolished this action only in respect of agreements entered into after the commencement of the Act, the position would be that having <Col N="2158" /> regard to the fact that an action could be taken up to six years after the actual breach of an agreement, which itself might be quite some time after the Bill became law because it could be a long engagement, it is possible that an action for a breach of promise of marriage could be instituted long after the Act becomes law.  Basically it would be impracticable not to have retrospection because you can envisage a situation where as and from the date of the coming into effect of the abolition of the action you might have what has been the traditional feature of Irish society, the long engagement.  You could have an engagement that was going on for x period before the coming into effect of the Act and went on for quite a considerable period after the coming into effect of the Act.  It would certainly be in conflict with the spirit of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>If you had on the one hand the action abolished but because of the fact that somebody chose to have an exhaustive period of engagement with another party, that person would have the right of action just because the duration of the engagement covered the period before the coming into effect of the law and some considerable time afterwards.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald asked why the Bill provides that the consent of a minor spouse for the sale of the household chattels will be good consent.  It is necessary that the circumstances, as I indicated in my opening remarks, that the consent of an under-aged spouse should be a valid consent when the house is being sold.  It should surely be then accepted that the consent should also be valid for the sale of the household chattels.  If the Law Reform Commission's recommendation is that the age of majority should be reduced to 18 years of age, or earlier marriage is accepted, the effect should be the same.</P>
    <P>The Government did not necessarily accept the Law Reform Commission's recommendation in all respects but I do not want it to appear that, regarding the commission's recommendation, which was as a result of exhaustive search by very eminent people, the implications of accepting or of not accepting a particular <Col N="2159" /> recommendation were not examined thoroughly by the Government.</P>
    <P>The question of the law of domicile was raised by Senator Cassidy and also by Senator Martin.  I would not like to enter into the area of reply on this question <i>per se</i> because I do not think you can take the law of domicile in the way that the Senators have indicated &mdash; in isolation from all the other effects in the area of other rights, such as property rights and maintenance rights.  For that reason it would be unwise of me to comment in view of the fact that the commission are examining this area.  I have on more than one occasion stated that in fairness to the commission and their work it would only be proper to await their findings and not do, as has been done by a Member of this House, Senator Robinson, and indeed by a Member of the Dáil, Deputy Keating, both of whom &mdash; for reasons obvious to me and I am sure clearly known to themselves &mdash; were prepared to move forward without even knowing the final recommendations of the commission, each in a particular area, but in respect of the law on domicile particularly, where Senator Robinson introduced her own Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin has raised the question on what happens when a female spouse has successfully won her case, where she has entitlement to the custody of her children and family home but where the husband is not prepared to meet his legal costs.  I do not wish to evade what the Senator is asking.  I will certainly examine it, if he would like me to do so, outside the House and consult with him on it.  I do not know the facts or the details but I make the point that it would seem most unreasonable.  I am satisfied that our courts have always considered reason and reasonableness as a very essential ingredient in any decision they take and I do not think, having regard to the implications of the 1976 Act, they would be prepared to act where it was reasonable to expect that the woman involved had acted reasonably.  In the absence of any details on the matter, I doubt it likely that the woman would be evicted by court order and be put out on the streets because she had an obligation to comply <Col N="2160" /> with a situation that was not of her making. However, I will certainly examine it. I do not know if we will have an opportunity in this House at a later point to discuss it &mdash; perhaps we may on Committee Stage &mdash; but I certainly will come back to it.</P>
    <P>Under the Family Home Protection Act the family home cannot be sold by one spouse without the prior consent of the other spouse.  It would be highly unlikely that a court would authorise the sale of the family home to meet the cost of proceedings brought by a spouse except, of course, in the most exceptional circumstances and we will investigate as to whether such circumstances are provided for.  I think that covers basically what was said and I would like to thank all Senators for their comments.</P>

      <P>Section 10 of this Bill is of very serious, urgent and practical importance for young couples buying houses where one of the spouses is under 21 years of age.  For such couples section 10 will obviate the necessity and expense of having a court application for the purpose of ensuring valid consent.  For that reason I am anxious that the Committee Stage be taken today.  The Government are aware of the importance of this matter to young house buyers and I think there should be no legal restrictions that would preclude them from being able to avail of all the offerings that have been made to them in recent months.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald was anxious to put forward some points and he thought other Senators might like to contribute in connection with amendments to the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill.  He suggested that could best be done this day fortnight rather than this day week.  For that reason I was not prepared to make hassle about it.</P>
