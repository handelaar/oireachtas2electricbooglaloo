    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1981, is intended to provide a measure of protection for tenants of dwellings which were controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts, 1960 and 1967.  These Acts were recently the subject of a Supreme Court decision which declared that, in important respects relating to the control of rents and the restrictions on the landlord's right to recover possession of dwellings, they were outside the provisions of the Constitution. This Bill will give tenants affected by the Supreme Court judgment protection against rent increases and against ejectment from their dwellings for a limited period of time.  It will be followed by a further Bill within six months to deal on a more permanent basis with the problems in this area.  For the moment we are called upon to respond quickly to a particularly grave social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision to which I referred declared unconstitutional Parts II and IV of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  The effect of this is that upward of 30,000 tenants of controlled dwellings have had their protection from rent increases and security of tenure under the Act removed.  Questions were raised in the Dáil about the actual number of tenants involved.  As I indicated then, there is no way of knowing what the actual numbers are.  However, on the basis of past trends, my Department estimate the number of such dwellings at present to be in the region of 30,000.  In any event the actions proposed here are not related to a particular estimate of the number of persons involved but are based on the realisation that a large number of <Col N="2264" /> persons, many of them from the poorest section of the community, are in need of protection and help.  This the Government are determined to provide.</P>
    <P>The basis for the Supreme Court's judgment was that the control of rents as operated under the 1960 Act constituted an unjust attack on the constitutionally guaranteed property rights of the citizen. This was because rents were fixed without provision for review, compensation, any regard to the respective economic circumstances of landlord and tenant, any limit on the period of restriction or any allowance for modification of the operation of the restriction.  This the Supreme Court held to be both arbitrary and unfair.  The restrictions on the landlord's right to recover possession were considered to be so closely entwined with the rent control provisions that they had no independent existence of their own and fell to be unconstitutional as a result.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to meet the situation arising out of the Supreme Court's decision.  It is a response to comments in the judgment which referred to the need for new legislation to deal with the statutory void created by the judgment and affecting this whole area.  It takes into account the recommendation of the court that in the period before such substantive legislation can be enacted, courts in dealing with an application for a decree for possession arising out of the judgment should either adjourn the case or grant a decision for possession with an appropriate stay of execution.</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively puts this recommendation on a statutory footing.  It does this by continuing for six months the restrictions of the landlord's right to possession set out in the 1960 Act and by making rent increases notified after the date of the High Court decision unenforceable for that period.</P>
    <P>Comments have been forthcoming from different quarters that this Bill itself might be unconstitutional.  This I do not consider to be the case.  This Bill, in its Long Title, refers specifically to certain provisions of the Constitution.  The effect of these has been amplified in the explanatory memorandum circulated on the Bill.  Under Article 43 the State may <Col N="2265" /> delimit by law the natural rights of property with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good and regulating them by the principles of social justice.  Article 45 pledges the State to direct its policy towards ensuring that the ownership and control of the natural resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes so as best to subserve the common good and to safeguard with special care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community.  In the face of these provisions of the Constitution, the temporary nature of the legislation and the explicit recommendation of the Supreme Court with regard to decrees for possession, I consider the Bill a proper, and indeed necessary, course of action for the Government to follow.</P>
    <P>The six month period of the operation of this Bill is intended to provide the breathing space for the Government to prepare and initiate, within the confines set by the Supreme Court's judgment, the appropriate policies and legislation that will be called for to meet the new situation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made in the Dáil that this period might not be long enough.  While I realise that the work which must be completed within the next six months is considerable I am confident that the necessary legislation will be ready when this Bill expires.  With regard to what future action is envisaged, the short time that this Government have been in office has not put us in the position to set out our final views on this complex subject.  At this stage I can go no further than refer to the programme for Government in which we have promised to secure fixity of tenure for existing tenants in rent controlled accommodation and to provide a scheme to subsidise rents where they are beyond the means of existing tenants.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Dáil on the Bill a number of suggestions were put forward for amendments.  Some of the suggestions had considerable merit in themselves, but they are really more appropriate to the substantive legislation which is to follow this Bill.  Further, as I <Col N="2266" /> indicated earlier, the Bill is designed to take into account the Supreme Court's judgment as well as the relevant provisions of the Constitution.  Suggested amendments to the Bill which would have the effect of negativing the Supreme Court judgment or which would conflict with the reasoning behind that judgment cannot be accepted.  Having regard to the need to deal immediately with a particularly urgent situation and the limitation of the Bill to six months, I have concluded that the Bill in its present form is the appropriate and best response.</P>
    <P>The situation facing the tenants of controlled dwellings is a serious one.  Nobody in this House can be unaware of the major change in the conditions governing the controlled rented sector which the Supreme Court's judgment will bring about.  The change will have far-reaching social implications with which we must cope while at the same time being fair to the interests of both landlords and tenants.  This Bill will provide the necessary breathing space in which to prepare the policies needed to deal with these social problems.  I accordingly commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend the courtesy of the House to the Minister of State on his first visit and to wish him well in his most important portfolio.  I am confining my comments on the Bill to the basic principles behind it.  The reason the Bill is before the House today is that Parts II and IV of the 1960 Rent Restrictions Act as amended by the 1967 Rent Restrictions Act were found in a judgment of the High Court, and upheld by the Supreme Court, to be repugnant to the Constitution in that they represent an unconstitutionally unjust attack on the property rights of the citizens of the State.  We have, therefore, to consider whether the Bill before us is an adequate response to what the Supreme Court called the statutory void which has resulted.  The preamble to the Bill suggests that the purpose of the Bill is to provide a measure of protection in conformity with the Supreme Court decision in order to enable legislation to be prepared and initiated.  But the central provisions <Col N="2267" /> of the Bill before us were contained in the parts of the Rent Restrictions Act which were found to be repugnant to the Constitution.  Section 5 repeats section 29 of the 1960 Act.  Part IV of the 1960 Act centres around section 29. Section 29, therefore, is central to Part IV of the 1960 Act, that part which has been found to violate the property rights of citizens.</P>
      <P>The reason that section 5 has to be enacted is that it ceased to be law at the date of the High Court judgment, namely, 18 April 1980, and it is not now law, so that the House is being asked to place on the Statute Book legislative provisions which both the High and the Supreme Courts have said are repugnant to the Constitution because, in the words of the Supreme Court judgment, they are an unconstitutionally unjust attack on the property rights of a section of the community.</P>
      <P>It is sought to justify this measure on two grounds: first, that it is temporary, and, second, that it is an attempt to implement the recommendations of the Supreme Court.  Let us take the first point.  No argument is needed to reject the proposition that the Oireachtas should do something which is contrary to the Constitution simply because the unlawful Act is to be temporary.  Is the Oireachtas to be told it is all right to do something unconstitutional because after all we are only doing it for six months? One does not need to argue against that kind of justification.  It is totally unreasonable to say that we can deprive a section of the community of their constitutional rights simply because we are doing it only for six months.  We cannot do it for six months; we cannot do it for six minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the second excuse we are given for this Bill&mdash;that it is an attempt to implement the recommendations of the Supreme Court.  It is, I am sorry to say, nothing of the sort.  The Supreme Court never suggested that the Oireachtas should adopt the extraordinary expedient now before the House. What the Supreme Court did say was that it assumed that new legislation would be <Col N="2268" /> speedily enacted and that such legislation might be expected to provide for the determination of fair rents, for a degree of security of tenure and for other relevant social and economic factors.  It is obvious that the court had in contemplation not the re-enactment of legislative provisions declared to be void because they were unconstitutional but rather the enactment of provisions which would be consistent with and totally in harmony with constitutional provisions and the fundamental property rights of all groups of citizens.</P>
    <P>Again it is suggested that the proposed temporary legislation is necessary pending the preparation and enactment of permanent legislation.  The Supreme Court never suggested temporary legislation. Indeed, it went on to indicate how steps might be taken for the protection of tenants pending the enactment of permanent legislation and it indicated the following steps.  First, that agreement should be reached wherever possible between landlords and tenants and, secondly, that where agreement is not possible it indicated that it as the duty of the courts in dealing with ejectments to have regard to the basic requirements of justice when exercising their jurisdiction.  The judgment went on to say that in this regard, in the reasonable expectation of new legislation, when a decree for possession is sought, the court should, where justice so warrants, in a case where the now condemned provisions of Part IV would have given a defence against the recovery of possession, either adjourn the case or grant a decree for possession with such stay as appears proper in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The onus here is placed on the courts specifically to provide, where necessary, a stay of execution.  Nowhere does the Supreme Court say that it is the duty of the Oireachtas to provide a stay of execution.</P>
    <P>I have already remarked and I now repeat how the preamble to this Bill suggests that its purpose is to provide a measure of protection in conformity with the Supreme Court decision in order to enable legislation to be prepared and initiated.  But the Supreme Court never suggested <Col N="2269" /> temporary legislation.  As I have just stated, they have taken us by the hand and shown us how the rights of the tenant should be protected pending the enactment of legislation in conformity with the Constitution.  To purport, therefore, to re-enact legislative provisions declared to be unconstitutional is to usurp the constitutional functions of the Judiciary and is, in any event, a wasted exercise.  Since such provisions in the parent Act have been declared to be unconstitutional then <i>a fortiori</i> the same provisions in amending legislation must also be repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The House is being asked to do something wholly without precedent.  We must be aware that the vindication of the fundamental rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution can be guaranteed only if the organs of the State act in harmony. In their judgment the High Court and the Supreme Court have discharged their constitutional function in this regard and it is now up to the Oireachtas to do likewise.  This duty cannot be discharged by a measure which will negative and render nugatory and ineffective&mdash;although only for a period of six months&mdash;the decisions of the superior courts.</P>
    <P>Apart from this fundamental argument it should be observed that it can scarcely be reassuring for the citizens who will have the vindication of their constitutional rights postponed or set at nought to tell them that this is a temporary measure.  The whole notion of rent control was introduced as temporary in 1915 and temporary amending legislation continued control until it was made permanent in 1960.  There are too many other examples of measures introduced as temporary which have now become part of the permanent law of the State.  The measure proposed, if enacted, would be void and the proposals in it are a demonstrably unacceptable invasion of the judicial domain.  For these reasons I believe the Bill should be rejected by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few brief words to say on this Bill.  I listened almost unbelievingly to the contribution from Senator Cassidy.  I have no doubt that the Senator is extremely concerned, as we all are, about the situation arising after the <Col N="2270" /> Supreme Court decision, but it would seem that she is prepared to allow countless thousands of vulnerable people to be put out on the side of the road, bringing back visions of very bad times indeed.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a measure which had to be brought in as quickly as possible.  It had to be brought in now in order to give time for thoughtful and caring consideration of the preparation of a complete set of measures both social and legislative which will protect people who are most affected by the Supreme Court decision, and this House is being given the opportunity to do something quickly to protect a great many people.</P>
      <P>The whole constitutional question of private property arises when we discuss this issue as it arises on so many other issues also.  This country must face up to the various implications of the constitutional provisions concerning private property.  This shock which we all had arising from the Supreme Court decision is very good in one way in that it might make us all give our full attention to the implications for the ordinary citizen and for social legislation of the constitutional provisions on private property.</P>
      <P>However, this Bill before us was envisaged and organised by the previous administration who were absolutely clear in their undertaking to protect the vulnerable after the Supreme Court decision.  It would be totally unthinkable either to leave the situation as it is or to rush through very major legislation without giving it proper time for preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must first express my surprise at Senator Cassidy's contribution.  I understand that this Bill was drafted by the outgoing administration of which Senator Cassidy, as far as I know, was a supporter.  In the Dáil the Bill, although criticised in detail, was accepted in a bipartisan spirit.  It seems to be a very independent stand indeed for Senator Cassidy to be challenging the whole Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Hussey, I can say that the measure before us makes me think a little about the basic issues which the Bill raises, apart from the immediate emergency, so to speak.  The first thing that any Member of either House must think about is the alarming extent to which the <Col N="2271" /> courts are now having to tell the Oireachtas how to run its business.  This, I hasten to add, is the fault of the Oireachtas.  In recent years there have been numerous cases in which it was quite obvious that because the Houses have neglected the legislation, that legislation has been pointed out to be defective and anti-constitutional.  I think many Senators would share my views and my uneasiness about this kind of legislation by court decision.</P>
    <P>The other fundamental reflection raised by the Bill and by the circumstances which gave rise to it is the way in which the courts seem to be constantly interpreting the Constitution as upholding the rights of private property against the common good, so that it is not simply the rights of landlords of rent-controlled premises that are being upheld.  On other occasions the rights of ground rent landlords and their right to be compensated have been upheld, again based on the interpretation of the privacy of private property as against the common good. Land speculators whose property is required for public development also are considered to be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>I do think that when the framer of our Constitution went to work the terms &ldquo;property&rdquo; and &ldquo;private property&rdquo; were not really meant as the right of large landlords or land speculators or anything of this kind.  In Deputy de Valera's day &ldquo;property&rdquo; meant property in a distributivist sense, in the vein in which people like Chesterton and Belloc used it, the property of the small man.  In the way things have turned out and in the various court decisions in these matters that is not the sense in which property is being emphasised.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement is an oblique rebuke to the courts and very rightly emphasised Article 43 of the Constitution which might well be receiving more attention from the courts than some of the other articles.  Article 43,2.2º clearly de-limits the rights to private property in the interests of the common good.  Article 45 in that section of the Constitution, which is not cognisable by the courts, emphasises the importance of the weaker <Col N="2272" /> sections of the community.  I should be glad indeed if this present temporary measure were to prompt the Government to consider the much larger issues which arise out of the interpretations of the courts in these matters.</P>
    <P>Possibly Senator Cassidy's point is that the measure is unconstitutional.  I am at the moment prepared to accept the consensus in the other House and the Minister's assurance that it is not anti-constitutional.  One approves of it as an emergency measure.  I share the reservations of people who are concerned about section 2 which limits this operation to six months.  This will certainly concentrate the minds of the parliamentary draftsmen very much.  Section 4 is very obscurely worded.</P>
    <P>I am glad, like Senator Hussey, that the interests of the poor, the elderly and the infirm, pensioners and so on, who would seem to be the greatest victims of the consequence of the court's decision, will be protected or at least will be given a stay of execution, so to speak.  It has been pointed out that they suffer as much psychologically as materially from the consequences of the court decision.  Senators have received a memorandum from Threshold, which is a voluntary housing body, which informs, and advises and does research on certain housing conditions &mdash; an admirable organisation.  The memorandum they have sent us is informative and well researched.  Perhaps it will be more useful later on when more substantive legislation is being considered.  It points to the curious lack of data to which the Minister refers in his address.  It points out also some of the consequences of the court ruling which have already become evident.  On page 11 of the Threshold memorandum it is stated:</P>
    <P>One case of which we do have information involves a group of some 85 controlled tenancies situated in a central Dublin area and owned by a single company.  Before the High Court decision the dwellings were on offer to the tenants at an average price of around £400.  In the weeks following the decision the asking price has risen to figures <Col N="2273" /> ranging from four and five thousand pounds.  The asking price for tenant purchase was dramatically affected by the court decision.</P>
    <P>The memorandum from Threshold also very interestingly points out the problems that landlords have as well as tenants.  They point out that the whole rent control sector is a problem area for landlords.  Page 7 of the memorandum says:</P>
    <P>Rent Control has in this way, actually encouraged the neglect of residential property and dwellings have thus been lost from our housing stock which could have been maintained for relatively modest maintenance outlays spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I am not going to develop my final point because there will be a further opportunity to do so but the term &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; is not uniformly a disparaging one. There are Rachmans in the business and of course we are all conditioned by the historical connotation of the term &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; or the folk historical connotations there might be.  But in fact not all landlords were baddies and not all tenants were goodies.  Just as 19th century landlords in Ireland sometimes were simply unable to improve the conditions of their tenants because they were impoverished, there are landlords, it is a matter of record, who are poorer than their tenants and there are documented cases of well off people paying ridiculously nominal rents to landlords who are poorer than themselves.</P>
    <P>This anomaly raises the final question of what will be the eventual outcome of the substantive legislation.  It is the policy, as I understand it, of the Government and of the constituent parties which make up the Coalition to implement the rent tribunal's fair rent proposals.  The trouble here is that if you implement fair rent, and a rent tribunal will obviously be weighted in favour of the tenant both in terms of rent, fixity of tenure and so on, the landlord may well become an obsolete phenomenon in all this.  In other words, the landlord will not consider it worth his while to invest.  As the Threshold memorandum pointed out, rent controlled <Col N="2274" /> property tends to decay, become dilapidated, because it is in nobody's interest to maintain it.  Therefore, the Environment Department may well consider, when they are framing the more substantive legislation, that in the end the appropriate remedy is for the State or local authorities to purchase properties like this.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 July a colleague of mine from University College, Cork, Mr. Donal Nunan, an economist, had an article which is relevant to our present consideration.  This is his ultimate conclusion: &ldquo;The appropriate remedy is for the State&rdquo;&mdash;and I would put in as an alternative &ldquo;or local authorities&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to purchase the properties in question rather than bring in a general system of fair rents which will compel all landlords to subsidise the accommodation of their tenants; and not because of their proven greater financial capacity to do so compared with the rest of society, but because they happen to be landlords.&rdquo;  A more useful form of rent control, he concludes, would be for the State to encourage the supply of additional accommodation to let rather than penalise its voluntary provision.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I am very glad to see him here and I hope that both of us will see each other here for some time to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Murphy's last remarks and welcome the Minister. He has a very onerous task before him but I know he is able for it.  With regard to the Bill, I think Senator Cassidy's case falls down.  She quoted certain sections of Article 43 of the Constitution, which protects the right of property, which states that the State cannot legislate against that right, and which establishes the right to inherit property.  The former Minister for the Environment was quite correct in the other House when he quoted Article 43 and read the various sections.  He quoted Section 2.1º, which reads: &ldquo;the State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.&rdquo; Paragraph 2 provides that: &ldquo;The State, accordingly may as occasion requires <Col N="2275" /> delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.&rdquo;  That is what is happening in this case and what motivated the former Minister for the Environment when he brought in the legislation.  Senator Cassidy's argument fails because her case was largely based on the fact that people had certain rights, that those rights had to be protected and that you could not do anything to protect those rights.  However, in fact the Constitution says that you can.  This is what the Bill is doing &mdash; it is protecting those rights over a limited period.</P>
      <P>It would be a strange Constitution if it did not give that sort of protection.  If we had not a Constitution fellows like me would be standing up screaming about people who lived in houses for up to 60 and 70 years of their lifetime and maybe longer.  These people are on fixed rents. Then somebody by some sort of speculative deal, takes over control of that property and stipulates conditions they just cannot afford to live up to.  Eventually an eviction order is given against them.  Now, we could not, whether we have a Constitution or otherwise, put up with that situation.</P>
      <P>The fact is what we are doing is constitutional.  There is a section in the Constitution which provides for it.  The former Minister was guided by that and I am glad that he took the initiative in this respect.</P>
      <P>The arguments advanced by Senator Murphy were very interesting, but they would be more suitable for a much wider debate on the substantive legislation, which, in fact, will be needed.  The former administration introduced a Bill which would have been welcomed by all sides. This Bill was accepted in the other House &mdash; there was a mutual acceptance of it there and I cannot see how we can take any other line of action on this Bill in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people now need a degree of security.  The Constitution says that we should give it to them and the Bill proposes to give them that security of tenure and protection against an increase of rent for a period of six months.  The other Acts <Col N="2276" /> that were introduced earlier did, in fact, allow people to get increases in their rents and, in that sense it looked after the owners of property.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, we need this measure to look after those in society who cannot protect themselves.  I would suggest to the House that it is urgently needed and that we should not delay it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly obvious, following the Supreme Court decision, that some measure was necessary to protect the rights and security of those in controlled rent situations.  The need for this emergency legislation is a fairly serious reflection on all administrations going back over very many years because, as has been said already, the provisions are to protect the common good, which is the greater good of the greater number of people and, particularly, families in certain circumstances in these homes.  On the other hand, without in any way involving ourselves in defending vested interests, or landlords as they are called, we must all acknowledge that over the years there have been very many injustices to people who purchased houses and let them for rent, pre-1945, as an investment on which they could retire but found subsequently&mdash;not only up to the time that rates were removed&mdash;they were liable in many cases for repairs in situations where the income from the rent was totally unrealistic.  In that sense, the courts have moved to the side of those to whom an injustice has been done.  It is a reflection on all administrations, and I, together with other Members of the House, have sympathy with the Minister in that some measure was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conflict in Senator Cassidy's mind is one that is in all our minds and it is difficult to perceive how, if there is a Constitution, you can play ducks and drakes with it.  How can you tell your courts to postpone the effective law, because that is what this Bill intends to do?  From the point of view of the common good and of the natural sympathy that we all feel for people who find themselves in a threatened situation, while it may be, as the Minister has said, <i>ultra vires,</i> so to speak, all our sympathies lie <Col N="2277" /> with protecting people for the time being. The question will resolve itself in due course as to whether a measure which postpones the effect of a decision of the Supreme Court can be found to be a practical measure at all.  I would question, as it was questioned in the other House, whether six months is sufficient to enable agreement to be reached on the sort of legislation that is necessary in a situation like this, in order, on the one hand, to do justice to those who own property and have been at a very serious loss, sometimes over a life time, because of legal enactments, and, on the other hand, to defend the common interests of families who may be faced with ejection.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view that if we have no certain means of solving a problem we should try whatever means is available, and this Bill appears to be the only means available to us at present.  It does not stop any of us with commonsense from asking how in the name of goodness one can set aside a decision of the Supreme Court? It is difficult to perceive how one can do that sort of thing but in the common interests of people it may be justifiable for the time being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first to join other Senators in welcoming the Minister on his first appearance in the House.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I, too, am still puzzled, in spite of the explanations given, and perhaps even because of the length of the recitative in the Long Title, as to how statutory restrictions pronounced to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court can validly be re-enacted, even for a short period.  I have no wish to pose as a constitutional lawyer and I would like to say that I do not regard a six months' suspension as objectionable or unreasonable, provided it can be validly put into effect.</P>
      <P>Leaving that doubt aside, my basic concern is whether, other than in very special circumstances, rent control is a form of regulation of private rights consistent with the principles of social justice or of good economic sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the explanatory memorandum reminds us, rent control was introduced as a temporary war-time measure.  It <Col N="2278" /> could be justified when incomes, prices, fees and everything else were being controlled to safeguard the life of the community and to prerserve some measure of social equity at a time of scarcity and grave difficulties of all kinds.  But rent control alone has persisted in a rigid form in peace-time.  Incomes are now determined by negotiations between the parties at national, firm or individual level. Prices, in the non-competitive areas, are still subject to general surveillance but surveillance by a specialised body with access to professional advice.  Allowance for cost increases is virtually automatic in price control.  What is the case, economic or social, for continuing to severely clamp down the rents of a wide range of properties, subject only to such relaxations as an ordinary court may allow?</P>
    <P>It seems that the economic case is not good, because, so far as rents are kept below an economic return, existing properties must go into dilapidation for want of adequate repair and maintenance and new properties for letting at low rents will not be constructed because the return is insufficient.  In other words, the trend must be towards a dwindling and deteriorating stock of houses for letting.</P>
    <P>Coming to the social case, I find it no less questionable, and I will try to show this by an illustration.  Let us suppose that we all recognise that there is a certain amount of poverty in a particular district. Would it be thought consistent with the principles of social justice if we were to enact a law which declared that all the residents in that district were entitled to get their groceries at half price from local suppliers?  The crudeness and inequity of any provision which did not distinguish between residents in need and those not in need, and inflicted the burden on suppliers irrespective of their capacity to bear it, would make such a law so ridiculous as to be unthinkable.  Yet the rent restrictions code is scarcely much better. The Minister said he thought there were about 30,000 tenants in controlled dwellings; he was not too sure of the precise number, but how many of whatever number it is are in a position of need?  Nobody can tell us that.</P>
    <P>I echo here what Senator Ruairí <Col N="2279" /> Brugha said: it is high time for Governments to reconsider fundamentally the social justice requirement and how it can best be met in normal circumstances. There is a scarcity of the supply of rentable houses in relation to demand, and this could create opportunities to charge more than an economic rent.  If there were no control, there could be exploitation through overcharging.  A general surveillance over rents of particular categories of property could be exercised by a specialised professional body like the National Prices Commission.  In general, however, I would favour letting economic rents prevail, just as economic prices prevail, and dealing with social needs by direct payments to supplement the incomes of those whose incomes are too low to enable them to afford to pay an economic rent.  That is the way we deal with social need in all other cases.  By that more rational and selective approach, market and investment distortions would be avoided and inequities as between individuals would be avoided as far as possible.  The present system of rent control is unsound and ought to be replaced, I suggest, by a combination of general supervision to ensure that only economic rents are charged and social payments to supplement incomes in cases of individual need.  Although only six months remain, I hope it is along these lines the Government will be thinking about appropriate policies and legislation to replace the present outmoded code.</P>

      <P>May I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister to this House and join Senator Murphy in hoping we may be here with him for a long time?  I would also like to join in the welcome to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be certain difficulties about enacting this type of legislation, but there is a qualitative difference between enacting legislation for six months only, with the promise that it will be changed and reviewed at the end of that period, and saying that for an indefinite period a certain right is to be removed.  In a sense, a Bill like this almost gives effect to the idea of the Supreme Court, which was <Col N="2280" /> clearly expressed in its judgment, that immediately after the decision there should not be a lemming-like rush of people to eject tenants or to raise rents enormously.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy has set out the various ways the Supreme Court recommended that this should be dealt with through the courts, but I am inclined to think that the learned judges of the Supreme Court were a little optimistic in their view that the majority of landlords and tenants would be able to do this by voluntary agreement.  Anybody who practises the law must be aware that there were large numbers of ejectment proceedings held in cold storage awaiting the Supreme Court judgment in order to rush them into court, and some kind of protection would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The idea that the courts should deal with each case on the basis of the individual judgment of a justice is not so easy to achieve in practice where these kinds of ejectment proceedings and small landlord and tenant proceedings are dealt with in such very large numbers.  To take each case separately would put the Circuit Court back to the position they were in before their recent reform where one could not get a case on for several years. It is a good idea to bring in a six months moratorium on what can be done about this while new legislation is being enacted.</P>
    <P>As regards the almost seeming contradiction within the provisions of the Constitution about the rights of private property and the common good, there was an extremely interesting discussion on this subject some years ago in the Kenny Report.  Mr. Justice Kenny wrote about the possibility of acquisition of land for building development, and discussed very fully the whole implication of the balance between the right of the individual to private property and the right of the common good.  He drew attention to the situation Senator Murphy referred to where one tends to think of private property as being the house belonging to an individual person, and not property belonging to enormous development corporations or very large companies.  That report would be well worth studying by <Col N="2281" /> those who are framing the new legislation.</P>
    <P>As other Senators have emphasised, the difficulty in this situation is one of balance.  Although research is needed into what the real situation is, it is well known that many of the people who live in rent-controlled accommodation are the poor, the weak and those in need of protection&mdash;and they do need protection&mdash;from exploitation.  On the other hand it is also well known that not all those living in rent-controlled accommodation are like that.  There are many landlords who cannot afford to repair their premises and there is the discouragement to bring new houses into the reasonably rented accommodation area. The crudeness and inequity that Senator Whitaker referred to is what must be avoided in framing new legislation.</P>
    <P>Landlords must be encouraged to provide properties that will create a stock of reasonably rented accommodation.  We need such a stock, particularly in urban areas.  At the same time, there must be control to prevent exploitation of those who really need protection.  I hope this was the direction in which the judgment of the Supreme Court was moving.</P>
    <P>The Government have almost a monumental task in trying to frame all this legislation within six months.  I would not join with people who say that one should lengthen the period because, like all human beings, parliamentary draftsmen and Government Departments tend to put things off, and the longer the period one makes it, the longer it will stretch out.  If people are told that they must provide it within six months and there is a danger that if they do not do that the six months period legislation will become unconstitutional as well, it will be much more effective.</P>
    <P>We will not then have the situation, as happened with the original rent control legislation, where it was introduced as a temporary wartime measure and lasted for the next 70 years.</P>
    <P>The most important effect of this legislation is that it will hold the position in cold storage and as such I welcome it. When the Government bring in this awaited new legislation it will be of <Col N="2282" /> supreme importance that a balance be held between the danger of exploiting the weaker tenants and the danger of creating a climate where there will be no rented accommodation available.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  I am delighted he is appointed to the housing section.  I know his interest in housing and I am satisfied that he will do a very good job.  I wish him luck and every success in it.  Like previous Senators, I hope that he will be there for some time.</P>
      <P>Approximately 30,000 people are affected by this.  It would be impossible to get a breakdown on that figure and that is one of the reasons for the delay of six months.  If we got a breakdown we would find that 90 per cent of these people are in receipt of old age pensions, disability benefit, etc.  The delaying period of six months is to see where we are going.  Senator Cassidy was critical of it and that is understandable.  We must remind Senator Cassidy that this Bill was inherited by the Government.  It is of the last Government's making and I doubt if the Minister will accept responsibility for more than the six months' period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister.  I wish him every success in his new appointment.  It is obvious from the debate here and in the Dáil and the general response that we are dealing with an urgent and important social problem.  I do not suppose one could find an issue that worries people to the very nature of their being as much as security of home and accommodation.  We are all very conscious of our history in this regard and a home and roof over our head is of fundamental social importance.  For that reason it is important that we have an immediate response to the decision of the Supreme Court to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As public representatives we all agree that the worry and anxiety that this decision caused to people living in rent-controlled accommodation was enormous. The numbers are hard to calculate and I sympathise with any Department that has to calculate them.  A figure of 30,000 <Col N="2283" /> has been mentioned.  I thought it would have been more.  That figure has to be analysed.  Each of the tenants is not in the same position but the number of people who were worried to distraction by the possibility of finding themselves faced with enormously increased rents or else no accommodation was frightening. Elderly people who lived in accommodation for many years and had reason to believe they had security legally felt endangered and threatened.  That worry and anxiety was sufficient to eliminate all hope of normal living or happiness in their lives.  It is essential that we respond with this legislation to the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>It is a very complex and complicated situation.  Many issues come before this House because that is the way society is today.  It is important that we are as analytical and sensitive as we can be in dealing with the problem.  Every tenant is not a poor person and everybody who owns property is not wealthy person. There are many cases of hardship on the part of owners of property who have not got the means to look after the property and are not getting sufficient income from it.  That is a very grave social problem.  As far as I know, if they had any legal redress available to them they had to go to court and prove financial stringency.  That meant exactly what it said. They had to prove financial stringency, that they simply could not continue to live unless they got the support of the court in acquiring the property.  That also has to be balanced, understood and fed into any subsequent legislation that will follow this Bill, hopefully in six months' time.  Our job as legislators is to be aware of that and to respond to it.</P>
    <P>While we are dealing today with this Bill we are really discussing the overall problem in its entirety, and the subsequent debates in the legislation to follow will be of fundamental importance. We are dealing with a problem of accommodation which has changed dramatically since the 1960 Act which was the subject of the Supreme Court decision.  The whole situation in relation to housing and accommodation has changed dramatically <Col N="2284" /> as our society and our economy has changed.  We have to take into account the enormous effect of inflation over that period of time, the population growth and the justifiable expectations of people that they and their children are entitled to share in the progress of the country.  We must also take into account the requirements in providing that accommodation, the building skills and the financial structures needed when we set about drafting the subsequent legislation, which really has to be the solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>We accept we have an urgent fundamental problem now and that it is right to respond to it in this way.  But we should accept that we as legislators must have the ability and sensitivity to respond to this highly complex problem in a way that recognises the apparent conflicting needs of both the landlord and the tenant.</P>
    <P>The question of the constitutionality of this Bill providing that solution to the problem that would otherwise be created is so important that I and everybody else wants to be assured that this solution is not open to legal attack and that it cannot be found to be unconstitutional.  I hope that the essential job we have set ourselves to do is something that will be done bearing in mind that six months is a relatively short time.  It is a very long time for the tenants to be left without protection, but in terms of drafting legislation of the complexity and sensitivity which will be needed it could turn out to be a short time.  If it is necessary to come back again, perhaps the Minister could assure us that the situation will be met then either with a subsequent Bill or with some solution to ensure that this gap is provided for in a way which is free from legal attack on constitutional grounds and in such a way that we as legislators on this very fundamental social problem can respond to the need with sensitivity and with social justice in a way that is not frustrated by legal argument or legal quibble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment: (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their congratulations and good wishes to me in my new office. <Col N="2285" /> Having for a long time had a deep interest in local government matters I am sure I will find my new responsibilities very rewarding.  I also thank the Senators for their constructive and helpful approach to the Bill so that it may be indeed speedily enacted.  Among my first duties as Minister of State has been bringing forward this legislation to safeguard the position of tenants of controlled dwellings whose continued occupation of their dwellings may have been put in doubt by the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two main provisions. These are in section 4, which for the six months during which the Act is in force makes an increase in rent of a controlled dwelling unenforcible, and in section 5, which for the same period reintroduces restrictions on the landlord's rights to recover possession of a dwelling.  The Bill is an emergency measure to deal with a major social problem and to provide the Government with a breathing space in which to examine the full implications of the Supreme Court judgment and so as to ensure that we bring in a legislative measure to meet the situation on both sides.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy was very concerned about the constitutionality of the Bill and it is only right that these fears should be expressed in the House.  It is not my wish to usurp the Supreme Court judgment. One has to be guided by natural justice. The Bill is founded on important principles enshrined in the Constitution.  This is amply demonstrated in the Long Title of the Bill.  Article 43 of the Constitution, mentioned in the Long Title of the Bill acknowledges the natural rights to property but recognises that in a civil society those rights ought be regulated by the principles of social justice.  The State may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of those rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.  This is what we are trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision was thrust upon me in my first week as Minister.  The problem has caused me and others in the House great distress as we are aware of a larger number of people who are at risk.  We are asking for the six months so as to gain a breathing <Col N="2286" /> space in which to bring in substantive legislation which will be fair to everybody and which will interpret the Supreme Court decision.  That is a clear indication that it is not my wish to infringe the Supreme Court decision.  We are acting in the spirit of that decision.  They indicated that there was a void and that legislation was necessary.  Given that legislation is necessary, they requested the lower courts not to make decisions or to defer the implementation of such decisions.  We accept the Supreme Court decision as being correct.  We need time and, given the provisions of Article 43 of the Constitution, we are acting constitutionally.  Time will ensure that we can, in the spirit of the Supreme Court decision, implement the substantive legislation needed.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have time. Members expressed fears that six months would not be long enough.  I have instructed my Department to ensure that a Bill will be before the House in the next session and I hope it will be law before Christmas.  That is what we will be aiming for.  I do not like the idea of temporary legislation.  This is not in the spirit of the Supreme Court's judgment.  It is not the spirit of what I want here in this Bill.  We are sincerely seeking a breathing time in which to implement the Bill.  Neither do I think we are being emotive when we say that there are a lot of elderly people involved.  The very fact that this restriction goes back a number of years means that most of the people affected would be elderly, many living on fixed incomes, their livelihoods at risk.  It is important, therefore, that their fears be allayed.  I believe this is causing grave concern to a number of people.  The speedy passage of this legislation will help to alleviate these very genuine fears.  It must be admitted that a number of these people have already been approached and asked for exorbitant rents.  That reason alone is sufficient for having this six months in which to operate.</P>
    <P>I am happy also that by and large the House recognises the need for this six months stay.  I am happy also that the Bill will pass all Stages quickly.  By so doing we can demonstrate that the interests of <Col N="2287" /> the people at risk are protected, given the Government's commitment that there will be in the substantive legislation fixity of tenure and that there will be an allowance added to the supplementry allowance to augment their rent.  By devising such measures we will be meeting the wishes of the Supreme Court judgment.  People have asked why we wait for the courts to take decisions for us.  That is a valid question but one can only think of the political consequences of its implementation.  Successive Governments may have been very slow to implement the provisions of the legislation. Now that it has been thrust on us by the Supreme Court there is no alternative to taking these difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a further comment on this matter.  The Supreme Court judgment will bring about fundamental changes in the respective positions of landlord and tenant.  Perhaps it is true to say that in a very short time landlords stand to benefit from the decision.  In the Dáil I asked that they be patient and wait six months.  They have had a decision in their favour.  It is not a question of this Bill upturning or changing the decision of the court; it is not and that has been accepted.  That is why I would ask landlords to be patient for the next six months.  I can assure them that whatever legislation is brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas will be fair and in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment.  Basically that is what we all want to see.</P>
    <P>Again, that is the reason I ask that this House pass this Bill quickly.  Certainly it should be debated fully to ensure that what we are doing is correct.  It is my view that this Bill is constitutional and is in accordance with the Supreme Court decision.  I again assure the House that we will have the appropriate legislation through within the six months.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question on subsection (7).  I think I am correct in saying that section 5, apart from subsection (7), is taken work for word, line for line, comma for comma from section 29 of the 1960 Act. It leaves out the small subsection (4) of the 1960 Act which I do not think has any relevance now.  These are the provisions which have been found unconstitutional; they have all died.  Would the Minister agree that we are now in the process of resurrecting them?  On subsection (7), is it not a reversal of the orders for possession given by the courts, whether it was <Col N="2290" /> the District Court, the Circuit Court or the High Court, since 18 April 1980?  Is it not a reversal of existing orders of all the lower courts?</P>

In many cases the courts will have decided in favour of the landlords since 18 April 1980, 15 months ago.  What we are trying to do is say that in such cases these orders must be reversed and, having power to do that, is it not blatant interference with the functions of the courts?</P>

Is it not any order made since 18 April 1980 or is it any order since 29 June?  As I read it, it seems to suggest that orders made since 18 April 1980, if they have been made by any of the lower courts in favour of the landlords, will have to be reversed.</P>

However, I do not think that is relevant at all.  The only thing that is relevant is that we should know what we are about here.  What we are about here today is to be concerned with the separation of the judicial and the legislative functions.  Perhaps the events of the last few weeks have so befogged and befuddled our minds that we are too <Col N="2292" /> tired from standing on kitchen chairs outside chaple gates and mouthing inanities at the electorate that we have let this fact escape us.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Employment Gurantee Fund Act, 1980, so as to permit a further Exchequer contribution of <Col N="2293" /> £10 million to the Employment Guarantee Fund.</P>
      <P>You will recall, a Chathaoirligh, that the second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development provides for a Government contribution to a new Employment Guarantee Fund. The previous Government were committed to making £10 million available for that purpose and, as I announced in Dáil Éireann on last Thursday 9 July 1981, this Government are prepared to fulfil that commitment.</P>
      <P>While the text of the Second National Understanding speaks of a new Employment Guarantee Fund, no practical purpose would be served by setting up an entirely new fund, rather than extending the existing fund, and there would be considerable administrative complications in doing this.  I am satisfied therefore that the best way of fulfilling the commitment under the second national understanding is to provide further resources for the existing fund.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to amend section 4 of the 1980 Act so as to increase the limit on the amount which may be paid into the Employment Guarantee Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas from £10 million to £20 million.  Amendments to section 7 of the 1980 Act are also required so as to provide for:</P>
      <P>(i) an increase of the limit on aggregate payments out of the Employment Guarantee Fund from £20 million to £30 million;</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(ii) the winding-up of the Employment Guarantee Fund when the aggregate expenditure from the fund reaches £30 million, instead of £20 million as provided for in the 1980 Act.</P>
      <P>The Employment Guarantee Fund under the first national understanding comprised a Government contribution of £10 million and an employer contribution &mdash;also of £10 million.  This latter contribution was collected by means of a 0.35 per cent surcharge on the employer social security contribution for the period 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £20 million which accrued to the <Col N="2294" /> Employment Guarantee Fund under the first national understanding has all been allocated for a very wide variety of job-creation projects.  There are 33 such projects and employment created as a result of these projects will amount to 2,800 man-years of employment approximately.  Of these, 1,800 man-years arose in 1980 and 1,000 man-years will be achieved in 1981.  Employment arising from the further Exchequer contribution to the fund of £10 million will be additional to this.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there will be no employer contribution to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the second national understanding.  This is a response which I very much regret. Therefore, the Government will alone contribute.  I should, however, point out that the employers will voluntarily contribute 0.2 per cent of payroll towards financing a further new scheme of aid for industries in certain sensitive and vulnerable sectors.  This scheme, which will be known as the Employers' Employment Contribution Scheme, replaces the Employers' Temporary Subvention Scheme funded from the Employment Guarantee Fund.  It received the approval of this House on 27 May 1981. It operates independently of the Employment Guarantee Fund and is administered by the employer organisations themselves.</P>
    <P>I gave an undertaking in the Dáil that, in deciding on the uses to which the furthe sum of £10 million for the fund will be put, the Government will consult with employer and trade union representatives.  I repeat that undertaking here.  The involvement of the social partners in the allocation of the original £20 million accruing to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the first national understanding was a very constructive development and was welcomed by both employers and the trade union movement.  I would like to pay tribute to the employer and trade union representatives who participated in this work.  Indeed, I might point out that my colleague, Senator Fintan Kennedy, was a member of that committee and, as I understand it, he attended a great many <Col N="2295" /> meetings of that committee.  That is the kind of contribution which was made and for which the Government are indeed most grateful.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this Government will have fruitful dialogue with the social partners on this and other matters.  There are many features of the common programme agreed by the two parties represented in this Government which meet concerns felt by employers and workers. In particular, this Government are committed to the concept of planning for economic and social development.  Effective planning is assisted by the co-operation of employer and trade union organisations and I hope that this co-operation will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I recommend that this House approve the Bill and, with the co-operation of Members, I hope we will be able to obtain all Stages today.  As it is a Money Bill we had to have the Seanad meet.  We would be grateful to have all Stages passed so that the necessary consultations can take place now between the employer-trade union organisations with the Government and we will then proceed to expend the fund as expeditiously and as effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new Minister of State, Deputy Barry Desmond, to the House and wish him well in his work in the Department to which he has been assigned.  There is no hesitation on this side of the House in welcoming this proposal and we will, of course, give it all Stages.  The sooner it is approved and the Minister is allowed to proceed with the underlying objectives in providing the additional £10 million, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, as the Minister says, regrettable that the employer side is not involved in this.  I understand that there are good reasons for this.  One should welcome the voluntary contribution of .2 per cent mentioned by the Minister in connection with a further scheme for aid for industries in certain sensitive and vulnerable sectors.  I would be glad if the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, will indicate some of the areas in which it might be proposed between the Government and <Col N="2296" /> the social partners to expend this.  The situation in which the Government find themselves is no different from the situation in which the previous administration found themselves, trying to provide positive, effective remedies for securing employment on as broad a scale as possible.  This measure, we take it, is intended to continue the objectives of the previous administration in that regard.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister said that in deciding the uses of the fund he will consult with employer and union representatives.  It may be possible that he is not in a position to indicate the areas in which it might be intended to use the funds.  If so, I can only welcome his efforts and encourage him to engage in the dialogue to which he has referred with the social partners I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister will have a fruitful period in office as a Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister and wish him well in the difficult task that lies ahead.  Concerned as we all are about the very serious unemployment position, all Members must welcome this Bill intended as it is to improve job creation.  If there is one note of criticism it must be that the amount of money provided for the fund is inadequate.  We can say already, in advance of applications being made for grants from the fund, that it will prove inadequate. That has been our experience in respect of the first fund set up under the first national understanding.  Very soon after the fund was set up and went into operation the number of applications for finance to support different projects far exceeded the £20 million in it.  In view of the deteriorating economic position this will undoubtedly be our experience perhaps at a very early date in respect of the fund.  Bearing that in mind and also the fact that, as one who participated in the joint committee administering this fund, I found that most of the applications were worthy ones and all designed to create employment opportunities, including the new Waterford Airport project which was justifiably supported, I ask the Minister to keep the matter under review with a view to exploring the possibility, <Col N="2297" /> and the desirability, of increasing the amount of money in the fund if that is necessary as, unfortunately, I think it will be.</P>
      <P>I note that section 4 relates to an upper limit but I am not quite so certain that, regardless of that limit, the Government through some means or other could increase the amount of money in the fund if desirable.  I know it is early days yet for the Minister and he may not be in a position to give that guarantee but I should like to ask him to consider reviewing the work of the committee and the amount of money in the fund from time to time with a view to adding to it if necessary.</P>

The opportunity should, to a greater extent, have been a means of allaying the consequences of unemployment and the lengthy dole queues for a period more than was provided in the original legislation.  I congratulate the Minister and assure him that he will get full support from this side of the House.  We hope that the educational as well as the practical results of this will be of benefit to our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator Brugha, Senator Kennedy and Senator Kilbride for their kind comments on my appointment which I appreciate.  Senator Brugha inquired about the prospective areas of expenditure in future.  The simple answer is that as yet the Government have not taken any decision on the allocation of the £10 million.  We have undertaken to consult with the social partners on the allocation, notwithstanding the fact that the £10 million is an exclusive Exchequer contribution at this stage.  The only general point I should like to make about the allocations is that they were of a very dispersed variety previously and my inclination <Col N="2298" /> is that they should be confined, perhaps more rigorously, to job creation in the wholly productive sense.  It is very difficult when very limited funds of this nature are disbursed on job maintenance as such which, essentially, can be the job of other State-supported agencies.  In fact, in terms of employment guarantee one would wish to see it going by and large towards job creation and in particular to help difficult areas of job creation. There might be an impression among State and other bodies at this stage, in the light of submissions made for future disbursements, that they are going to receive subventions or that they have been absolutely assured of such subventions.  I want to disabuse them of that because the Government have not taken any decision at all and we will be looking entirely afresh at the area of expenditure. To that extent, Senator Brugha, I am precluded from elaborating further, but I can assure the House that the social partners will be fully consulted on that before there is a Government decision.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult area, that concept of a guarantee fund under a national understanding.  It is argued that, for example, if one disburses money from a fund of that nature for the construction of a sports centre essentially it should come under the Department of Education.  If a company on the verge of liquidation or receivership seek money it is arguable that they should get the money through other State supported agencies such as Fóir Teoranta or if they want money to engage in export work they should go to CTT rather than to the Tripartite Committee seeking money by way of the guarantee fund which was not necessarily created for that purpose.  I can assure Senator Kennedy that the fund, particularly in the context of a future national understanding, will be kept under review and that particular point will come up in the not too distant future, assuming that there will be further negotiations on another national understanding.  Naturally an increase of any amount of money available is entirely dependent on further legislation because we are quite limited in the Bill today to the additional £10 million guaranteed by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> These are the main points I would like to make in reply.  I want to thank the Senators for their co-operation and I assure the House that the points made will be borne in mind in any future consideration regarding disbursement of the fund.</P>

    <Title>Transport Bill, 1981: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is threefold: first, to extend the limit on CIE's borrowing powers for capital purposes, secondly, to extend the limit on the board's temporary borrowing powers and, thirdly, to extend the powers of guarantee of the Minister for Finance in relation to borrowings or contract arrangements for the provision of goods and services entered into by CIE.</P>
      <P>CIE's capital expenditure is financed from the board's internal resources, mainly depreciation provisions, and from borrowings either from the Exchequer or from such outside sources as may be found attractive.  At present, the aggregate amount of CIE's capital borrowings at any one time may not exceed £55 million.  CIE have now reached the limit of their capital borrowing powers, most of the outstanding borrowings being represented by Exchequer capital advances on which interest is paid by CIE.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, essential to extend CIE's capital borrowing authority to enable the board to proceed with a number of capital projects and to undertake any new projects which may be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major projects which the board have in hands at present are the electrification <Col N="2300" /> of the Howth-Bray suburban rail service, the acquisition of 124 mainline carriage units and the renewal of the board's urban and provincial bus fleets. There is also, of course, the provision of a commuter rail service linking May-nooth and intermediate points with Connolly Station, but the provision of this service, which is scheduled to commence operations in a few months, does not require large scale capital investment at this stage.</P>
    <P>The electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban service will, on its introduction in 1983, represent a major improvement in public transport services for people on the eastern side of the city.  Since the late sixties passenger demand on the Dublin suburban rail services has been increasing&mdash;daily carryings on the Howth-Bray section have increased from about 12,500 in 1970 to 34,500 in 1980.  The services are at present operated with dieselhauled refurbished carriages which are due for replacement.  In the consideration of the CIE proposal for electrification, account was taken of the need to upgrade the existing service in order to attract as many passengers as possible and so make the maximum contribution to the relief of traffic congestion.  Considerations which favoured electrification were the desirability of achieving a reduction in dependence on oil, and the environmental benefits offered by an electric system which is pollution free and less noisy than a diesel system.</P>
    <P>The electrification project, on which over 200 people are at present employed, is now nearing the halfway stage.  It involves the provision of an electrical supply along the line, the provision of new signalling and depot facilities, the opening of two new stations at Sandymount and Salthill and the acquisition of new rolling stock specially designed for commuter needs.  The new service will bring about a substantial improvement in the existing service in terms of frequency, speed and passenger comfort.  Day-long services will be provided, serving 25 stations on the line, with trains operating at five minute intervals during peak periods reducing to 15 minutes off peak.  It is intended also to extend the catchment <Col N="2301" /> area of the railway line by the provision of feeder bus services to selected stations. CIE estimate that by 1985 passenger numbers will have increased from the current average of 34,500 per day to about 80,000 per day.</P>
    <P>Major improvements of this nature cannot be made without substantial capital investment and in the case of the Howth/Bray electrification scheme the latest estimate of capital cost, largely based on contracts already placed, now stands at £66.4 million at April 1981 prices.  This represents a substantial increase on the estimate available at the time the project was approved, which amounted to £46 million approximately at early 1979 prices.  While there have been, of course, inevitable variations between actual contract prices and the indicative pre-contract estimates on which the original costings were based, the increase in the capital cost is very substantially attributable to the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations.  I should add that it is proposed, in accordance with normal practice, to capitalise interest charges until the project is completed, after which interest will be charged to the revenue account.  The total amount of capitalised interest charges is estimated at £16 million at current prices.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to ensure that with this project every effort is made to maximise the Irish input of components and services.  So far, I am glad to say, it has proved possible to ensure that, apart from the rolling stock, over 50 per cent of the remaining requirements for materials and services is coming from Irish sources.</P>
    <P>The second major railway project at present on hands is the provision of new carriages for mainline passenger services. Approval was given earlier this year for the acquisition of 124 mainline carriage units, comprising 94 standard carriages, 15 catering cars and 15 generator vans, to be assembled at the Inchicore works in Dublin.  These carriages are needed to enable CIE to provide mainline rail facilities of an acceptable standard of comfort and convenience for all rail passengers. It is expected that over the life of the project employment will be provided at <Col N="2302" /> the Inchicore works for an average of 165 men.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the maximum possible use will be made of Irish sub-contractors for the supply of goods and services and that the Irish input generally will be maximised. Planning work on the project has commenced and it is hoped that the first carriages will be available to be put into service in 1983.  The capital cost of the project is estimated at about £36 million, exclusive of VAT.</P>
    <P>The third major item in CIE's capital programme at present is the renewal of the board's city and provincial bus fleets. The renewal programme had earlier fallen into arrears because of the time lag between the termination in 1977 of CIE's arrangements for the supply of buses with Van Hool McArdle and the establishment of the new Bombardier bus building factory at Shannon.  The new factory, at which production commenced last August, is now giving valuable employment to some 300 people.  CIE have already taken delivery of 20 single-deck buses for use on the provincial services, 30 coaches for the board's tour operations and the first of the 135 doubledeck buses to be delivered this year for use in the Dublin city area.  There have been some initial teething problems with the new buses but I understand that these are relatively minor and are being quickly resolved.  Because of the backlog in CIE's bus replacement programme the board's requirement for new buses for a few years will be unusually high.  The total capital allocation for new buses in CIE's capital programme for 1981 is £18.5 million and CIE's forecasts for the years immediately ahead envisage expenditure continuing at a high level.</P>
    <P>The three projects which I have mentioned, combined with the board's normal capital programme, clearly require a substantial revision of the limit applicable to CIE's capital borrowing as the board's depreciation provisions would fall far short of the expenditure involved.  It has, therefore, been decided to set a new limit of £180 million in respect of capital borrowings that is an increase of £125 million on the existing limit.  In addition the Bill provides for an increase in the limit on <Col N="2303" /> the guarantees which can be given by the Minister for Finance under the State Guarantees (Transport) Acts in respect of contracts for the provision of goods and services entered into by CIE.  This will allow greater scope for exploring alternative arrangements for the financing of CIE's programme, for instance, leasing of equipment, which might provide worthwhile opportunities for financing investment in transport.</P>
    <P>The increased borrowing and guarantee arrangements provided for in the Bill will enable CIE to proceed with the projects I have mentioned in the years immediately ahead and to undertake any new projects which may be approved.  Additional finance may have to be authorised in a few years time and the introduction of the necessary legislation will provide an opportunity for further review of CIE's capital programme by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, the intervening period will give time within which consideration of the McKinsey Report on CIE can be completed and a start made on implementing whatever decisions arise from that consideration.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the Government are very conscious of the necessity for adequate and efficient public transport services for economic and social purposes.  It is, of course, essential that these services should be provided in the most cost-effective manner possible, taking account of the social and economic needs of the community as a whole.  It is on this basis that the Government will be considering how public transport services can best be organised.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, the present Bill also provides for an increase in CIE's temporary borrowing powers which at present are limited to £5 million under the Transport Act, 1974.  This figure is now insufficient in the light of the inflation which has occurred since the 1974 Act was passed.  CIE's expenditure on operating account has increased from £65 million in 1973-74 to £200 million in 1980, while the Exchequer subvention increased from £10.75 million to £70 million in the same period.  It is proposed, therefore, to increase CIE's temporary <Col N="2304" /> borrowing powers to £20 million so as to provide a safeguard to tide the board over any short-term cash difficulties such as unforeseen losses in revenue or increases in expenditure.  The inadequacy of the figure of £5 million has been evident on a number of occasions in recent years and Supplementary Estimates have had to be introduced for CIE at short notice to ensure that the board would have sufficient cash to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to say that while this Bill provides the means for improvement of the facilities available to CIE for the operation of bus and train services, these facilities will not, in themselves, guarantee a service which will meet the needs of the public and on which they can rely.  The provision of facilities must be accompanied by the necessary degree of commitment and co-operation by CIE management and staff.  In particular, there must be a determined effort by all concerned to avoid the type of disruption of services at present being experienced and which, unfortunately, occurs all too often.</P>
    <P>Serious hardship is being caused especially in Dublin to many thousands of citizens.  Business in the centre of the city is being adversely affected to a point when the jobs of those working in these businesses are at risk.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that the strikers and the other CIE workers who will not pass their pickets want deliberately to inflict hardship on fellow citizens or put any of them out of a job, but they must recognise that they are doing both so long as the present strike continues.</P>
    <P>In particular I am at a loss to understand why the workers who are not in dispute have failed to answer the call from the Congress of Trade Unions to pass the pickets.  I would appeal to them on behalf of all who are suffering through the absence of buses to answer the call of their own congress to go back to work and thereby show solidarity and sympathy with their fellow citizens.  By doing so they would also recognise that it is the tax contributions of these citizens now deprived of bus transport that are contributing towards the massive subvention, <Col N="2305" /> currently £74 million, that is keeping CIE workers in their jobs.</P>
    <P>The debate in Dáil Éireann on this Bill last week indicated a widespread wish for a fundamental review of CIE and of transport policy generally.  This is a matter which is already being pursued in the context of the McKinsey Report on CIE and which will be one of my principal priorities in the months immediately ahead.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Transport and wish him well in his office.</P>
      <P>It is customary in both Houses generally to welcome provisions for additional capital to our semi-State bodies.  On this occasion, while I welcome the proposals from the Minister, I am glad that he referred towards the end of his speech to the disastrous industrial relations situation that exists at present.  There is no doubt that the public of Dublin are very tolerant and patient.  Time out of number in recent years they have been subjected to a withdrawal of services, disruption of their lives and unemployment caused by the fall-off in business in the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he cannot imagine that those who will not pass pickets want deliberately to inflict hardship on their fellow citizens, but one must begin, in relation to our transport system, by being critical of both management and labour.  One does not have these persistent disputes without some measure of culpability lying on both sides.  However, the situation that has come about now is one that calls for total public condemnation.  The situation calls for total public condemnation by those of us who are elected representatives.  We have a transport system which is being subsidised week by week to the tune of well over £1 million.  People whose wages are paid by the taxpayer are holding up progress and in the tourist season giving this country a bad reputation all around the world. The industrial relations system in a large organisation such as CIE is such that a minority can prevent the majority from working.  This is totally contrary to democratic practice.  We inherited a bad <Col N="2306" /> industrial relations structure which needed to be remedied.  The onus in on the trade union leadership and the Government to try to improve that situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements being introduced by CIE.  These are parts of continuing proposals and developments over the past few years.  I wish that organisation well in their efforts to provide a more adequate and more efficient transport system.</P>
    <P>I decry an industrial relations structure which prevents workers and old age pensioners who have the free travel concession from availing of our transport system in Dublin.  When a large part of the employment in this company is being paid for directly or substantially subscribed to by the taxpayer, those employees should realise that they have a double obligation.  The obligation on any person who is drawing a weekly wage to give the best performance possible is normal in private employment.  The obligation on any person in public employment is a dual one to the community as a whole.  It is fair to criticise those who withdraw their labour and to refer to the absence of a serious and conscientious approach to their obligations by those who are in public employment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, can the Minister let me know what amount of money is currently being paid by the Exchequer to CIE arising out of the free travel facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support what the Minister and Senator Brugha said about the current bus strike in Dublin and, more generally, about the obligations of people in public employment.  I should also like to join in welcoming the Minister to the House in a new capacity.  Apart from that, I wish to make only two points on this Bill.  As the Minister has indicated, quite understandably the Government are not yet ready for a general discussion on transport policy or the finances of CIE.  The Government will obviously have to give urgent attention to all the major loss accumulators in the system, particularly CIE and NET, if the appalling state of the public finances revealed in today's paper from the Department of Finance is to be remedied <Col N="2307" /> even over a period of years.</P>
      <P>My first point is a minor one.  I do not think it is satisfactory drafting that a Bill should appear before us which refers to &ldquo;the Board&rdquo; and mentions nowhere, not even in the definitions clause, that the board in question is Córas Iompair Éireann.  It may be said not to be formally necessary because earlier Acts have defined the board, but surely it would have been better for clarity's sake to do it again here so that this Bill would be intelligible on its own.</P>
      <P>My second point has to do with the absurdity of maintaining the pretence that money provided for CIE for capital purposes is an advance which is repayable and which constitutes a State asset to be set off against State liabilities.  The latest published Finance Accounts show at 31 December last over £33 million of repayable advances to CIE under the rubric: Capital Assets of the Exchequer, Account number XXVII.  Surely this is self-delusion.  Given the mounting scale of losses of CIE now in the run up apparently to £100 million a year, I do not believe the Minister or anybody else entertains the slightest hope that CIE will be able to repay a single penny of previous advances or of any new advances made under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the nice circumlocution in the Minister's speech about &ldquo;capitalising the interest charges&rdquo; shows that they will not even be able to pay the interest not to mention repaying any money.  So why not have some realism in this matter?  The Minister has a reputation for dislike of humbug.  Why not treat all money given to CIE as a non-repayable grant and eliminate these advances, these worthless assets, from the table of Exchequer assets in the finance accounts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to be recorded as wishing the Minister well in his new portfolio.  I have admired his valuable contributions to the debates on many national issues in the past four years.  This gives me confidence that he will give his keen attention to all matters concerning transport and particularly to the effects of inflationary costs in the various public services on the competitive <Col N="2308" /> position of Irish industry in general.  I might add that his opening statement was reassuring.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, the Minister has gained enormous experience of the problems which we face in our economy and the mounting demands which have emerged in the various reports.  I hope the Minister will use his influence to ensure that this type of committee will be established on a permanent basis to quell the anxiety of a large section of the public who would wish to see a national approach to our many serious economic problems.  The massive borrowings required by State-sponsored bodies, as is evident in the debate already and with CIE today, will need more active monitoring than ever before and such growing subsidies will need continuous analysis by an all-party committee.</P>
      <P>During my time in the Seanad I have found that most of the demands for funds for State-sponsored bodies as initiated through legislation are passed with very little adverse comments by politicians.  This is because the State-sponsored bodies are large employers throughout the country and inevitably in all parties there is an inherent bias towards the wishful thinking of one's constituents.  It is a pity &mdash; and this is coming out in the debate today &mdash; that the politicians do not fully explain the reasons and these are usually very worthy, for subsidising State-sponsored bodies and that the money granted has to come out of the Exchequer.  We fail the PAYE workers in not giving them a full explanation as to the necessity for contributing to our public services through income taxation.  I am sure that PAYE workers would have a greater understanding and a greater willingness to pay their portion of the appropriate taxes necessary to subsidise the jobs not only of their colleagues but in some instances of their own jobs if they were better educated to the problems of Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint Oireachtas committee in their various reports have brought a new enlightenment to the programme of financing our State organisations, and in <Col N="2309" /> the case of CIE I am sorry that the McKinsey report has not received adequate debate so far.  However, I am glad to have the Minister's reassurance on this.  The name McKinsey, which is well known for incisive analysis of an organisation, often puts up emotional barriers before the actual arguments are adequately thought through and deliberated. I have been an admirer of the conscientious manner in which Deputy Reynolds approached the McKinsey Report and has realised the necessity to break down the monolithic structure of CIE.  We cannot go on with a blank-cheque situation because in the first place the Government will not stand for it and neither will the taxpayers when they begin to understand the problem, and it is also in the best interest of all workers to understand what our problems are for the economic future.</P>
    <P>From all debates both inside and outside this House it is obvious that income restraint is one of our major priorities for survival.  We must have this restraint.  The necessity for it is obvious also from the economic review published today.  The lead must be given by the Government in relation to public sector pay and such capital investment as will follow under this Bill.  It is interesting to hear where some of the capital investment is going but it must be seen to produce the returns and the benefits outlined by the Minister. He says that in assessing future capital expenditure and extending borrowing powers under this Bill due consideration must be given to the future structure of CIE.  Everyone will agree now that the monopoly of road freight transport must be relaxed.  For many years now the Irish Transport and Distribution Association have been making submissions to the previous Minister for Transport and to the Confederation of Irish Industry seeking an end to the CIE monopoly of road freight.  On the points raised it is interesting to note that they sought liberalisation in private haulage in making available more licences within the professional standards now set by them. Ninety per cent of all road freight is carried by own-account operators.  They represent some 77 per cent of gross national <Col N="2310" /> product, which is an enormous percentage and deserves consideration.  It is now fully acknowledged that own-account operators are more efficient than CIE but are unable to carry return loads from delivery points.  Twenty per cent of oil energy is used by road freight.  In the Irish biscuit industry's case our distribution system covers the entire Twenty-six Counties and all our vehicles are returning to Dublin empty.  In addition, we are not permitted to carry other producers' products from Dublin which in many cases would improve our vehicle and output capacity and consequently improve the performance and better utilisation of resources and fuel.</P>
    <P>To give the House some indication of the magnitude of what I am talking about, Irish Biscuits' vans travel approximately 1.2 million miles per annum and about half of this is travelled by empty vehicles.  We have had many requests to engage in haulage for other companies but are not permitted to accept under present legislation.  It is extraordinary in reviewing our whole energy policy that more attention is not given to this aspect of waste within the distribution industry. It is absolutely illogical to allow the existing monopoly to continue in this day and age when everyone is preaching the necessity to conserve fuel.  By simple legislation we have the opportunity to improve fuel economy and reduce the number of vehicles on the roads because there would not be the duplication of vans coming and going, returning empty when they could be carrying goods from various destinations and helping some of the industries that are in trouble.  This would obviously improve performance, reduce road wear and tear and ease the major impediment of traffic congestion and above all reduce our national oil requirements.</P>
    <P>I have purposely given the example of one major Irish industry but if you multiply this across the country amongst all the own-account operators the savings could be enormous.  In addition will be the saving on the subsidisation of CIE all of which would reduce the tax implications for the PAYE sector who are so vociferous.  We must support our State <Col N="2311" /> bodies and services.  Most politicians are ready to do so but they must be ready and willing to explain that the subsidies granted have to be paid by the public in general through taxes.  With those reservations I am pleased to support this Bill and I wish the Minister every success in his onerous responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I would say that this is a Bill coming about as a result of problems over which the previous Government did not have an immense amount of control.  The difficulties that the people today experience in consequence of the structure and the widespread operation of CIE are exemplified first by the sight of so many people walking the roads after subscribing substantially through VAT or through other tax channels to the provision of that service. This is not just an annual affair; it is often at least twice annually.  That is not something we should have to experience in a free society.  In a free society those people who benefit through employment from a national structure like CIE should carry the obligation of providing the service that they are supposed to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is terrible to think that no matter how far you are from the city of Dublin you find young and old, gentle and simple, condemned to the exercise of thumbing lifts and in many cases not being able to avail themselves of the charity of the many people who would otherwise like to accommodate them.  The people in secure employment with CIE have an obligation to the people providing the money to pay them, but they exercise what muscle they can on society as a whole to extract increased benefits, certain facilities or certain accommodation for their union or whatever it may be. They exploit the rest of society and create a problem because of very small differences of opinion as to what may be regarded as a reasonable request from authority, and a proposed remedy may be refused by one or two people.  In consequence the whole populace of a city like Dublin are put to walking miles and miles every day for weeks and weeks. With the Senators who have already spoken <Col N="2312" /> and with the rest of the people in this city and country I condemn in the strongest possible way the exercise of the powers that produced this result.  People should apply a code which will make the granting of a reasonable request entirely obligatory on those in a position to do so without implication of loss to themselves or to the union.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and assure him that on this side of the House we are 100 per cent appreciative of what he has said here today.  We hope he will have a successful implementation of this measure to the advantage of the people and of CIE in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I add my congratulations to the Minister on his translation to the other side of the House and to the Cabinet.  Now that I think of it &ldquo;translation&rdquo; is a word one uses in the case of bishops who have far greater security of tenure than the Minister is likely to have. Therefore, instead of wishing him <i>ad multos annos</i> it would be more appropriate 2312 to say <i>ad multos menses.</i> We are all struck today by the unreality of these proceedings.  We feel like so many Oisíns after the Fianna or like Marius sitting on the ruins of Carthage.  I would like to postpone what I have to say to the occasion when the McKinsey Report will surely be discussed in the Seanad.  There is a notice to that effect on the Order Paper but, who knows, it may be a swan song so I want to make one or two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I join in deploring the present bus strike in Dublin city.  There is nothing easier than to deplore the present bus strike in Dublin city, but I have no intention of joining in the self-righteous chorus of condemnation of the workers. That is much too facile.  I simply am not in possession of sufficient facts to make a facile judgment in that regard.  Senator Brugha said &mdash; and it is partly true &mdash; that the cessation of a great urban transport service among other things makes a very bad image conveyed through tourists to people abroad.  Perhaps so, but I remind the House that the virtual collapse of the tourist season in high summer in many parts of this country is due to factors far more sinister than a transport <Col N="2313" /> strike in Dublin city.  I do not have to spell that out to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a bad time to be defending CIE. It is a bad time to be defending semi-State bodies.  The debacle of Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta which we discussed in this House not so long ago was a godsend to those who were constantly knocking semi-State bodies and advancing the claims of the private sector against the public sector.   Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that if morale in CIE is at an all-time low &mdash;&ldquo;on the floor&rdquo; was the phrase used in the other House &mdash; a lot of that is due to factors outside the control of CIE.  There is a feeling in CIE management and unions that somehow the McKinsey Report and the suggestion of approval forthcoming for the McKinsey Report is another blow to their morale, so to speak.  There is the continual demand of the private sector, not to take over the social services afforded by CIE, not to transport people over the remotely-populated areas, but to pluck out and keep for themselves the lucrative side of CIE practices.  In that respect tears did not spring to my eyes when Senator Lambert made his references to the desirability of moving road haulage into private hands.</P>
    <P>CIE are further demoralised by the lack of any philosophy of public transport.  What are they supposed to be doing?  What is the purpose of CIE?  The suggestion somehow is that they should not be losing money.  They should even be repaying money.  Perhaps not from exactly the same points but I go along fully with Senator Whitaker's view that the idea of advancing CIE money which is going to be repaid is absolute humbug. All these things demoralise CIE, and so do the daily reminders of the whole shabbiness and dilapidated state of their rolling stock.  Regarding the impression made on tourists, nothing is more calculated to give tourists the impression of a ramshackle Republic than the kind of public vehicles which are now being run into the ground, particularly on some provinicial services.</P>
    <P>Since it is fashionable to knock CIE, the public should be made more aware of the fact that Governments in other countries <Col N="2314" /> provide much higher subsidies to their public transport systems than we do, Most of all, in recent times CIE have been demoralised by a particularly cynical attitude on the part of the outgoing administration.  It is well known that CIE applied for a hefty increase in prices in their fares because if nothing else their Government subsidy had been effectively and very substantially cut considering the value of the subsidy in real terms and in terms of inflation from year to year.  So, their subsidy was cut and they either had to reduce services and/or increase fares, but purely for electoral purposes the outgoing Government would allow them to do neither of these things.  It was expedient that increases in CIE fares should not be seen to add to the cost of inflation before the general election.  That kind of scurvy treatment surely must have compounded the already bad morale of the company.</P>
    <P>I make these points because I think that of all the semi-State companies &mdash; and frequently we have occasion to praise the achievements of many of them &mdash; the one really on the losing wicket is Córas Iompair Éireann because they cannot make money.  There have been some suggestions in the other House that they should somehow capitalise on some of their assets like their splendid Victorian railway stations and the couple of acres here and there but nobody has seriously indicated how this could be done.  CIE is a public transport system.  We should put it in the context of public transport systems in the rest of the world.  In terms of mass urban transport, for example, it is recognised in places as ideologically different as San Francisco and Moscow that the urban masses have the right to cheap and mass transport.  Perhaps the Minister would not be too much inclined to take the Moscow model as an example.  Nonetheless, they are grossly overcrowded, like sardines bursting out of a tin, but they get there.  In most other cities of my acquaintance, certainly in the United States, the price of urban transport is very reasonable, not to say extremely cheap in some places.  The one glaring contrast that I notice with our Cork and Dublin city bus services is that you pay a <Col N="2315" /> flat fare in your travels throughout the city.  In other words, there is a recognition, whether it is in a Communist country or in a liberal democratic country, that the freedom of the citizen includes the freedom of movement, that the ordinary person has a right to cheap travel.</P>
    <P>I know I may well be asked where is the money to come from but, nevertheless, if we are to serve the needs of a growing and young population ever more constantly on the move, we must have a radically different attitude to the whole system of public transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his new Ministry and in dealing with the Bill before the House he certainly needs luck.  I also hope that he will be brave and will take whatever steps are necessary to improve the transport situation.  Senators have commented on the present state of play and deplored the fact that so many people are incommoded with the present bus strike.  The previous speaker did not want to lay blame on the workers and the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No commercial undertaking that consistently proved inefficient and lost so much money would last very long after the shareholders caught up with it.  I hope, therefore, one of the first tasks the Minister will undertake is to find a completely new board for CIE.  It should be possible to find more efficient management.  We should have aspirations at least to have an efficient service.  The criteria with the semi-State companies of latter years seem to be to have a competition to see which of them will lose the most money to the State.  It is difficult, and many people are inclined to knock institutions like CIE and take them all as a body.  Nevertheless, when you look at the component parts which the board of CIE govern, you might think there are lots of people who are doing an excellent day's work.  I am sure they are doing their best. There is no doubt that some of the services are being improved.  If one travels on the railways, for example, one notices that the rolling stock is improving.  I suppose it is from the new continous tracks that are being laid over the past few years.  These are fabricated and laid down <Col N="2316" /> by highly skilled workers who, I understand, are based in Portlaoise.  When one knocks CIE one loses sight of the fact that there are many diligent workers who are doing a good job and who are tarred, unfortunately, with the same brush. There is room for improvement in every public service, and I hope the Minister will seek that.  His task should be to find a board and personnel who will be able to provide for the general public the best possible service.</P>
    <P>There are two many cynics in this country, I suppose I qualify as one, but I cannot but recall a deputation I was on to Kingsbridge a couple of years ago.  We were campaigning to have a bus service arrive in a town in the constituency ten minutes earlier than it operated.  The idea was that if it came ten minutes earlier it would catch a train which was on its way to Dublin.  It involved the bus starting from the original destination ten minutes earlier, but CIE said that it was a bus depot and a bus service and had nothing to do with the trains.</P>
    <P>There are people in CIE who forget about the passengers.  The service is there for the public.  In flag-carrying institutions, like CIE, they say people are not using the services.  People will not use the services unless they are run at a convenient time.  This is important.  If you look back at the statistics and take the town of Portlaoise four years ago to see how many people commuted to Dublin each day from Portlaoise, you will find the numbers quite small.  But eventually the company were prevailed upon to put in an early morning commuter service leaving at 7.30 a.m.  I think statistics show that people appreciate and will utilise the services if they are at a convenient time and if they suit the needs of the travelling public.  That is the area in which the public transport company should be searching and their sole purpose should be in what way they can enable the public to get to and from their work or recreation.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the company to at least aim at breaking even.  It is unacceptable that any public company can continue increasing its debt and its losses year in year out.  New ways must <Col N="2317" /> be tried.  The public will appreciate an improved service.  Also, in this materialistic age, the operatives will have an effect on the public's patronage of the service.</P>
    <P>That is why the old traditional courtesy should be part of and expected from the personnel working not only in private companies but in public companies as well.  I remember years ago when we used to despatch sugar beet by CIE to Thurles. If a train went through the station five minutes late or five minutes early, the porters would look at their watches and if the train was a couple of minutes off they would change their watches because there was an <i>esprit de corps</i> and they felt the trains could not be wrong.  I do not think there is any hope for CIE until a similar kind of spirit is reintroduced.  It must start at the very top.  Leadership must be given.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to write to the Chairman of CIE some years ago after completing a journey to Galway.  I complained of the state of the carriages but the man did not even accept that such could be the case at all.  If they have the attitude that the company cannot be wrong, how can they see the wood for the trees?  The Minister will have to be cruel if he wants to be kind to the travelling public.  He must tackle the job with determination to bring about an improvement in the service, not only in the interests of the people who want to travel to their places of work, but in fairness to the taxpayers who should not be asked to share an ever-increasing burden, as seems to be the record over the past few years with some semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  I know he has a daunting task before him.  I hope that he will be brave enough to take the steps necessary to improve the service.  Over the years, every time there was a rationalisation programme carried out in CIE the idea was to slash services, to sell off the rail lines, to curtail station stops.  That is not the way to run an efficient service. Improvements can be carried out.  In Europe even a trans-continental express stops for one minute sharp at very many stations.  The public are quite used to hopping off and the train just goes on if <Col N="2318" /> they are not quick enough to get off and they must then travel on for some more miles.  It should be possible in this way to improve the rail service by stopping at stations where there is a demand.</P>
    <P>It is only by improving the frequency of the service, the quality and indeed, every aspect, from a human point of view as well as from a purely economic point of view, that CIE will come out on top. Public transport represents something like 7 per cent of the GNP in the entire European Community, while agriculture would represent something like 5.6 per cent.  It is, therefore, a very important sector and is given a very minor rating in our order of priorities.  This is something we will have to change.</P>
    <P>We will have to recognise the value and importance of effective transportation within this country.  I do not think that we should run a transport service with tourists in mind.  Our own people must come first and they should certainly expect more than they are getting at present.  The service is anything but a cheap one.  It is possible to compare the prices and rates with anywhere in Europe and there are certainly no bargains attached to it.  Nevertheless, there is a sharp shortfall, perhaps in some cases in courtesy and certainly in care.  A tremendous public relations job needs to be carried out on CIE.  CIE management must share the blame.  Occasionally you will see excursions or holiday traffic on 8 December, with the trains packed all the way up to Dublin.  I see no reason why, since people will require more space for a day's shopping, an extra coach should not be made available.  In my experience no attention is paid to detail.  This is a great pity because from my experience the people working for that company are as good as those in any other sector.  With proper management, leadership and impetus, that organisation can be transformed and can perform a better and a more caring service for our people and surely also at less cost to the taxpayer than at present. I wish the Minister well and welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief because Senators McDonald and Kilbride <Col N="2319" /> have said much of what I had in mind to say today.  I commend them for their remarks.  They pinpointed the root cause of the evil of this continual disease of strikes.  The present bus strike must be condemned by every right minded person.  We who are at the moment travelling the length and breadth of the country on the Seanad campaign are hearing remarks such as: &ldquo;When will a serious attempt be made to dismantle CIE and let private enterprise take over?&rdquo; People are becoming very impatient and impatience is growing.  Unless something is done and sanity returns soon to the minds of those responsible for these strikes, there will be a general revolt and a general demand for a total restructuring of our transport system because people cannot put up with it any longer.</P>
      <P>This morning as I was coming into Dublin I saw people putting up their hands looking for lifts, middle-aged people, in particular, elderly people trying to get into town to do a bit of shopping. They have no way of travelling and there is no hope of any settlement of the strike. These things are very disturbing, even in a disturbing age such as this.</P>
      <P>So many things can be done in the rail or bus systems to make conditions more attractive for travellers.  Senator McDonald referred to timetables and the interest workers had in times gone by in making absolutely sure that timetables were strictly adhered to.  They took a pride in it and would be very upset if a train was even half a minute late.  I remember the first time I taught in a school near a mainline railway system.  One of the excuses made by a child who was late for school one morning was this: &ldquo;The quarter past eight must have been late this morning, sir.&rdquo;  When the train passed, that was the time to get up.  The train was late and therefore everything went wrong.  That was the attitude to work and service at that time.  Until that attitude returns, we cannot have satisfaction, for management, employers or the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heartily welcome Deputy Cooney back to the Seanad again.  In fact, he has returned here already, even though the <Col N="2320" /> election has not taken place.  It is lucky for him that he has a State car because if he had to come by bus, he would not be here yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Bill should really be called the CIE Bill, because that is the subject matter of the Bill and that is what is dominating our minds.  In reality it is a transport problem in the fullest sense.  The problems afficting the operation of CIE have to be seen in the context of the transport situation generally.  I do not think CIE's performance either in Dublin or nationwide, but particularly in Dublin, can be examined realistically without taking into account the overall traffic situation and the facilities for both public and private transport.</P>
      <P>Despite the examination of this subject over a long period, I do not think there is sufficient awareness of the real cost of the chaotic transport situation that exists in Dublin city.  Statistics come out from time to time and get a certain amount of publicity, but it would help the whole approach to getting solutions and acceptance of what might be difficult solutions if the real hardship people are putting up with was made clear to the average individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some hidden costs and some costs that are not hidden involved in the present transport chaos.  Public transport goes through the city at what is now calculated as an average three miles per hour.  This is something that cannot be tolerated.  In itself that gives rise to a lot of costs because it reflects the overall snarled-up traffic situation.  Any vehicle that travels at three miles per hour is not operating efficiently.  It uses more fuel; it will wear out more quickly, and the individuals concerned and the whole country will be involved in very big expenses.  A situation where we would have smooth, free-flowing transport, be it public or private, would have tremendous benefits and savings for our economy.  In the present traffic situation in Dublin, there is enormous wastage of fuel and of money spent on maintenance and replacements, because parts wear out quicker than they should because of constant congestion. <Col N="2321" /> These costs are fairly obvious, but there are other costs.  There is a loss of time at work, and of time which could be devoted to leisure &mdash; to families or to whatever the individuals want to do.  Time wasted in a chaotic and inefficient transport system is time for which there is no return and is a huge cost on our society.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of health because of pollution.  Studies have shown that the incidence of pollution increases the more congestion there is.  The slower the traffic moves, the greater the rate of pollution and the longer it lingers in the atmosphere.  Over a long period that will cause very serious health problems.  The health of people who suffer from respiratory problems is getting worse every year as the congestion problem worsens. There is also the question of stress.  People are frustrated by this snarled-up traffic, with no hope of efficient and smooth-flowing access to where they want to go.  Studies have shown that stress over a long period is very damaging to certain people, depending on their temperament.</P>
    <P>How do you put a cost on all those factors?  If you could put a monetary cost on them, then, great as the capital investment in our public transport and great as the costs of some of the solutions may be, I believe they would not stand comparison with those obvious and not so obvious costs which we are all bearing day by day, and which are getting worse.  The costs of the present situation far outweigh the costs of putting up with the present situation and patching it here or there and mitigating its worst effects.  There must be a fundamental approach to solving that problem.</P>
    <P>There are many factors in that approach.  I have no doubt that more efficient public transport would reduce the incidence of private transport and the frequency with which people bring their cars into the city centre.  That would present us with a double advantage.  We would have a more efficient public service which would reduce the use of other traffic on our thoroughfares.  The opposite is also true.  If we do not make the public transport system more efficient and if it continues to get more and more <Col N="2322" /> inefficient, there will be more reliance on private transport.  There has to be a clear analytical approach to this problem and a start must be made.  The more the cost of the present chaos is seen and understood, the more chance there is we will get the right framework and the right public support for the changes that should be made.  There is not just one change needed.  There has been a great deal of controversy over road construction.  There have been many unnecessary delays and a great deal of shilly-shallying on the part of Dublin City Council on some proposals that came before them. Road construction is part of the solution but I would not suggest it would be the whole solution in Dublin or even a substantial part of it, even though it is a necessary part, but the link roads are certainly a part of the solution.</P>
    <P>If we are going to get hung up on every single individual component of a solution that comes up and if it is going to be looked at from ideological lines, whether at local or at national Government level, we are going to sink more and more into the morass.  I hope the new Government will not get entangled in this ideological approach, which seems to have befuddled the thinking of their colleagues in Dublin City Council when it came to dealing with part of this problem.</P>
    <P>To deal with the present traffic problem as it affects CIE I would like to point out that most of Dublin's buses are 20 to 25 years old and they travel through the congested streets at three miles per hour. How they could be expected to give a service is incomprehensible.  I welcome the steps that have been taken over the past year or so to provide the new fleet. This will contribute to and be part of, the solution.  I also welcome the experiment with bus lanes.  It shows a flexibility that is needed.  It shows an awareness of the problem and a willingness to experiment. Where right decisions have been made, they should be acknowledged.  There is no doubt, as has been mentioned over and over again in this debate, that morale is a huge factor in CIE.  It has sunk to an abysmal low among workers and management.  It is so gigantic an organisation now that it is easy to understand why it <Col N="2323" /> is so hard to fire morale and imagination and to have a lively and imaginative approach on the part of management and workers.  Success in any one area is likely to be swamped by continuing deterioration in many other areas throughout the organisation.  Pride in identification with the organisation and the public service it provides seems to have disappeared totally.</P>
    <P>The present strike in Dublin is a reflection of that.  It is the latest evidence of the chaos and crumbling morale in that organisation for which the public are paying the bill.  It is one thing to pay the price for a service that is not good, but surely it is absolutely outrageous and intolerable that the public should pay the price for a service which does not exist at all. That is exactly what is happening at the moment because the public are paying taxes, direct and indirect, to support an organisation which, with incredible frequency, is simply providing no service at all.</P>
    <P>Part of the answer lies in the size of the organisation.  Smaller units provide more flexibility and the possibility for management and the work force to identify more with the service they are giving, not carrying the tag of constantly losing money, being inefficient and having old equipment and rolling stock.  There is an opportunity for a new beginning through the use of smaller units in the provision of the overall transport service.  It would give flexibility and the possibility of identifying with the service and taking a pride in it.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to have the ideological hang-up that certain services must always be in public control, but people who advocate that as much as possible they should be handed over to private enterprise can be equally wrong.  We must be pragmatic and weigh the situation to see in what way the service can best be provided.  Bearing in mind the huge extent of the public transport service involved in CIE there is room for participation by both public and private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Steps have been taken in recent legislation, including the Finance Act, 1981, <Col N="2324" /> to provide support through the taxation system for private investment in some of these areas such as road construction, bridge construction and car park construction.  That is a step in the right direction.  It is somewhat removed from the direct operation of CIE itself.</P>
    <P>One cannot look at CIE's performance and their ability to provide a service outside the overall transport and traffic situation generally.  The more we can involve private finance in financing this service, the more flexibility we will get, the more thought will be brought to solving the problems generally and the less the public purse will be called on.  There are cumulative advantages in the use of smaller units, whether they are publicly or privately owned, and the flexible combination of public and private finance.  I hope that the new Government will take this view and will not be bogged down by ideological hang-ups or compromises between the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party as to whether certain services should be financed through the public Exchequer or through public borrowing or private investment.  We must have a fresh and flexible approach which will have the public interest in mind.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Senators for their welcome and their good wishes.  It is a rather odd feeling to be translated, as Senator Murphy said.  It may be more a form of political reincarnation if we follow the theological analogy.  I am greatful to the Senators who contributed to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is quite narrow in its objective which is merely to provide for the financial position in CIE and does not deal with the structures of CIE.  All Senators refrained from going into the whole area of transport policy in any depth because of the limited scope of the Bill.  CIE have been the subject of an evaluation by a firm of consultants who have reported in the last few months.  Their report is being considered and a debate on that report is under way among the interests involved. I intend bringing that report and the Government's views on it and on the whole transport scene generally, which includes CIE, to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible date for a comprehensive <Col N="2325" /> debate.  This is an area which is giving rise to a considerable amount of dissatisfaction and an area of national life in which there is a real and proper expectation of significant change to bring about significant improvement.  It goes without argument that improvements are required.</P>
    <P>Much of the impetus for this demand for change and improvement arises from the situation in Dublin city.  Senator Donnelly made a case with which I am in total sympathy regarding the need to deal with the chaotic situation in Dublin city.  Very often CIE unfairly have to carry the blame for it, but I do not think any transport company could provide an efficient public transport system in the streets of Dublin at present because they are so choked with traffic.  I was encouraged when Senator Donnelly said that the problem must be approached in radical terms.  I believe totally that it must be so approached.  There is a task force dealing with this matter at present and they have made certain recommendations regarding new traffic techniques to try to ameliorate the problem.  As a personal thought &mdash; and there is always a risk in expressing personal preferences without the benefit of deep analysis preparation &mdash; there must be a more radical approach to the problem in Dublin even to the extent of making it financially unprofitable to come with private transport into the chaos of Dublin.  There must be a financial deterrent and it could be cheaper on people in the long run than having to bear their share of the hidden costs that result from the present chaotic situation.  I assure the House that I am conscious of the need for a radical approach to the problems in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I am also aware from the debate here and in the other House that there is a demand for a radical overhaul of the entire CIE operation and the transport policy of the nation.  I assure Senator Donnelly that this will not be approached on the basis of any particular ideological hangup.  It will be approached on the basis of getting the right mix; and, if the right mix happens to be public and private, fine.  But let us not forget that CIE <Col N="2326" /> came into existence because private transport as then constituted had failed. That is not to suggest that the private enterprise presence might not be a good thing now.</P>
    <P>The fundamental debate has yet to take place.  I do not want to take the risk of making any pre-emptive remarks at this stage bearing in mind that I have yet to consider the implications of the McKinsey Report and make my own evaluation and advise the Government who will finally decide on the transport policy we need.  As Senator Murphy pointed out, we need an efficient public transport in urban areas.  We cannot have that in our urban areas until we cure the traffic chaos.  That is the first requirement towards providing efficient public transport in the larger urban areas.  Traffic chaos must be cured, if necessary by radical new measures.  I intend looking at experiences in other parts of the world where experiments have been carried out and have produced significantly successful results.  It will be interesting to see whether our people will have the sense of self-discipline to accept whatever may be offered.  I hope there will be the political will to impose solutions.  If the question of making these decisions I am proposing arises in the next few years, I can assure the House that the political will will be present.</P>
    <P>The present dispute in CIE is causing considerable hardship.  While CIE bashing is an easy thing to engage in, it is a bit unfair and I take issue with Senator McDonald when he called for a change in the board and management.  I pay tribute to both the board and management for what they have done in a very difficult context.  I am quite satisfied with the level of dedication and expertise available in CIE management.  They are men of great spirit to have endured all the criticism and bashing that they have had to endure for so long.  I pay tribute too to the vast majority of the work force of CIE.  Some Senators have spoken of the <i>espirit de corps</i> that is there.  That is possibly a carry-over from the days when the railways were the predominant feature in our transport system and there was a <Col N="2327" /> great <i>esprit de corps</i> among railwaymen. That can be fanned again to our benefit. At the same time when sections of that work force are prepared to leave their fellow citizens stranded, it is right that they should be criticised.  I would not like Senator Murphy to think that such criticisms could be called self-righteous condemnation.  I do not know that one could apply those terms to the call by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who have asked their members who are not on strike to go back to work.  The workers' failure to respond to a call from their own congress is something that should be subject to criticism.  I make that criticism. Those men should heed the call of their own trade union leaders and go back to work.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned that in urban areas that have a good public transport system very often there is a flat fare. That is something that may well be suitable for our situation in due course, but to operate that and get the full benefit we would have to have the one-man buses which is something that has been resisted for a very long time by the trade unions. New attitudes and new approaches will have to be seen if we are to make improvements and implement the radical changes that the present situation requires.</P>
    <P>The present dispute is sensitive and complex.  Any dispute arising in an institution as large as CIE will necessarily have complexities different from those arising in some other organisations and the complexities are compounded by the fact that there are so many different grades and so many different unions catering for the same grades.  This adds to the difficulties of grappling with the problems and finding solutions.  I am satisfied that my colleague, the Minister for Labour, has sufficient knowledge and sensitivity of that scene to be able to give it the attention it deserves.  I agree with the point made by Senator Whitaker that it has now come to the stage when the public service pay, its place in our economy and the need for reason in the levels of public service pay are of paramount importance.  We have to be careful that <Col N="2328" /> we do not call for easy give-in solutions to any trade dispute.  That is not to say that solutions are not being sought urgently within the accepted parameters of industrial relations and negotiating procedures.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker raised the question of the attention that will have to be given to the loss-makers generally in the public sector.  That is a serious problem facing Government finances because the accumulated amount of these losses is frightening.  How they will be controlled, reduced and, hopefully, financed for the continuing operation of these institutions is a major problem.  It is all part and parcel of the whole question of the public finances.  Senators know from the review that was published today that they are in a serious condition and will require serious remedies.  The remedies cannot all be implemented immediately and even to talk of phasing out some of the deficits over four years is possibly unduly optimistic.  It will probably have to take longer.  But the loss-makers will have to get attention.  We will have to take an overall view of all these State-sponsored activities and we will have to give attention to their financial requirements and financial implications.  I take Senator Whitaker's point that we are still describing amounts given to CIE as repayable assets and that the advances are repayable advances and consequently are shown as assets in their books.  It would be more realistic to describe them as non-repayable grants because in effect that is what they turn out to be.  It is a matter of presentation, although there is an argument in favour of calling them repayable advances because there is an expectation that repayable advances must pay interest to the Exchequer. Whether that interest ever comes is another day's work.  It is an attempt to impose some of the discipline of the balance sheet, illusory though it may be. That, I am sure, is the historical reason for calling them such.  On review of this whole scene we may call them grants so that the public will know exactly what the position is.  It could be better too for the morale of the workers that we do not expect them to operate on commercial <Col N="2329" /> criteria and with impossible financial structures so that they are constantly being projected to the public in a serious loss situation attracting the criticism that would come with that.  We may have to change all that.</P>
    <P>With regard to CIE, the Joint Oireachtas Committee suggested that that part of their operation which can be identified as purely social should be shown differently in their results and that that which is commercial should be shown as such, so that there would be public recognition of the role that CIE play and how each part of that role is to be financed.</P>
    <P>Senator Lambert made the point that the present monopoly situation must be relaxed.  As I said already, it came into being because private enterprise had failed totally, but that is not to say that relaxation of monopoly is not now required.  Again I do not want to preempt the fundamental discussion we must have on CIE and on transport policy generally.  Likewise, with regard to the question of road freight, I take the point Senator Lambert made.  But I am expecting shortly a report from the Transport Consultative Commission on this very subject.  I would be slow to react to what he said in a way that might be pre-emptive and necessarily off the top of my head. Therefore, the caution of office is manifesting itself.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha asked the specific question: what was the cost of the social welfare free travel scheme for the elderly?  I understand that the provision in the Social Welfare vote for 1981 is £12.23 million.  That does not include certain free school transport schemes which are paid for by the Department of Education.  But the social welfare payments, in which Senator Brugha was interested, are calculated to be £12.23 million for this year.  It is like a transport subsidy but, if you like, is not something for which CIE can be blamed.  We have decided that social welfare recipients and the elderly should be provided with free transport.  It is a circular payment emanating from the Exchequer.  If it did not come under the Department of Social <Col N="2330" /> Welfare Vote, then the CIE subvention would be that much greater.  It is as broad as it is long.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker raised the drafting point that the board are not specifically defined in this Bill.  As he suspected, and as I am advised, it is not so defined in this Bill because this Bill amends earlier Acts in which the word is defined.  I take his point though that it might be neater to say specifically for the benefit of a stranger who might &mdash; if one can imagine a stranger wanting to read this Bill &mdash; want to know the definition of the word &ldquo;board&rdquo;.  I take his point and we can draw the attention of the draftsmen to it for suitable Bills in the future.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised by Senators.  As many of them pointed out, the full-scale debate on CIE has yet to take place.  It is something that is a bit daunting because of the size of the problem.  Senators here have referred to the very size of CIE.  Senator Donnelly spoke of its size and that possibly one change to be affected might be smaller units in the future.  That may well be but it is something that will have to be considered.  There is to be remembered the very size of CIE, the scale of its operations, its economic role, its social role.  Then again there is the morale of their workers and how that is to be restored.  It does seem that it is at a lower level than we would like.  People feel that bad morale is the cause of the constant series of industrial disputes.  Indeed, I think there have been over 100 of them in the last four years, though the bulk of those have been unofficial.  I suppose that does show some malaise somewhere. Therefore, our examination of CIE will have to look at matters that are not purely economic, that are not purely transport. We will have to look at these intangibles &mdash; human relationships between management and workers, between workers themselves, the whole complex trade union situation within CIE, this intangible question of morale.  Possibly all those things will come right if we get the economics right.  And, if we get the structures right, all those other things should follow.  We hope they will follow.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that I am <Col N="2331" /> conscious of the need for urgent attention to this problem and for bringing forward proposals urgently.  I nearly said: bringing forward solutions urgently &mdash; that would be a brave statement &mdash; but I will certainly come forward with proposals at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise from £1,200 million to £1,400 million the limit on total expenditure by the ESB for capital purposes.  Senators will be aware that the primary function of the ESB, under the Electricity Supply Acts, is to ensure the adequate supply and distribution of electricity throughout the State.  The board has a number of other subsidiary functions but we are concerned here with the board's main responsibility to ensure that electricity is at no time in short supply.</P>
      <P>The history of electricity generation in Ireland since the ESB was established over 50 years ago shows that although there were periods when demand levelled off, overall there has been a steady increase in electricity consumption over the years.  The enormous growth in demand over the past 50 years is illustrated by the following figures: in 1930 the ESB had 50,000 customers and sold 43 million units of electricity.  At year ended March 1980 the ESB had one million customers and sold 8,560 million units of electricity.  This means that a 20fold increase in customers created sales almost 200 times greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to keep pace with this demand there has been a continuing capital investment in electricity generating plant and networks.  Generating capacity now stands at 3,090MW, compared with something in the region of 85MW when the ESB was in its infancy.  This reflects our increasing reliance on electricity in industry, commerce and the home and demonstrates its essential function in the economic and social expansion of the <Col N="2333" /> country.  Electricity now accounts for about 31 per cent of our energy requirements.</P>
    <P>Demand for electricity is closely allied to economic and social development and therefore it is in the nature of things that it can be expected to increase.  Planning to meet that demand is very complex requiring a high degree of flexibility.  The long lead time of eight years or more required for the construction of base load plant means that we are now building to meet expected electricity demand at the end of the decade.  Such long-term planning requires flexibility to allow for factors which are not readily predictable. This is why flexibility is an integral part of the plant programme currently approved in respect of the ESB.  The plant programme envisages an additional capacity of 1,435MW, towards the end of the decade but about 32 per cent of this is in the form of combustion turbines. These are intended to meet peak demand.  Because of their relatively short lead time of about three years, their construction can be deferred to coincide with any fall off in electricity demand, for whatever reason.  This is the flexible element of the plant programme.</P>
    <P>Of course increased investment in plant entails expansion and improvement of transmission and distribution networks. A significant proportion of the ESB's capital investment goes into such works. But there is another element in our energy strategy which is of vital importance.  We must decrease as much as possible our dependence on oil.  At present, generating capacity is about 54 per cent oil-fired.  In the knowledge that oil is a rapidly diminishing resource, it is only prudent that we should reduce our reliance on that particular energy source for electricity generation.  This is why base load plant recently constructed and currently under construction is intended to be fired by fuels other than oil.</P>
    <P>A major diversification away from oil will have been achieved when the 900 MW coal-fired station at Moneypoint is commissioned between 1985 and 1988. Construction of an additional 80 MW of peat-fired plant, some 240 MW of dualfired plant which will accommodate natural <Col N="2334" /> gas and the prospect of over 45 MW of plant burning low grade native coal will ensure maximum use of native resources and make a not insignificant contribution to the programme of diversification.  Thus, towards the end of the eighties we will have reduced to just over 40 per cent the amount of our generating capacity which is dependent on oil.</P>
    <P>Although the plant programme which I have outlined is the mainstay of our strategy in relation to diversification for electricity generation, we would be lacking in responsibility if we did not assess the prospects of alternative energy sources in the face of finite and shrinking conventional resources.  The ESB are playing their role in this regard.  A practical example of this is the board's current windpower programme.  Four medium-sized wind turbines will be sited in four different locations to again first-hand knowledge of the economics, efficiency, reliability and availability of wind energy in the Irish environment.  The programme will cost an estimated £630,000. The ESB have also been examining the possibilities of biomass as an energy source.  This project is EEC supported and is being carried out in conjunction with Bord na Móna and the Forestry and Wildlife Service.  The ESB have, in fact, been successfully using wood waste and thinnings combined with slack in their smaller stations.</P>
    <P>In the field of wave energy, the board participate in tests being carried out in Japan and Britain and monitors developments world wide.  While practically all of the major hydro sources have been developed a number of rivers have been surveyed for small hydro potential and work on a project for the Ballisodare river is continuing.  The board also provide an advisory service to the public in regard to private development of small hydro resources.  My Department are at present examining the possibility of making funds available for such development.</P>
    <P>For almost a decade the ESB have been interested in the prospects of district heating.  A project demonstrating the commercial use of residual heat derived from electricity generation is now well advanced at the Lanesboro power stain <Col N="2335" /> tion.  District heating studies are being undertaken in the Dublin inner city areas and the Mahon Peninsula near Cork city. The ESB have been commissioned by Dublin Corporation to study the possibility of incinerating refuse to fuel the Ballymun district heating system.  This system at present uses oil.</P>
    <P>In the past few years, the ESB have played an important role in energy conservation in the domestic and industrial sectors.  Since 1974 the ESB's advisory service for industry has been helping industry to achieve economies in energy usage through conservation and efficient usage.</P>
    <P>In the domestic sector, the board have launched publicity campaigns with various conservation themes, including the issue of leaflets and booklets on the efficient use of energy.  It is interesting to note that many of the applications for grants under my Department's attic insulation scheme are the result of promotional activity by the board.</P>
    <P>Within the next couple of years there is the prospect that natural gas will be piped to Dublin and other centres of high population density.  All these developments taken together should contribute towards bringing down the level of peak demand for electricity.  This, in turn, should contribute to a reduction in capital investment on new plant in the long term.</P>
    <P>On the question of nuclear energy as a source of electricity in Ireland I would emphasise that the Government's policy is quite clear.  No final decision will be taken until such time as a thorough examination of all relevant aspects, including safety, economic and environmental considerations, has been completed.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable regret that the electricity inter-connector with the North has been out of action since 1975.  The interconnector proved its value when it was in operation in the early seventies.  If it had remained undamaged it would have enhanced our security of electricity supply, provided considerable savings in fuel consumption, created the prospect of significant savings in capital investment in plant and provided profitable <Col N="2336" /> opportunities for trading of electricity.  I am sure it is the will of this House and of the people as a whole that those responsible should realise the immeasurable damage to the economy their actions have caused.  The Government are determined to pursue their efforts to achieve maximum security of supply and efficiency of operation which interconnection with other electricity grids can provide.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the capital and labour intensive nature of the electricity supply industry.  For example the capital budget of the ESB in 1981 is expected to be about £209 million.  The bulk of this is for construction of plant but some £70 million will be spent on improvement of networks.  The number of new jobs arising out of that expenditure is expected to be in the region of 1,350.  The expected breakdown of capital expenditure in the period 1982 to 1985 is as follows: generation projects &mdash; £700 million; transmission &mdash; £150 million; distribution &mdash; £200 million; premises and general &mdash; £50 million.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory limit on capital expenditure by the ESB was increased by £500 million to £1,200 million under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1979.  This was sufficient to meet the ESB's requirements for about two years and the stage has been reached where capital expenditure by the ESB in excess of the present limit is unavoidable.  It is necessary, therefore, that the limit should be raised to £1,400 million to enable the ESB to get on with their capital programme.  The increase now proposed will meet the ESB's requirements for only about a year.</P>
    <P>However, the ESB have put proposals to my Department that future statutory limits should be expressed as a borrowing limit as in the case of other State bodies such as Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis Éireann and not as an expenditure limit. The proposed increase in the expenditure limit is therefore an interim measure until my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, have considered the ESB's alternative proposals.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="2337" />
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister and wish him well in his very responsible position in charge of our energy policies on which so much of our future prosperity depends.  I am very glad to be able to support this Bill because for 13 years I had the satisfaction of participating in the deliberations on forward planning as a member of the board to which I had the honour of being reappointed by different Governments.  I had, therefore, first-hand experience of the conscientious commitment of the directors and management to the objectives of the board which are to serve the community to the best of their ability and to ensure the availability of electricity in parallel with our economic growth and at minimum cost to the Irish consumer.</P>
      <P>In retrospect, however, we must admit that plans to achieve these objectives were taken rather in isolation and the setting up of the Department of Energy has been a major step forward, and I must compliment the former Minister, Deputy Colley, for the personal flair and dedication which he gave to the initial co-ordination of our sources of energy and to the development of the Department.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the ESB are a highly complex and technical organisation and as a member of the board, although I might have been qualified to talk on finance and marketing, industrial relations, economic affairs and changes in structure according to the rapidly changing circumstances, I often found it difficult to question specialised or technical assumptions concerning proposals relating to the new generating stations or distribution networks as put forward by the executives.  I was delighted to read in the Official Report that the Minister stated in the Dáil that those in the Department of Energy are well qualified to forecast energy needs and are well equipped from the point of view of manpower and technology to monitor the energy needs of the economy.  These are factors which I consider vital in order to complement the contributions made by part-time members of State boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time, over four years ago, I recollect that we were more than 70 per <Col N="2338" /> cent dependent on oil and I am glad to read that this was down to 64 per cent at the end of March 1980 and 54 or 55 per cent at the end of March 1981.  Deputy Colley, in conjunction with the board, is to be congratulated on this quite dramatic achievement and I have no doubt that the target of 40 per cent at the end of the eighties will be achieved given the continuity of the exemplary co-operation and co-ordination there is between the board and the Department of Energy.  Because of the long lead time of eight years or more required for the construction of a generating station, the ESB, I found, were more conscious of forward planning than any of the other State enterprises and in the debate on the science budget &mdash; which sadly was never concluded in this session of the Seanad &mdash; the only criticism I had was that Government Departments were required to prepare expenditure projections only up to the year 1983.  It should be for at least ten years.  I reckon that is why we are hearing now in so many reports on the various State bodies that one of the major problems is under-investment because of the lack of adequate forward projections in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Another illuminating proof of the success of the Department of Energy has been the forward planning of alternative sources which the Minister has illustrated in his opening statement.  The urgency to make a decision on nuclear energy has receded.  The magnitude of such a decision was brought home to me as a member of the board some years ago when the estimate was £600 million, which in today's terms could probably be trebled and in ten years' time, God knows what the estimate might be.  I just mention this to illustrate the fact that what we are asking for today, the increase in the total expenditure from £1.2 to £1.4 million, is minimal and obviously only of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>I have said it before and I will say it again: it is important to make it clear to the public at large that the ESB must raise capital through internal resources and by borrowing on the home and foreign markets at the going rate of interest. It is a measure of the ESB standing with <Col N="2339" /> the financial institutions here and abroad that they have been successful in raising capital in the past for their developing programme.  It is essential therefore that the financial soundness of the operation is sustained and thus the ability of the ESB to borrow externally should not be prejudiced by the demands from other State bodies without a full knowledge of the total facts concerning our total national borrowing requirements and powers projected forward on an annual basis for the next ten years.</P>
    <P>My point is that as members of the EMS our external capital borrowing powers are restricted and that some of the projects which we have in mind at the moment may have to take their place in a list of priorities.  In other words, where such projects cannot be funded either from internal resources of the public body in question or from borrowings within the country, it is obvious that with the restricted ability under the EMS to borrow externally, then questions of nuclear stations, jumbo jets, CIE subsidies, rail and road networks and other infrastructural proposals must be looked at in the context of our total potential national borrowing programme.  While I have been a Member of the Oireachtas I do not consider that I have been alerted sufficiently to the enormity of future borrowings from capital projects which face us so that priorities may be debated in time with more realistic appraisal.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the opportunity pass without paying tribute to the late Jimmy Kelly with whom I had the privilege of working whilst a member of the board.  Because he was a humble man his contribution to the progress to our largest State enterprise will be under-estimated.  He served us well during a time of great expansion and unprecedented social change.  He was a man who was totally immersed in the affairs and progress of the ESB.  He bore his great responsibility with calm and fortitude and he was an inspiration to all both within and outside the ESB.  We are fortunate now to have a man of Paddy Moriarty's ability and qualifications to succeed him but I should like to say that we must also be grateful to Jimmy Kelly <Col N="2340" /> for choosing and training his successor &mdash; this could be an example to other State enterprises &mdash; in advance of his early retirement and sad demise.</P>
    <P>I hope the comprehensive agreement under discussion will come to fruition because it is difficult to understand how in a well-structured and efficient organisation like the ESB which has improved its communication system with the staff enormously and has shown internally deep concern and continual research into all aspects of industrial relations any small pockets of dissatisfaction could block such a goal.  We need more than ever the removal of any threat to the community by a stoppage to electricity supply.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive agreement would provide the proof that we need that the appointment of four worker seats on the board has brought new hope in the direction of finding a logical solution to the national problem of unofficial disputes. Proof that the advancement of worker participation towards more stable industrial relations in this and other State bodies will be an encouragement to the private sector.  We hear reports that electricity costs are amongst the highest in the world and I am not quite clear how much of this is due to the fact that the ESB does not receive Government subsidy like other State bodies.  I am, however, satisfied that the past performance of the ESB now co-ordinated with the assistance of the Department of Energy will ensure that electricity costs are moderated in the future so that Irish industry can remain competitive.  In supporting the Bill I wish the Minister well in his efforts to achieve these goals.</P>

      <P>All Members will give support to this Bill and I do not propose to delay its passing.  I commend the work of the board, directors, executives and workers of the Electricity Supply Board on the initiatives taken by the board as outlined by the Minister.  It is extraordinary the degree to which we are now dependent on the success of the energy-producing ESB.  I welcome their proposals, which, I hope will be successful, to reduce the dependence of the Electricity Supply Board on oil, as set out by the Minister. Indeed, the whole area of energy production is one that is fascinating and vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the idea of giving support to any private interest that may be able to provide additional water power.  I welcome the experiments that are taking place in the use of wind as an energy producer and the experiments that are taking place in the production of biomass.  At a later stage if the biomass development is found to be successful can any encouragement be given in this area to private interests to engage in the private production of electricity for the ESB?  I understand that the problem in the biomass areas is that of centralisation, that the efficient means of production of energy through the use of biomass involves having to centre the plant in the area where the timber is grown.  There are a couple of questions that occurred to me which are of some interest.  One is, to ask the Minister the extent of involvement of the board in overseas development, particularly in the Third World.  I should also like to know the extent of borrowing by the board outside of borrowing from the State.  Finally, I should like to know the cost of the free electricity scheme to old age pensioners.  What is the Exchequer contribution to the board <Col N="2342" /> for that free scheme?  I welcome the Bill and support it.</P>

      <P>Déanaim comhghairdeas chomh maith leis an Aire agus treasláim a ghradam nua leis agus guím gach rath ar a shaothar.  It is a welcome change to be discussing the ESB rather than the hapless CIE.  It just goes to show how different semi-State companies are. The business of transport is a much more mundane and more loss-making business than a productive, imaginative and creative enterprise such as the Electricity Supply Board and I join with the other Senators in paying tribute to the board. I think Senator Brugha's question about their activities in the Third World is relevant.  In the past there were many genuine people and organisations who were concerned about the operations of the ESB in the Philippines: I do not know if they are still concerned.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the ESB are suffering financial embarrassment at the moment, some of that is due to the sheer political expediency of the previous Government, in artificially avoiding price increases and, consequently, inflation costs, by refusing the ESB's application for a price increase.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with what the Minister said about the electricity inter-connector with the North.  He said that if it had remained undamaged it would have enhanced our security of electricity supply, provided considerable savings in fuel consumption, created the prospect of significant savings in capital investment in plant and provided profitable opportunities for trading of electricity.  Indeed it would.  Not only would the inter-connector have utilised the resources in this island and have resulted in considerable savings, but there would also be the enormous psychological advantage of co-operation between public corporations in neighbouring jurisdictions in this island. The inter-connector would have fostered this psychological awareness: in short, the inter-connector was a mechanism for a unifying exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that those responsible for destroying the inter-connector should realise the immeasurable damage <Col N="2343" /> to the economy their actions have caused. Of course, they realise the immeasurable damage they are causing; that is precisely why they do it.  In this connection, those who are now deluded or who deceive themselves into support for subversive fronts, might care to reflect on the obscene strategy of seeking a united Ireland by repeatedly destroying energy and travel links between North and South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Edward Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Senators who have contributed to the debate and in the first instance for their kind words of congratulation on my appointment to office.</P>
      <P>Senator Lambert raised a number of points.  From his first-hand experience as a member of the board, he appreciates the highly technical nature of the board's activities.  I, too, welcomed the establishment of the Department of Energy.  I share his opinion of the contribution which Deputy Colley made as Minister for Energy to the development of the Department and, indeed, I stated this in the Dáil in the debate there.  I support his words of tribute to Deputy Colley.</P>
      <P>The officials in the Department whom I have met and with whom I have had consultations have impressed me very much, as has their understanding of the situation, their commitment to the development of the Department and to forward planning in relation to national energy requirements.  They are a very professional Department and are very necessary in a period of inflation and in a period in which we must cost our energy needs at all times.  We must be aware of the cost of energy, whether it is the cost in financial terms, in current terms or, indeed, more important, in capital terms. It is there that the expenditure can be extremely heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my introductory speech, there is a mechanism in the expenditure planning by the board.  The gas turbines which are used to meet the peak demand have a lead time of only three years.  If there is a rapid growth, expenditure can be put immediately into these gas turbines to meet a rapid increase in usage of <Col N="2344" /> electricity and if the growth rate of national production is slow the same mechanism can be used to slow down the capital expenditure.  It is significant that electricity produced by oil has fallen substantially from 70 per cent some years ago to the present percentage of approximately 54 per cent.  It is intended to continue to reduce our national dependance on oil.  We intend to move to a situation that by the end of the eighties electricity generated by oil will amount to 40 per cent of the total electricity generated. That requires a lot of planning and quite a lot of study and this has been carried on by the Department and, of course, by the ESB.  The need for forward projection is so vital and we are all so aware of it that, perhaps, there is no need to mention it.  The cost to the country of oil and the real cost of increases in oil prices that this country has had to face in the past six years have done great damage to our economy and, indeed, to the prospects of growth in our economy and in the economies of other western countries as well.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Lambert and Senator Brugha emphasised the need for seeking alternative sources of energy.  There are experiments, and one can only call them experiments in relation to the possibility of hydro-power, wind-power and the use of biomass.  These are only in the experimental stage.  As I stated in my speech, the ESB examined every possible hydro-power source and they feel they have exhausted their possibility in industry here.  The Department are prepared to help by grant aid work on micro-hydro-power plants.  But we must be sure that any projects are soundly based.  It is our intention to examine them very closely.</P>
    <P>The extent of the ESB's overseas involvement especially in the Third World was raised by Senator Brugha.  Consultancy activities abroad were undertaken by the ESB during the mid-seventies. They are now, in fact, well-established activities.  Assignments have been carried out in the USA, Switzerland, Sudan, Nigeria, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The activity produced a turn-over in 1979 <Col N="2345" /> - 1980 of approximimately £4 million and a surplus of £.66 million.  That was the information requested by Senator Brugha.  In relation to borrowing, the borrowing from the Exchequer is £45 million of the total.  The rest was raised by the ESB themselves and of this 65 per cent is foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha also raised the question of the cost of free electricity for old age pensioners.  I have no separate figures.  It amounts to 5p per unit for 300 units for two months in a year for all old age pensioners.  But, of course, that scheme is administered by the Department of Social Welfare and is not under the aegis of the Department of Energy. That also answers the question in relation to foreign borrowing which Senator Lambert raised.  I agree with his comments about the need to recognise the limitation to growth which exists and that our national resources and the nation's capacity to borrow abroad is, in the long term, limited.  Any Government have a responsibility to examine in depth the whole question of the direction of foreign borrowing in the short, medium and long term.  We must recognise that the balance of payments cannot be allowed to remain in deficit.  The level of the balance of payments currently is not acceptable.  It would land the country in serious economic trouble and our position within the EMS would be put at risk.  The Government cannot allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Lambert mentioned the comprehensive agreement currently being negotiated.  As I have not yet received the final result of all the balloting I am not in a position to comment as I do not wish to prejudice the negotiations one way or the other.  I am sure the Seanad understands my position in that regard.  I hope it can be agreed by all the unions involved and that there will be industrial peace in the ESB which is vital for the economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome worker participation at board level.  They have much to offer and I hope other State bodies will follow this model.  Hopefully, private enterprise will also see the wisdom of having workers participate at board level.</P>

      <P>Will we see the results?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could use the German model where there are two levels of participation.  I agree with any moves to have worker participation at board level.  In these trying economic times they would be far more appreciative of the difficulties facing management, industry and commerce.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the cost of electricity and have a commitment to ensure that the cost to the comsumer is at the most economic lowest price.  That is a complex issue because the board's finances must be kept in balance.  Taking one year with another they must not be in a loss making situation.  There is also the question of the ESB financing their own capital expenditure to a certain level.  The level that should be, whether 40 per cent or whatever, will always be debated.  I am committed to ensuring that the board will be properly financed, as it is required to be under the Act.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of the science budget which Senator Lambert raised, I would agree to longer periods of planning.  It is difficult to plan for the long term.  It would be difficult to plan if the rapid rates of inflation, unsatisfactory levels of unemployment and drops in growth of GNP which we had in the seventies were repeated in the eighties.  I accept his suggestion that there is need for long term planning and certainly planning in excess of a three-year period.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy mentioned the inter-connector with Northern Ireland.  The bombing by terrorists has done great damage to the security of electricity.  The damage was done on the northern side and caused the inter-connector to be put out of action.  This is a matter which will receive my attention.  I should like the Northern Ireland Electricity Board to put it back into action.  The security of it must be guaranteed and that primarily is a decision for the Northern Ireland authority.  It is a matter to which I will bring my attention to bear and on which I hope to enter into discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards inter-connecting with other national grids.  I should like to mention <Col N="2347" /> the possibility of an east-west inter-connector with England.  Discussions have been ongoing and a draft final report has just been received in my office and is under consideration.  There would be great economic benefit to us from an inter-connector with Britain or Europe. It would have the benefit of capital savings and security of supply.  This is a major problem to which I shall address myself in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate and assure them their comments will be taken seriously by me and my Department officials.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This resolution arises from the recent restructuring of the particle board firm at Scarriff, County Clare.  On 26 March 1981 the Dáil approved a supplementary forestry estimate of £1,293,000 in this context.</P>
      <P>The difficulties experienced by the chipboard industry in Ireland over the past decade resulted in the closure of three of the country's four mills, the exception being Chipboard Ltd, Scarriff, which was in receivership since April 1980 and which remained in production through State assistance to the receiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package for restructuring this firm <Col N="2348" /> involved the setting up of a new company, namely Chipboard Products Limited, in which the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry became the major shareholder. Very briefly, the restructuring arrangements, which were completed on 13 May 1981, involved an agreement between the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and a local consortium to purchase the assets of Chipboard Ltd, in receivership, and form a new company to carry on the business of particle board manufacture at Scarriff.  The board of the new company consists of four State directors and three directors representing the private investors.  The company have an ordinary share capital of £527,000, of which the State subscribed £334,000 and private shareholders provided £193,000. There is provision for a share option scheme which, if taken up, would increase the private share capital to £231,000.  The State also subscribed at par for £200,000 15 per cent redeemable cumulative preference shares.</P>
    <P>A loan of £466,000 for a period of 12 years was provided by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and there is provision for capital grants, totalling £1,012,000 over a three-year period, of which £293,000 was included in the Supplementary Estimate.  The package also incorporates a timber supply agreement with the new company whereby the Forest and Wildlife Service will continue, for a period of three years, an arrangement whereby the existing firm were paid to harvest a proportion of their wood requirements from State forests and allowed to remove the wood free of charge.</P>
    <P>Apart from the direct financial investment and timber supply agreement referred to, the State agreed to guarantee £400,000 of a bank loan of £750,000 to the company.  This guarantee necessitates an appropriate amendment of the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, and it is specifically in this context that the resolution now before the House arises.  Before any moneys from the loan can be disbursed, approval of this amendment is necessary in order to legalise the guarantee.  There is an urgency about the matter inasmuch as it is envisaged that <Col N="2349" /> the company will require to draw down on the bank loan in the very near future. I recommend the resolution to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I thank the Seanad for giving this resolution the approval which is required for the purposes I have outlined.  Since no question of a controversial nature has been raised it is not necessary for me to say very much.  As the House will see, this arrangement is somewhat unusual inasmuch as the company are now virtually a State enterprise.  The company in Scarriff got into trouble to such an extent that they could not carry on.</P>
      <P>The House might wonder why the necessary assistance was not provided by the Industrial Development Authority or Fóir Teoranta.  I understand that Fóir Teoranta did their best to assist the company when they were in difficulties but decided that the company, as then structured, could not be made viable.  The Industrial Development Authority did not see fit to intervene.  One might ask: why did the Department of Fisheries and Forestry intervene?  The reason is that that Department could provide the raw materials&mdash;the timber necessary for the continuance of this undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The firm are now virtually a State enterprise.  The State has provided equity capital to the extent of £534,000.  There is also a departmental loan of £466,000. Grants have been provided over a period of three years to the extent of £1,012,000 of which £293,000 was provided in the Supplementary Estimate.  The State is also guaranteeing a bank loan of £400,000 under the State Guarantees Act, 1954. We are now authorising an amendment to the Schedule of that Act to enable the State to do this.  That £400,000 is part of <Col N="2350" /> a loan of £750,000.  The State is guaranteeing £400,000 of it.  Private capital has been provided to the extent of £193,000. Private investors have an option on a further £38,000 of shares if they wish to take that up.  As well as the loan we are dealing with here, the £750,000 of which we are guaranteeing £400,000, the private shareholders have provided £57,000 by way of loans.  In addition to what I have said, the State is providing timber, the raw material, over the next three years free of charge to the company.  In fact they are paying the company for half of this.  In other words, they are making the timber available free of charge and paying the company for taking it away.  I thought I had better spell that out because that is the position.  That was done for two reasons.  There were 200 jobs at stake and about 150 jobs will be saved by doing this.  If the company proceed satisfactorily there will be a market for forest thinnings in later years.</P>
    <P>I did not have time to speak at length on this in the Dáil.  This arrangement was entered into by the previous Government and the previous Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is a party to the agreement which provides for the guarantee which we are now providing.  I sincerely hope that things will go well for this company in Scarriff which has taken over the chipboard factory there.  My Department will certainly be monitoring the activities of the company in the years to come and I hope that the company will justify the confidence placed in it.  The principle involved is a good principle.  There is a mixture of State enterprise and private enterprise and that is good.</P>
    <P>Again I want to thank the House for giving me this motion without any debate or without any delay.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.25 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
