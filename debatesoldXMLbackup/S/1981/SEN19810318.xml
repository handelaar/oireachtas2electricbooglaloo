    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 18 February, 1981, takes note of the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta which was laid before the Seanad on 5 February, 1981 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash; Senator Hillery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this motion.  It is a significant one as it is the first debate the Oireachtas have had on a report from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  We can all recall that for many years Members of the Oireachtas felt a great sense of frustration at the inability of the Oireachtas to become involved in this particular sector of Irish life.  The practice grew that when questions were asked in relation to State-sponsored companies <Col N="1158" /> for the Minister to say they were autonomous and that he had no responsibility.</P>
      <P>Members of the Oireachtas were annoyed that bodies, which were in receipt of large amounts of State funds by way of capital or subventions, apparently were being excluded from overview by the Oireachtas.  The eventual setting up of the committee was very welcome. It is significant that the work of the committee is brought to the floor of the House and that we now have the opportunity to debate for the first time in detail the activities of an important company in the State-sponsored sector.</P>
      <P>The view, unfortunately, that the members of the committee have had to form with regard to the various companies has been, if not universally gloomy, very nearly so, because they are all beset with various problems, which chiefly have to do with the imbalance of the financial structure which now prevails in most of the corporations concerned.  I can only think of one of them which is profitable in the commercial sense, yet those companies or their managements. There may be some exceptions to that, on which a report has yet to come.  In fairness to the companies it is only right to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have given them their brief have been confused about the precise nature of their brief.  We have given them a mixture of a social and a commercial brief but it is not spelt out clearly what precisely their responsibilities are in regard to each area.  We have expected them to discharge a social obligation while providing them with commercial funds.  This is very evident in the report on the Sugar Company.  It will be seen that much of their activity has been to provide employment in areas of the country which might not have had any industry if it were not for the setting up by the Sugar Company of their plants in those areas.  With the passage of time, the growing sophistication of Irish industrial and commercial life and the complexity of the world in which the Sugar Company are operating, some of the plants are now <Col N="1159" /> clearly to be seen as social only and their commercial future is very limited indeed. In regard to Tuam we were quite blunt in the report.  Tuam does not appear to have a commercial future.</P>
    <P>We suggested in the report that the time has now come for the Government to differentiate with regard to the Sugar Company as to what role they want the Sugar Company to play.  If the Sugar Company are to play a social role, in fairness to those who are working in the company this should be spelt out clearly. If the role is to be a social one funds should be made available for the company to discharge their social obligations. It is not fair to allow a company such as this to be put in a position that when their annual report is published a loss is shown, because the people reading the papers just notice the loss.  The amount of publicity the report gets might not be very great or the attention paid by the casual reader sufficiently detailed to appreciate that the factors going into making up that loss are not purely commercial ones but that it is compounded by the social role we have forced on to those State-sponsored companies.</P>
    <P>It is damaging to the morale of the people who work in those companies if they feel that they are being blamed for losses which are commercially unavoidable because of factors which are totally outside their control.  The Sugar Company find themselves with a crazy debt equity ratio at the moment.  Over the years the funds which would normally have been available for reinvestment were carrying losses in one of their divisions.  It was clear for a long time that that was an unprofitable division.  I do not believe any Government could have tolerated the thought of doing what a commercial enterprise would have done, excising the loss-making area totally.  It was an expectation that the Sugar Company would carry this particular division and in fact they did so.  The upshot of that policy was that the finances of the company went completely out of control. They have now to make a large amount of further investment if the company are to continue profitably on the sugar side <Col N="1160" /> alone.  The sugar side was consistently profitable over the years but, unfortunately, it is now falling into an unprofitable state.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company have asked for a considerable amount of equity to remedy this state of affairs but there are other problems in the company besides the question of more equity.  They have constraints now in that whole area arising from our membership of the European Community.  There is difficulty with their growers and there is a certain lack of morale among the farming community which may reflect itself in deliveries of supplies.  Even if the investment were to be made and the plants modernised those areas still have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence that the company are suffering from the fundamental malaise of the Irish industrial sector generally, low productivity or bad workmanship.  The throughput in the factory per worker is significantly lower than in the UK which does not stand very high in the reputation of having an energetic work-force either.  There are obviously some basic problems which have to be tackled before we can look on the Sugar Company with the optimism we would like to look on them and before we can say that this company, which were profitable for so many years in the past, will, with an injection of capital and new management plans, suddenly become profitable again.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties.  However, we are impressed in the committee that there is management expertise within the company to overcome these difficulties. This management expertise needs the support of the Government by way of encouragement and, more importantly, by way of extra equity.  I am pessimistic about the capacity of the Exchequer to supply the equity needed.  We cannot send the company down the borrowing road because to do so is only to compound the imbalance of their balance sheet.</P>
    <P>Because of our position on the committee, we have been able to get an over-view of the capital requirements of the whole State-sponsored sector.  The amount of money needed to make that sector viable commercially is frighteningly <Col N="1161" /> large and beyond the capacity of the Exchequer to supply it even within a reasonable time.  Nervertheless, for a company such as this, every effort should be made within the constraints on the Exchequer to supply the capital needed by this company.</P>
    <P>In our report we were gloomy on the question of the food division of the Sugar Company.  Undoubtedly they have been beset with problems for years.  There is no simple answer to these problems or to improving the situation.  If one were to be entirely commercial, obviously the future would be bleak and short.  One cannot be commercial with regard to the food processing industry in a country like Ireland.  When we consider the staggeringly high amounts of vegetables imported into this country, we must stand back and have a look at ourselves, and ask ourselves are we crazy, in that we cannot so organise our own affairs as to provide those vegetables ourselves.  The figures are quite staggering.</P>
    <P>The vehicle we will have to use to improve that situation is probably the food division of the Sugar Company.  It is readymade to some extent, but obviously it will require a fair amount of reorganisation.  There is the point, too, that the home market is comparatively small.  While the amounts being imported are high, nevertheless in terms of total market, they are quite small.  That division will have to be able to export as well if it is to be viable commercially.</P>
    <P>The problems of the Sugar Company are many.  They are problems shared by other State-sponsored companies.  Our examination of the company and our confrontation, as it were &mdash; and I do not use that word in any adversary sense &mdash; our meeting with representatives of the company entitle us to give grounds for optimism for their future.  The management expertise is there.  The energy on the part of those in charge is high.  I suppose the provision of money can be arranged.</P>
    <P>The morale within the company is an important matter.  One way in which that can be kept high is by a clear brief from the Government and the Oireachtas as to what is expected from the company.  If some parts of their operations are social <Col N="1162" /> and political, as an expansion in the vegetable area might be at this stage, this should be clearly spelled out.  It should be indicated to the company that the Government's expectations take into account that there are unusual commercial difficulties in the way of commercial success as judged by the normal criterion of a good bottom line.</P>
    <P>This is a problem not only in regard to this company but also other companies in the State-sponsored sector.  We are not clear in our own minds what we expect from them.  Some type of an accounting mechanism should be devised pointing out clearly to the public that where they have a clear commercial role they are successful but where it is clouded by a social role a differentiation has to be made.  In fairness to those operating the company, this is necessary.</P>
    <P>One must congratulate the company on their years of success.  Speaking in terms of success having regard to the bottom line, the success has been significant in a very vital area.  The company operated where the private sector was unable or unwilling to do so at the time of our national development.  It is only right that we should recognise that and indicate to the company that their efforts are appreciated, their present difficulties are understood, and that in this report from a committee representative of the two Houses there is an understanding of their problems and a willingness to assist in whatever way possible towards their solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the joint committee on the extremely useful work they are doing.  In recent years there has been a huge proportion of State activity in the semi-State sector.  In terms of democracy where there were semi-State bodies with immense power but outside direct parliamentary responsibility, this led to very serious problems when one thought of the amount of State financing and employment in the semi-State field.  Of all the Oireachtas committees this committee have been very successful.  There were misgivings initially that the confidentiality which applied to work of the <Col N="1163" /> semi-State bodies might be breached in certain circumstances, and that there might be an uneasy relationship between the senior executives of the semi-State bodies and Members of the Oireachtas. The experience has been extremely good in terms of give and take, and the quality of the reports has been excellent.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on this report on Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.  They relate to the west of Ireland and the sugar company in Tuam.  I am aware from reading this report, and I have been aware for some time, of the very serious problems with regard to the economics of the Tuam sugar factory. I note the remarks made by the committee in that section of the report.  The comments I want to make relate largely to social matters rather than purely economic matters.</P>
      <P>Those of us who come from the west of Ireland have been arguing for years that we are talking about a part of this country which is unique and in which circumstances are completely different, and no more so than in the agricultural sector.  When we talk about the grasslands in the south and the east, and the heavy milking counties, we are talking about a totally different social picture, of congested holdings, of small holdings, of problems with regard to alternative employment which, in my view, make the issue of the Tuam sugar factory completely different from the issue in other factories and an issue which should be treated on social grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a much broader sense, some of us sought politically during the time of the previous Government to have a western development board established to be charged with the economic development of the five counties of Connacht together with Donegal.  The purpose of that related to the social circumstances of the west where we envisaged that the western development board would be responsible to a Government Minister who, in turn, would be responsible to the Cabinet, so that the buck would stop there.  We suggested that that board would get their funds annually from Dáil Eireann and <Col N="1164" /> would decide within a western context how they would dispose of these funds.</P>
    <P>Had that board been established the social issues we are talking about relating to the Tuam sugar factory would have been discussed by that board.  We appreciate that the responsibility of the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta to the Minister relates to economic issues, agriculture, cost of inputs, cost of outputs, mechanisation in the sugar beet field and tonnage of beet in specific areas.</P>
    <P>Apart from that there are the social factors which are unique and which are the business of the Government.  I appreciate that, within the narrow context of their brief, the-Sugar Company may feel they have to make hard economic decisions.</P>
    <P>On the broadest possible political ground we are dealing with issues relating to Tuam, which essentially concern political decisions.  We are talking about a wider area and, frankly, on this wider area, for the reasons which I have mentioned, the retention of the Tuam factory has my full support.</P>
    <P>The possible approach to it, again expanding my social view to the agricultural end, we have circumstances where we are paying a great deal of money in unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance from which we are getting no return as a nation.  This system obtains for social reasons to allow people in less well off parts of the country to survive, people who would not otherwise be living in this country or in the west but in Birmingham, London, Chicago or New York.  That might be a little imaginative thinking but it is not within the ambit of the Sugar Company <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Tuam plant, where you are talking about the production of sugar beet with a lesser level of mechanisation, without the same possibilities for income because of the size of the farms.  Possibly the social answer is in a western context because the essence of the Tuam factory is that there is not a sufficient amount of beet grown in the west to feed that factory and that is the major consideration.</P>
    <P>Possibly the way a Government, in the broader sense, should look at this specific issue is to get back to fundamentals, get <Col N="1165" /> back to the land and to sugar beet and see, perhaps, if within these western counties they might not provide the incentive at source to the farming community in an attempt to have more beet grown in the area which in turn should help the economics of the Tuam factory.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Sugar Company on the work which they have done over the years.  I know many of the personnel in the Tuam factory and of their attempts at diversification in the grassland area and, more recently, in the energy field in the turf area.  Recently I have had personal discussions with the people in Tuam concerning bogland issues and they have taken very considerable initiatives.  I know that they are doing their best to diversify from what has been a very difficult base and I wish them well in that context.  I urge Government to look at this issue in Tuam in the broadest possible sense so that an equitable solution rather than a disastrous social decision will be made which will have welcome consequences.</P>

      <P>Before making some concluding remarks on the debate on the Sugar Company, I should like to extend a warm welcome to Deputy Michael Smith, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, on his first visit to the Seanad.  His appointment is deserved and I wish him every success in his new and onerous position.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney has underlined that this is the first report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies to be debated in either House of the Oireachtas.  Listening to the debate has proved the work of the committee to have been a healthy and positive exercise.  As a member of the Joint Committee, I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, and, indeed, several of my fellow Senators for the generous remarks they have made about the work that has gone into producing this report on the Sugar Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general agreement in the House that the company are a major industrial concern of national importance.  The Minister's speech was a constructive and comprehensive contribution <Col N="1166" /> to the debate.  I feel confident that the Sugar Company will continue their task of compiling a programme of action to return the company to profitability. The Government, as the Minister underlined in his speech last week, will not be found wanting when the company have put forward a suitable programme for restoring themselves to full viability.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of interpretation, this section says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;employer&rdquo;, in relation to an employee, does not include an employer who employs that employee&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i> on a permanent basis for less than 18 hours in each week, or</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i> under a contract of employment, or otherwise, for a fixed term of either less than 26 weeks or of which there are less than 26 weeks still to run;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interpretation of employer in regard to the employee having to be there on a permanent basis for more than 18 hours each week and for more than 26 weeks can bring into this Bill the first discriminatory and unfair aspect.  The privileges which a Bill such as this can convey should extend to our less fortunate people who have to go out and seek work, such as mothers who have to go out to earn some extra money.  In such cases they are much more likely to seek employment for a limited number of hours per week.  The figure of 18 hours and also of 26 weeks can be discriminatory against those people.  The question of the 18 hours comes very close to the number of qualifying hours in certain categories. <Col N="1167" />  Teachers could be one example where the qualifying number of hours worked per week is about 22.  We are coming very close to a line between 18 hours and 22 hours where all the benefits of this Bill do not extend for the sake of a four week period of work.  I am open to correction on the 22 hours for teachers but, if I am correct, for the sake of four hours we are depriving many women of the privileges of such a Bill as this.  I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on the two matters I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Markey.  For the real advancement of women to make it possible for them to join in the economic life of the country, the trend should be towards the provision of far more part-time work.  Anything in any enactment which makes people disadvantaged who work less than a certain number of hours in the week is a great pity. I am aware that the figure of 18 hours a week applies right across the board for social welfare benefits and various like areas but it is about time we examined that question and discussed why we have arrived at the magic figure of 18 hours a week.  As well as making this minimal provision in this Bill for the maternity protection of employees we should be removing all the other real barriers.  As the Minister said in his opening speech here, this is one more barrier being removed to the employment of women. We should set ourselves to really removing barriers and one of these is having to work full-time.  While I support Senator Markey, I would like to know the reason for that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support both Senator Markey and Senator Hussey in relation to the 18 hour limit.  I know of course that the 18 hours is a figure which is used in the social welfare benefits across the board, as Senator Hussey said.  However, in this particular circumstance it is particularly important that the people most likely to work part-time are, in fact, mothers of young families, the very people to whom this kind of protection <Col N="1168" /> should apply and therefore it is important in this area not to discriminate against people who have part-time employments.  It is indeed the very mothers of the young families who will be working in part-time jobs and are therefore going to need protection by way of maternity leave and being able to return to their jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous speakers on this matter.  One of the reasons why they cannot satisfy this 18 hours a week condition is because very few employers pay any attention at all to organising shifts within the school hours. If that was organised I feel that this discrimination would not need to be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Senators on the question of hours is linked to the social welfare provisions, because of the connection between this Bill and the new social welfare maternity allowance.  The new maternity allowance will be payable only to employees who are on maternity leave under this Bill.  It has been necessary to define employee and employer in the way they are defined under the social welfare code.  If the Department of Social Welfare were to change their definitions at any future stage to bring within the scope of the social welfare code any of those employments which are currently exempted ones, then section 3 (2) of this Bill contains provisions empowering the Minister for Labour to extend the scope of this Bill accordingly and he can do it at any time that the Department of Social Welfare change their code.</P>
      <P>Because of the link between the two Bills we were bound to take into account the code of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I could not quite understand what Senator Markey meant in relation to the question of the teachers who work 22 hours.  If they are working 22 hours then, of course&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just drew the contrast that for a period of only four hours you have one case where a woman who works <Col N="1169" /> 22 hours gets all the rights under this Bill and a woman who works fewer than 18 hours does not have any rights.  For such a small difference, four hours, it is unfortunate in a Bill which can do so much to help women, that it does deprive women&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately we are tied to the social welfare code in relation to this.  The Bill contains provisions for change if the Department of Social Welfare change at any stage.  The 18 hours is not sacrosanct.  In time it may come down and if it does, there is provision in the Bill to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the 18 hours is not sacrosanct it seems a pity that we have put it in at all.  I understand the reason why it was put in.  The 18 hours provision if we talk about part-time work, a five day week and about people working for three hours five mornings a week, excludes with one fell swoop a great many women who need and want part-time work.  They are not going to have protection unless a change is made in this Bill. I worry about this because times are economically very difficult and women's employment does not receive the kind of consideration it gets in the good times. To put something into law now with a figure of 18 hours in it may well get stuck there because of the hard times.  I would have preferred not to have it there at all although I understand the reasons for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 (5) provides for the Minister to consult organisations representing employers, trade unions and bodies analogous to trade unions as he considers appropriate.  Would the Minister not consider consultations with bodies such as the Council for the Status of Women because it was largely such a <Col N="1170" /> body that brought about this Bill?  There are many cases where the employees concerned would not be members of trade unions and the Council for the Status of Women and other bodies could represent such cases and they would certainly submit arguments on behalf of those women who are not members of trade unions. The wording &ldquo;bodies analogous to trade unions&rdquo; does not cover them in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any function for the Employment Equality Agency in that list of bodies to be consulted?  As Senator Markey points out, there are a great many women who are not members of trade unions and there are a great many women who are not members of the Council for the Status of Women and are not represented by them.  The Employment Equality Agency, despite their short staffing and the fact that they do not have enough proper premises and enough money, seem to be the correct body to monitor this kind of legislation.  Do they have a function in monitoring this legislation as they do in monitoring other legislation that we had protecting employees in the 1973-77 period?</P>

      <P>In relation to Senator Markey's question about the Council for the Status of Women, that is covered in line 31 in the phrase &ldquo;bodies analogous to trade unions&rdquo;.  The Employment Equality Agency have not been consulted and they do not see their brief extending to this.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;the expected week of confinement&rdquo; and &ldquo;confinement&rdquo; have the meanings respectively assigned to them by sections <Col N="1171" /> 24 and 28 of the <i>Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981;</i></P>
    <P>The people who wrote that little paragraph have set out to make it all very difficult for ordinary people like myself to understand.  Why do those phrases have to refer to another Act?  Could we not have set out clearly in this Bill what they actually mean, since this Bill has all to do with maternity and maternity leave?  It is trying to obscure things by not putting clearly what those terms mean, and by referring us to other Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Senator, I, too, sometimes wonder why.  The draftsman suggested this and because of the link between the social welfare code and between this Bill and the Department of Social Welfare's new maternity Act, it is essential that the definition be the same.</P>

      <P>While appreciating the point that Senator Hussey makes, generally speaking, the ordinary woman in the street finds these kinds of Acts difficult enough to read, even if the definition is set out.  In the case of some previous Acts that apply to employment, the Minister's Department have produced some much clearer and plainer leaflets that are available to ordinary members of the public.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if this will or can be done in the case of this Bill.  That might very well be of more help to the ordinary woman worker than having her try to plough her way through the Act regardless of whether the definitions are in it or not.</P>

      <P>Section 8 is where we state the length of time of the maternity leave we are giving women now and this is one of the major parts of this Bill.  I am not happy with 14 weeks.  It does not really compare favourably with modern thinking in this area.  If we take it later on with the provision for additional maternity leave, it adds up to a package of something very ungenerous.  We have for a very long time in this country paid a great deal of lip service to the sanctity of the home and the role of the wife and mother and how the common good could not be achieved without them and so on. Yet when it comes to actually getting down to brass tacks and saying that we will acknowledge the extreme importance of motherhood the inferior position of the work day and the rigidity of the work schedule in general to maternity and the important role of nursing children it is a pity that we are so ungenerous. There are much more generous periods of maternity leave in other countries which, when added to the additional leave they can take, leave us only in the halfpenny place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In West Germany, for example, where <Col N="1173" /> they have had really to face up to the importance of motherhood and maternity because they have a falling population, they are giving 14 weeks plus four months maternity leave.  In the public service in Denmark they are giving three months extra maternity leave plus five months at half pay.  In France, they are giving 16 weeks and an extension up to 10 months; in Italy five months and in Luxembourg 16 weeks.  For a country whose Constitution specifically values its mothers we are being less than generous in this provibion of 14 weeks.  I understand that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were originally looking for much more than this and that we have arrived at this 14 weeks by, presumably, a period of bargaining.  In this bargaining women have lost out which points to the problems that women have when it comes to being consulted and when it comes to being real social partners.  Of course, they are not social partners at all, because they are not consulted sufficiently on a wide enough basis about what goes on in this respect.  The 14 weeks is really far too short.</P>

      <P>I agree that the maternity allowance is not as good here as it is in the rest of the EEC countries.  The ICTU deputation and not the Minister were anxious to see the position being as good as legislation on the Continent but in the absence of being able to get agreement on that they were pleased to have the concept accepted as we are the last country in the EEC to give effect to it.  In that sense, Senator Hussey is correct about the periods of time and so on, but on the other hand there is a welcome there from the trade unions and since it is part of the national understanding we are anxious that this would go through as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister's sources are extremely reliable but I am giving examples of parental leave from a working document presented to the European Parliament on 29 January 1981 which sets out a list of what is available in all the countries in Europe.  It says that in West Germany, maternity leave amounts to 14 weeks at full pay, that since July 1979 it has been possible to obtain additional maternity leave of four months and that in that case the maximum pay is 750 deutschemark per month.  That is slightly better than our provision of four weeks additional maternity leave.  If that document is wrong, I should be very interested to hear it, because there are many things in it that I would be worried about if they were all wrong.</P>

      <P>This is an appropriate time to comment on something that I should have perhaps commented on at the commencement of Committee Stage.  Senator Robinson forced the issue about Committee Stage being held over until this week.  Her request was very well-intentioned and she intended to put down amendments.  Unfortunately due to her own situation something very urgent cropped up.  She could not pursue her amendments one of which would have been in respect of section 9 in relation to the principle of notification.  In the case of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act the employer is obliged to supply or to publish or display an abstract of the Act.  I quote from section 19 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977:</P>
      <P> (1)  Every employer shall display at the principal entrances to the premises where any of his employees work, and in such other places as an inspector may require, in such a position that it may be easily read by employees so employed, the prescribed abstract of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  An employer who fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine that Senator Robinson would have wanted that in accordance with the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 if an employer wants to change or alter shifts or alter the working conditions of people, he should have to display an abstract of what has been agreed to by the Minister and himself or under his licence.  With the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act the abstract has to be displayed.  Here we have a situation where the employee is obliged to give notification of her intention to take maternity leave but there is no obligation <Col N="1176" /> on the employer to display the abstract whereby the employees can be notified of their rights under the Act. Under the Conditions of Employment, Act 1936, where people apply for licences and so on it is a very useful thing for employees to know if something that might affect their working lives is happening.  Generally speaking, we were talking about a pamphlet being issued earlier on, running alongside the pamphlet.  The same principle applies in section 12.  The employee must give the notification yet the employer under no circumstances in this Bill is obliged to display the conditions in an abstract of the Act under which they are obliged to function in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Harte in seeking the display of a notice of this kind as is done under quite a number of other Acts affecting employment so that the employee is made aware of the fact that this notification has to take place particularly as there does not seem to be any discretion as to dispensing with this notification.  I would like the Minister to let us know whether even the employer can dispense with the necessity if he feels that his employee was ill-informed or has just forgotten it by a day or two.  As Senator Markey said, there is nothing to tell us what happens.  If the notification is not brought in does it mean that automatically the woman is not entitled to any of the maternity leave, or is it cut down, or what happens?  Where there seems to be no discretion in whether she is notifying in four weeks time or not we should at least make sure that she is made as aware as possible of her duties under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point raised by Senator Hussey, an employee who found herself claiming under this Act shortly after 6 April could qualify for a reduced benefit.  The purpose of section 9 is to make the employee's entitlement conditional on her having given her employer prior written notification of her intention to take maternity leave and having supplied the employer at the same time with particulars concerning the <Col N="1177" /> pregnancy, that is a certificate confirming that she is pregnant and indicating the week in which it is expected that the baby will be born.  This was a provision the importance of which was stressed by the FUE during the discussions.  It was felt by them that the employer should be kept fully informed by the employee at all appropriate stages of the exercises of her statutory entitlement so as to enable the employer to plan ahead in connection with absences from work arising out of pregnancy.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators that there is a need for employees to be informed adequately about the various entitlements. Having been in a number of factories and having looked for notices and seen them all over the place, even in areas where they could not be read properly, I feel it would be much more appropriate if we ensured that the women are advised of their rights under this Bill by making available suitable explanatory material at clinics all around the country, to doctors, community centres and at the various offices of the National Social Services Council.  I assure the Seanad that in addition the FUE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will be giving publicity to the Bill.  This was mentioned in the debate in the Dáil.  The ITGWU journal, <i>Liberty</i> has an article about the Bill in its current issue.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the posting of an abstract is not quite the same where this Bill is concerned.  Workers in factories are interested in the provisions of the Factories Act, to see whether it is being complied with by their employers: otherwise the workers' health and safety could be put in danger.  In the case of this Bill, and I accept the importance of what Senators have said, it is a question of imparting information to employees about their right to maternity leave.  I honestly feel that the channels that we propose to use for this purpose will be the most appropriate ones.</P>

      <P>I do not understand this. I am talking about when this Bill becomes law and, say, a woman is going to have a baby about a fortnight after the Bill becomes law.  She will not have had time to notify her employer of her intention to take maternity leave or give a doctor's certificate four weeks before.  She is required to take maternity leave for four full weeks before the expected date of confinement.  When this Bill comes into force, say on 6 April, what will be the position of women who are going to have babies well before 6 May?  I am not a bit clear about that.  That is my problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Employers must have four weeks notice in order to engage a substitute to replace the employee who is taking the maternity leave.  If the employee, due to the date of her confinement, is unable to give four weeks notice before her baby is born, then she may start her post-birth leave four weeks after she eventually gives notice to the employer, that is, by going on annual or sick leave.  This is about the only time this will come into effect, just when the Act <Col N="1179" /> is coming into force.  She can qualify for a part payment or she can start her post-birth leave four weeks after she has eventually given notice to the employer.</P>

      <P>This is precisely why I was suggesting the possibility of some sort of discretionary clause as one would have in normal legal agreements, that this notice shall apply except by agreement between the parties.  Though I very much appreciate the point that the Minister said was being made by the FUE, if you are running a large factory full of female employees, you would obviously need notice, so that you know what is happening.  Quite a number of women, and particularly married women, are in employments where there are very few people employed and very often the man or woman who is employing knows that they are pregnant.  If they <Col N="1180" /> just slipped up by a day or two in the notice, their employer would be quite agreeable to say, &ldquo;We will take it that you have applied four weeks in advance&rdquo;. I suggest there should be some element of discretion in this, not necessarily that the employer would be forced to accept this but that if the employer was agreeable, if he knew the situation that obtained, that she should not be cut off from her entire entitlement just because of a slip up like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept everything the Senator has said, but there has to be some provision whereby some onus must be also put on the employee.  I will go back to Senator Hussey.  The explanation is quite long.  If an employee's baby is born on 6 April 1981 &mdash; this is the worst example you can take &mdash; she would be able to comply with section 9 (1) (b) which is most important, given that her expected week of confinement could be medically certified as commencing on 6 April 1981. She would comply with section 9 (1) (a) by ensuring that the written notification was sent, not necessarily by herself, to the employer on 6 April 1981.  Her maternity leave in accordance with the Act would commence four weeks after receipt of the written notification by the employer, that is on 4 May 1981.  This would also be the commencement date for her in so far as the new maternity allowance is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the four weeks prior to 4 May 1981, the employee could take sick leave or annual leave to which she was entitled, since the birth of her baby on 6 April would obviously preclude her from coming into work before then.  Since her baby was born on 6 April, she would not be able to take four weeks leave before the birth as provided for under section 10, and so she would lose that period of her maternity leave.  She would then be left with the maximum possible period of post-birth leave which is ten weeks.  However, she would have taken four weeks annual or sick leave after the birth and these would have been subtracted from the ten weeks.  This would mean that the employee would be entitled to take six weeks maternity leave under the Act during <Col N="1181" /> which she would also qualify for a new maternity allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that explanation.  I gather, therefore, that it is just hard luck if the baby comes at the wrong time.  With this Act coming into operation some are going to be less well off than people who have the good fortune to have their babies more than four weeks after it comes into operation.</P>

      <P>The section states that the minimum period of maternity leave shall commence not later than four weeks before the end of the second week of confinement, and that there is no choice. That seems to be very arbitrary.  I know numerous people, indeed myself included, who were perfectly fit and able and wished to work up to the day of confinement.  There are many occupations where women who are doing valuable jobs, who enjoy their work and are well able to do it, would want to work for longer than up to four weeks before the date of confinement.  Is there any way, for example, that a doctor could certify that this woman was perfectly well able to do the kind of work she was doing if she wished to do it for longer than that?  It is very arbitrary to have a cut-off point of that kind.  There are many jobs where perhaps there might be an important project to finish, where the woman might <Col N="1182" /> want to train in the person who would replace her while she was out and where she was particularly fit and able to work, and where in fact it would not do her a bit of good to be sitting at home worrying about the confinement.  Many women would prefer to be active.  Can any way be found around that very arbitrary arrangement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Though there probably are exceptions, as the Senator has said it is generally accepted &mdash; and I emphasise &ldquo;generally accepted&rdquo;&mdash; that in the interests of protecting the health of the unborn baby and of the mother at least four weeks of maternity leave should be taken both before and after the birth.  The other six weeks of the leave can be apportioned before or after, as the employee wishes. There are, however, certain exceptions. It is recognised that circumstances may prevent an employee from complying with the normal apportionment of maternity leave.  The provision in the section need not apply to a situation where for medical reasons it is certified that an employee's maternity leave should begin on a specific date.  That is covered by section 11.  Late births are covered by section 12 and premature births are covered by section 13.  Generally speaking it is a fair assessment.  As Senator Hussey said, there will be people who could go right up to the date of confinement, but a Bill has to take account of the normal position and generally speaking it is accepted that at least four weeks are needed before the birth and four weeks after the birth.  That is how the four weeks period was set and arrived at.</P>

      <P>If a woman who wanted to go on with her work later than four weeks before the expected birth went to <Col N="1183" /> her doctor and got a letter from him saying, &ldquo;It would be bad for you to stop working, it would upset you; you are doing a good job and you should stay at work,&rdquo; would she be able to go on working up to, say, one week before confinement?  I feel strongly about this.  The Minister has said that generally speaking we are protecting the health of babies and the health of women.  Of course that is what we are doing.  That is what this Bill is about and that is why we are all so glad that this Bill has been introduced, late and all as it is, and why we are giving it the care it is being given here.  That is also the reason why it is absolutely essential to go through this Bill little by little and not rush it through so that there will not be any misunderstanding about what people's rights are.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said, that generally speaking women will be feeling tired and for their sake and the sake of the babies they will need more rest.  For some women in some employment, and poorer women in the kind of employment that many women do in this country, it would be more restful for them to be out at work than to be at home with a lot of other children where they would not get any rest.  I should like to repeat the point I made on section 10, which is that I see a situation where people doing sedentary work, people working in various professions, people working in offices and so on, where they are quite well and fit and able to go on working and where the view of their doctors would be that they should go on working until they themselves feel they should take a few days off before the birth.  Does section 11 mean, therefore, that a doctor can sign a certificate saying she can work much longer than the four weeks before the confinement?</P>

      <P>This section introduces an element of flexibility into the stipulation by recognising that medical reasons, that is the state of her health, could prevent an employee from complying with the terms of the section.  The flexibility should enable the employee to be guided by the advice of the medical staff caring for her during pregnancy as to when it <Col N="1184" /> would be advisable for her on medical grounds to stop work.  Subsection (1) permits an employee to begin her maternity leave on whatever date is specified in a certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner or other appropriate source. The certificate must indicate to the satisfaction of the Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare that on account of the medical reasons mentioned in that certificate the employee concerned should go on maternity leave on a specific date.  The Minister for Labour is empowered to make regulations concerning the period within which a certificate is to be produced for the employer's inspection.</P>

      <P>The more I look into this the more I am convinced that this statutory provision about four weeks notice before the period of confinement is wrong.  The period of maternity leave should have been given and should have been allowed to be taken at the discretion of the person, even one continuous period if necessary.  The period of four weeks prior notice is purely a bureaucratic measure, perhaps complying with other regulations in the social welfare code.  Section 11 is the first breach of this bureaucratic thing as far as I can see.  It provides for what I think will happen in very many instances where women will work up to as late a date as possible on the submission of a medical certificate and then continue by perhaps taking extra weeks additional maternity leave subsequent to the confinement.</P>

      <P>As the Senator has said, this section provides for the presentation by the employee of a certificate.  If a woman worked up to the date of birth she would have ten weeks afterwards; if a woman worked up to a week before the birth she could have 11 weeks.  While the Bill takes into account everything Senator Hussey has said, particularly in relation to her own experience and the experience of many of her friends, the situation is that this Bill has to cope with various situations.  I honestly feel that the four weeks is a reasonable time before a birth and afterwards.  At least she should <Col N="1185" /> have that period before and afterwards, and the rest would be at the discretion of the employee.</P>

      <P>Have we seen a chink of light?  I understand that a doctor may decide that the woman can work up to near the birth of her child, but that she will not then get the full 14 weeks.  If my understanding on that is at fault I would be happy to have it clarified.  If a doctor decides that a woman would be better off working nearer the birth of her child for a variety of reasons which we have gone into, then she starts her maternity leave two weeks before the birth of the child and she is entitled to 14 weeks maternity leave.  Therefore she can have 12 weeks after the birth of the child, I presume.</P>
      <P>I would also like to know if a doctor's certificate must be accepted by the Ministers or will the Ministers sit down and look at a doctor's certificate and decide whether the doctor is right or wrong in saying, for example, that this woman's psychological welfare would be much better served by working nearer to the time of her confinement and that if she had to leave, for example, some special project she was doing it would upset her greatly and might upset her coming up to the birth?  There are two questions there: one, I want to know if she works nearer to the date of birth does she have the full 14 weeks if the doctor signs a certificate saying that she should take leave nearer to the birth and, two, do the Ministers have to accept that certificate or can they decide they do not want to accept it?</P>

      <P>I am saying section 11 entitles her to do that if a medical practitioner issues a certificate stating on medical grounds that she should stop work on a specific date, for some of the reasons that Senator Hussey mentioned. The Minister can accept that certificate and the Minister for Labour is empowered to make regulations concerning the period within which a certificate is to be produced for the employer's inspection. If a doctor issues a certificate that on medical grounds he recommends that the employee should stop work on a certain date then the employee is entitled to 14 weeks from that date.</P>

      <P>On reading the Bill I saw section 11 as allowing a sort of discretion about this four weeks before and after.  It read to me as though it was generally meant to apply to somebody who perhaps wanted to take more leave before the birth rather than less leave before the birth.  My personal experience is the same as Senator Hussey's, and I would have thought that in a relatively healthy pregnancy it is quite easy to work up to near the birth.  The time you really need the holiday is when the baby is very small, after the birth, and the longer holiday you can get, particularly if you have other children, the more desirable it is. I was very glad to hear the Minister say that a doctor could give a certificate to this effect and perhaps the Minister's regulation can make it clear that as well as allowing more before the birth it can allow less before the birth as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which deals with the additional maternity leave for a maximum period of four consecutive weeks commencing immediately after the end of the maternity leave. Given the fact that in this country we have no crêche facilities to speak of, four additional weeks is too short a time, and also considering that in this Bill there is no reference at all to parental leave in the wider sense, including fathers, and that there is no reference either to the provision of crêches in the work place.</P>
      <P>One reason alone would make it far too short, that is, that the medical opinion is that the best way to look after a baby is, if possible, that a mother should breast feed her own child and should do so for as long as is comfortable and going well and no problems.  That can be for quite a long period.  If we are to talk about cutting off additional maternity leave we may be talking about forcing mothers to change the system of feeding the child because they have to go back to work and because, you can be quite sure, as we heard in regard to RTE recently, there are no facilities for breast feeding unless you go to the ladies' loo, which very often may not be at all a suitable place for looking after a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it was a pity that the four weeks' period was agreed to in order to have this Bill in operation by 6 April.  It is far too short.  I would like to see it extended to a period of at least two months and, of course, it goes without saying that I would hope very much that we will have additional legislation bringing fathers into this whole question of parental involvement with small children.  I do not mind whether we are on a par with, behind or in front of Europe, but if we are talking about Irish solutions for Irish problems, and we seem to be very keen on that, for Irish mothers who have decided to take the benefit of maternity leave, to give them only four weeks is very ungenerous and mean.  I particularly <Col N="1188" /> think that in the whole area of breast feeding their children it puts a lot of pressure on the mothers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <P>I agree that family responsibilities are onerous and perhaps the most onerous thing of the lot is child care. Some other day we might be talking about proper child care facilities to supplement the Bill, but at this time what concerns me most of all is that the extra four weeks is unpaid leave.  That is the real problem.  I will admit the period is short if something goes wrong.  The very onerous responsibility of the woman in regard to child care cannot be eased in this short period.  I would like to see the Bill go through as quickly as possible, but I hope we can do something in the future to have an extended period of maternity leave that would be paid for.</P>

      <P>Senator Hussey said that she does not mind where we are in relation to the other EEC countries, but it is no harm to say where we are.  There is no extra leave in Denmark or Belgium and there is none in Greece as far as we can ascertain.  In the United Kingdom four weeks leave is given on medical grounds or at the employer's request.  In Luxembourg, four weeks is granted in the case of multiple or premature births.</P>
      <P>It is not a bad start to the Bill.  The Minister has the power under subsection (6) to amend subsection (1) to extend the period of the four consecutive weeks referred to.  That can be done by an affirmative order which can be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and be discussed.  Of course, we can all argue for a lot of extra facilities, conditions and payments but, as the Senator has said, the important thing is that the Bill will at least become law and a start will be made. Many of the Bill's provisions can be extended by affirmative orders.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to bring up the question of breast feeding.  Does the Bill allow any time off for an employee who is breast feeding her child?  If she is going to get time off for post-natal care a very important part of post-natal activity for any mother is breast feeding the child.  What happens if she cannot do it at the factory bench, sitting at a typewriter, running a company, or sitting in the boardroom with her fellow directors, or whatever she happens to be doing?  I would like to bring that question up again.  Does antenatal or post-natal care of the baby come into this Bill at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> Who is to feed the child if the mother is not getting any time off to breast feed the child?  It is an interesting thing when one thinks of the kind of occupations in which women are in large numbers, such as in primary teaching, where they do such a marvellous job, and where it is child-centred and where the hours fit in extremely well with family responsibilities.  I am sure a lot of sympathy will be given to the question of breast feeding. Am I right in assuming that this Bill does not care about the post-natal care of a child who is being breast fed?</P>

In relation to the regulations, discussions will take place with the FUE and the trade unions on the amount of time off that should be given and the number of visits before and after the birth.  Senator Hussey is coming up again, as Senator Harte said earlier, with the whole question of child care which will have to be considered at another time and in another Bill. This Bill deals with maternity and maternity leave.  All this section does is allow the mother to have time off for post and ante-natal care.</P>

I do not see what sense it makes to bring in a Bill which completely ignores that matter.  I do not think the FUE are the best people to answer that either.

She shall be entitled to return to work either in her normal or usual job or in that job as soon as it is practicable. Does that mean if she has taken additional maternity leave and has given due notice in writing of the additional maternity leave without pay which she is taking, that she may be left hanging on without pay while people figure out how soon is &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; for her to come back?  I am a little worried about that phrase &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; because she may be without pay.  Who is going to decide what is practicable?  It is very important that we are quite clear about who is the decision-making body in this area and also that we remind ourselves that because we are giving that little bit of extra leave without pay she may be hanging on without pay until an opening is found for her.</P>

      <P>In this section &ldquo;job&rdquo;, in relation to an employee, means the nature of the work which she is employed to do in accordance with her contract of employment and the capacity and place in which she is so employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite a number of positions in this country, for example, the position in banking, where a girl is employed under a contract and the nature of her work is clerical work but the contract can cover a multitude of places in this country.  It can also cover, perhaps, a number of different capacities within the banking world.  I would like to think that she is entitled to return to the place in which she left off doing the work, for that is adequately covered in this because subsection (3) means the nature of the work which she is empowered to do in accordance <Col N="1193" /> with her contract of employment.  A girl working in the banking world could be doing the same kind of work in a bank in Cahirciveen as she had been doing in Dublin prior to her confinement.  I would like the Minister to clarify that what is intended in this Bill is that she will return to the same place, to the same job and in the same capacity as when she left.</P>

There is no way, to take his own example, that a lady bank clerk can find herself going from Dublin to Cahirciveen.

      <P>I have not.  The only thing that is introduced here is a small element of flexibility.  That is introduced into the interpretation of the word &ldquo;job&rdquo;. By referring to the nature of the work which the employee was employed to do in accordance with the contract of employment and the capacity and place in which she was so employed, the reference means that the employer is not obliged to give the employee precisely the same job on her return to work.  To provide otherwise, that is if the job was to be rigidly defined, could cause practical difficulties for the employer and could moreover, adversely affect the employees' chances of reinstatement under the section.  While the definition of &ldquo;job&rdquo; is a flexible one, it is considered sufficient to protect the employee's interests.  For example, she cannot be given work of a different nature from that which she did before she went on leave.  She cannot be employed, for instance, as a junior typist if before her absence on leave she was a personal assistant to a managing director.  In regard to the case that Senator Markey gave, she cannot be employed in a Cork branch or in a country branch of a firm if before her absence she was employed in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey was talking specifically about subsection (2).  The aim of this subsection is to ensure that it is to her normal work that the employee returns. If she was doing work different from it before she went on maternity leave and, where appropriate, on additional maternity leave as well, in cases where return to her normal work would be precluded by existing protective legislation the employee must be allowed to resume that work as soon as the legislation in question permits.</P>

      <P>When the employee reports for work she has to be paid.  If the employer has not the particular job he just has to fit her in somewhere.  However, there are some examples.  For instance, the Factories Act prohibits a female employee who is employed in any process which is wholly or principally comprised in the manual transport, including the lifting and putting down of loads, from being employed at that work during pregnancy and during ten weeks following confinement where in the opinion of a registered medical practitioner such employment would be likely to impair the employee's health.  There are certain exemptions when the employee would now be precluded by law.  Until such time as the time spans under the various Acts have passed the employer could not put the employee back into the same job.  It is only in that case that the Senator's question may arise.  However, once the employee reports back for work she has to be paid.</P>

It is &ldquo;the capacity in which the employee concerned is to be employed and any other terms or conditions of employment are not substantially less favourable to her than those of her contract of employment immediately before the start of her period of absence ...&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Substantially&rdquo;, in that context, is rather an ominous word I feel.  That would convey that they can be quite considerably worse before they can get substantially worse.  It is a word that could be interpreted to the grave disadvantage of workers.

Phrases like &ldquo;suitable alternative employment&rdquo;, &ldquo;not substantially less favourable&rdquo; and so on allow for a good deal of laxity of interpretation. One certainly does not want to have to go to the courts to get them interpreted on behalf of an employee.  I would like to know just who decides that the employment is suitable or not suitable.</P>

      <P>I would like to go back to the point I made about a different location that the woman returns to.  Can <Col N="1197" /> I again put it to the Minister that if she returns to her banking place in Finglas and is told there is no longer a position there for her for a number of reasons &mdash; there could have been redundancies in the meantime &mdash; but is offered a place in a bank in Tallaght.  would that be grounds for her to plead that she is being given terms and conditions substantially less favourable than she had hitherto?  Take the case of a girl who returns to her place of employment in which she had an office on the first floor.  a nice comfortable office, in which she did her work and she is told the office is no longer available. Somebody else who had been recruited in the meantime has been installed in that office and she has instead been given a top floor or a basement office which she finds is not suitable perhaps for her own psychological reasons.  atmosphere or whatever it might be, would that be grounds for her to put the case to the commissioner that she was being treated in a manner that was substantially less favourable to her?</P>

      <P>Section 20 generally deals with an employee's return to work. It is only where the employer decides that he cannot reinstate the employee that section 21 comes in.  Senator McGuinness mentioned the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Rights Commissioner.  Certainly the employee has the right to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal or a Rights Commissioner if she feels that her employer is being unreasonable.  The same thing would apply to Senator Markey's question.  I could not honestly say at this stage &mdash; these will all be matters for the employee as to whether she felt that she was being treated unjustly in the context of where she was being asked to go to, what she was being asked to do.  She certainly has the right to go to the Rights Commissioner or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>

      <P>This section continues the trend I mentioned earlier.  A mother at this stage has far more important things to worry about than being very precise about submitting notification of her return to work no later than four weeks before.  That notification has to be subsequently confirmed in writing under subsection (2).  This is being a bit too niggardly and detailed in the circumstances and I believe that there is not a great need for such strict provisions.  Any woman who is going to return to work will naturally give notice as soon as possible.  She should be given that discretion rather than given a specific period within which she must give notice.</P>

The employer also has rights and has to have these rights safeguarded: this is one of the things that the FUE were very firm about in the negotiations.  An employer must get reasonable notice of absence so that he can make alternative provision.  He must know when the employee is returning to work. There is somebody else there for the time and that person will have to be let go and it is only fair that that person also should get reasonable notice.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that we had this clarification discussion this afternoon, which was extremely important. When it was suggested to the Minister last week that we should not pass all Stages it caused a great deal of upset, apparently.  The discussion has been very valuable and has clarified many questions, perhaps not all in a most favourable manner.  At least we know where we stand on some issues where perhaps we did not know before.</P>
      <P>I hope this legislation, which is a fundamental, significant part of any country's modern legislation concerning equality between the sexes, will be kept under constant review as to how it is working, whether it is doing the best job possible for mothers for babies and for families.  If a country is about anything it is about its families.  This Bill is not a women's rights Bill, as it has been described on other occasions.  This Bill is a human rights Bill and a family rights Bill.  It is in that spirit that I have approached this.  Bill from the beginning in the context of making it possible for families to be protected in this age when there is so much emphasis on materialism.</P>
      <P>I hope that the constant review of the legislation will concentrate on lengthening the period of paid maternity leave and lengthening considerably the period of additional leave.  I am too much of an economic realist to believe that this country will be able to afford long periods of paid parental leave.  Certainly, mothers should have the option of a much longer period of unpaid leave very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I discussed a problem which the Bill has totally ignored, that is, the problem where a mother, who is successfully and happily breast feeding her child who is thriving, is forced to attend at work because of the limited additional maternity leave allowed to her.  That is a question which must be examined quickly and people should be discussing that whole problem with doctors.  I should like to see also the <Col N="1200" /> involvement of fathers in leave from employment concerning their children.</P>

    <Title>Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 18th February, 1981, takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Taxes other than Turnover Taxes which Affect the Consumption of Manufactured Tobacco which was laid before the Seanad on 11th March, 1981, and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
      <P>I should like to put before the House the background and conclusions of one of the most recent reports which was considered and adopted by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  This Report on the proposed Council Directive on Taxes other than Turnover Taxes which Affect the Consumption of Manufactured Tobacco is a very important report, in our opinion.  The committee felt that it would be appropriate to recommend that the matter be considered by the Seanad in the light of the seriousness of the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee felt this was important because they are dead against the proposals coming at the moment from the EEC in the form of a Council Directive, <Col N="1201" /> amending Directive 72/464/EEC on this matter.  We wanted to get the support of the Seanad for the line we took.  The line was to go completely against the recommendations of this Directive and the intention of this Directive.  The committee are convinced that the whole approach should be reviewed and that the matter should be followed up in the EEC by all concerned to ensure that this Directive does not go ahead in the form in which it exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>The matter is important because we are dealing here with an important Irish industry &mdash; the tobacco industry.  We considered the representations from the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers' Advisory Committee, ITMAC, and we are convinced that they have a very good case.  We are dealing here with a situation which, as we say in the report, is potentially disastrous for the industry which employs around 2,000 people, in which £45 million is invested and which has a turnover of £210 million per annum.  That sets the scene for the impact we think this report should have on the policy to be adopted in relation to this Directive coming from the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is all the more important when we consider that in 1976 the Taoiseach, then Deputy Charles J.  Haughey, was chairman of the committee which considered this matter and more or less reached the same conclusion.  In their report, the 41st Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EEC, they said they considered it was essential that the Irish industry be given every opportunity of remaining economically viable in conditions of more intensive competition and trusted that this would remain a major consideration in negotiations on the tax structure.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was then chairman of the committee which put forward that view and the committee today feel that matters may have gone down the road a bit too quickly in relation to this subject. We want to do whatever we can as a committee and we are calling on our colleagues in the Seanad to help us to slow down this whole development and have the whole matter reconsidered.  That is the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> I will mention some details and my colleagues on the committee might elaborate on them when they are speaking.  It comes down to a problem about the way excise duty is levied on cigarettes.  Basically that is the problem.  There are two ways of handling this excise duty.  One suits us and the other does not suit us.  In the original Community of six, two different systems operated, one known as the specific component method of tax and the other the <i>ad valorem</i> component method of tax.</P>
    <P>In Germany, excise tax was levied at a fixed amount per cigarette.  In the other five States excise duty was levied as a percentage of the retail price, tax included.  In 1972, following their policy of harmonising taxes the Council of Ministers decided to combine these systems into a harmonised system under which, in each member state, the duty charged would consist partly of a specific component, that is a tax per cigarette, and partly of an <i>ad valorem</i> or proportional component with a view to having an <i>ad valorem</i> component rather than a specific component.  As I develop the point Senators will see we are not very happy from the Irish point of view, that the <i>ad valorem</i> method would be to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Of the three member states who joined the Community in 1973, Denmark had a system like the German one.  It was a specific component, a specific tax per cigarette. Ireland and the UK operated a third system.  They levied excise duty according to the weight of the leaf tobacco.  The idea was that the harmonisation should move in stages, the first stage to run from 1973 to 1978, and the second from 1978 to 1980.  Recently this was extended to 30 June 1981.  That is why the matter is fairly urgent.</P>
    <P>The committee are proposing to implement the first stage to run until 31 December 1986.  The first stage of the harmonisation of the duty began on 1 July 1973. In 1972 it was implemented in all the member states except Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Implementation in those States was postponed until 1978.  In the second stage of harmonisation in accordance with the 1977 Directive the specific excise duty is fixed at not less <Col N="1203" /> than 5 per cent and not more than 55 per cent of the total tax charged &mdash; excise duty plus VAT.</P>
    <P>Some effects of the second stage were looked at recently with the following data coming from the review: of the most popular cigarettes in 1978 the table shows that four member states, the Benelux countries and France, apply specific components close to the authorised minimum of 5 per cent.  Of the range allowed, they went to the lower end.  Italy has so far failed to reach the 5 per cent minimum, while the remaining four States, Germany, Denmark, the UK and Ireland. apply a specific component close to the authorised maximum of 55 per cent.  Senators can see the trend for those States to move towards a specific rather than a proportional tax.</P>
    <P>The Commission said that, judging by the information received from member states, the effects of the measures introduced by them during the second stage have been very limited.  They point out that changes have taken place in the market structure and the competitive structure in the UK and the Irish markets regardless of the effects of taxation.</P>
    <P>The proposed third stage, which would run from January 1981 to December 1986, envisages that the range of the specific component of the excise duty would gradually be further narrowed and would fall within the parameters of 10 per cent to 35 per cent.  We would be dropping from 55 per cent to 35 per cent as far as the <i>ad valorem</i> content is concerned.  In attaining this objective two intermediate stages are involved: from January 1981 to December 1982 the specific component would be within the range of 5 per cent to 55 per cent, and from January 1983 to 1984 a specific component within the range of 7.5 per cent to 42.5 per cent would be reached.  Senators can see this converging or squeezing in effect taking place.  In their explanatory memorandum the Commission concluded that eventually the specific component should be 20 per cent at the final stage.  This was the attempt to harmonise.</P>
    <P>There are also two other amendments which I will not elaborate on.  They are <Col N="1204" /> in the report.  As far as Irish legislation is concerned, if the specific component proposals as outlined were adopted, no changes would be required by Ireland until 1983, since we already operate within the parameters of 5 per cent to 55 per cent.  From 1983 an alteration to the specific element of taxation would call for a recasting of the components.  In relation to the Finance Act, as far as excise duty on special products is concerned, an amendment would be necessary.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Irish tobacco industry is a significant industry.  To move towards the <i>ad valorem</i> method would mean that the price of cigarettes would be determined very much by this proportional content which would in effect tend to exaggerate the relative prices in relation to other cigarettes, competing cigarettes, possibly coming in from abroad. This multiplier effect, as the industry calls it, is the basic problem.  If an Irish cigarette has a certain basic figure placed on it, and then a proportional amount goes on top of that, as the basic figure is changed due to the proportional effect, the actual selling price is exaggerated, making the Irish cigarette more open to competitive attack by other cigarettes, particularly if there was a move towards the area of low cost cigarettes.  There would be a tendency to push the industry towards producing lower cost, low quality cigaretees.  There are all sorts of disadvantages which have been well discussed in the past few years about the quality of tobacco and the medical effects.</P>
    <P>One might ask: is it not reasonable that taxation should be harmonised?  This is the whole basis of the EEC approach.  As a committee we would have to agree with harmonisation but it is not a case of all things being equal, <i>ceteris paribus</i> does not work in this instance because the way the tobacco industry is organised in competing countries, in other European countries, is not the same as it is here or in the UK.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the area of what are known as excise credits, in some countries there is an extended time period for the payment of the tax.  In Belgium it is 91 days and in the Netherlands it is 107 <Col N="1205" /> days.  As far as I remember, it is 30 days in the Irish case.  This means, in effect, that those industries are getting an interest-free loan by virtue of withholding this tax for that period of time, which gives them a competitive advantage again over the Irish industry.  In some countries the tobacco industry is a monopoly.  For instance, in France and Italy the tobacco industry is a Government monopoly for production and retailing.  Those countries have extensive leaf-growing interests as well.  This obviously influences the strategy they will adopt in their industries.  In harmonising taxation we are dealing with one dimension only of the attempts to make competition fairer and to operate under the same system.</P>
    <P>The third area I would like to highlight is this: given that the Irish cigarette market is small compared with the market in other Community countries, and that we have three significant manufacturers with their own production facilities in this country, the Irish industry cannot operate at a level which gives them the economies of scale which would be available through mass production in other countries.  This puts the Irish industry in a disadvantageous position in relation to the other countries.  An <i>ad valorem</i> tax multiplies this disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to point out that we are not alone in being disturbed about this Directive.  In a recent case before the European Court, the Advocate-General emphasised the point that very high <i>ad valorem</i> taxation markedly limits the scope for competition between operators in the market.  That is a fairly prestigious opinion coming into line with our own. Likewise, the Section Economic and Financial Questions of the EEC Economic and Social Committee has disagreed, in an opinion of 3 February 1981, with the Commission's main proposal for tax harmonisation.  The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has raised questions about it.  We are convinced of the validity of the general case put forward by ITMAC.  We are for the rejection of the present proposal and can find no answer to many of the criticisms of the proposal.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the whole approach of <Col N="1206" /> the Commission should be reviewed and that approaches towards the goal of harmonisation, other than in the narrow area covered by the present proposal, should be examined.  An examination by the Commission of other factors, such as the two I have mentioned already &mdash; the case of excise credits which are a subsidy to the continental manufacturers, and the monopoly nature of the structure of the industries in some of the EEC countries &mdash; should be undertaken.  We recommend that this examination should be made and reported on before any further transitional measures are implemented, because any squeezing of this range of 5 per cent to 55 per cent will put our industry under pressure.  In view of the serious implications of this proposal we asked for this matter to be brought up in the House. I commend it to my colleagues for their attention and support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Mulcahy on this motion and, in doing so, to draw attention to the fact that the work done on this matter for the Joint Committee, of which I am chairman, was done by a sub-committee of which Senator Mulcahy was the chairman.  He has put a great deal of work into it.</P>
      <P>All this talk about the ratio between the specific duty and the <i>ad valorem</i> duty which is to be established in the different countries and the common ration which is aimed at in the original Directive sounds very complicated.  It is very easy to get lost in an effort to understand precisely where we are now and where we are going.  We might start with this clarification for the House.  The conclusions of the committee are that.  if this stage of the harmonisation is proceeded with as proposed, it will lead to a decline in and finally the demise of the Irish tobacco industry.  It is at this stage that the particular type of harmonisation proposed has got to be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my duty as chairman of this Joint Committee speaking in this House to urge fierce resistance by the Minister at the Council to this proposal.  I do so very much affected by the fact that there are 1,900 persons employed in that industry <Col N="1207" /> at the moment whose jobs will be put at risk if this step is taken.  There are grounds for resisting this step in the harmonisation stage which are of wider appeal, an appeal which is more than just the interests of the persons employed in the Irish tobacco industry.  I suggest to the House that a step is being taken here which will do damage and which may be a cynical move in breach of the Treaty which of course, under the provisions of the Treaty, can be corrected by judicial findings in due course.  If it is left to that for correction the damage will have been done, in particular to the Irish tobacco industry which is our concern.</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify the factual situation as I understand it.  We are advised that the multiplier of the manufacturers' selling price pre-tax, which would be as high as two in the determinant of the retail selling price as a result of taxation, would be the point at which serious damage is done to that industry.  The committee were given a formula for determining how the multiplier is reached.  The formula for determining how you reach the multiplier is a simple one.  If you take 100 and you divide a 100 by 100 minus the <i>ad valorem</i> rate, the proportional rate, you will get a result which will give you the multiplier.  Within the present range of the parameters of specific taxation, a country is entitled to go as high as 55 per cent specific of the total excise duty and value added tax duty.  Ireland at the moment is at 54.8.  We are informed that the present arrangement will continue from July of this year up to which the second stage, the stage at which we are, continues.  From 1 July of this year, the first part of the next stage begins.  The parameters are 5 per cent to 55 per cent. That is to say, a country can go as low as 5 per cent specific, or as high as 55 per cent specific.  One country, Italy, has not yet brought up its specific duty to 5 per cent, being still short of 5 per cent.  Presumably, that is the reason for having the first part of the next stage running on to December 1982.</P>
    <P>From January 1983 to December 1984 the parameters will change.  The 5 per cent will go up to 7½ per cent, the 55 per <Col N="1208" /> cent will come down to 42½ per cent. From the point of view of planning an industry, investing and getting money and being able to justify the return of the money in competitive conditions, January 1983 is very soon.  From that point, the proportion of specifics will go down and the multiplier will go up to 2 per cent. From July 1985 to the end of 1986 &mdash; the next part of the next stage &mdash; the parameters will be 10 to 35.  At that point the multiplier will be 2.4 and then, in the conditions of the Irish tobacco industry, we are in real trouble.  We are in real trouble for a number of reasons, particularly because of the nature of the demand for cigarettes, the kind of cigarettes which people here want, based on Virginia tobacco &mdash; a high cost raw material.  The increase in the multiplier will increase the effect of taxation on that high cost production.  At the same time, other countries with tobacco industries are operating on low cost production, using different leaf tobacco with the benefit of monopoly conditions, and premiums given to the tobacco buyers in these countries.  The industry here will thus have to face import penetration where the advantage is given to other members of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should remind ourselves of what the Common Market is about.  The Community was given as its task in Article 2 of the Treaty, to establish its common market and progressively approximate the economic policies of member states, to promote, through the Community, a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous, balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between the States belonging to it.  If we proceed with the harmonisation of tax along the route which the Commission have plotted and get to a parameter of 20 per cent &mdash; which is a proposal made to the Commission, and which the Commission in December or November of 1979 thought was too high a proportion of specific duty &mdash; if we get to that stage, the harmonious development, where this country is concerned, of the economic activities here will be <Col N="1209" /> disturbed because of the selective harmonisation of tax laws, without harmonisation of other conditions.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the tobacco industry in France and in Italy is a monopoly in both cases, and a State monopoly at that.  The State can do what they like with their prices in these monopoly conditions, in addition to which, by virtue of the operation of the common agricultural market in tobacco leaves, the buyers of the tobacco leaves which are used in these industries get a premium for buying it.  Against that premium and against monopolist conditions we will be in the absurd position that we will be trotting along with a harmonisation of tax laws intended to make economic conditions equal between the different countries, but there can be no possibility of equality where these monopolist conditions continue in Italy and France without control in the interests of the other partners of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Just to give the House some particulars with regard to the Belgian situation, in a paragraph of the committee's report we drew attention to a group of cases which were, in fact, related to the Belgian position.  In these cases, the Advocate General considered the decision of the Commission with regard to Article 85(1) of the Treaty that agreements between Belgian producers were contrary to the provisions of Article 81.  The Advocate General concluded that the State intervention in Belgium was such that it limited the scope for, and distorted competition so much, that the restrictive industry agreements, notwithstanding the fact that they existed, had not been shown to have sufficient appreciable effect in restriction or distortion of competition so as to constitute a breach of Article 85(1) of the Treaty.  In other words, the State was already so active in the affairs of the Belgian tobacco industry that the agreements, in the view of the Advocate General before the court &mdash; which was not followed by the court incidentally, although the court agreed with the Advocate General on his analysis of the facts &mdash; could not be said to be in breach of Article 85(1) because they would have such little effect on competition, having <Col N="1210" /> regard to the extent to which the State's intervention already had operated in relation to competition.</P>
    <P>In a rather helpful paragraph in regard to the Belgian situation, quite apart from this case, the Economic and Social Committee described the way prices were arrived at in Belgium.  In the Common Market of which Ireland is a member, this is the situation that our tobacco industry is going to be faced with in the name of the Treaty, to get harmonious development, to create a common market so as to make the position between all our countries just the same as if we were all members of a domestic market. This is describing the Belgian tobacco industry, after we have harmonised the tax laws in accordance with what is proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>In Belgium, prices are arrived at as follows: it is illegal to sell cigarettes by retail at a price other than that stated on the tax banderole affixed to each packet. Cigarettes can be sold only at retail prices for which the Government is prepared to make a banderole available.  Any price increase takes place on an industry-wide basis.  If manufacturers wish to increase prices, they must collectively submit to the Government a detailed case for doing so and must obtain Government agreement.  Because of the high multiplier in Belgium, a large part &mdash; typically two-thirds of any price increase &mdash; goes to the Government as additional tax.  The system results in 80 per cent of all cigarettes being sold at the same price and other conclusions are drawn from that.</P>
    <P>In these cases, while the Advocate-General's view in the cases was not accepted by the court, the court, in its judgment, accepted his opinion as a result of the multiplier effect &mdash; which is what is proposed to be increased for all of us.  That, combined with the minimal excise enforced by the Belgian state to ensure its fiscal income, results in all competitive action by the manufacturer / importer which has an effect on the retail price being limited.</P>
    <P>We are talking about improved competition between all industries in the Common Market of the ten countries. Apart from particular action which it is <Col N="1211" /> the object of this debate to obtain &mdash; that is to say, resistance by the Council of Ministers &mdash; the Commission need to go back to their original directive.  It is in the name of this that we are proposing this tax harmonisation, whereas the object of the Treaty is to establish an economic union within which there is healthy competition of the kind one gets when one lets two roaring monopolies loose on the rest of the Community and one featherbedded Belgian industry whose cartel agreements in the view of the Advocate-General might be held to have minimal effect because of the other effect of action by the Belgian Government.</P>
    <P>The directive encourages an economic union within which there is healthy competition and whose characteristics are similar to those of the domestic market and as regards manufactured tobacco &mdash; and this is the bit which does not follow &mdash; achievement of this aim presupposes that the application in the member states of taxes affecting the consumption of products in this sector does not distort conditions of competition, does not impede their free movement within the European Economic Community.  That is only one of the presuppositions.  The Irish industry, and I speak, for the moment, only for Irish industry, is most unfairly damaged.</P>
    <P>The Commission should be told by the Council of Minister to look in particular, at Article 4(3) of their first directive in this field.  It is provided as the final stage of harmonisation of structures, that the same ratio should be established for cigarettes in all member states between the proportional excise duty and the specific excise duty.  That should be revised.  This ratio should be established in such a way that the range of retail selling prices reflects fairly the difference in the manufacturers' delivery prices.  There is no assistance provided by the Commission as to how this proposed harmonisation moving in this direction of establishing the same ratio in all the member states can be justifiably regarded as achieving a range of retail selling prices reflecting fairly difference in the manufacturers' delivery prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> When we talk about a Common Market, we can speak about consumer choice and consumer taste.  It is, perhaps, significant that 85 per cent of the export trade of the Community is being made by countries where the specific rate of duty is low and where there is not this multiplier effect on increased costs.  Finally, there is an example of an increased cost which should not have, as a consequence, an increase of a proportionate rate of duty reflected unduly in the selling price. There are three tobacco manufacturing companies in this country devoting money to eliminating anything from their raw material which may be found to be deleterious to the health of the consumer. Expenditure of that kind will go into the cost of the manufacturer's delivery pre-tax selling price and will be reflected unduly in his final market price and therefore it is a disincentive to such expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Joint Committee on their comprehensive report on the proposed European Council directive for further harmonisation of excise duties on cigarettes.  I should stress that harmonisation of the system of duty is under discussion, not the rates of duty; we are completely free to decide what aggregate level of taxation should apply to cigarettes.  This area of taxation is complex and unlike any other of our excise duties.  As Senators are aware, excise duties are normally charged as a specific amount of money on a specified quantity of a commodity or as a fixed percentage of the value of the commodity.  Examples of the former are the tax on beer and spirits and an example of the latter is the excise duty on motor vehicles.  But in the case of cigarettes EEC legislation requires that the excise duty be composed of a specific element and a proportionate element.  The matter is further complicated because the VAT element of tax is also taken into account in determining the split between the specific and proportionate elements of the excise duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of taxation was devised before we joined the EEC and it was a <Col N="1213" /> compromise between the systems which previously existed in the original six member states of the Community.  On joining the EEC we were granted a five year derogation, but on 1 January 1978 we had to switch from our system under which the raw tobacco was taxed, rather than cigarettes, to the EEC system whereby the tax applied directly to the cigarette irrespective of the amount or quality of tobacco which it contains.  This, as Senators may recall, caused some disruption in the structure of the market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Harmonisation of the duty structure for cigarettes has to be seen in the context of the programme for harmonising the structures of excise duties generally, a programme which has its origins in a Council declaration of March 1971 on the gradual achievement of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>At the present stage of harmonisation the specific element of the excise duty must be greater than 5 per cent but not more than 55 per cent, of the total tax, including VAT, on cigarettes in the most popular price category, Carrolls No. 1. The actual charging provision is specified as a fixed amount per 1,000 cigarettes &mdash; since the budget this is £15.30 &mdash; plus a percentage of the retail price.  This is now 22.4 per cent</P>
    <P>The objective of EEC harmonisation in this area is set out in the original directive of 1972.  It is simply that at the final stage of the process a single ratio of proportionate excise duty to specific excise duty would apply in all member states in such a way that &ldquo;the range of retail selling prices would reflect fairly the difference in the manufacturers' delivery prices&rdquo;. Because of the difficulty in determining what ratio would be &ldquo;fair&rdquo; the European Commission has suggested that the member states should make equal effort in striving to establish the final ratio.  With this in mind, the draft Council directive proposed that the next stage of harmonisation should progressively narrow the range within which the specific element of the excise duty may be set.  The intention was that this new stage would apply from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1986.  However, because of time constraints <Col N="1214" /> on examining the proposal, the present stage has been continued until 30 June 1981 in order to avoid a legal hiatus.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that this system of taxation, combining specific and <i>ad valorem</i> duty, was already a <i>fait accompli</i> when we joined the Community so we had no say in formulating it.  We have to make the best of it and in deciding what would suit us best we must keep two possibly conflicting points of view in mind.  The issue can be put fairly simply. Should the tax on cigarettes be mainly proportionate, that is, should high <i>ad valorem</i> rates of duty apply, or should it be mainly specific?</P>
    <P>The conflict arises because high rates of proportionate tax are attractive from a fiscal point of view.  Revenue is maintained in real terms in times of high inflation, without any deliberate adjustments having to be made to the rate of tax.  This is obviously attractive to Ministers for Finance.</P>
    <P>The other aspect is that high proportionate taxes discriminate against high quality, but high cost cigarettes because higher manufacturers' costs are accentuated by the tax system at the retail level.  Irish manufactured cigarettes have been traditionally made from high quality, high cost tobaccos, and have been packaged to a high standard compared with continental-type cigarettes.  The Irish Tobacco Manufacturing Advisory Committee, ITMAC, contend that high proportionate taxes would make Irish cigarettes less competitive and would open up the Irish market in a discriminate way to cheaper foreign cigarettes.  They contend that the Irish industry could be badly affected.  Accordingly they would favour high specific rates of tax.</P>
    <P>In 1977 a difficult initial choice had to be made because of the change-over to the new regime which took place on 1 January 1978.  Having considered the conflicting views it was decided that we would opt for as high a specific element of excise duty as the system would allow, in the interests of domestic industry and notwithstanding the revenue attractions of a greater proportionate tax element.</P>
    <P>Once again we are faced with the same choice and in our working party negotiations <Col N="1215" /> on the draft Council directive which is the subject of this report, we have followed the same line as in 1977. We have argued that high proportionate rates of duty could be discriminatory rather than fair, in that the tax system could have too large a role in determining the relative prices of different brands of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament have proposed that the present stage of harmonisation should be continued while re-evaluating the position in general.</P>
    <P>We agree with this because there are many other factors which influence the cigarette industry that need to be examined.  The different member states have different advertising codes, for instance. The organisation of the industry in France and Italy is State run, and hence in a different position from the free enterprise cigarette industry which operates here and in the United Kingdom.  They also benefit from the common agricultural policy in respect of home-grown tobacco.  Even more to the point, the credit terms for payment of duty can differ markedly in the different member states.  Then, of course, there is the very difficult issue of health policy and cigarette smoking, which is, strictly speaking, outside the tax area, but nevertheless has an influence on the cigarette industries. So all in all this might be as good a time as any for the member states to take stock of the harmonisation process and its objectives.</P>
    <P>I would assure Senators, however, that in future negotiations in the EEC on this issue we intend that the line I have set out above will be continued.  The grounds remain compelling for seeking to protect the domestic manufacturers from discriminatory systems of taxation, although at the end of the day we may have to show some measure of flexibility.</P>
    <P>The report deals with two other minor items which are covered in the draft directive.  One deals with the existing option to prescribe a minimum excise duty for all brands of cigarettes.  This could be necessary in order to protect the <Col N="1216" /> revenue if very cheap cigarettes were to be marketed.  We have not had to use this provision but we feel that it is a desirable safeguard to have: and in order to be effective, we feel that the minimum duty should continue to be 90 per cent of the duty on the most popular price category of cigarettes rather than the lower 80 per cent which is now proposed.</P>
    <P>The other item concerns the present option to exclude common customs duty from the base on which the national excise duty is charged.  We have never exercised this option and we feel that it should be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given some welcome news as far as it goes.  It will be up to the Government to keep a very vigilant eye on the negotiations proceeding in this matter.  The Irish Tobacco Manufacturers have been watching this whole thing since, as they say in the submission, 1975 and I congratulate the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of European Communities for highlighting and indeed giving timely warning as to the consequences of this harmonisation of taxation.  It might seem rather ironic in two instances.  We all speak so lavishly about the ideal of harmonisation on occasions, but when it comes to one's front door we begin to be rather careful and cautious about it.  The second matter in which the whole subject can be seen to be ironic is in this matter of tobacco, cigarette smoking and so on, about which there has been so much adverse publicity in recent years.  Here we see the Government of today taking a very cautious step in ensuring that the production of cigarettes within our own domestic market is continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a county which is the proud home of one of the three significant Irish manufacturers of tobacco and I can look at this whole matter in a rather objective way.  I do not smoke so that gives me added grounds on which I can speak my mind on this matter.  There is no doubt that there is a danger in this harmonisation.  The committee have set out in their document that they have not been able to provide any answers against the arguments put forward by the Irish <Col N="1217" /> Tobacco Advisory Committee.  The Tobacco Advisory Committee have fought long to get the progressiveness of these harmonisation measures.  It has been going on for the past six or seven years and we see pointed out for us in the submission both by ITMAC and by the Joint Committee that when the economies of large-scale production come to the Irish threshold we will not be able to compete with the European monopolists in the cigarette and tobacco industries, particularly in France and Italy.  The uncertainty that can afflict any industry is not a healthy thing and it is up to the Irish Government to abolish this uncertainty once and for all.  Perhaps today the Minister has taken a step in that direction but the tobacco manufacturers will not be satisfied until this whole question of harmonisation, which they see as being to their detriment as regards investment and employment in Ireland in future years, will be conclusively resolved to the satisfaction of this State.</P>
    <P>In Louth, which is the proud home of one of the three significant Irish tobacco manufacturers, I see at first hand the benefits that have been put into my county economy by the efficient company that is there.  I see what could be the adverse consequences of taxation harmonisation both in investment and in employment opportunities.  That company in Louth have a great reputation as being efficient, as being the provider of positions and jobs with the very best of conditions, providing the very best in security and tenure of employment.  That is something that no county would wish to see jeopardised or prejudiced in any way.  This company have diversified in no uncertain manner in the past decade. They have moved into other fields and have taken cognisance of the publicity and particularly the medical evidence against cigarette smoking.  This has not stopped them from diversifying into other industries and creating further jobs and employment opportunities.  They have made a great contribution to the economy, in the arts field, in the tourism field, in the sporting arena and also in educational and in recreational areas. <Col N="1218" /> These are all wonderful assets for any county and I wish to see them continuing.</P>
    <P>It is initially and primarily the responsibility of the Irish Government to let the Council of Ministers in Brussels know that this is a case of the ideal of harmonisation going mad with very contrary consequences for an economy to what was outlined in the original Rome Treaty. The Joint Committee have done an excellent job in highlighting and giving warning as to what might happen to the Irish tobacco industry.  It is necessary for the Government to give a commitment so that the tobacco manufacturers in Ireland will have confidence in the future that will enable them to continue investment in their industry and in diversification.  I look forward to this happening.  The consequences of this harmonisation have been outlined not only by the tobacco manufacturers &mdash; and we can always expect any business body to put up the best side of the coin &mdash; but also by the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas who have examined and analysed the pros and cons of the case.  They have come out very conclusively and strongly on what should be done in this instance.  The Joint Committee, the manufacturers and no doubt this House, see that harmonisation may be very well and may be ideal but, when it runs contrary to what could well be the principal premise of the Rome Treaty, it is time to tell Brussels to halt. The Minister has indicated that there is a sort of freeze on progress in these harmonisation matters.  The Irish Government should insist that the matter be resolved in a way that will leave the Irish tobacco manufacturers in no uncertainty about their future and the future of the 2,000 jobs in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this motion.  I am delighted that the Minister has indicated that the Government are viewing the situation with considerable gravity.  We are talking about the survival of an important industry.  It would be extremely difficult for the Irish tobacco industry to continue to be successful if the harmonisation at present being pursued were continued to its logical conclusion.  It is absolutely vital that in so far <Col N="1219" /> as possible, we modify considerably or if possible stop the progression of this EEC policy.  As the Minister pointed out, we are starting slightly from behind as a certain position had already been taken before we joined the EEC.  Therefore, we are compelled to accept these decisions.  However, there is considerable room for manoeuvre, and for not merely the delaying but the stopping tactics that are essential.</P>
      <P>The tobacco industry here employs directly a considerable number of persons and many more indirectly depend on that industry.  As Senator Markey so clearly pointed out, one particularly excellent firm is located in County Louth and it would be a particularly severe blow for that region were progression of harmonisation to continue unallayed.  It is pleasant, in a way, to find ourselves, Opposition and Government, Joint Committee, industry and workers combining on this issue.  I congratulate Senator Mulcahy and Senator FitzGerald on the excellent way in which they have developed this debate.  One of the very great advantages of Joint Committees is that Senators and Deputies from both sides of the House confer in detail with members of a given industry or group and all of us combine on matters which are strictly non-party matters but which are vital for the country and for the industry in question.  I would like to see a lot more of this taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic in a way, as Senators have pointed out, that it should be the tobacco industry that we are combining to support as that industry has come in for a certain amount of criticism.  There are aspects which we must take cognisance of.  As Senator FitzGerald pointed out, this policy of harmonisation will not help the health aspect but will have quite the opposite effect.  It will mean the introduction of types of tobacco which are deleterious to health.  By making the industry uneconomic it will increase the difficulty of adopting appropriate health measures.  On this aspect, the tobacco industry is making a very serious effort to improve the situation healthwise.  At times this effort is not appreciated.  This <Col N="1220" /> procedure of the EEC would run totally contrary to that.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which I would support, such as the Government monopoly situation which Senator FitzGerald outlined so clearly in relation to one country.  It applies in other European countries also.  The situation as regards tobacco and the tobacco industry is very different in these islands as compared with northern Europe or southern Europe.  In these islands, for example, the main process in relation to tobacco is a flue curing process and the tobacco used is of a particular quality and standard.  We do not in these islands use oriental tobacco, which is of a very different type.</P>
    <P>In certain northern European countries which were in the EEC before we joined, oriental tobacco is used to a considerable extent.  This has important implications, particularly with the enlargement of the Community.  Greece is a major tobacco grower and in Greece the tobacco grown is the oriental type and therefore there is a certain natural, very understandable, vested interest from the point of view of this new member of the Community particularly as in Greece and other associate members such as Turkey, tobacco growing, not the actual production of cigarettes, is a major agricultural occupation and a major social support.  Indeed, Greece is heavily dependent on tobacco exports for its economy.  There are very strong vested interests, which the Minister will come up against in his arguments at the EEC. It is very important that we continue the very excellent united front that we have seen here between the Government and members of the Joint Committee from both sides of the House and, I am sure, from both sides of the tobacco industry. I certainly give my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly support both committees, the tobacco manufacturers committee and the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation for highlighting the problem for us.  However I must make the observation that the Minister told us that there would be need for flexibility on the part of the Government and that it <Col N="1221" /> would be inevitable.  We cannot complain about that because it is a Common Market and it is their job to bring things into harmony.  As far as we are concerned we have an obligation to use the institutions in the best way possible to give the best possible safeguards to the people we represent especially when a very responsible body like the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee and the Joint Committee ask us not only to oppose but to reject the legislation.  This is a very serious development.  It means the people who have examined the legislation have seen the gravity of it and have asked for the ultimate in the context of rejection.</P>
      <P>Referring to what the Minister said, we must look at the fact that because we are a member of the Common Market inevitably we will be affected.  We cannot weave a cocoon around ourselves and let the world go by.  We are in the EEC.  We knew the problems when we were going into it.  We should provide as much protection as we can &mdash; it is right that we should on this occasion &mdash; but we cannot hide ourselves from the rest of the world and weave this cocoon and think we will get by.  That is not the nature of things. The legislation will eventually affect us but, while we can, we should give this motion the fullest support possible.</P>
      <P>We must pay particular attention to the fact that there could be a decline in the cigarette trade here and its possible demise, with the loss of 2,000 jobs.  Eventually the market could be flooded with Italian cigarettes because with the type of manufacturing plants in operation in Italy production is cheaper and they could rely on volume to get the benefit of undercutting on the Irish market.  The Italian producers would have a great advantage over the Irish manufacturer. For this reason we must take cognisance of the report and support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Tobacco Manufacturing Advisory Committee made the case that the different structures of excise duty are not impediments to market penetration. They point out that measures in this direction so far adopted have been very limited.  We take that point also.  They <Col N="1222" /> also make the argument that the extended time for payment of tax gives producers the necessary capital for long periods &mdash; an advantage which does not apply to Irish manufacturers.  They point to the existence of monopolies in France and Italy.  Government monopolies, not just monopolies of individuals or private enterprise, monopolies that engage in extensive leaf-growing which benefit from the cost factors attached to the common agricultural policy through the growing of tobacco leaf.</P>
    <P>The position is that those very large manufacturing plants could not afford to embark on productivity arrangements or productivity deals with their employees. Therefore, they produce cigarettes more cheaply and throw them on to this market and, on the basis of increased volume of sales, undercutting Irish products.  Therefore, we have to give the Irish trade all possible protection, particularly in view of job loss.  Maybe we were not in a position to give the industry the same type of protection or provide a hearing for it in open forum as was the case in relation to other industries.  We have seen jobs going all over the place through lack of import controls and the dumping of foreign goods.  Textiles and leather factories have been going to the wall.  Here we can do something about it and it is only right that we should.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that this motion has our full support.  We should not lose sight of the fact that this is only a postponement.  Inevitably we must face competition whenever it arises.  By slowing down the process, the Government may not be able to get rid of the problem but rather make the problem less acute. In the meantime, it is our duty to protect the 2,000 jobs in the industry.</P>

Mar is eol díbh go léir, agus mar a dúirt gach éinne, táimid ag cur síos ar rud atá fíor-riachtanach, an-tábhachtach ó thaobh cúrsaí tionsclaíochta sa tír seo.  Táim an-shásta gur tháinig an Seanad go hiomlán taobh thiar den tuarascáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> We are talking about the threatened destruction of an industry.  Senator FitzGerald put it very well.  The signal for this, the cue, appeared in 1976.  When the present Taoiseach chaired the committee the problem was on the horizon and now it has become more acute.  We, therefore, have to tackle it and oppose it with even greater vigour than was shown in 1976. At that stage it was only a shadow on the horizon.  It is now a much larger spectre looming before us.</P>
    <P>I have little to add.  I thought the team-work was excellent.  We had Senator FitzGerald, who is an expert in the tax area, covering the legal background of the situation for us including &ldquo;the spirit and letter of the Treaty&rdquo; and the degree to which this approach would be cutting right across it.  Senator Conroy was able from his very specialised knowledge to support the contention that there is a health problem &mdash; that if the cigarette industry in this country came under this type of attack it is highly likely that the market would be flooded with low cost, possibly carcinogenous products.  We should be very glad that our industry here has been based on high quality product, high quality tobacco, from the very beginning.  We want it to remain so.</P>
    <P>We had the support of the trade union side, making it clear what the employees' view would be, and we had the support of the community from Senator Markey. I thought the team-work was very good, and it goes further to make the point that Senator Conroy was making, that these committees which are made up of Deputies and Senators from all parties are enabled to get down to analyse problems for the sake of the problems and not for the sake of the political points being made.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the point being made for possibly a greater use of committees of this kind.  The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and the Joint Committee on EEC Legislation are very fine examples of legislators working in the way it was intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that <i>ad valorem</i> taxes make life easier for the <Col N="1224" /> Minister for Finance, that it is a way of allowing the State to generate more taxation yield without necessarily having to highlight the fact that more duty is going on cigarettes in every budget because it gets caught up in the natural increase in prices.  That reminds me that in my own contribution I did not emphasise that we are rather inclined to support the view that the 90 per cent figure for revenue should be supported rather than the 80 per cent which is the intention in the new directive.  The higher the amount of duty that can be raised the more you could predict the revenue in the event of any drop in price in the cost structure of the cigarette product.  Therefore, at this point I would add our support for the 90 per cent rather than the 80 per cent duty limits.</P>
    <P>I gather that the estimated yield from tobacco for 1981 is of the order of £183 million.  We are not talking about buttons.  About 93 per cent of that would come from cigarettes.  That means in effect that if we were operating the same excise credit scheme, which has been highlighted by a number of speakers, we would be indirectly giving the industry, depending on how you calculate it, something between £20 million and £50 million investment support.  That is a lot of money.  That is the sort of thing we would be up against if we are trading against European competition which operates with that level of excise credit given.  We are not just talking about putting a bit of tax on a fag, we are talking about an intricate structure of trading which operates in this sector, and <i>semplice</i> solutions are not what are required.  So what we are saying is, &ldquo;Refer it back and we will give the Minister every support in going back to Brussels to oppose this directive&rdquo;.  The whole thing needs greater examination in greater depth.  There is more than a dimension of excise duty, proportion or specific content.  It involves analysis of the whole competitive structure of the industry.  We would recommend that that be done before any further moves are made.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank the Minister for coming along and contributing <Col N="1225" /> to the debate.  I thank all my colleagues for their support in coming behind this report and opposing something that could be disastrous for one of our industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
