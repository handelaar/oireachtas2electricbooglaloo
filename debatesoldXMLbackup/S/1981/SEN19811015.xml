      <P>I would willingly agree to it if I could get some clarification.  I am still serving my apprenticeship in this House.  I simply inquire, in support of my colleague, Senator Robinson, and in full support of the actions of the Leader of the House, and purely by way of eliciting information, whether we are debarred by convention or by Standing Orders from putting on the Order Paper of this House a motion to establish Joint Committees in advance of the Dáil?  If we are so debarred we are prisoners of any such convention but if not is there not a good reason to move ahead of the other House?  That is the spirit in which this House started.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1981: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is appropriate, given the essentially non-party political nature of this Bill, that it should be initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to abolish the death penalty and to substitute imprisonment for life.  It also provides that a minimum period of imprisonment must be served for treason and certain murders.</P>
      <P>I think, perhaps, I might begin by going a little into the background.  As Senators will be aware, the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, abolished the death penalty for all but a few crimes and substituted a life sentence.  The crimes for which capital punishment was retained were treason, certain murders, including murders of gardaí and prison officers acting in the course of their duty, and certain offences against military law, most of which can be committed only in time of war.  As I understand it, the decision of the Oireachtas in 1964 not to go the whole way and totally abolish the death penalty for murder was based on a belief that capital punishment was likely to have a deterrent effect on those who murder for so-called political motives.  The view was also taken that the Garda Síochána, being an unarmed police force, required additional protection and that the death penalty would give this protection.  However, in my opinion, experience since 1964 has not borne out the views that were then expressed about the desirability of retaining it in those remaining cases.  The logic that capital punishment was not a deterrent to ordinary murder but might be to capital murder is totally untenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1964 the debate on capital punishment has continued in this country and at international level, in particular on whether it is or is not a deterrent either generally or in relation to particular murders. As far as I am aware, the studies <Col N="219" /> that have been made have reached no firm conclusion one way or the other.</P>
    <P>For my part&mdash;and I believe I speak for the great majority of people&mdash;I am completely opposed to the taking of life, whether by the State or by anyone else, and I believe that the time has now come for this country to finish the job that was begun in 1964 and to remove completely from the Statute Book the right of the State to inflict death on any person for whatever reason in the future.</P>
    <P>I believe deeply in the sacredness of human life.  The right to life is precedent to all other rights for when a person's life is ended all other rights of that person are of no further consequence.  Moreover, at a time when so many human lives are being taken on this island to the near universal abhorrence of the population, it is timely that the State should give clear expression to that abhorrence by the symbolic act of repudiating its own right to deliberately take life in any circumstances. I use the word &ldquo;symbolic&rdquo; advisedly. For I think there was great force in the statement made by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party on the 6.30 RTE radio news programme on Monday, 28 September last.  He said that capital punishment was, any way, for all intents and purposes gone.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this Bill seeks merely to give expression to the reality of the situation. More than that it seeks, by very stiff jail sentences indeed, to increase the deterrent against what up to now are defined as &lsquo;capital&rsquo; murders.  Above all else, however, the symbolic declaration, inherent in this Bill, that no one, but no one, has the right to deny another his life validates and strengthens the near total condemnations repeatedly made against murder.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I subscribe to the view expressed in 1966 in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology that &ldquo;brutal punishments accustom people to brutality and tend to create attitudes conductive to the commission of violent crimes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>And as was said on another occasion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> The only moral ground on which the State could conceivably possess the right to destroy human life would be if this were indispensable for the protection or preservation of other lives.  This places the burden of proof on those who believe that capital punishment exercises a deterrent effect on the potential criminal.  Unless they can establish that the death penalty does, in fact, protect other lives, at the expense of one, there is no moral justification for the State to take life.</P>
    <P>In enacting this Bill we shall be joining a growing number of states that have already totally abolished capital punishment. As Senators will be aware, France recently enacted legislation abolishing the death penalty and Belgium has also introduced a Bill to the same effect.  By the time our legislation has been enacted it is likely that capital punishment will be a thing of the past &mdash; at least in peace-time &mdash; in virtually the whole of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Abolition will also accord with recent developments in this regard within the European Community and the Council of Europe.  The European Parliament in a recent resolution expressed its strong desire that the death penalty should be abolished throughout the Community and invited members to amend their legal provisions accordingly.  In the Council of Europe the Parliamentary Assembly has adopted a recommendation that the European Convention on Human Rights should be amended so as to outlaw the use of the death penalty.  This recommendation is being considered by the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Reservations about this Bill have been expressed, understandably, by Garda and prison officers associations.  Their reservations weigh heavily with me but, nevertheless, I am convinced&mdash;given that capital punishment is for all intents and purposes already gone&mdash;that this Bill will enhance, not reduce, the special protection rightly accorded to the Garda and prison officers.</P>
    <P>Turning to the provisions of the Bill, abolition of the death penalty is a <Col N="221" /> straightforward matter, as can be seen from the simple provision in section 1. The punishment to be substituted for the death penalty is not so straightforward and was a matter which necessitated careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The first question that arose was whether the law should continue to treat some or all of the offences now carrying the death penalty differently, in so far as sentence is concerned, from other serious offences, such as what might be termed ordinary murder.  In other words, should a more severe sentence be prescribed for them?  The Government considered that, as regards the &ldquo;civil&rdquo; offences of treason and &ldquo;capital&rdquo; murder, the answer to that question should be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  In the Government's view there are still valid reasons why the law should mark in a most emphatic way society's denunciation of these particular crimes.  These offences constitute an attack, either directly or indirectly, on the institutions of the State, prejudice the maintenance of public order and threaten the security of every citizen.  And, as I have said, we must never forget the special position of our police and prison officers who are particularly at risk from violent criminals and some of whom have been murdered in the execution of their duty.  For these reasons we consider that there is no alternative to providing more severe punishment for such crimes and this is what the Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the penalty for these offences&mdash;treason and the murders in question&mdash;will be life imprisonment.  It does not necessarily follow, of course, that a person sentenced to life imprisonment will in fact remain in prison for the whole of his life.  In practice, he is released earlier&mdash;initially on parole, technically called temporary release, under the powers given to the Minister for Justice by the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  If, after a period, the prisoner has fulfilled the conditions of his temporary release, the balance of the sentence would be remitted under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  Whether it is right that the law should continue to prescribe life sentences rather than a maximum <Col N="222" /> determinate sentence or a combination of minimum and maximum sentences, leaving the actual sentence to the discretion of the court, is another, and general, question which is, I think, beyond the scope of this Bill.  In the present instance the Government considered it essential that persons sentenced for treason and these murders should serve extremely long sentences and that, in order that such sentences should have the maximum possible deterrent effect, it should be clearly seen in advance that there would be no prospect of early parole or that the Minister or the Government would commute or remit the sentence after a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>What the Bill, therefore, proposes is that in sentencing a person convicted of treason or of what is now &ldquo;capital&rdquo; murder the court would be required to specify a period of not less than 40 years as the minimum period of imprisonment to be served.  That is provided in section 4. Section 5 goes on to provide that, during the minimum period specified by the court, the power of the Government and the Minister for Justice to commute or remit the punishment should not be exercisable.  It also provides that during this period the power of the Minister to grant temporary release should not apply to a person serving such a sentence unless for grave reasons of a humanitarian nature.  Moreover, any release that would be granted in such circumstances would have to be of such limited duration as was justified by those reasons.</P>
    <P>Of course, it will still be possible for the Government to advise the President to act pursuant to the powers conferred on him by Article 13.6 of the Constitution to commute or remit a sentence in a case such as this.  Short of amending the Constitution, there will be no legal obstacle to prevent that happening in the future. It is the Government's view, however, that the restriction by this Bill of the Government's and the Minister's statutory powers to act on their own in this matter will go a long way towards preventing this happening.  First of all, the restriction will help to give reassurance&mdash;if such is needed&mdash;that the Government <Col N="223" /> are determined to uphold the institutions of the State and to protect those who defend these institutions by providing severe punishment for those who would seek to undermine or overthrow them.  It may be said that, since it will always be open to a future Parliament to repeal this Bill, there will be no guarantee that it will not be repealed.  Such a guarantee, of course, cannot be given.  But I believe that the restriction in this Bill on the Government's and the Minister's power to commute or remit these sentences or to grant parole will set a headline for future Governments and is likely to create a climate in which it would be very difficult indeed for a future Government either to repeal this legislation or to advise the President to remit the sentences.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to allow prisoners serving sentences for the offences in question to earn the normal remission for industry and good conduct applicable under prison rules to prisoners generally. This will be deductible from the minimum period specified by the court. Remission for good conduct should not be confused with the power to remit punishment which, as I have already explained, is being restricted.  At the moment, well-conducted prisoners can earn a remission of one-quarter of their sentence. Under section 5 (2) of the Bill, prisoners serving a minimum period will be treated, for the purpose of remission, as if they had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment equal to the minimum period.  Accordingly, a person serving a minimum period of 40 years would be eligible to earn ten years remission, bringing the minimum period that he would have to serve down to 30 years.  I should stress that this would still be a minimum period and that it would then be a matter for the Government or Minister for Justice of the day to decide whether to allow release at that stage.  I realise that a minimum period of imprisonment of such a length is an exceptionally severe punishment but, as I have said, the Government believe that a firm stand has to be taken against people who <Col N="224" /> are prepared to engage in attacks on the institutions of the State and to murder members of the Garda or prison officers. In the Government's view a period of 40 years &mdash; or I should say a net 30 years under the present rules governing remission for good conduct &mdash; is the minimum which would be an acceptable substitute for the death penalty for perpetrators of these crimes.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill.  There are, however, one or two other matters to which I would like to refer.  We are making it clear by virtue of section 3 (2) that murder to which section 3 refers &mdash; formerly known as &ldquo;capital&rdquo; murder &mdash; will be a distinct offence from &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; murder and that it will be necessary, in order that a person should be convicted of such an offence, to prove <i>mens rea,</i> that is to say, the necessary guilty intent, in respect of all the ingredients of the offence.  In this respect the Bill follows the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Murray case.  This provision is designed to ensure that a person charged, for example, with the murder of a garda acting in the course of his duty will not be convicted of the offence unless it is proved that he either knew that the victim was a member of the Garda acting in the course of his duty or was reckless as to whether the victim was or was not such a member.  Paragraph (b) of section 3 (2) will, except to the extent that the Bill provides otherwise, ensure that the law and procedure generally relating to murder will apply to these particular murders. This will preserve all the usual defences to murder which the law allows and will also ensure that there will be a power of arrest without warrant for the offence.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are mainly procedural and the Schedules contain the necessary consequential amendments and repeals.  Senators will see that quite a substantial number of consequential amendments are necessary to the Defence Act, 1954.  That Act contains a number of provisions dealing with the trial of offences against military law by courts-martial and it is necessary to amend some of them to bring the Act <Col N="225" /> into line with the provisions of the Bill. The main thing to note, perhaps, is that a sentence of life imprisonment is being substituted for the death penalty for the purely military offences, such as mutiny with violence.  At present the death penalty is not a mandatory sentence for these offences.  A court-martial may award a lesser punishment.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate to impose a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment in substitution for the death penalty in these cases.  Where, however, a person subject to military law is tried by court-martial for treason or for what is now &lsquo;capital&rsquo; murder &mdash; as he could be so tried when on active service &mdash; he will be liable to exactly the same penalties as he would be if tried by a civil court.  The provisions relating to restriction of the powers of commutation or remission of sentence, as well as of parole, will also apply.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am putting this Bill forward as an essential measure of law reform which will complete a process begun by the Oireachtas in 1964.  As I have already said, our experience since 1964 indicates that the retention of the death penalty on the Statute Book is not justified.  In my opinion, mandatory long-term sentences, as proposed in the Bill, will be &mdash; at least &mdash; as effective. Moreover, abolition will bring our law into line with that of virtually all other countries in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>But, so far as I am concerned, the overriding consideration is that abolition is right in principle and it is on that basis that I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before speaking on the Bill I would like to say that if the Second Stage of this Bill is concluded before 4.30 p.m. the Members on this side of the House will not be voting on it because the party has not had an opportunity of considering the principles of this Bill.  I did mention this to the Leader of the House and suggested that the Bill might be taken at the next sitting of the Seanad, but that was not found possible.  If a vote does arise before 4.30 p.m. we will not be voting.  We will reserve the right to <Col N="226" /> vote on the principles of the Bill on Fifth Stage.</P>
      <P>In general terms I am in favour of what this Bill sets out to do, that is, abolish capital punishment.  I expressed that view when the 1964 Act was being considered by this House.  I see no reason to change my view as to the basic desirability of reaching a stage where capital punishment could be abolished for what one might refer to as domestic crime, the kind of crime that takes place in a country in which there is no unusual activity of a political nature.  If that stage had been reached in this country, then I would certainly be supporting this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not express the view against capital punishment because I am a pacifist.  I am not a pacifist: I believe that a person is entitled to use force to defend himself, to defend his family, to defend his neighbour and to use such force as is necessary. If this entails the death of the person who has attacked him, then that is something I accept as being necessary, however regrettable.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I believe that the country as such is entitled to defend itself against invasion or revolution and to take the steps that are necessary in these circumstances, even though they may result in the death of people taking part in the invasion or the revolution.  I am not therefore adopting a pacifist view in considering this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this Bill, an important point arises &mdash; whether we are or are not now in a position which approximates to one of the two conditions which I have mentioned, that of revolution.  At present, certainly in the North, there are several paramilitary forces at work, believing themselves to be waging some kind of a war which they believe entitles them to take the law into their own hands, to wage war against the Army and against the police force, not only the police force in the Six Counties but even the police and Army down here.  In these circumstances I would certainly have to consider whether it is appropriate to adopt the principle of abolition of capital punishment <Col N="227" /> at the present time.  It is not a normal situation.  We are not merely dealing with what I have referred to as domestic crime and, consequently, it is inappropriate at this time to be talking about the abolition of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>To return for a moment to the situation that existed at the time of the 1964 Act, at that time it was agreed that capital punishment should no longer apply except in certain specified areas, certain specified situations.  These specified situations included the murder of a Head of State, Head of a foreign State, or Ambassador or Minister of a foreign State.  That would also apply in the case of the murder of a garda or a prison officer.  At that time it was certainly arguable that the murder of a Head of State was most unusual, something which was unlikely to happen, which was perhaps merely theoretical. Unfortunately, whatever may have been the facts at that time, assassinations of Heads of State have become very commonplace in the meantime.  If we came to the conclusion then that capital punishment should be reserved for that kind of situation, even when it seemed to be rather theoretical, it is difficult to accept the argument that capital punishment should no longer apply at the present time, in view of the fact that such assassinations have become very prevalent.</P>
    <P>Again, in dealing with the question of excluding the murder of a garda or a prison officer, conditions at that time were not anything like as serious in this respect as they are at present.  If we considered at that time that the murder of a garda or a prison officer should not be excluded from the abolition of capital punishment, there is a very strong case to be made for capital punishment at the present time in much more difficult and much more appropriate conditions compared with then.</P>
    <P>To go back to the arguments that were made at that time and to the debate that took place in this House at that time, it was considered appropriate then that capital punishment should apply in the cases which I have mentioned and a few <Col N="228" /> other cases which are not quite so relevant. It is difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments on this matter of capital punishment, the principles involved and the theoretical background to capital punishment were considered very fully at that time and debated by this House and the other House.  In the end it was concluded that it should be retained for these special categories of offences.  Certainly, the arguments that applied then apply more than ever now.  It is difficult to conclude that we should take a different view at this time.  I know that it can be argued that the climate of thought has changed since then and everybody is entitled to take a different view now.  It is true that capital punishment is being abolished in a few of the remaining countries where it still applies.  However, the Minister used the rather significant words that these countries were abolishing capital punishment in peace-time.</P>
      <P>It is debatable, to say the least, whether we can be regarded as being at peace in this country at the present time, having regard to the existing volume of violence, particularly in the North but even down here.  There is not a normal situation.  The reason why some of these countries have decided to abolish capital punishment may not be relevant to this country.  They are doing it in what can be regarded as a peace-time situation and my view is that we cannot be regarded as being in the same category.</P>

    <P>It is a difficult dilemma for a person who believes that capital punishment is very objectionable and abhorrent and something that should be abolished.  On the other hand, we have here a situation <Col N="229" /> where it may be necessary and essential in an effort to eliminate the present violence. This dilemma poses great difficulty for anybody who is considering this Bill.</P>
    <P>I certainly look forward to hearing the argument from both points of view.  I believe that there will be arguments put forward from both points of view and will certainly be listening with great interest. It would be a great help to hear the arguments which will be put forward, before the time comes to make a decision on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything at the present time as regards the detailed views put forward by the Minister on the sections of the Bill.  It would be more appropriate to deal with them on Committee Stage.  Certainly Committee Stage will give rise to a good deal of consideration and a good deal of debate.</P>

      <P>I would like to open by mentioning something Senator Ryan brought up in his speech, that is the problem of not having sufficient time to consider this Bill.  On the Order of Business of 8 October last, I mentioned that this Bill would be taken today.  At that point there was no objection raised to that proposal. In fact, I had no intimation until very shortly before the House sat today that there was any problem.  At that stage, the Government assumed we were ready to go ahead.  However, I fully accept that the importance of this Bill and its far-reaching aspects are such that all possible opportunity must be given to everybody to have sufficient time to study it and I hope the adjournment of the debate at 4.30 p.m. will meet the problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister for Justice to this House, to wish him well in the very onerous job he has undertaken and to express my appreciation, and I am sure the appreciation of all Senators, that this House should be given the opportunity to open this very important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from his speech that he feels that this Bill is recognising a <i>de facto</i><Col N="230" /> situation, that the death penalty does not exist in this country.  To look at recent reprieves or commutations, it is obvious that the people, as represented by previous Governments and by the present Government draw back from enforcing the death penalty which remains on our Statute Book.  This Bill, in essence, is recognising this situation.</P>
    <P>Given Senator E. Ryan's very heartfelt words about the present situation it is symptomatic of the times we are living in that it is necessary when making a speech advocating the abolition of the death penalty that one should make quite clear one's total abhorrence of all violence, no matter for what ends.  It is necessary to make quite clear my own view, that I support and welcome this Bill in the full conviction that the kind of violence we have in our society &mdash; more specifically the kind of violence which would undertake to subvert the State and its institutions &mdash; is totally unacceptable to every person in this House.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that I am not a person with legal qualifications. However, I believe this Bill needs to be discussed in detail by as many people as possible and that the views of non-legal people on a subject like this have at least the same validity, if not more so, than the views of people with legal qualifications.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a significant step in this country's progress.  At this point I would like to quote a previous Attorney General of the United States, Mr. Ramsey Clarke, who is very well known for his humanitarian work among prisoners and for prison reform.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>No activity of a people so exposes their humanity, their character, their capacity for charity in its most generous dimension, as the treatment they accord persons convicted of crime.</P>
    <P>That is a very significant and eloquent statement of principle which should be adhered to by all, and certainly by legislators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> I was not present for the 1964 debate which last discussed this whole question and which set out certain crimes which would be considered capital murder, nor was I present at debates stretching back into history which gradually changed laws which were extremely savage in their application.  In preparing for this debate I read some of the December 1969 House of Lords debate when the British were abolishing the death penalty.  One of the speakers was able to recall his grandfather telling him about the execution of seven years old and 11 year olds for what we would now consider minor crimes. That should bring home to us how far we have come in about 100 years.  It is horrifying to think of what used to be done in the name of a State in pursuance of the tenet &ldquo;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&rdquo;.  We in Ireland have progressed greatly since 1964, the last time we used the death penalty, and I believe our unwillingness to use it nowadays shows the time has come to get rid of it once and for all.</P>
    <P>There are extremely well-reasoned and cogent arguments in favour of the retention of the death penalty.  Since many of those arguments come from the bodies we are seeking to protect, and who are actually mentioned in this Bill &mdash; the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the Garda Representative Body, the Prison Officers' Association &mdash; their objections to the abolition of the death penalty and their repeated objections to the recent reprieves must be very soberly and carefully studied, because this is the section of society from whom, if you look at it one way, we are removing some protection which they now enjoy. It is arguable whether the retention of the death penalty does afford any protection to gardaí.</P>
    <P>The argument against the abolition of the death penalty boils down to one essential &mdash; that the retention of the death penalty is or would be a deterrent to future murders.  In trying to establish whether this argument could be validated, I have tried to read as much as possible on that subject.  All I can say is that having read and studied the various <Col N="232" /> arguments about its deterrent qualities, the studies are at very best inconclusive; most studies in this area would seem to disprove any theory that the death penalty acts as a deterrent.  It cannot be shown absolutely conclusively that in order to protect the State we must have the death penalty and that stands as an argument for abolishing it.  If it could be shown conclusively that the death penalty's presence on the Statute Book was a deterrent to this kind of crime then I personally would have to consider very carefully my attitude on this Bill.  When I say I would personally consider my attitude I do not know if I would change my mind because I believe the arguments against the death penalty are so very strong that the opposite arguments would have to be totally and utterly conclusive in order to shake one's view.</P>
    <P>There is an impressive list of bodies, organisations and individuals in this country who have joined over the last few years in a very strong argument for the abolition of the death penalty and they have done so despite the fact that we have had a lot of unrest and a lot of difficulties.  This list is most impressive and far too long to go through.  I would not attempt to detain the House by reading out what each one of them said but a cursory glance at all the organisations and individuals who have come out strongly in favour of the abolition of the death penalty would be useful to us and would give encouragement in supporting the measure which the Government are proposing.</P>
    <P>The list I am going to read out is by no means exhaustive because I have left out a great many international bodies, but the following are the ones which immediately spring to mind as having unequivocally opposed the death penalty: the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, a commission set up by the Irish Bishops; the Irish section of Pax Christi; the Quakers; the late Dr. Birch, Bishop of Ossory; the Chief Rabbi; Amnesty International; the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Prisoners' Rights Organisation. These last three bodies joined together recently in a campaign for the total abolition <Col N="233" /> of the death penalty, raised the campaign to quite a high level of public awareness and carried on the campaign in the most responsible manner.  I would like to congratulate them on the work they have done in that campaign.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the European Parliament which has come out strongly in asking member states to propose the abolition of the death penalty where it remained.  There is also the Council of Europe and the Conference of European Ministers for Justice who in 1978 and 1980 made a unanimous statement that the ultimate aim should be to abolish the death penalty.  The word &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; was probably put in there because one or two of the states still had the death penalty on their books.</P>
    <P>Another body which came out unequivocally in support of the abolition of the death penalty was the commission of inquiry into the Irish penal systems which was chaired by Mr. Seán MacBride, Nobel Prize winner and Lenin Prize winner.  This commission of inquiry sat for 18 months and reported in the autumn of 1980.  The members of that commission included the then chairman of the Labour Party, Mr. Michael D. Higgins; a Minister of State in the present Government, Mr. Michael Keating; Father Micheál MacGreil, a sociologist; Mr. Matt Merrigan and various other people.  Dr. Gallagher of the Methodist Church in Ireland also came out strongly in favour of the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
    <P>Inquiring into what the Bar Council felt about this matter it is useful at this point to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 March 1981.  The Bar Council should be heard in this respect.  Statements from legal people are often not quite as clear to the ordinary lay person as they might be but this points quite clearly to the way they were thinking.</P>
    <P>The report is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Bar Council, in a statement on the death penalty, said that while it could not as a general rule debate a political issue, it was concerned about <Col N="234" /> the taking of life and advocated a society where the taking of life did not and need not occur.</P>
    <P>It pointed out that if the Bar Council took a stance against the death penalty, the position of prosecuting counsel would be compromised in his relationship with the Director of Public Prosecutions, and ultimately with the Government and the Oireachtas which were, under the Constitution, obliged to make a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the other hand, it would hardly be proper for the Bar Council to express itself in favour of the death penalty when members of the Bar may be defending persons accused of capital murder,&rdquo; the statement said.</P>
    <P>That strikes me as coming down firmly on both sides of the fence.  I interpret it as a desire to get rid eventually of the death penalty.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of making up ones mind on this issue I also spoke to several lawyers and a unanimous view of the people I spoke to in this respect was that because it is quite obvious that the State does not intend to use the death penalty it would be much better to get rid of it.  That is a very simplistic summary of their views but because in the most recent cases of people who were condemned to death the reprieves came not on appeal but on the President exercising his power on application by the Government it is quite clear to these lawyers that the State does not intend to use the death penalty and for that reason alone they were advocating that it should be abolished.</P>
    <P>It is necessary at this point to remind ourselves that all the countries in the EEC except ourselves and Greece have abolished the death penalty.  I take Senator Ryan's point that some countries have abolished the death penalty in peace time but at a later stage I might try to refute that argument.  The reason that very impressive list of organisations and individuals have called for the abolition of the death penalty could be summed up very simply, they have&mdash;as we all have &mdash; a total abhorrence of violence no mat- <Col N="235" /> ter which quarter it comes from.  They uphold the right to life totally and reject anybody's right to take away life.  In that rejection, which rejects the right of any organisation or individual to take life, they would include the State.  They also have a belief that it debases all of us if we allow killing in our name because an execution, no matter what way one looks at it, carried out as a result of the passing of a death sentence is carried out with careful planning, it is premeditated, it is never unexpected, it is never accidental, it is always carried out cold-bloodedly. That aspect of judicial execution, or execution by the State, distinguishes it in many respects from the conditions in which the original crime was committed, not always, but in many respects.</P>
    <P>Very importantly, it seems to me that to execute somebody who has committed a serious crime denies the possibility of rehabilitation or repentance of that person and, therefore, denies human potential. It denies the very possibility of human dignity being restored; it denies the possibility of a valuable life being once again led.  All these arguments, seem to me to be incontrovertible.  I do not want to introduce a note of emotionalism into this debate.  However, the death penalty, whether we like it or not, is a very emotional subject.  In many countries, and in western European countries, executions used be carried out in public.  Why are executions not carried out in public anymore?  The reason is because we consider ourselves too civilised to stand around and cheer when somebody is being killed, that it is a barbaric way of doing things.  Now, we have private executions so that people will not be faced with this unpleasant procedure and that an execution be carried out away from the public eye by somebody else.  It is worth pondering on the removal of executions from the public to the private domain.</P>
    <P>Because we have no broadcasting or televising of any kind in this Chamber, I realise that one is rather limited because, after all, pictures speak louder than words.  In preparing for this debate I did not know the modern methods of execution, <Col N="236" /> and I proceeded to research that area.  I found a series of photographs, not of people being executed I hasten to say but of the methods, the actual instruments used in executions.  I had photographs of a gas chamber, a garrotte, a guillotine, an electric chair, a hanging scaffold and, unfortunately, because of its very nature, we have to have a photograph of people in the illustration of a firing squad.  I must remind the House that these are the humane ways of execution. As we are all aware, there are other more barbaric ways of state execution carried out in other societies. What I have just read out is a list of the humane ways.  These photographs are very clinical, very unemotional.  I called some people to have a look at them and they were uniformly horrified.  Those people had never seen the set-up or the instruments that were used and some of them were quite upset.  One cannot get away from it &mdash; execution is a very grizzly sanction; it is never pleasant and we have tried to hide it away from society.  I am glad to say we have not used it since 1954 but it has been used in our name and if this Bill fails to go through the Oireachtas, it could be still used in our name.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at a point when we have to say to ourselves: if we take this step now how do we answer the fears of the guardians of the peace and how do we answer the fears that the State leaves itself open and vulnerable if we remove this final sanction.  This fear is felt not only by the men and women of our police force but by their families, who worry about somebody not coming home in the evening having gone out to work protecting the State.  That must be a grave concern of ours and we must address ourselves to it.  At this point we must turn to the mandatory sentence.  The mandatory sentence by any standards is extremely strong &mdash; 40 years is a very long time.  Thirty years, which is what we are talking about at best, is also a very long time.  Something which I do not want to go into now but which is a fundamental question should be mentioned, and perhaps other Senators might take it up.  If the death penalty cannot be shown to be <Col N="237" /> a deterrent how will the mandatory sentence be shown to be a deterrent?  That is a fundamental point which calls into question the operation of the sanctions of society against the criminal deviants in society.  It is not something into which one can go in detail here.</P>
    <P>I accept that for the purposes of what we are about now &mdash; abolishing the death penalty &mdash; the best we can do at this point in thinking, in Irish criminology, in Irish penology, is to substitute a mandatory sentence for the death penalty.  I note the Minister's and the Bill's contention that the Minister divests himself of certain personal powers of release in this mandatory sentence for these scheduled crimes in this area.  I see the reasoning behind that.  It is important to remind ourselves that we still have the power under Article 13.6 of the Constitution for the Government to appeal to the President who may act differently.  Obviously, that still remains and we could not take that power away, even if we wanted to, without a constitutional amendment.  I do not foresee a situation where there would be a public demand for a constitutional amendment to make people stay in jail for 40 years.</P>
    <P>I accept that this compromise, this mandatory sentence, does hit the right balance between severity and some possibility of mercy under the law.  But we must look at other ways of protecting our guardians of the peace, because it is absolutely essential for the Garda Síochána to be fully supported by every single one of us, to be assured that they have the full support of Government and Oireachtas and that, as far as possible, their job will be made not only possible but that they will be winning the battle of protecting the country.  In that respect of course, apart from things like mandatory sentences, I would strongly urge on the Minister the need to continue the improvements in equipment and training for the Garda so that our Garda Síochána will be a force which will have equipment and training as good as any security force in the modern world.  I believe that is the <Col N="238" /> very least we owe the protectors of the State.</P>
    <P>I believe that the pay and conditions and standards of excellence of the Garda should be kept constantly under review so that they may be a very special body because they are doing very special work. This is because we place enormous demands on the Garda and rely enormously on them.  In their own interests this standard of excellence of the Garda also includes the need to insist on excellent standards of behaviour so that the public will always have unshakeable confidence in them.  That is part and parcel of having a first-class police force.</P>
    <P>I know that on the whole question of abolishing the death penalty there has been a question of whether the Garda should be armed.  I know that the Garda themselves are not at one on this issue, that many of them are strongly against it and that that is an ongoing debate.  At this point it might be just as well for us to remind ourselves that in relation to the recent tragic murders of members of the Garda Síochána the gardaí in those cases were armed.  It is relevant and necessary for us to remind ourselves of that fact. That is not conclusive.  I am not drawing the conclusion that, because some gardaí were armed and were shot dead, the Garda should not be armed.  The argument about arming or not arming the Garda is an ongoing one, not entirely divorced from this question of abolishing the death penalty.</P>
    <P>The present unrest, which was touched on by Senator Ryan, has been going on at its present level since 1969.  Eight members of the Garda have been killed since 1969, not all in direct conflict with particular subversive groups.  In the North, where countless members of the RUC and Army personnel have been killed in the course of their duty, the death penalty has been abolished and it has not been brought back in the face of the terrible problems there.  To bring back the death penalty against members of certain organisations in this country would defeat our purpose.  I believe that this <Col N="239" /> country has enough martyrs without adding more.</P>

      <P>I believe that our determination to turn away from violent sanctions against violent men is an eloquent answer to terrorist violence and shows the abhorrence that we have of any kind of violence and that we will not be drawn down to the level of those people.</P>
      <P>That is all I wish to say at this stage of the Bill.  I would like to conclude by congratulating the Minister and the Government on bringing this Bill before us so speedily and wish it well through the Oireachtas.  I hope that it presages other Bills which will come to grips with the real problems of criminals and the prison system here.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should have said it on the Order of Business, but if I were Leader of the House &mdash; which I do not think I will ever be &mdash; I would order the business rather better in that this Bill should either have been taken for the whole of today or most of today or not at all.  It seems most unsatisfactory cutting it off after a couple of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me also pass one or two critical remarks on the explanatory memorandum. In theory these explanatory memoranda should be helpful to Deputies and Senators.  In practice very often they specialise in telling us the obvious and in making the obscure even more obscure. A legislator of even the meanest significance should be able to grasp that the first section in the Bill proposes to abolish the death penalty.  Yet the memorandum persists in telling us that all over again. But it does not tell us, for example what is meant by section 3 (i) (c): &ldquo;murder done in the course or furtherance of an offence under section 6, 7, 8 or 9...&rdquo;  It would be very helpful for Deputies and Senators to be informed as to what that meant.  Also, surely someone could have devised a less cumbersome reference to the new category rather than &ldquo;the murder&rdquo;<Col N="240" /> and so on &ldquo;to which section 3 applies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is something else which to a layman raises a number of questions about the Bill apart from the question of the overriding power of the President to commute.  I am not altogether convinced that the constitutional section here, Article 13.6, does not in fact have a paramount influence which still remains even after this Bill has been passed.  If a particular Government came to power with a particular political sympathy it could very well disregard many of the provisions in this Bill by having recourse to the constitutional expedient of directing the President to commute or remit.  What is not clear to a layman is in what way the process of appeal will be influenced by the new legislation.  I take it that some one convicted of this class of special murder will have the usual right of appeal to the higher courts.  If so, is the higher court bound either to acquit or to continue with the mandatory minimum sentence? Again the legislation does not make that clear.  Perhaps the Minister might say that is not necessary, but the explanatory memorandum could be used to clear up these points.  Incidentally, the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in the Constitution, Article 13.6, would now seem to be obsolete.</P>
    <P>Another question which comes to mind is whether the death penalty is now for ever gone in the military sphere, even in time of war or invasion.  This is simply a point of information I would like to have clarified.</P>
    <P>The eight words which begin section 1 are historic.  I may have some reservations, as Senator Ryan has, as this is a very complex measure, but when, as a legislator, I am presented with a Bill which says in section 1 &ldquo;No person shall suffer death for any offence&rdquo; I cannot but give my wholehearted assent.  Like Senator Ryan, I wish that it was not necessary to bring in the Bill just now.  Perhaps no great harm is being done by continuing the present system, but once the Bill is proposed by the Government it seems that I have no choice but to support the abolition of the death penalty.  It is the <Col N="241" /> final stage, I hope, on the long road and of the argument that has gone on in various parts of the world over the best part of two centuries on the death penalty.</P>
    <P>It is one of the rather extraordinary paradoxes of our time that we should see such massive wastage of human life in global wars and such appalling brutality under certain régimes involving the wholesale destruction of human life and yet at the same time this age should manifest such a tender concern for the sacredness of human life.  Part of the past history of capital punishment is to be explained in terms of the brutality, shortness and nastiness, to use the famous Hobbesian phrase, of life in previous centuries.</P>
    <P>When pain and suffering were the universal lot it really did not offend people's civilised conscience that hanging, the most cruel and barbarous kind of public execution, should take place even for relatively trivial offences.  That was related to the background misery of life. Even when the theology of retribution was dominant civilised man protested against the barbarism of execution.  The poet, Alexander Pope, who lived in an age in which the range of offences for which capital punishment was meted out became even more extensive than in earlier periods, remarked caustically:</P>
    <P>The hungry judges soon the sentences do sign.</P>
    <P>And wretches hang that jury men may dine.</P>
    <P>That measures, very succinctly, the cheapness with which human life was regarded in his day.</P>
    <P>It is still a great tribute to the humanity of ordinary people that juries even circumvented the law which would have wretches hang for the theft of 40 shillings worth of goods from a store by stubbornly maintaining that the goods stolen, no matter how objectively they were assessed, were in their view only worth 39 shillings.  This kind of circumvention was being practised in the cause of humanity before Governments moved on the matter.</P>
    <P>The development of the abolition of <Col N="242" /> public executions has particular interest for students of Irish history because the last person in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to be publicly executed was Michael Barrett in 1868 who was accused in connection with the bungled liberation of prisoners attempt in Clerkenwell Prison.  Some people accuse abolitionists today of being &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; liberals and of taking all these things in their stride, being against capital punishment, being for divorce and so on, but opposition to capital punishment is far from a modern development.</P>
    <P>It is of some interest that in the year 1841 the State Assembly of New York set up a special sub-committee to consider the matter of capital punishment which recommended that it be abolished <i>in toto.</i> Obviously these were premature voices striving for expression.  The Royal Commission, which abolished public executions in England &mdash; Michael Barrett's in 1868 was the last &mdash; had a minority report recommending the total abolition of capital punishment.  Within a century of Alexander Pope's mordant comment on the cheapness of human life there was indeed considerable development.</P>
    <P>The debate has continued, sometimes two steps forward, one step backward, into our day with distinctions being drawn, for example, between the fact that civilians should not be put to death but that, perhaps, capital punishment was understandable in the military sphere.  Even more compassionate distinctions have been brought in, such as the new category of infanticide in 1922 in Britain which recognised that a young mother who killed her child in a particular fit of depression could not be possibly classed as a murderer.  The distinction which at present obtains in the State is another kind of milestone on the road to final abolition.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide scope for arguments about the rights and wrongs of capital punishment.  We are now down to the particular business of deciding if we should abolish this last category of special murder.  Nonetheless, it is not irrelevant to recall that many of the arguments <Col N="243" /> we have heard today and will continue to hear have been repeatedly aired in various assemblies in various public fora all over the world for the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>One point put forward by total abolitionists is the total dogmatic certainty and finality of execution.  It is the one punishment in law that cannot be reversed.  It is irrevocable and, therefore, it should be ensured that the person to be executed is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, guilty.  In the nature of things that cannot be established. Perhaps one of the greatest arguments against capital punishment is the possibility of the miscarriage of justice, the possibility that in addition to the atrocities of judicial execution the sufferer may be, in the end, innocent.</P>
    <P>There have been reviews and surveys of various executions, 30 and 40 years afterwards, in the United States and it has been established that a sizeable percentage &mdash; the figure is debatable &mdash; of the people executed have been innocent. Some people would say it is sufficient argument against capital punishment that even one innocent person should have suffered wrongly and that in the scale of moral values it is considerably more immoral for the State to execute one innocent person than for a number of innocent victims to fall to the hands of murderers.</P>
    <P>The other arguments against capital punishment are fast becoming obsolete. I do not think anyone would seriously argue the retributive or justice aspect of capital punishment would seriously contend that it is right in the name of justice and in the name of retribution that the State should take a life for a life.  If you were arguing in that case, you could get a fair amount of support from religious sources but to fall back on holy writ or religious tradition is a very doubtful expedient for anyone wishing to argue for the abolition of capital punishment.  People could argue, as they did in ancient Rome, that because life is sacred that is precisely why you should underline it by putting the murderer to death.  The Romans held the maxim, <i>Homo homini res sacra</i>, man is <Col N="244" /> a sacred thing to man, and that therefore the unique and terrible punishment of death should be reserved for murder.  By and large, these are now academic matters. The great argument is whether or not capital punishment is a deterrent, whether it has been a deterrent in general for murder over the centuries and whether in this last special category which we are talking about today it is a deterrent there.</P>
    <P>The answer to the first question must remain inconclusive, namely, that no one can finally and dogmatically assert that capital punishment has been a deterrent. Like Senator Hussey, I might have a different view if it could be shown substantially that the gallows has prevented more people from being killed, has on balance saved lives, but there is certainly no way in which that can be demonstratively proved.  The statistics as usual can be manipulated.  Nevertheless, there are some interesting results of research available. May I point to the United States, which is the most interesting model in what we are discussing since there is a common community in the United States of America but there are individual states with different laws on capital punishment, so that there is a great opportunity of comparing states side by side and their different practices?</P>
    <P>One interesting point is that in 1917 the Government of the State of Missouri abolished the death penalty but restored it two years later in 1919 believing that its abolition had been a mistake.  Murders increased over the two-year period and, therefore, the governmental powers in Missouri decided that they should restore the death penalty.  Later on a comparative survey was done of the homocide rate in Missouri from 1910 to 1924 and compared with Ohio, which had retained the death penalty throughout the whole period and the figures were approximately the same.  The rise in the homocide rate in Missouri over that two-year period was not in the end shown to be an actual result of the abolition of the death penalty. As far as I am aware, any measurements that have been done in European states to test the &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo;<Col N="245" /> homocide rates show no perceptible effect of the abolition of capital punishment. In my view the deterrent argument is not such as to come down firmly on one side or the other.</P>
    <P>May I revert briefly to the theme of the innocent person which I raised some moments ago, when I said that the dreadful thing is that an innocent person may suffer and the state will be culpable of judicial execution, of a miscarriage of justice, of an innocent person?  The possibility of that happening is greater in a Special Criminal Court than it is through trial by jury.  I may be wrong but I put my trust in the common man more than I do in learned counsel, no matter how learned.  The particular alignment of forces in the Special Criminal Court, the understandable identity of interests between the bench and the law, leads us to the speculation that the possibility of a miscarriage of justice may be greater in the Special Criminal Court than in an ordinary trial by jury.  Since we are likely to be stuck with the Special Criminal Court for some considerable time to come, that is an important consideration to keep in mind here.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Ryan's reservations, because this is a grave and complex business and it behoves all of us to do some reflecting and perhaps a little personal research before we make up our minds or speak on this matter.  At the same time, he did not really crystallise or pinpoint his objections.  He said we have in effect a state of revolution or emergency here all the time and this is not the period to be considering dropping the measure of capital punishment that remains.  He could put it the other way around, that it is really quite a remarkable thing that so few members of our security forces have been murdered in the past 10 or twelve turbulent years.  If it had been the case that our gardaí were being murdered at an alarming rate than I think Senator Ryan might have had a case.  This is not to express anything but the most profound sympathy with the families of the gardaí who gave their lives for the State in the course of their duty.  I do not believe that the state of revolution or emergency is such as to warrant the retention <Col N="246" /> of capital punishment under the present law.</P>
    <P>If we pass this Bill we have to consider very seriously the question: will it put our gardaí and our prison officers at greater risk?  These are the categories who are most important.  While maintaining that all human life is equally sacred, nevertheless we have a special duty to our security officers in this respect.  In trying to answer the question, will it put their lives at greater risk, one of the factors to be kept in mind is that much of the murderous activity in this country at the moment is politically motivated &mdash; not all of it of course, but much of it &mdash; and I do not think that politically motivated criminals are deterred by the death penalty. They may be deterred by the high risk of detection and conviction but I do not think the actual prospect of suffering capital punishment has ever really disturbed the politically motivated criminal, or in the past ages the patriot.  &ldquo;Whether on the scaffold high or on the battle field we die,&rdquo; would be their motto.</P>
    <P>One of the lessons of the tragic hunger strike is that men who are prepared to give their lives for a cause are the comrades of other men who are equally prepared to kill for a cause.  The members of these organisations are not the kind of people to be deterred by the presence on the Statute Book of the capital punishment measure.</P>
    <P>Reverend Ian Paisley has repeatedly called for the introduction of the death penalty to combat terrorism in Northern Ireland.  As Senator Gemma Hussey has said, the authorities have not responded to the call.  Reverend Ian Paisley would have less difficulty than Senator Eoin Ryan has and that we all have about this great question, because he would have no hesitation in invoking an Old Testament God to justify capital punishment &mdash;&ldquo;Revenge is mine&rdquo; says the Lord.  It is only speculation, of course, but if capital punishment had been in operation in Northern Ireland since 1969 my guess is that the situation would be far worse and that the political martyrology of the Provisional IRA and similar organisations would have soared and would have been enhanced in prestige by the number of <Col N="247" /> new martyrs created.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator Hussey's plea to the Minister that the Garda must be given every assistance possible, crime detection technology and anything that will increase their protection, but like Senator Hussey I am not convinced that the death penalty is necessary for their protection or that it protects them any more than its removal would.  Ultimately, the greatest protection of the Garda Síochána is, of course, that they enjoy public support, that they are a popular force.  That is expressed in the universal odium and revulsion expressed whenever a garda is murdered in the course of his duty.  That universal odium was expressed very salutarily after the Ballsbridge riots, a turning point in a certain dangerous trend.  I can understand the fears of the guards and the prison officers &mdash; perhaps the prison officers more than the guards &mdash; because you could take the view that someone sentenced to life imprisonment knows that under the law he has no need to fear destiny and there is no incentive or motivation for that person in prison to behave or not to carry his animus against prison warders to the most alarming extent.  One could argue that the prison officers are at risk in that regard.  Nevertheless, one takes comfort, I suppose, from the fact that under the existing law and existing circumstances, as far as I know, despite a number of quite alarming riots no prison officer has been killed in the performance of his duty.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty I have about the special category status obtaining at the moment or, indeed, the special category status that would continue to obtain in respect of such a lengthy prison sentence is, does it make a moral distinction between the value of one life and another?  Does not the sacredness of human life reside in each individual, whether he is a garda or a prison officer or a misfortunate drunken tramp who is mugged and killed?  There is a real moral difficulty there.</P>
    <P>Whatever protection the guards and the prison officers might derive from an operative death penalty, and that is, as I <Col N="248" /> have suggested, doubtful, in my view they derive none at all from a non-operative death penalty.  The fact is that capital punishment under 1964 law is not operative, it is a dead letter and we all know it.  The public know it and the criminals know it as well, because they know that on every occasion on which there was the slightest prospect of a convicted murderer being actually put to death, there was in recent times a public outcry. That public outcry is sufficient to ensure that whether this Bill is passed within the foreseeable future there is no prospect of an execution for murder.  And that being so, what happens then through a curious but understandable process of public opinion is that the convicted person or persons become the objects of sympathy in the interval between their conviction and the time when the President is directed by the Government to invoke clemency.  This has happened in the case of a certain couple who were the object of great solicitude by various civil rights groups and so on.  Surely, this defeats the whole purpose of the law whereby the criminal should be held up to public odium for his activities.  If we have more of these cases and more of these convictions, especially if they have a gloss of respectability about them, those people are going to be the objects of public sympathy rather than the opposite.  These arguments are very strong ones indeed for ending the present situation and substituting something new, certainly the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
    <P>I an not so sure about the statutory minimum 40 years prison sentence.  One of the questions I had pencilled down to ask the Minister, which is not evident either in the Bill or in the explanatory memorandum, is the question of remission. The extent of remission here is vital. If a man knows that he is going to serve 40 years with a maximum of ten years remission &mdash; that is 30 years &mdash; that is indeed, I agree, a fairly considerable sentence, even more so because I take it that it is up to the trial judge to impose in certain circumstances, if he considers fit, a longer sentence &mdash; 40 years is the minimum. But the difficulty I have relates to the conditions of detention of those <Col N="249" /> people.  A young man of, say, 25, will know that he will have to do an absolute minimum of 30 years even though he may undergo a change of heart.</P>
    <P>Assuming he is not a totally psychotic murderer, rehabilitation is possible and should be worked for by society.  It seems that the imposition of a long sentence which is not liable to be revised is at odds somehow with modern trends in penology and with the ever-increasing attitude to try to rehabilitate the prisoner.  I can see no other reason for the inclusion of the 40 year sentence except as a concession to a particular kind of pressure from the Garda and the Prison Officers' Associations. I am just making a comment on that in passing.  I pass no judgment either way.  It seems to me that we are engaging in a little piece of self-deception here. The 40 year rule will be amended before long.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech the Minister gave simple but convincing reasons why we should abolish the death penalty, no matter what we think of the other clauses in the Bill.  I should like to add my voice to his in that respect.  It seems to me that he was perfectly right to stress the symbolic nature of this Bill against the backdrop of our history, much of which was violent.  I refer to incidents like the placing of the shrunken skulls of alleged malefactors in the courthouse in my own town of Macroom to deter people from any further political subversion and what might be called the first ambush at Kilmichael in 1822 when a small group of peasants had the temerity to attack a detachment of infantry.  For their pains they were eventually executed and their bodies displayed, not in the execution grounds in Cork city, but in their home townlands around Kilmichael.</P>
    <P>Against that national history of violence and oppression, and against the global history of man's inhumanity to man, it is right that we should take this step, particularly in view of our professions about peace which we express elsewhere on the world stage.  Peace has to be peace, and non-violence has to be a kind of seamless robe, and respect for life has to be a seamless robe.  If one is repealled by abortion, by euthanasia, one <Col N="250" /> must be totally repelled by capital punishment. As the Minister suggested, it is against the violence in Northern Ireland that we should assert our own respect for life; not alone assert it against those people who carry out terrible acts in our name, but also against the sectarian gangs on the Protestant side who, the evidence suggests, are once again at their terrible work in Northern Ireland at this time.</P>
    <P>There is the wider global stage.  Every day we of the western tradition, I suppose you could call it, are revolted by what is happening, by the brutal regimes in El Salvador and, under strange and terrible cultures to our way of life, in places like Iran where executions are the terrible order of the day.  It is a very good thing that we should have the mind, the resolution and the compassion to undertake, as the Minister said, this symbolic act.  It never made any sense to me that, in order to show our abhorrence of killing, we ourselves should proceed to kill, which is what capital punishment is.  To a small degree we lessen the burden of our own guilt and the guilt of humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the most basic human right of all, the right to life.  It proposes that we deprive ourselves of the existing power to kill in the name of the people a person convicted of an offence described as a capital offence.  I put it in that context because it will be seen as a very unusual measure.  The Minister comes into the House to ask the House to deprive the State of a power and, by doing so, to affirm what I believe is a most important moral truth one we must reflect on and consider very fully in this House.  The issue itself is a very grave one.  It raises deep concern and, indeed, considerable fear in the country and in particular in those who feel they might be more vulnerable or less protected if this measure were passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we make clear the context in which this measure is proposed and what it intends to do in a very basic and essential way.  The issue is a moral one and, as such, it must be considered in the context of the value of human life <Col N="251" /> and of an affirmation of that value.  As has already been mentioned, the power of which we are proposing to deprive ourselves has not been exercised in recent years.  It has not been exercised since 1954.  I agree with Senator Murphy &mdash; and Senator Hussey made this point too &mdash; that it is a power which we would not be likely to exercise even if it remained on the Statute Book.  When it came to the point we would realise the tension and pressure caused, and the revulsion in the minds and hearts of people at the idea of a premeditated, cold, legal killing of a human being as the penalty for conviction of an offence.</P>
    <P>This is a question and an issue which other countries have faced.  Most recently, the new socialist Government in France abolished the guillotine which was the French form of capital punishment. As the first Labour speaker on this Bill, I should like to remind the House that the abolition of capital punishment has been a long and dearly held policy of the Labour Party.  It formed a very important part of the Labour Party's approach to law reform.  For that reason it was a welcome part of the programme adopted in the Gaiety Theatre discussions prior to the establishment of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>As Senator Hussey said, it has also been championed down the years by a number of public bodies.  I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work done by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  I recall the early meetings of the council when it was established and, in particular, a public meeting in 1976 where the arguments for abolishing capital punishment were put before the people in a very public and educational sense.  At the start of this year a further campaign was launched, this time jointly by The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and The Prisoners' Rights Organisation.  It is timely to pay tribute to the work done by these bodies.  We must not assume that there is an automatic sensitivity to, or knowledge of, human rights issues.</P>
    <P>We neglect in a public sense in Ireland a concern for education about establishing <Col N="252" /> the values relating to human rights. In a facile way we sometimes talk about human rights.  But I believe we do not do enough to educate, in a structured and considerate way, to provide a basic framework of reference in which people can relate the need for a concern to protect and promote human rights.  I was very struck only last Saturday when, at the invitation of Amnesty International, I participated in a workshop for school children on human rights in which this issue of capital punishment was raised. Afterwards, at an informal tea, a number of these young people spoke about the lack of any information or education about human rights in the schools system. They said that nowhere in the education process do they get an opportunity to discuss human rights issues, even to know their rights, to know what rights they have, for example, if they are stopped and questioned by members of the Garda.  This is a serious lack and one which results in our concern for human rights being sporadic and unrelated to an overall framework and context.</P>

      <P>I was drawing my remarks to a conclusion on Friday last when the House adjourned so I will not detain the House much longer.  I do not think this an appropriate time to complain about the secretarial facilities of the Independents in the House.  But, as an Independent, I feel that I have one great handicap, that is, I seem to be the only person in this House who does not have a hot line to Wolfe Tone.  Wolfe Tone died 183 years ago.  Yet, to my mind, in this debate he has been used and spoken about more on the issue of constitutional and legislative review than anybody else.  He seems to have been used on both sides and to have issued an enormous amount of contradictory statements.  I was disappointed when I received this pamphlet this morning &mdash; the official transcript of the Taoiseach's interview &mdash; after his remarks last week when he said that he would try not to invoke the names of the patriot dead of Ireland again because he agreed it was a bad idea to find that, at the back of it, we had again Tone and Davis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the weekend, at an unveiling cermony of a memorial to Eamon de <Col N="254" /> Valera, I counted, in one newspaper report, the use of the names of de Valera, Daniel O'Connell, the Fenians, Parnell, Wolfe Tone, Thomas Davis and, an unlikely recruit to the cause, Michael Collins &mdash; all used in opposition to the crusade of the Taoiseach.  It is a pity that the politicians &mdash; especially Fianna Fáil over the weekend &mdash; have taken such a divisive and rather depressing attitude to this issue.  There ought to be very little difficulty about all-party agreement on this.  Both the major parties and Labour seem to have a common aspiration.  As I understand it, all the Taoiseach is asking is not at this stage abolition of Articles 2 and 3, which I favour, but a change in Articles 2 and 3 which will express an aspiration the major parties on both sides seem to share.  I cannot understand why the Opposition in this case do not take a responsible attitude and agree to sit down at the table, as they did in 1967, and come up with a formula which would be easy enough for them and which would express an aspiration to unity.</P>
    <P>When I was concluding my remarks last week I was tackling the problem of extradition.  I hope, when the Minister comes to sum up on this problem, that he will not duck the problem of extradition. I was addressing myself to the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act which was introduced as a result of the Sunningdale meetings in 1973.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act was a recognition of the problem which exists with cross-Border incursions.  It was a recognition of the problem that we undoubtedly have in our midst people who have committed terrorist offences over the Border and are now walking free in the Republic.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act has been a failure.  There is no doubt whatsoever about that.  The prosecutions under it have not successfully brought to justice the people it was meant to bring to justice. Where the blame for that lies I am not particularly interested.  What is important is that the problem has been recognised, an attempt has been made to solve it and it has failed.  If that is the case I believe then the law is at fault.  It has not succeeded in apprehending and convicting those it was set up to counteract.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> It should now be repealed and be replaced by an effective and convincing means of ensuring extradition back to Northern Ireland of those people wanted for crimes committed there.</P>
    <P>If the Government recognise the problem &mdash; the Coalition Government did in 1973 and the Opposition here, although they made scant use of the Act, also recognised it during their period in power &mdash; they should tackle it and not funk it. It is a very thorny problem.  I recognise that it is a very difficult one and I recognise also the inherent legal problems.  We still have a problem of terrorists coming over the Border into the Republic being free from justice in respect of crimes they have committed in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is very important because, while in the eyes of the moderate Northern majority, Articles 2 and 3 are a vital gesture and a prerequisite to good neighbourliness, the problem of extradition is a tangible one.  They believe that we are responsible for harbouring people who actually commit murder in their area. What they see as hard evidence of our ambiguous fellow-travelling attitude to the terrorists would be gone if we could do something concrete about this.  I believe firmly that if we acted to ensure extradition we would see overnight a dramatic transformation in the attitude of the majority in Northern Ireland towards us.  The extremists would not be impressed but the vanguard of moderates would undoubtedly respond.</P>
    <P>Already the Alliance Party, who are, I gather, coming down to see Senator Dooge tomorrow &mdash; this is a party that support the Union, have significant support in Northern Ireland and should not be dismissed &mdash; have issued an unqualified welcome for the Taoiseach's statement. This is significant and should be noted by the House.  The Unionist Party have been strangely less welcoming for a policy they have always demanded.  Of course, this can be explained by their fear of losing ground to the extremists on the Unionist side by welcoming anything at all that comes from us.  If we show the will to pursue the necessary amendments to our Constitution and laws, this will <Col N="256" /> change; and, as our goodwill becomes more evident, the extremists on both sides will become more isolated.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks and the views expressed by him &mdash; and I shall be voting in favour of this motion &mdash; I should like to question, and no more at this stage, a fundamental objective of unity which appears to be the purpose of constitutional and legislative review.  I think it was Senator Murphy who said last week that there was no underlying or overriding reason why the island of Ireland should be a unit.  It is a very neat idea, a neat geographical unit, but I do not see any absolutely fundamental reason why there ought to be unity.  I detect a growing feeling of this in the Republic as well.  I believe that the younger generation now believe that unity is no longer the unalterable priority it was.  Too much has been done in the name of unity at too great a cost to make it such a mythical attraction to this generation as it was to the last.  There are many idealistic aims of equal importance in the public mind: the creation of a liberal, just, non-sectarian society here; the fight against poverty and unemployment; the solution of the housing crisis; and the development of industry with its resultant prosperity for all our people.  Besides these aims I believe that perhaps the impulse towards unity is beginning to fade.  Perhaps at last reality is beginning to take over from mythology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blennerhassett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this motion but after listening to what was said last week on both sides of the House, it is my duty to speak on this occasion.  I happen to be a member of the Protestant community living in the Republic.  The Taoiseach has brought before us something that is to be made available to Protestants both in the Twenty-six Counties and in the Six Counties. I as a Protestant living in the south of Ireland in the great Republican county of Kerry would classify myself as a Republican as well as any other person who was born and reared in the Republic of Ireland.  We sometimes are referred to as British and as Protestants living in the south of Ireland.  My family goes back as far as 1523 and came from England to <Col N="257" /> live in this country.  So I claim to be as Irish as anyone in this country.</P>
      <P>I believe people are under the impression that the Protestants in the south of Ireland are downtrodden and discriminated against completely.  Down the years I have been active in politics since I was a teenager.  No one has ever done me an injustice at any time.  The first election I ever contested happened to be for chairman of a trade union.  On that occasion I had to defeat my fellow trade unionist, a Catholic.  I was proud when I was elected chairman.  That was exactly 15 years ago and I am still chairman of that union in my own town.  I have never felt discriminated against in the south of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1972, six years later, I was appointed a member of the national executive of the same union and that union today is the second strongest in the Republic.  In 1967 for the Fine Gael Party I contested a Tralee Urban Council election.  Never before, since the foundation of the State, had there been a Protestant elected on behalf of a political party.  There was a Protestant elected as an Independent.  I happened to be the first person and I have been elected to Tralee Urban Council on three different occasions, heading the poll for my party on each occasion.  When I contested the Kerry County Council election I was elected on two different occasions.</P>
      <P>As regards this House, you could say on the first occasion, eight years ago, I came in by the back door.  I was appointed by the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave.  In 1977 my name went forward and I had to go around the country as many other Senators here had to.  All of us know what it is to do this long journey around the Twenty-six Counties.  In 1977 many people thought that it would be impossible for a Protestant from the south of Ireland to be elected to Seanad Éireann.  On that occasion everyone I met helped me in every way possible. Never was I asked what religion I belonged to.  I was elected to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just a few weeks ago the same thing happened and I was told by several different people that the odds were against <Col N="258" /> me.  I never feel I have odds against me and I knew on this occasion that my chances of coming back to this House were pretty good.  As far as the Protestants in the South are concerned, it is up to every person to pull his weight and work where he is earning his livelihood in the Republic.  If we had many more Protestants who were willing to let their names go forward and contested local elections, Seanad elections and Dáil elections I believe we would have more of them in this House and in the other House.</P>
    <P>We could possibly spend days speaking about our Constitution.  The Taoiseach has asked us to review what can be improved so that we may be able to have better relationships with our own people here in the South and then with our Northern brethren.  A few things baffle me.  Senator Ryan spoke the other day about minority communities and referred to the poorer sections of our people.  I am not going to speak about the minority Churches but rather on what Catholics are a bit confused about just as I am.  One matter is Article 41 of the Constitution. Quite a few annulments have taken place in the Republic since 1977.  There were 109 in 1977.  Everyone is confused.  I find it very hard to accept that if I am the father of four or five children, I can think if I happen to be a Catholic that my marriage never took place.  If this is so, the children in that family would be classified as illegitimate.  About 20 per cent of the people who obtained annulments in that year were allowed to re-marry in the Catholic Church.  At that stage it becomes more confused because such a person who re-married in the Catholic Church can, if at all possible, produce another family.  At this stage we are more confused than ever.  The children of the second marriage are illegitimate according to our Constitution, so we find ourselves with one lot of children here and one lot of children there and all of them illegitimate.  This is very confusing.  The priests in the Catholic Church can be charged with carrying out those ceremonies, as also can the men and women concerned, but our Constitution and our laws seem to be protecting them.  It is <Col N="259" /> about time something was done to rectify the situation.  In England the Catholic Church will not annul a marriage unless the state has dissolved it first.</P>
    <P>In County Kerry, as in other places, there are wives with young children but whose husbands have left them.  We also have, of course, cases where the wives have left the men.  I have been speaking to quite a few people about this problem in the past few years.  In one case a young woman with three children was deserted seven or eight years ago and the husband cannot be found.  That woman cannot obtain a legal separation and neither can she have her marriage annulled, so the only alternative to living without a partner is for her to live in sin.  Do we not respect those people's rights or do they have any rights?  I believe it is about time that this minority of people &mdash; and possibly not so small a minority &mdash; are looked after.  If a person in such circumstances decides to live in sin, he or she is in an unfortunate situation so far as our laws are concerned.  The Constitution is not looking after them.  If, having decided to live in sin, such people produce families, these families are again illegitimate.  Are we ever going to do away with this ugly word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It is about time that we did something to alter Article 41.  There were changes from 1922 to 1937.  In 1937 Éamon de Valera decided that we needed a change, but 44 years later we find ourselves here today debating the matter.  There was an attempt by the late Seán Lemass in 1967, when he set up an all-party committee to deal with this question, and I give him credit for what he was trying to do.</P>
    <P>If we do not legislate for the younger generation they will do their own thing. What I mean by &ldquo;doing their own thing&rdquo; is that we will not have marriages such as we had in the past.  They will live as they like, and where does this leave us?  It leaves us in a situation of not making any provision in our laws for illegitimate children. If we do not cater for them, all churches may find themselves in a predicament because the younger generation will not be going to the churches.  It is very difficult for a woman to rear a <Col N="260" /> family single handed.  She must depend solely on what she gets from the State. The people opposite must be aware of the problems about which I am speaking. I hope that in the near future an all-party committee can be set up to look into these matters.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few comments on behalf of Fianna Fáil regarding the Taoiseach's speech to the Seanad last Friday.  It was the third version we now have of his views on the Constitution.  First, we had the original broadcast which, importantly, was heard by the nation.  It is this we have been asked to approve in the Government's motion.  Then we had the booklet which was circulated to Senators but which omits the aspersions on de Valera's reputation and the partisan attacks on Fianna Fáil.  Finally, we have the Taoiseach's speech, which withdraws or softens many of the things said in the previous two versions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has partially retracted some of the elements in his broadcast, those elements which caused enormous offence to Irishmen and women at home and abroad. We welcome his retraction on some of the aspersions he cast on the memory of de Valera and his retraction of the description of this State as sectarian, though he still claims there are sectarian provisions in the Constitution.  We welcome his recognition that he was also really attacking his own party's record and traditions, which on at least a couple of occasions caused real scandal and we welcome his recognition that we as a people have nothing to be ashamed of. We also welcome his acknowledgement, for the first time, of the breakthrough achieved by Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach in the Anglo-Irish talks.  We might, of course, have wished that he had gone further still, but we note that he admits that he did not express himself with the objectivity he would have desired during his <i>ex tempore</i> broadcast.  Therefore, in view of the fact that he has retracted or modified a significant part of what he said &mdash; and, indeed, the Government Information Services have produced a partially <Col N="261" /> expurgated edition of his remarks &mdash; we feel that the Government motion which calls on the Seanad to approve the views expressed in his broadcast should be withdrawn as no longer appropriate. The Seanad motion no longer makes sense as it stands.</P>
    <P>If I may turn to one or two points I would like to point to some fundamental contradictions in the arguments of the Taoiseach and his supporters.  It is now apparent that the real purpose of the Taoiseach's crusade is not to win over the Unionists at all but to induce the British to put the constitutional guarantee on the table and thus to pressure the Unionists. If this is the intention then the Taoiseach is engaged in a dishonest and almost certainly ineffectual manoeuvre.  Fianna Fáil have always stated openly and honestly that the British guarantee should be removed.  That way the Unionists know clearly where they stand in relation to us.  If the effect of changing Articles 2 and 3 is to recognise the validity and legitimacy of Partition and of the Northern Ireland state, what reasonable argument can be put forward for asking the British to modify the guarantee which underpins the majority in Northern Ireland?  The British might ask the Unionists to be more reasonable <i>vis-à-vis</i> the minority and the neighbouring state, once the Unionist position had been so strengthened, but they would be very unlikely to go further or to take sanctions against the Unionists if they did not comply.</P>
    <P>The second contradiction comes where in one passage the Taoiseach says the Constitution is imbued with a specifically Catholic ethos &mdash; that implies that the Constitution is saturated with this Catholic ethos &mdash; but in another passage in the same statement the Taoiseach says that the sectarian elements in the Constitution amount in effect to only 5 per cent of that document.  However, there is clearly an enormous amount of confusion in the way in which the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; is interpreted.  &ldquo;Sectarian&rdquo; in most peoples' minds means actions or laws which reflect a narrow, dogmatic ethos <Col N="262" /> which discriminates against all those who do not share it.  This is a definition that the Taoiseach would appear to share and I was particularly interested to hear Senator Blennerhassett's contribution in which he underlined that he had not encountered discrimination as a Protestant living in the South.  It will come as a surprise to most people to learn that Article 45 &mdash; Directive Principles of Social Policy &mdash; which contains such clauses as the state pledges itself to safeguard with especial care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community, in fact reflects Catholic social thinking of a certain period.  This does not make Article 45 discriminatory or in any way detract from its validity. The American Constitution is based on an eighteenth century ethos but that does not automatically invalidate it today, far from it.  We do not have to be ashamed of any taint of Catholic or Christian influence. We can, in fact, be proud of it.</P>
    <P>On education the Taoiseach seems to be at a loss to understand exactly how the Constitution is supposed to be sectarian since in matters of education there has not been discrimination against the Protestant minority.  They have been assisted in maintaining their own schools and institutions sometimes to a point which amounts to discrimination in their favour.</P>
    <P>This effectively leaves the sub-article on divorce.  It is difficult for anyone to argue that the ban on divorce discriminates against people of the Protestant faith when the principal Protestant denomination in this part of the island do not themselves recognise divorce for purposes of re-marriage in church.  The ban on divorce affects all citizens, not just Protestants, and the arguments for and against change are not being conducted on sectarian lines, so politicians should not conduct them on these lines either.</P>
    <P>The third contradiction is the Taoiseach's proposal that the Dáil should legislate as if for the whole island, having first removed from the Constitution its actual right to do so.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil would draw the attention of the House to the way in which the Taoiseach is shifting his ground.  His <Col N="263" /> broadcast is already out of tune with his latest thinking and apparently it is no longer the Northern Unionists he is appealing to but the British to put pressure on the Unionists, for which he criticised Fianna Fáil a short time earlier. This lack of consistency of approach is the reason why Fianna Fáil have put down their amendment appealing to certain clear, fixed principles.  If we trade those in for others superficially more attractive to some, we will soon find ourselves in a complicated mess of our own making and without any clear directive, principles or guidelines.</P>

      <P>The case for reform of the Constitution is a very valuable exercise which can be wasted if we devote too much time and energy to Articles 2 and 3.  The case for reform in other Articles will fall and a golden opportunity will be lost if this debate were to centre around those two Articles.  Fifteen years ago Seán Lemass set up an informal all party committee to review the Constitution. He thought that the Constitution was in need of review.  How much more is it in need of review in 1981?  Deputy Haughey and his party consider the present Constitution the next best thing to the Ten Commandments as handed down by Moses.  Is this the great and noble document that Fianna Fáil say it is?  Clearly Seán Lemass did not think so when he set out to review it.</P>
      <P>Since 1937 the world has undergone fundamental change.  We have seen a world war, man has travelled in outer space and has set foot on the moon.  Our way of life has changed dramatically.  This country has become a young people's land.  Our schools are now highly competitive. Inner city life has broken down and violence has become a way of life. Distress is reflected in the breakdown of many marriages today and it threatens the very fabric of the society we live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim report of 1967 signed by Seán Lemass suggested that Article 3 be amended to make it less offensive to the people of the North of Ireland and to reflect the true position more accurately. If we believe in unity of this isle and its <Col N="264" /> people by peaceful means and by consent, how can we claim in our Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over people in the North of Ireland?  The first 39 Articles, with some limited exceptions, deal with matters that should never have been in the Constitution in the first place. There is a lot of padding in it.  Some of the provisions are necessary to define the role of Government and so on, but there is a great deal of what is unnecessary and useless for the needs of modern Ireland. Section 40 deals with personal rights &mdash; the rights of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association. These personal rights are too qualified and, were it not for the liberal decisions of our courts under judges like the late President Ó Dálaigh, they would mean very little.  The Constitution should be specific.  It should not rely on the interpretation of the courts.</P>
    <P>The child law section of the Constitution caused major difficulties in the area of child welfare which affected adoptive parents, children's social workers and institutions for children.  In the area of industrial relations the rights of public servants should be protected and enshrined in the Constitution.  Article 41. 1. and 2. would be deemed offensive to working wives as many women are forced, for economic necessity, to take employment.  Article 41. 3.2º says that &ldquo;No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage&rdquo;. This is completely unacceptable in modern Ireland.  Every social worker, every solicitor and anyone who deals with personal problems could personally testify to the breakdown of marriage, to the appalling human problems created without assistance from the law or the Constitution. Have these unfortunate people no constitutional rights?  Deputy Haughey, in his speech in Ennis on Sunday, claimed that Éamon de Valera would urge us now to create a just, compassionate and tolerant society.  Is there justice when the wealthy of this land can obtain a divorce by changing domicile? There is still a law for the rich and a law for the poor.  How can the Church grant so many annulments and the State remain unmoved in this respect?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> In the section on education many of the provisions seem far removed from the present day Ireland and prospects for the planned economy, for the common good are made secondary to the so-called rights of public property.  It is generally recognised that the Article on private property is too heavily weighted in favour of the rights of private property.  The difficulty in implementing the provisions of the Kenny Report is testament to this. There are two options open in a re-written Constitution.  There is need for a statement to include the rights that exist with the possibility of a new social and economic right &mdash; for example, the right of women, the right to work and the right to literacy.</P>
    <P>Dr. Sheehy-Skeffington, in his open letter to Thomas McDonagh, said: &ldquo;To achieve any purpose one must internally train and discipline one's self&rdquo;.  If we are to obtain a just society we must examine ourselves, we must not get carried away by words when action is needed.  I come from Newbridge where the labour exchange is not large enough to cater for the queues of unemployed.  In County Kildare we have 2,000 families in need of housing.  Some of these are young married couples who live in caravans with no water and no sewerage on rat-infested sites.  Many of our young people have no hope of employment and are destined to walk the streets and make places like Loughan House a continued reality.  Ask these people about the changes in the Constitution and they will answer that unless the spirit of the law is upheld, unless they can have employment, enough to eat and a house to live in, this debate will become meaningless.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in addressing this House last week, stated that the issues before us were no less than the identity, the hopes and the destiny of our people.  It should not be forgotten, in the light of these sentiments, that we are being asked to note with approval the comments the Taoiseach made on the radio on September 27 last.  In those comments the Taoiseach said that Articles 2 <Col N="266" /> and 3 of the Constitution should be deleted.  He accused us of having divided this island and he branded this State as being sectarian.  The only specific items raised in the course of the Taoiseach's speech here were Articles 2 and 3, Article 41, dealing with divorce and Article 45, which is concerned with principles of social policy which are not binding on the Oireachtas or the courts.</P>
      <P>I am suspicious of the Taoiseach's motives in raising these specific issues at this time.  Almost a decade ago the Taoiseach was the author of a book entitled <i>Towards a New Ireland.</i> An entire chapter in that book was devoted to changes in the Republic that were desirable.  Summing up that chapter the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Summing up the specific steps that might usefully be taken in the Republic at this stage as an earnest wish of its people to seek a reunification of the country in terms that could be acceptable to Northern Protestants, the changes that seem to be most needed are the repeal by referendum of the constitutional provisions on the special position of the Catholic Church and divorce; amendment of the law banning the import and sale of contraceptives; a modification of the system of dealing with obscene printed matter, substituting a new version of the older system of control by prosecution for the existing censorship system and the removal of Irish language requirements in examinations and in recruitment for, and promotion within the public service.</P>
      <P>Many of these reforms have been carried out already and there is no mention whatsoever in that chapter, or in that book, of Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in the six counties of Northern Ireland are Irish, not because of Articles 2 and 3 but because it is their birthright.  The majority of those people are proud to be Irish and many of them aspire to being governed by their fellow countrymen in a just and humane fashion. I believe that Articles 2 and 3 do no more than assert the moral right of the people of the thirty-two counties to govern themselves and I am not going to <Col N="267" /> renounce that right.  When the Taoiseach stated that we somehow partitioned this country, he was wrong and acting in a mischievous and ill-considered fashion. Partition is a direct result of the decision of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to opt out of the Irish Free State.  They took that decision under Article 12 of the Treaty and it was that which caused Partition and not any act or attitude adopted in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>It has long been the belief of Fianna Fáil that Ireland is one nation and that nation has a moral right to self-determination and self-government.  As long ago as 1918, Éamon de Valera stated the views that Fianna Fáil still believe when he said:</P>
    <P>Judged by every criterion of nationhood, Ireland is a nation &mdash; one of the oldest in Christendom &mdash; with geographical boundaries clearly delimited and defined, and with a tradition, history, language, culture and a characteristic national consciousness of its own.</P>
    <P>That is the belief of the great majority of people on this island.  Fianna Fáil are determined to achieve that aim by peaceful means.  Discussions were started between the two sovereign Governments in London and Dublin so that Irish people might be peacefully united by consent. We now face the situation that the Taoiseach's outburst suggests that his Government are submitting that many of our fellow countrymen should be disowned by Dublin.  Have any of the consequences of this unpremediated outburst been thought about?  Are the proud people of the land of O'Neill and O'Donnell to be denied the right to call themselves Irishmen?  Are they to be denied the right to carry Irish passports?</P>
    <P>I am suspicious of the motive behind this crusade and particularly suspicious of the fact that it was launched in a radio interview, amid accusations of sectarianism and partitionism, by the leader of a Government in the midst of an economic recession fuelled by their own monetarist policies.  If the Taoiseach wishes to launch a debate on sectarianism <Col N="268" /> and the Irish Constitution, he should put both issues in a suitable context.  He should have said that if the six Northern counties had a Constitution with personal rights provisions such as ours, the discrimination and oppression which have given rise to the present troubles would never have been allowed.  I reject the allegations of sectarianism at this stage. I reject the toned down allegation contained in the Taoiseach's Seanad speech that this State is constrained.  He has given ammunition to the enemies of Irish unity.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also spoke of divorce and the need for reform in the area of law.  He wrote:</P>
    <P>The making of such a constitutional change (the elimination of articles 41, 3 and 2) might suffice to meet Northern Protestant opinions on this matter, without going beyond this to introduce actual divorce legislation in the Republic,...</P>
    <P>Divorce should be looked at in the context of family law in general.  If the Taoiseach still believes that the ban on divorce should be removed from the Constitution but not legislated for in the Republic, he should say so.  I cannot find anything in Article 45 which would give rise to any allegation of sectarianism and I wish the Taoiseach had been more specific in his treatment of this Article.  It outlines worthy objectives and should not be changed merely for the sake of change.</P>
    <P>The motives behind this crusade or debate are suspect.  It was launched in a radio outburst and not before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a deplorable attempt to distract attention from the dismal state of the economy.  It will not work and I do not believe that the Irish people will be fooled by it.  I support this Constitution and condemn the damaging statements of the Taoiseach concerning sectarianism.  If the Taoiseach is serious about a crusade, let him lead one against the evils of unemployment and poverty. Let him lead a crusade against the plight of the elderly and infirm, grappling with inflation.  If there is to be a crusade, then let it be a meaningful one.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with other Members in congratulating the Cathaoirleach on his election and also the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I would ask the forbearance of the House if what I say and how I say it appears at times a little incoherent and stumbling.  This is for me a poignant moment.  I will not bore the House with personal details but merely say that for some of us the road to this House was a short and relatively easy road and for others it was not quite so short or as easy.  Apart from that, there is a great personal significance in this debate and in the motion before us in that in talking about the Constitution and the other matters which have been raised in this House on this debate we are emphasising the importance of that Constitution and also emphasising the importance of the Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Legislature, needless to say, has a certain importance since we are Members of it.  We live in a time and at a stage in the history of this community when constitutional democracy and the institutions which form part of that constitutional democracy are, frankly, under threat. They are under threat not only from those people who explicitly say that they wish to tear down these institutions and to replace them, presumably by a pile of rubble, but also from those people who lack faith in the ability of these institutions to cope with the problems of our society.  I hesitate to arouse the accusation that I might be too serious but we must remember that constitutional democracy is not something shared by everybody in all parts of this world at the present time.  It is a precious gift that was won for us, not just on one occasion or a <Col N="270" /> few occasions, not just briefly but by a very long and difficult struggle by our ancestors.  It is up to us to ensure that that gift is cherished and preserved.</P>
    <P>Consequently, we must admit to ourselves that we in this House, and particularly we in the Upper House who have read, over the summer and at various other times, allegations of the irrelevance of this institution, are on trial as an institution of politics and of government.  We are on trial here to see whether, in fact, we can confront the realities of our society and come up with answers and comments which are relevant and effective. We are on trial not only before the bar of History, but also before our contemporaries and, possibly with the exception of one or two of our colleagues, we are on trial before our young people.  When I say &ldquo;contemporaries&rdquo; I mean people of a certain age and respectability.</P>
    <P>Consequently, this debate must go a little further than just the contents of one small grey book, however important that small grey book may be, and I am glad to see other Members feel the same.  We must consider where we are going and how we are going to get there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this debate is an opportunity for us in this Assembly to consider where we are at the moment and where we are going.  It is something of a cliché to suggest that when we are involved in that kind of operation we should consider where we came from in the first place.  In order to understand where we are at the moment we must look at our past and consider what our past involves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of his very eloquent contribution to this debate Senator Murphy underlined some of the dangers of regarding history as a kind of holy writ and also the dangers of looking back or trying to look back and being selective in what we find there and what we reproduce. We in this country should be particularly careful and conscious of the dangers <Col N="271" /> of history since it is part of the tragedy of much of our recent history and also our less recent history that we have paid too much attention to the past and have been too selective.</P>
    <P>At least one speaker on the opposite side of the House referred to the fact that there had been little or no mention of Pearse from this side and what I intend to do briefly is to try to rectify that omission and, with the permission of the House, to read a couple of quotations from the collected works of Pádraig Pearse.  They are important quotations with which many of us may be familiar and in them there are the seeds of contemplation, things we should look at. There is also an illustration of the kind of danger we encounter when we pay too much attention not only to the past but to what has been said or written in the past.</P>
    <P>It is one of these significant things about the way in which we look at Pádraig Pearse and his contribution to Irish history that we concentrate mainly on what he contributed as a soldier and as a politician. We do not always think of Pearse as a politician, but a politician he undoubtedly was.  I, as a teacher, would take the view that Pearse was somebody of exceptional importance, certainly as a teacher, and I intend to quote a small part of his famous essay &ldquo;The Murder Machine&rdquo;.  If we had reached the stage that Pearse envisaged in his writings &mdash; and to a very large extent in his practice as a teacher &mdash; we would have much upon which to congratulate ourselves.  He wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>In our adoption of the standpoint here indicated there is involved a primary blunder as to the nature and functions of education.  For education has not to do with the manufacture of things, but with fostering the growth of things.  And the conditions we should strive to bring about in our education system are not the conditions favourable to the rapid and cheap manufacture of readymades, but the conditions favourable to the growth of living organisms &mdash; the liberty and the light <Col N="272" /> and the gladness of a ploughed field under the spring sunshine.</P>
    <P>Some may well feel that this is an idealistic view of education and that those of us who are familiar with the realities of the educational trenches know that education is not always quite like that.  But there are many teachers, parents and children who regard education in that light and if more of us did so our country would be not only happier but also more fruitful.</P>
    <P>I should also like to cite part of Pearse's essay entitled &ldquo;The Coming Revolution&rdquo;.  He wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>I am glad, then, that the North has &ldquo;begun&rdquo;.  I am glad that the Orangemen have armed, for it is a goodly thing to see arms in Irish hands.  I should like to see the A.O.H. armed.  I should like to see the Transport Workers armed. I should like to see any and every body of Irish citizens armed.  We must accustom ourselves to the thought of arms, the sight of arms, to the use of arms. We may make mistakes in the beginning and shoot the wrong people; but bloodshed is a cleansing and a sanctifying thing, and the nation which regards it as the final horror has lost its manhood.  There are many things more horrible than bloodshed; and slavery is one of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy warned us against the danger of asking what so-and-so would have thought or would have said.  There is a danger that we would ask what Pearse would have thought of the present time. What would Pearse think of an Ireland in which the black plastic bag has become a symbol of nationalism nailed to lamp posts but also a symbol of what goes into that nationalism, the bits and pieces of living organisms?  I do not intend to speculate upon what Pádraig Pearse the teacher might have thought of that kind of civilisation.  We know what he said about bloodshed.  We know he said that bloodshed was a cleansing thing, something that would purify us as a nation, and we can understand that view to a certain degree.  But what we have to do, a Chathaoirleach, is to try to look at <Col N="273" /> our past, our very difficult and complex past, to try to understand the emotional basis of that past and to try to do so so far as it is possible with our heads, our minds, as well as our hearts.</P>
    <P>There is a danger when we are looking at history of reading into that history a kind of pattern, a pattern that happens to suit our own particular outlook, a pattern that happens to suit whatever happens to be the axe that we are grinding at any moment, the pattern that suits the tactics or even the strategy of the particular moment.  Generally speaking, we may look at patterns in history, historians may look at patterns in history, but for most of the time the majority of the people who were living at that time which we are looking at now were not interested in patterns.  They were interested simply in the business of living.</P>
    <P>I am under some trepidation that the Chair might at any moment intervene and possibly wonder what the relevance of what I am saying is.  I would make two points there.  First of all, though the Constitution is clearly a substantial part of what we are discussing in this debate, that Constitution is a reflection of the aspirations of our people, and I do not think that Members on the opposite side of the House would disagree with that point.  It is a point that they have made on numerous occasions, that that Constitution is the reflection of the aspirations. What they fear is that, if we attack that Constitution, if we criticise that Constitution, if we demolish that Constitution, we are in some way denigrating, denying or demolishing the aspirations of our people as a whole.  That Constitution, though it is, as has been said on this side of the House on many occasions, the product of a particular time, the product of particular circumstances, though it reflects those circumstances in certain ways which a historian or constitutional expert can point out with great ease, it was an attempt rather to interpret the culmination of a struggle by our people that goes back literally over hundreds of years.  Though I take Senator Murphy's point about the danger of looking into <Col N="274" /> history and seeing patterns, it is valid to suggest that there are certain patterns in our history and that those are patterns we must consider now if we are to give relevance and meaning to where the Constitution is and where it is to go.</P>
    <P>I would identify in that struggle &mdash; I leave aside the fact that most of our people most of the time are not concerned with patterns; they are not concerned with theories, philosophies or anything like that; they are concerned with the day to day business of living &mdash; three trends, or three strands, in that struggle.  Those strands sometimes merged, sometimes diverged, sometimes were not apparent and sometimes were only too apparent.  One of those strands is the struggle for democracy, that is to say, the participation of our people in the running of their country, the running of this community, participation in trying to determine the destiny of the people, trying to determine what is going to happen next.  The second strand is the struggle for social justice.  Because ours is a country which until recent times was predominantly rural the most obvious aspects of that struggle was a struggle for the land, the struggle for some kind of rational and effective social and economic system on the land.  Then, as our country became more urbanised, as it became more industrialised, that moved to a certain extent into the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The third strand is the struggle for cultural identity.  We have all grown up in a society in which that has been a daily topic of conversation among many people in at least one language and sometimes two.  But there has been a tendency to interpret that struggle for cultural identity as a fairly narrow question, &ldquo;Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam&rdquo;.  In other words, the language alone was the touchstone by which one decided whether somebody was Irish or not.  It is more than just a question of language.  It is a question of our distinctive way of life, those aspects of our behaviour, those aspects of the way we live which are distinctly ours, distinctly Irish, which <Col N="275" /> belong to us and without which we are not ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have three strands, three themes. The historians may pour a certain amount of scorn on this.  I do not think the politicians will do so.  Three strands &mdash; the struggle for democracy, the struggle for social justice, the struggle for cultural identity.  The next part is going to shock some people in this House.  These three strands, this struggle that was going on, took place against the background of what was basically a Christian philosophy, and by and large, at any time, even up to the present time, the majority of our people give at least lip service, at least nominal allegiance, to the notion that what they do, socially, politically and otherwise, reflects a basically Christian philosophy.  Push it a little bit further and try to define exactly what they mean by this and one runs into certain difficulties.  But for the moment I would like to suggest that what this means is that as a people we would give acceptance to certain affirmations about human dignity, certain affirmations about the human dignity springing basically from the theology of Christianity, which is based upon the idea that each individual human being is sacred and that the rights of each human being are sacred.</P>
    <P>What this debate is about is asking ourselves, as people who have been involved in the public life of this country, as citizens, as individuals, parents, teachers, children, have we achieved the Ireland that our ancestors were struggling for?  When we look back at what those people were fighting for &mdash; and by fighting I do not mean necessarily fighting with arms or bloodshed but struggling for &mdash; can we say in our hearts that we have achieved that Ireland in its totality?</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery said that we have nothing to be ashamed of, and we certainly have a great deal of which to be proud. I am not going to deal with that now but if requested I am prepared to deal with it at some length.  When we emerged from colonialism, when we emerged from the colonial state &mdash; and some will say that we have not fully emerged from it yet <Col N="276" />&mdash; we managed to retain some system of democracy.  We managed to go through two Constitutions and to order our affairs in a constitutional fashion according to the rule of law.  Of the countries which have emerged from colonialism during this century, there are very few that can say that.  There are many other things we have achieved, but what we are trying to do here is to look at the things we have not done, where we have failed to a certain extent.  Have we really created an Ireland in which all our citizens share equally?  Is it really a socially just society? Is it truly a democratic society?  Senator Ryan spoke eloquently about the men of no property in connection with Tone or with some other people.  There are men and women of no property now.</P>

    <P>Naturally enough this debate has turned a great deal upon the situation in the North and the consequences and implications for the rest of the country. But when we look at the record, what concrete achievement did any Southern Government provide for the Northern minority?  What did we actually do for them to make their situation better? What did we actually do apart from words &mdash; and words are very cheap &mdash; to take away the frustration under which they live?  I can remember my father going up to the North when he was involved in a social organisation and coming back and telling me that the leaders of the community there were very worried about their young people.  That was in the fifties. They were worried about how much <Col N="277" /> longer could they hold them down in the system that existed there, in the discrimination that existed there.  What have we done to remove from the Northern majority the fear of violent death and the fear that their way of life would be removed?  What have we really done? There was one effort that I know of and that was the Sunningdale Agreement.  It had its inadequacies but it was something in which a Southern Government and a Southern Opposition participated to a large extent.  It was an attempt to do something for the people of the North. That is the only concrete achievement I can remember.</P>
    <P>What have we done for the quarter of our population &mdash; statiticians vary as to whether it is 20 or 25 per cent and probably the people themselves are not too concerned about statistics &mdash; who live below the minimal acceptable standard of living?  What have we done for them?</P>
    <P>Have we preserved all that is good in our history?  Have we preserved a culture which truly reflects our Irishness?  If we were this evening to go into 20 or 30 Irish homes, what would be there that would be distinctively Irish?  Have we included all our citizens in the running of the country? Have we treated them in such a way that they at least have the illusion they are in control of their own destinies?</P>
    <P>Have we done all in our power to cherish the principle of human dignity?  A number of Senators have referred to this problem.  They have referred to the unemployed and to various deprived minorities.  They must have their place in this debate.  This debate is not just a question of a few dry words in a constitution. It is a question of what kind of life our people have and what kind of life we provide for them.</P>
    <P>I am a gradualist in politics and I believe that the best form of political change is achieved by evolution and by gradual change.  But one of these days we are going to have to look very seriously at ourselves, very seriously at what we say, very seriously at what we practise, and we are going to have to ask ourselves <Col N="278" /> if the predominant public values which govern our decisions, which govern our policies, which decide the priorities where money is going to be spent, which decide the priorities of what we do in our society, really are compatible with the Christian message.  Is it, for example, a fact that the Christian message says that we should exploit our neighbours for financial gain?  I know when I say that that I am using language which has little meaning for many of the people who are listening to this and many of the people who might, if they get a chance sometime, read it because these are cliché words and we no longer look at them to see what the meaning is.  Is it the Christian message that we act in such a way in society that we try to derive from society the maximum benefit for ourselves alone?</P>
    <P>I speak as somebody who was elected on the Labour Panel, somebody who has been a trade unionist all his working life and is proud of it and who worked in the movement in order to make sure his professional association affiliated with Congress.  Have the unions always behaved in a way which shows that they cherish other people as well as themselves? Is the dog eat dog behaviour which we have in our common life really reflective of the Christian message?</P>
    <P>It is also something of a cliché to say that young people look to older people and that they draw a distinction between what older people preach and what they practise.  We will have to ask ourselves to what extent is this true, to what extent do we realise it is true?  In this context I would like to refer to something which Senator Fallon said.  There is nothing personal in what I am going to say now &mdash; I want to make that very clear &mdash; but I think it is an illustration of how sometimes we say and do things and do not realise in fact what we are saying or doing.  He was speaking about Senator McGuinness' speech and he congratulated her upon the fact that she said that she was a Protestant and was proud of it. He then went on to say that he congratulated her because he was a Catholic and <Col N="279" /> native Irish.  This reminds me vividly of an occasion in this city not so very far away from here when there was supposedly an ecumenical meeting organised by the Catholic Church.  It was in the Round Room in the Mansion House. When the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin arrived he had to look around for a chair in the body of the hall.  I am absolutely sure there was no malice intended there.  It merely reflected the fact that nobody had thought about it.  I suggest to Senator Fallon that in his mind, with the best will in the world, he was saying Protestant on the one hand and Catholic and native Irish on the other.  Until we can get beyond that kind of thing it is almost useless to talk about the unity of this island.</P>
    <P>All of us involved in public life &mdash; I would certainly say it of myself as a teacher and somebody involved in public life &mdash; do not expect a brave new world to be built in a matter of hours.  One does not expect everybody to behave perfectly within seconds, minutes, days, years or decades.  It takes time but one must make some allowance for human imperfection. Are there things we have not done?  Are there things we must do?</P>
    <P>Prophets of doom enjoy a certain amount of publicity and, generally speaking, prophets of doom are more honoured because their predictions do not come true than because of what actually happens.  We must ask ourselves if our society is not in crisis at this moment, if there is not a great deal of questioning going on, a great deal of fear, a great deal of alienation.  Alienation means a state in which people feel strangers in their own land and in relation to what is going on around them.</P>
    <P>We know that there is a very serious drug problem in this city and this is probably true of other cities too.  There has been an immense amount of publicity over the last two to three years in relation to the way in which many young people have been attracted by unusual minority sects and that sort of thing.  Does this not reflect the fact that these people are turning away from what we have to offer <Col N="280" /> them, what our forefathers had to offer them or what they think we are offering them?</P>
    <P>The problems we face in this island are problems common to the entire island. They are not just exclusively Southern problems or Northern problems; they are problems which affect all of us who live on this island.  Consequently, when we are considering the kind of things we have been talking about here, we must place them in the context of this island as a whole.  One of these days some of the people in the North who say that the South has nothing to do with them will have to confront the fact that there will be no final solution or no serious interim solution to the problems of this island until the people of this island get together and find some means of producing a solution.</P>
    <P>I have said on other occasions that the real political divide in this country is not on party lines.  It is a very important political divide but the real political divide in this country is between those who accept the <i>status quo,</i> those like Senator Hillery who say that we have nothing to be ashamed of, those who say there is nothing to change, those who say all is rosy in this particular garden on the one hand and those who challenge the <i>status quo,</i> those who say that everything is not right and if we are to be faithful to our forefathers we must change and we must move forward.</P>
    <P>I find the Fianna Fáil amendment saddening. I believe some of the statements that have been made outside this House since the Taoiseach gave this interview which is the subject of this debate represent a refusal to question and look objectively at anything that is in our society, a total acceptance and not even the dimmest awareness that there is anything that we have to change.  This is saddening.  Personally, I have many friends who are strong Fianna Fáil supporters. I have a great deal of admiration for many of the genuine achievements of Fianna Fáil Governments.  At the cost of frightening and shocking some members of my own party I am even prepared to say here and allow it to go on the record <Col N="281" /> that I consider that Eamon de Valera was a very great man.  I would not agree with everything he did.  I would also say, and I am prepared to say it on another occasion if necessary, that there was a time in his career when his failure to be a leader had the direst and the most tragic consequences for this country.  But he was still a very great man, and a man who at least tried to contribute to this country. I believe that, in refusing to look at any kind of change, in refusing to look at our society as it is now, Fianna Fáil are not doing a service to the memory of that man among whose gifts was a certain amount of flexibility.  Some people sometimes felt he was a bit too flexible.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that we must be careful when we are looking at the past, that we must not give too great an importance to the past.  Then, in what some may feel was an apparent contradiction, I turned to the past and said there was a certain direction in which our society seemed to be travelling into the past.  It is not really a contradiction because what I was suggesting was that we must not go to extremes.  We must not accept everything that was done in the past, or, alternatively, turn our backs totally on the past. We must look at the past in an intelligent, objective and effective forward-looking fashion.</P>
    <P>I believe the people of this island took a certain number of wrong turnings.  I can see Senator Murphy rising in his seat at such unhistorical phraseology.  What I mean is this: for example, there was a time not so long ago when the people of this island had a common forum.  It may not have been a forum that was exclusively Irish, it may have been a forum that was always weighted against Ireland, but at least it was a forum on which the people of the North and South could sit down together and talk about the problem of this island.  That forum no longer exists.  It died between 1912 and 1922.</P>
    <P>I believe the Civil War was a wrong turning.  At that time at least a substantial section of our people were united in a massive surge of patriotism &mdash; patriotism <Col N="282" /> not in a narrow or divisive sense but patriotism in which they were prepared to work together for the good of our people and our country &mdash; but that was destroyed and in its place came dissolution. It has been one of my ambitions in politics that the day would eventually come when we would turn our backs on the Civil War, forget about it and get on with the problems which really matter &mdash; the problems of our people.</P>
    <P>I also believe that in the 1960s, though there were very substantial achievements in the economic and social fields, as a people we turned towards the values of consumerism, and materialism which were basically foreign to our people, not only foreign to our people but also in conflict with the basic Christian philosophy to which we give nominal lip service.</P>
    <P>There can be no turning back of the clock.  What is done is done to a large extent.  If this House rises to the occasion and if we as politicians, as custodians of the Constitution, as the heirs of the democratic political tradition of this country, can rise to this occasion and pick up the strands of our struggle, the struggle of our people in the past, we can find again the means of unleashing the potential of the people of this island.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of divisiveness. There has been talk of partitionism. There has been talk of party politics. What I think the Taoiseach has tried to do &mdash; and what he is doing with the ordinary people of this country &mdash; is to give us an opportunity to try to break out of the narrow confines of the Twenty-Six counties state towards a new all-Ireland which is bigger than that or the statelet in the North.  It is our responsibility before history and the people of this country, and particularly the young people, to respond to that call.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to congratulate you on your election and to congratulate Senator Dolan on his election as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  In my maiden speech I should like to take this opportunity of contributing to this important <Col N="283" /> debate which raises the most serious issues for the country.  I find it extraordinary that this House has been asked in the first half of the Government motion &ldquo;to approve the views expressed by the Taoiseach in the course of an RTE radio interview on 27 September 1981.&rdquo; I use the word &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; deliberately because, as far as I have been able to establish on my third day in this House, this move by the Government is unprecedented. It is the first time the House has been asked to approve first, the terms of a radio interview and, secondly, to approve the full text of the interview without the text being incorporated in the Government's motion.  This is a departure and I feel everyone here this evening who has respect for the traditions of this House should rightly condemn it. In fact, I feel so strongly about it I urge that this malpractice and abuse be examined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I also feel that the dignity of this House, and indeed of the Dáil itself, has been affronted by the fact that the Taoiseach made his remarks in the course of a radio interview and not before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which would have been more proper and statesmanlike.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn to some of the reported remarks by the Taoiseach.  I propose to deal with only some of the issues he has raised.  The Taoiseach is reported to have said, and I will quote only a few of his remarks:</P>
      <P>This part of the country has slipped into a partitionist attitude.  We have created here something which the Northern Protestant finds unacceptable. I believe it is my job to try and lead our people and understand how it is that we have divided this island.</P>
      <P>I wonder who he meant there.</P>
      <P>I want to lead a Republican crusade. Fianna Fáil do not believe in the principles of Tone and Davis.  Fianna Fáil know nothing about Northern Ireland. If I were a Northern Protestant today ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine some of these remarks, which as far as I am concerned represent <Col N="284" /> nothing more than neurotic and unfounded outbursts which insult our people and countless past generations of Irish people.  Where is the basis for these unfounded allegations made by the Taoiseach which have been rejected by all our people, and I mean all our people, because I include people within the Taoiseach's own party, as representing a most serious and unforgivable contribution, never made before by any Taoiseach in the history of the State, representing national self-debasement?</P>
    <P>Where is the evidence for the Taoiseach's claim that we in the South suffer from a partitionist attitude?  Is the Taoiseach totally unfamiliar with the long and sad history of our country?  Might I remind the Taoiseach that Partition was created not by us in the South but by a selected, privileged and a wealthy clique in the North with the full connivance and support of successive British Governments right up to the present day?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's remarks will not contribute one iota to the long-cherished goal of national unity.  They will only put this back.  We know from the reaction to the Taoiseach's remarks by prominent Northern Unionist politicians that the Taoiseach's remarks have provided ammunition for the Unionists' claim that we in the South are a sectarian State.</P>
    <P>May I remind the Taoiseach, who boasts about his understanding of the Northern Unionist mentality, that he completely misunderstands it?  Does he understand the Southern Republic?  He desecrated the names of Tone, Davis and Emmet.  Does he not know that, no matter what changes he proposes to make in our most cherished beliefs and traditions, he will not change Unionist intransigence as long as the British guarantee remains?</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, has always maintained there will be no move forward towards reconciliation and national unity while that guarantee remains.  This is why in Government Fianna Fáil, under the leadership of Deputy Charles Haughey, succeeded in getting agreement with the British Prime Minister, Margaret <Col N="285" /> Thatcher, that the solution lies between the Dublin and London Governments, and to treat the matter as an international problem.  I sincerely hope that the agreement reached between Deputy Haughey and Mrs. Thatcher at the Anglo-Irish summit talks last year will not be undermined or damaged in any way by irresponsible or immature actions by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I must say that what I have seen and heard from the present Taoiseach give us in the Fianna Fáil organisation and Fianna Fáil Party very little ground for optimism.  Of course, what the Taoiseach has succeeded in doing in all of this is not only to support the Unionist claims but at the same time to ask us to throw away all our fundamental beliefs and traditions which we have had down through the years.</P>
    <P>What does the Taoiseach mean by &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;?  I ask him to provide us with any documentary proof of where our laws are sectarian.  Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution represent our long-cherished goal of national unity as propounded by Tone and Davis.  Does the Taoiseach now want to delete these two Articles from our Constitution?  Would Tone and Davis, if they were alive today, agree with this?</P>
    <P>Might I remind the Taoiseach that the 1967 All-Party Committee only proposed alternative wording of Articles 2 and 3 for reasons to do with the Continental Shelf?  This was fully supported at the time by the Fine Gael Party.  I ask the Taoiseach if the Fine Gael Party have changed their minds and, if so, why was it not put to the electorate during the last general election?  Was this not a massive deception of the Irish people?  It will never be forgiven.  The reality, I suspect, is that the Taoiseach's remarks are purely personal ones which have not the full support of his own party.</P>
    <P>We learned from the Taoiseach in his radio interview that he now wishes to lead a crusade.  His choice of words was unfortunate.  He obviously does now know history, but might I remind him <Col N="286" /> that the history of crusades in the Middle Ages was a sad one for the leaders and does not stand up well by modern day criteria.  The Taoiseach said that the history is so selective and biased as to be absurd.</P>
    <P>Other speakers here this evening and tomorrow will put the record straight regarding Éamon de Valera, Fianna Fáil Governments and the 1937 Constitutional ban on divorce.  It must be evident from what I have said that the Taoiseach's remarks represent a digression from the real issues facing the country today, the Government's disastrous policies to resolve the economic problems facing the country.  As every day passes we can see the clear division separating the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in their approach to economic policies.  It must be unique not only in the European Economic Community but in the entire western world that we have a Government which attempt to combine the conservative and monetarist policies of Fine Gael and those of the Labour Party who, in its thirst for power, were prepared to reject and forget everything which they had claimed to represent.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible for this House to accept this motion proposed by Senators Hussey and Ferris.  I fully support the amendment to the motion tabled by Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator William Ryan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate this evening, and let me say at the beginning that I regard the issue we are discussing as perhaps the most important issue we will debate in this Chamber for some time. We are dealing with a national question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be said at this stage, having listened to the debate for almost three days, that we have had some excellent contributions.  We have had contributions from Senators who recognised the importance of the issue.  There has been a willingness on the part of many of them to face this motion and what it entails objectively, fairly and honestly, and to give it the treatment and the open-minded approach that a matter of its <Col N="287" /> importance deserves.  For that reason the debate has been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I regret that I cannot extend that classification to the contributions of all Senators. I regret that from the Opposition side of the House a consistent attempt has been made to reduce the debate, to bring down its content and purpose to the realm of narrow party politics.  There has been a refusal to face this issue for what it is.  I regret that many on the Opposition side could not find the generosity of either heart or mind to debate this motion on its merits and to give to it the attention that its seriousness deserves.  I regret equally that a consistent attempt has been made by a number of Opposition speakers to deflect the attention of the House from the central theme of this motion and to introduce side issues to divert discussion. These side issues ranged from arterial drainage in County Monaghan to an unjustified and unwarranted attack on the name and memory of Wolfe Tone.  In his time Tone had to contend with enemies who misrepresented his purpose, who attacked his cause and who destroyed him in the end.  It is regrettable and sad that the sentiments of those people should be echoed in this Chamber today.</P>
    <P>This issue is far too wide and far too important to be made a narrow political issue.  I want to ask the Opposition one simple question: how deep is their concern? What good can be achieved if, at the very beginning of this debate, they are prepared to set out deliberately to confuse it, to misrepresent the motion, and to misrepresent a genuine attempt to have a national debate on a highly important issue?  In the course of his radio interview the Taoiseach is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>I want to lead a crusade, a Republican crusade, to make this a genuine Republic... I am passionately committed to a United Ireland, established on the principles of Tone and Davis and will try to lead our people towards that.</P>
    <P>Do some people believe the right to lead a Republican crusade, or the right to be associated with the principles of Tone and Davis, is in some extraordinary <Col N="288" /> way their special preserve?  Is that belief a factor of the extraordinary reaction we are getting from some people on this question?  Numerous invitations have been issued to debate side issues.  It would be very easy to respond to many of the misrepresentations which have been made, but I do not propose to proceed further on those lines because, to do so, would be unworthy of the great issue we face in this motion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with approval the views expressed by the Taoiseach in the course of an RTE radio interview on 27 September, 1981, on the desirability of creating within this island conditions favourable to unity through a reconciliation of its people and towards this end of undertaking in this State a Constitutional and legislative review.</P>
    <P>That represents a challenge to all our people to examine in sincerity and in depth what each of us is prepared to do to achieve a united Ireland.  That is the thrust of the Taoiseach's speech and it is the purpose and the essence of this motion.  It is simply a challenge to all of us both inside this House and outside it to examine what we are prepared to do. It poses the question: are we prepared objectively and fairly to examine our attitudes, our Constitution and our laws, if necessary, to discover if in some way they are a barrier to the eventual unity of this country.  We all owe it to past generations to be willing to examine our Constitution, our laws and our attitudes to see whether in some way they prevent the realisation of a dream which has inspired the best in so many generations over the centuries.</P>
    <P>It is 60 years since this State was founded and it is 44 years since the Constitution was adopted.  New generations have come and gone.  Conditions and attitudes may well have changed.  In some ways we may have drifted from our neighbours in Northern Ireland.  We may have allowed feelings or attitudes to develop which in some way put a distance between us.  Is it not reasonable at this stage to say that, after that period, we <Col N="289" /> are justified in asking for an examination of our attitudes and our laws, if necessary?</P>
    <P>The motion is good.  It is positive and it will compel many people who have avoided doing so up to now to examine where they stand in relation to Irish unity, to measure how deep is their commitment to it, and to ask themselves what changes they are prepared to make to achieve that unity.  The vast majority of our people believe in Irish unity.  The vast majority of our people would like to see the Border go.  Very many would like to see the end of British association with and involvement in Northern Ireland but, subconsciously, many of them feel that that situation is so far away that they do not have to give it serious examination.</P>
    <P>One area of agreement which has emerged from the discussions we have had during the three days devoted to this motion is that all parties accept the desirability of Irish unity.  If we are to have a truly united Ireland &mdash; and to a very great degree this is acceptable &mdash; it must be based on consent and reconciliation.  It must encompass two communities whose beliefs, traditions and practices are different from each other,.  It must be the kind of Ireland to which both of these communities will feel free to give allegiance.</P>
    <P>It must also be a united Ireland where the traditions, the beliefs and the practices of one community enjoy the respect of the other.  There is no other way.  This may require change and in this part of the island it may require a certain amount of give.  Therefore the question this motion poses is: are we prepared to consider what changes we may have to make to bring nearer the achievement of a united Ireland?</P>
    <P>I regret that a positive and worthwhile proposal has been opposed.  I regret that the sincere and genuine thought behind it is being rejected by some people.  I do not believe that the national interest is best being served by shutting the door on a proposal that suggests simply that we discuss and examine our situation, our attitudes in this part of the country in relation to an eventual united Ireland.  I believe also that it is futile for people to <Col N="290" /> say that they are committed to a united Ireland based on consent and reconciliation if in the same breath they declare that they are not prepared to even engage in a basic examination of ascertaining how reconciliation and consent can best be achieved.  The motion is a worthwhile one.  It is one that deserves support. Indeed it is one that is receiving the support of people right across the ancient divide.</P>
    <P>We have been asked here to reject this motion.  We are being asked to accept in its place a four-part amendment.  That amendment, which I have read carefully is one that should not arise from an objective assessment of the motion.  The first part of that amendment speaks about the dignity and freedom of the individual and the attainment of a true social order.  It is implied somehow or other that the freedom and the dignity of the individual is in some way threatened by our motion. It suggests that the true social order, whatever that may be, is likely to be upset if this motion is to be accepted.  I am at a loss to know what is meant by this.  I am at a loss to understand the reasoning behind the amendment.  I do not believe that the dignity and the freedom of the individual or true social order is being threatened by the motion or, indeed, by the speech of the Taoiseach.  I know of no person in this country who is more committed to the preservation of the freedom and dignity of the individual than is the present Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment deals with what it describes as:</P>
    <P>...deplorable and unfounded allegations of sectarianism in our laws and in the administration of our affairs;</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the terminology here is abusive and irrational I pose the question to the Opposition: is it not a fair proposition that we examine our laws, that we examine the administration of our affairs to make absolutely sure that there is nothing that could come near to being termed sectarian in our laws or even in the administration of our affairs. For that reason the suggestion is that we have a full examination of our laws and <Col N="291" /> the administration of our affairs to ensure that there is no taint whatsoever of sectarianism within them.  It is a reasonable suggestion and I contend that, if the people opposite are reasonable, they will accept it.</P>

      <P>The third part of the amendment says:</P>
      <P>...condemns the Taoiseach's divisive statements which have damaged the cause of a united Ireland based on reconciliation and a respect for the many different traditions in this island;</P>
      <P>Of course it does no such thing.  None of the Taoiseach's statements on this issue has been divisive.  I regard them as being sincere, courageous, open and fair.  They have invoked a positive response right across the ancient divide on this island. Therefore, I say to the Opposition: if that is your assessment of his statement you-stand alone except for the extreme fringes of orange and green, and if you want their company you can have it.</P>
      <P>The final part of the amendment says:</P>
      <P>...re-affirms its conviction that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution express the unalterable aspiration of the great majority of the Irish people to the unity of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal with the amendment as worded.  I do not believe it is a good thing that this discussion has become involved so closely with Articles 2 and 3.  Nonetheless that has been the case.  I believe that, having become so closely involved with these two Articles, the main point and thrust of the motion and what the Taoiseach set out to achieve are being missed.  In all sincerity I want to ask the people who want to hold on to Articles 2 and 3 at all costs, because they say it expresses the aspirations of the great majority of the people, are they seriously suggesting that there is no other channel or no other method by which the majority of the people could express their aspiration for a united Ireland?  Obviously, the late Seán Lemass did not think so.  He <Col N="292" /> established a commission to review the Constitution in 1967.  There are other methods, probably even more effective methods, by which the aspiration of the majority of the Irish people for national unity can be expressed other than through this Constitution, which not alone recognises Partition but confirm it by preventing &mdash; in Article 3 &mdash; the Oireachtas from enacting legislation that would apply in a Thirty-two County Ireland situation.</P>
    <P>The amendment is unreal, is unnecessary and is based on misconceptions and inaccuracies.  It refers to non-existent fears.  Furthermore, its phraseology, its tone and the allegations it makes are really damaging in the cause of Irish unity.  The amendment was proposed by Senator Eoin Ryan.  I accept Senator Eoin Ryan's speech as reasonable in terms of legitimate political debate.  But there are one or two points on which I want to take issue with him.  He suggested &mdash; and I think I am quoting him correctly &mdash; that the acceptance of the motion would convey to the Nationalist people of Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry that they were being abandoned.  I fail to see that point because the Nationalist people, be they in Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry, south Armagh, south Down, west Belfast or many other parts of the North, for the past 60 years have been in somewhat of a limbo situation.  They are part of a State which they largely reject.  As far as their position and their situation is concerned, for the past 44 years the 1937 Constitution has failed to improve their lot one iota.  It has failed to advance or bring nearer the aspirations of the majority of the people by one single hour.  The Nationalist people of Northern Ireland will welcome everything that is proposed in this motion because it represents a real and fresh approach to bring the realisation of their aspiration nearer.  Most important of all, it offers a genuine alternative to the methods and the policies of violence.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, while there may be differences, and I regret them, there is nonetheless a general consensus in this debate on the desirability of a united <Col N="293" /> Ireland.  I am repeating myself on this but I want to emphasise that the only kind of a united Ireland that can survive and prosper is one that is achieved through peace and consent, one that would embrace both communities, would respect the beliefs and traditions of both communities and one to which both communities could freely give their allegiance.</P>
    <P>I am almost back to a point I mentioned earlier and that is back to Tone. That was his Ireland: an Ireland that embraced Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter. It has just occurred to me, especially so because of press reports in recent weeks, that Bodenstown is a hallowed spot among many others.  Year in and year out groups and individuals go there on organised pilgrimage.  The people who go there &mdash; at least this is how it should be &mdash; go not alone to show their admiration for his courage, patriotism and sacrifice but implied in that visit is an expression of loyalty and fidelity to the views and philosophy of Tone.  Let no one doubt, no matter how well they may attempt to camouflage it, that to reject this motion is to reject the principles and views of Tone.  His concept of a common nationhood embracing all communities, which inspired so many generations in the past, can be achieved in the not too distant future provided enough people feel committed to it and are prepared to work unselfishly for it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his radio interview and in his speech here last week pointed to certain dangers.  In the past 60 years we have lived and developed in our own way and there is the danger that we may have drifted away from our neighbours in Northern Ireland.  It is important that recent generations who have grown up in the last 60 years or so should question seriously the measure of their commitment to a united Ireland.  They should question what is entailed in it and ask themselves honestly are they prepared to accept what the achievement of a united Ireland today may involve.</P>
    <P>We have reached the point of soul <Col N="294" /> searching.  For that the Taoiseach's move has been well worthwhile.  We have reached the point of decision making. For many people the luxury of avoiding this issue and at the same time paying lip service to a 32-county Ireland has passed. In the months ahead many people will be engaged in an examination of where they stand in relation to these issues in which they would not be involved if it were not for the Taoiseach's initiative and the motion that is before the House.  If the response of enough people, particularly in this part of our island is generous enough, if we have the conviction and capacity to show other people that we are prepared to share with them the freedoms that we cherish ourselves, then we may have brought nearer the day of eventual unity.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge in the course of his speech last week made one very telling statement.  He said that every generation had its own historic task.  I add to that this: patriotism in every age and in every generation has been marked by those who would respond and those who would not.  History has made its cold distinction. Senator Dooge concluded by saying that our generation may have the last great task of achieving Irish reconciliation.  I hope that such will be the case and that we have the capacity, conviction and commitment to respond to what is required.  I fully support the motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say how honoured I feel to be able to address the Seanad today as one of its Members and to <Col N="295" /> experience the great freedom of being able to express my views openly and freely in a manner denied to so many thousands of Irish men and women in the past.  It is indeed a great privilege to participate in an open and free democratic Assembly, made possible as it has been by those same thousands who worked and died that it might be present in their lifetime.  Having said this, I should to like to contribute to the debate by laying before the House ideas and concerns which are present in the hearts and minds of Irish men and women today.  I know that many people are deeply concerned about the Taoiseach's views on the Constitution.  My duty is to express those deeply felt concerns in this Assembly.</P>
    <P>I am not representing any elite group or academic view on this matter.  The academics can well speak for themselves and can confuse the minds and the hearts of Irish people with their newfangled ways of looking at things.  For several years as a public representative I have been conscious of a dangerous practice in Irish life and particularly in Irish political life.  I refer to people, politicians and others, who have blatantly tried to undermine the confidence of the ordinary Irish person and the totality of his own background &mdash; the combination of institutions and ideologies that have made the majority of Irish people what they are.  I refer especially to repeated attacks by some academics and by some members of the last and present Coalition Governments on institutions such as the Catholic Church, the Gaelic Athletic Association and in general on institutions or organisations that try in a genuine way to further things traditionally Gaelic.  It goes without saying that these institutions are subject to human fault but there is a feeling put forward that one can find the roots of many of the ills of Irish society in the operations of these institutions.</P>
    <P>It is easy to find instances and isolated examples of institutions going wrong. That has been done in this assembly. Indeed, it was initiated by the Taoiseach <Col N="296" /> in his radio interview during which he pointed to one or two isolated matters to prove his entire thesis.  Wolfe Tone has been quoted frequently by the Taoiseach. It is my sincere opinion that the Taoiseach has started us once again down the path of self-guilt, a feeling of inadequacy in what we have achieved and cherished always, a sense of inferiority so engendered in the Irish people through oppression. Perhaps the Taoiseach's cherished background may not have given him an understanding of the inferiority or oppression I speak of but the Irish people have known it.  Tone once said that we had been reduced to the lowest state of human degradation, that we had almost ceased to respect ourselves, that we doubted whether the opinion of our oppressors was not just and whether we were not in fact framed for the submission to which we had been bent.  Yet we are being told now by the Taoiseach and by those in this assembly who support these charges that we are sectarian, we are wrong, we have been wrong and that we must change our basic aspirations as a people in order to accommodate, in order to placate as it were.  I reject and resent the insinuations that we are a sectarian State.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach refers to the ethos of the religion of our majority as being excessively enshrined in our institutions or exemplified in Acts of Irish Governments over the years.  I would confidently hold the view that the majority of ordinary Irish people would consider that non-Catholics have had a greater share of good things in life than themselves.  I believe most Irish Catholics would consider, although not with justification, that their Southern neighbours are being in some ways privileged.  There is no need to go into the special position of our non-Catholic Irish neighbours in the Northern part of this island.  It is not too long since we agreed to change the special position given to the Catholic Church in our Constitution.  This has made no difference to the attitude of Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland towards the South.  There is inherent danger in watering down the aspirations of our people as <Col N="297" /> enshrined in our Constitution.  In my view this debate can only help to undermine the people's confidence in the Constitution, not to mind any change or deletion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has called on all of us to join him in a new crusade of real republicanism.  There is inherent in his words a criticism of any kind of republicanism, which existed before his enunciation. His words suggest that he is enunciating a new kind of republicanism which was never heard of before and which he in his messianic role is going to teach the Irish people.  Even the very word &lsquo;crusade&rsquo; smacks of the truly Christian knight who will correct and conquer the heretical beliefs of former republicans.</P>
    <P>May I suggest respectfully to the Taoiseach that there are many people who would prefer him to direct his attentions to the socially and economically deprived areas of this State, towards human beings whom I talk genuinely about as suffering from another form of sectarianism which has little to do with creed or political beliefs?  May I also suggest to the Taoiseach, lest he forget, that there are strong traditions here in the Republic which cannot be laid aside to placate the Unionist view?  I cannot say &ldquo;Unionist tradition&rdquo; because I cannot help thinking that it is a mere allegiance rather than a tradition. The Gaelic tradition of Ireland called for revitalisation.  It is a tradition that finds adherence both North and South, among Catholic and non-Catholic alike.  Let the Taoiseach's efforts be directed towards areas like the Irish language and the total culture of Ireland, because it is in this area that we find unity of purpose and people.  When we come to a greater sense of trust and togetherness, where there can be proper union with give and take on both sides, then we can sit down and talk constitutionally about a new Ireland, a united Ireland, the only Ireland that Tone and Davis wrote of &mdash; a free and Gaelic Ireland embracing all of the people of this island.  Anything else is artificial and doomed to failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard every speaker in this debate so far and I have <Col N="298" /> been struck by a number of different points.  The first was that, apart from the contribution of Senator Eoin Ryan, the Fianna Fáil Members of this House have unfortunately been adopting an unyielding and narrow-minded attitude.  They are totally set &mdash; in public anyway &mdash; against any idea of constitutional change. I hope to show my friends in Fianna Fáil that this is a foolish and a wrong approach.  Not only is it foolish and wrong and inconsistent with the tradition of that party but it is inconsistent with even the current policy of that party as enunciated as lately as the recent general election.</P>
      <P>The second thing that strikes me is that among those of us, and I include myself, who accept that there is a need for a review and perhaps a change in some sections of the Constitution arising out of that review, each and every person seems to have his or her own interpretation as to what that review should be.  Other speakers on all sides of the House have detected but not identified this trend.  The academics approach it from an academic viewpoint and they put forward lessons that history teaches.  I know very little history and I am not going to quote history in my contribution to this debate. The lawyers in the House seize upon it as an opportunity to reform the legal situation. The socialists in the House seize this opportunity as an occasion to question the primacy of private property.  The agnostics, whom I will not identify, see it as an opportunity of identifying and rooting out all references to the Church of Rome.  The zealous Romans, whom also I will not identify, see it as an opportunity to stitch into the Constitution the dogma of their Church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the excellent contribution last week of Senator Murphy. I was amused by his expression which he quoted from a fellow academic of his own: &ldquo;Níl aon Wolfe Tone mar do Wolfe Tone féin.&rdquo;  I am beginning to believe that there is no review of the Constitution like your own review of it, to translate loosely.  Therefore, I propose to approach this debate in that spirit.  It is in that spirit that we can contribute to the debate and not by taking what the <Col N="299" /> Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, has said as being gospel.  My tradition in political life &mdash; going back as it does, I say with some pride, to the Irish Parliamentary Party &mdash; is not that we accept automatically what our leaders say.  The Seanad is the ideal place to express our views and in that review of our Constitution distilling from it what the people of this country really require.</P>
    <P>Nobody has yet attempted to define what our Constitution is.  Our Constitution is very much more than the mutilated document within the grey or light green covered book which each of us was presented with on election to this House, mutilated for the reason referred to by Senator Robinson, that the changes have not been properly incorporated in the original text.  That is only the Constitution of Ireland.  There is more than the Constitution of Ireland.  Countries which have no constitutions produce great constitutional lawyers.  Books are written on the constitutions of those countries because the constitution of a country is not just that book to which I refer; it is a whole range of legislation and authority which exist side by side not in contradiction of that constitution but as an addition to it.</P>
    <P>The first element of our Constitution and the primary and most important source of our Constitution in the future could well be EEC law and the Treaty of Rome.  I propose to deal further on with that and the problems that that is going to give us.  We have, of course, the written Constitution, the document to which most of the Senators have referred during the course of this debate.  Even within that Constitution there are myriad rights, not enumerated under the Constitution that were never in the minds of the people who framed the Constitution but which under the various Articles of the Constitution have been interpreted by the courts as being the rights of the human individual.  Particularly, we have the rights which arise under Article 40.3 of this Constitution, the personal rights, and I propose to deal with that at some length also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> Another important part of our Constitution is the whole area of common law. That area of common law which is not inconsistent with this document is accepted by the courts of this land and people are punished and rewarded as a result of this common law.  Therefore, when we talk about a constitutional review we are not merely talking about this document: we are talking about a consideration of the document and how it fits into the pattern of the various other constitutional instruments which are alive and making a contribution in this State today.</P>
    <P>Here we come to one of the major problems in dealing with people from the North of Ireland.  People from the North of Ireland do not understand what our Constitution is about.  The Nationalist people of the North of Ireland do not understand what our Constitution is about.  They have never been subjected to the disciplines which a written constitution brings.  That is one of our failures. We fail to appreciate that Northern politicians of all persuasions do not understand what written constitutions are and the effect which they can have on the ability of a sovereign government to act. The constitutional law which they have been brought up on is a constitutional law based on the primacy of the parliament of the country to which they owe their allegience.  In talking about the North, Northern politicians and Northern people we must understand that for the most part they would not know what we are talking about when we speak about Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>At the top of our Constitution there is the Treaty of Rome and various other treaties which together make up the European Communities.  I propose to deal with merely the Treaty which sets up the European Economic Community and in particular the laws enacted under that Treaty, how they were interpreted and how they will be interpreted in the future by the European Court.  We have, of course, control in an indirect way on formal amendments of the Treaty of Rome. But we do not have control of the way in which the existing Treaty is now and will <Col N="301" /> in the future be interpreted by the European Court and how this could gradually extend the areas of the supremacy of the European institutions over our domestic institutions.  I would like to quote a number of Articles from the Treaty of Rome. I presume it is a document that this House is aware of and, therefore, I do not have to give any further source for it.  Article 145 deals with the Council of Ministers and it says:</P>
    <P>To ensure that the objectives set out in this Treaty are attained, the Council shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty:</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensure coordination of the general economic policies of the Member States; have power to take decisions....</P>
    <P>It does not say what kind of decisions, just power to take decisions.</P>
    <P>Article 169 deals with the Commission and the Commission's power and authority over the affairs of the European Economic Community.  It says:</P>
    <P>If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity to submit its observations. If the State concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the Commission, the latter may bring the matter before the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Commission is the watchdog of the way in which we conform to our duties under the obligations of the Treaty.  Article 145 is drawn in such a way that there are no precise limits laid down as to the limit of the power which is available to the Council, being a meeting of democratically elected representatives but not in itself being democratically elected.</P>
    <P>Article 173 says:</P>
    <P>The Court of Justice shall review the legality of acts of the Council and the Commission other than recommendations <Col N="302" /> or opinions.  It shall for this purpose have jurisdiction in actions brought by a Member State, the Council or the Commission on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule or law relating to its application, or misuse of powers.</P>
    <P>I shall deal later with how our own Constitution has developed and the way in which personal rights which were never enumerated by this House and never enacted by the people, have, quite correctly, taken precedence over the written words of the Constitution.  You can see the interpretation which the European Court could put on the various Articles and our duties under those Articles.  In view of the amendment enacted at the time of our accession to the European Community, it is right that we should at this time consider whether that amendment to the Constitution was the correct one.  If it was not the correct amendment to the Constitution, then obviously men of goodwill representing all the political parties must sit down and examine what would meet the requirements, what would protect the interests of this country, should the European Community want to extend &mdash; it shows no sign of it at present &mdash; but if in the future it should want to extend its jurisdiction over the area which it was originally envisaged it should operate.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but I will do what no other Member has done so far: at the end of my speech I will pose a series of questions which an all-party committee could examine.  This will be one of the questions which the all-party committee on the Constitution, which I would like to see established, could examine.  The amount by which we are willing to divest ourselves of the authority to make laws is a legitimate area of constitutional review and I do not interpret the motion as it is before the House as limiting me in any way to those items which were specifically mentioned by the <Col N="304" /> Taoiseach at the time of his radio interview. The amendment which we enacted included the following statement, and the first part of it is technical:</P>
      <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
      <P>That is an area of proper legitimate constitutional review in the near future in this country.</P>
      <P>I would like to move on to the next area which I consider to be an area of legitimate constitutional review.  Before doing so I would like, for the benefit of the Members, to quote from Deputy Kelly's book, <i>The Irish Constitution.</i> I am glad to quote from it today when he is not here rather than tomorrow.  It is written under his professional name Professor J. M. Kelly.  In it he deals with the point I have made about the personal rights which arise under article 40(3º) of the Constitution.</P>
