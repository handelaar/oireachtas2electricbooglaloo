      <P>I have notice from Senator Robinson that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The level of co-operation between the Department of Health and the Women's Aid Organisation.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That item No. 14 be added to the Order of Business&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions we have stressed the necessity, urgency and importance of taking this motion but for a number of reasons which were not entirely satisfactory it was found impossible by the Leader of the House to take it.  We cannot allow it to be deferred any longer.  It is extremely important and I have moved that it be added to the Order of Business for today.  If Government business makes it impossible to take it <Col N="1170" /> today, then at least it can be put on the Order of Business and taken tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Ryan's motion.  I find it extraordinary that the Government are afraid to let us debate this motion which is, if not more important than, equally important as some of the matters discussed in this House since the new Seanad was elected.  This discriminates against 75 per cent of the children of this country and all of the Protestant children in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader of the House in a position to indicate when the relevant motion relating to reconstituting the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies might be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. G. Hussey Mrs. G. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. G. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator E. Ryan, there is no question, as mentioned by another Senator, of this side of the House being afraid to take this motion.  I have already indicated on several occasions that we consider this motion of great importance.  I would point out that we took a Private Member's motion as recently as last week, and also that this week and next week there will be a great deal of important Government legislation coming before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons I put forward on other occasions for not taking that motion were perfectly valid, in that we had a recent threat by an organisation of the institution of legal proceedings.  Apparently this threat has not been acted upon, which seems to be very wise.  Because we are as convinced as the Opposition of the importance of this motion, and the allied motion No. 15, we intend to order those motions for the first sitting day after Christmas, which will perhaps be quite soon after Christmas.  Given the pressure which will be upon us to deal with an enormous amount of business in these two weeks, the first sitting day after Christmas would be the best time to take <Col N="1171" /> this motion and therefore I give that undertaking.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, as Senators are aware we are taking a motion establishing another joint committee today, which is being initiated in this House.  I share Senators' puzzlement about the delay in bringing the other joint committee motion before us, and I can assure Senator O'Mahony that I will be pressing very hard for that to be taken at the first possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the question of whether the subject of a motion is <i>sub judice</i> is a matter, in my submission, for the Cathaoirleach to rule on.  I am perfectly satisfied to allow the Cathaoirleach to say whether this is a motion on which that should be raised, but with all respect, I do not think it is a <Col N="1172" /> matter for the Leader of the House.  I cannot understand the attitude she is taking. Apparently she says it will be allowed early in the new year.  Has the threat of proceedings now been removed?  If it was a good excuse for not taking it up to now, I do not see that there is going to be any change in the new year.</P>

It looks as though it may be difficult &mdash; I would like the Leader of the House to comment on this &mdash; to get this joint committee under way before Christmas.</P>
      <P>That is deplorable on several grounds. The staff of this joint committee have been waiting around for the committee to be reconstituted.  It has a statutory duty to fulfil under the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973, to examine the implementation here of European community secondary legislation, particularly important directives which affect all aspects of our life.  Also, it has an extremely important political role, to scrutinise, as a watchdog committee, the draft measures and the programmes at EEC level.  We are all too acutely aware of how much decision making has been transferred to Brussels and how much of it deeply affects every aspect of our economic and social lives. It is very serious indeed that this joint committee is still going only through the procedural motions to establish it.  It is very serious that the Seanad, having taken a welcome initiative &mdash; I should like to commend the Leader of the House on the fact that we did move the expediency motion and referred it to the Dáil &mdash; must wait such a period of time before the matter is referred back to it for the motion establishing it.  Of course, there will have to be a further motion in the Dáil.  I would like some commitment and undertaking that this joint committee will meet and have its first business session before the Christmas recess because of the importance of the work involved.</P>

      <P>I share the concern voiced very passionately, and with righteous anger, by Senator Robinson.  I would like, in support of what she has said, to try to obtain from the Leader of the House and, indeed, from all parties and Independents here, and their corresponding colleagues in the other House, that the procedure being adopted in relation to this motion will not serve as a precedent for item No. 2 on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with the concern expressed by the other two Senators on this matter. We all know that whether or not our committees are being established the EEC is not inactive and that there is a very substantial amount of material coming through every week and indeed every day.  By delaying the implementation of this motion and by failing to set up this joint committee at the earliest possible date we are saddling that joint committee with a very substantial weight of business that will have to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson has emphasised the way in which the secondary legislation of the European Communities impinges upon every aspect of our national life and in a highly practical fashion.  That is to say they are dealing with matters which are of immediate concern to our citizens, not of an obstruse nature.  I should like to support the other two Senators in urging an immediate movement on this joint committee.</P>

      <P>I share the views of the other speakers about the delay in introducing this motion.  I am even more concerned by the fact that in respect of another joint committee which was in existence during the last four years no motion has even been presented to the House at this stage.  That is in connection with the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I hope that whatever delay there has been, whatever the difficulties are, they will be overcome as soon as possible and that that Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies will be reestablished without further delay and will <Col N="1182" /> be enabled to begin operations immediately after Christmas.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome very much the concern expressed by Senators about item No. 1 and, indeed, about other joint committees. We had in this House an extremely solid and valuable debate on the setting up of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and it was full of strong resolution and very good suggestions.  I am also very well aware that there are many Senators who are anxious to get to work on those important joint committees.  Perhaps we could arrange that our own Committee of Selection should proceed immediately to appoint our Members to this joint committee and should convey that to the other House.  I want to say quite clearly that I find it very difficult to understand the delays arising on these committees and I assure the House that I will proceed to make very strong representations on the Seanad's behalf.  I hope to be able to report to the House at an early stage on what exactly the situation is and how soon we can expect to be able to start the work of the committees mentioned.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is the first step in the procedure for establishing this committee.  This is also the first occasion on which a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas has been established to consider Ireland's co-operation with developing countries and I take the opportunity to outline the background to this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1973, Ireland's assistance to developing countries, known as Official Development Assistance (ODA), has risen substantially as a result of two <Col N="1184" /> events.  The first was our entry to the European Community which involved us for the first time in the Community's programme of assistance to developing countries which was itself undergoing rapid expansion at the time.  The First and Second Lomé Conventions with what are now 60 African, Caribbean and Pacific States, both of which were signed during Irish Presidencies of the Council of Ministers, are the central elements of the Community's extensive and, indeed, progressive programme of aid to developing countries.  In 1980, the Community's total aid to developing countries will amount to more than £1 billion of which Ireland's contribution will be approximately £6.7 million.  This makes our involvement in the Community's aid programme the single largest element of our Official Development Assistance Programme.</P>
    <P>The other event that occurred was the establishment by the Government in 1974 of a bilateral aid programme.  The Government recognised that, despite the economic and social problems that existed here, Ireland was still one of the wealthiest nations in the world in terms of income per head and this imposed on us an obligation to make some contribution to those countries which were immeasurably poorer and less developed than ourselves.  A bilateral aid programme, it was felt, offered us an opportunity to make a direct and distinctively Irish contribution to development.  In this way, the special skills that we in Ireland possess could be used to help other countries and peoples in a way that would complement and reinforce the tremendous and unstinting work done by Irish missionaries in developing countries over the years.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the bilateral aid programme was introduced, the Agency for Personal Service Overseas was established to promote and sponsor personal service by Irish people in developing countries.  As I have said, the traditional contribution to development by Ireland was her people, in the form of missionaries and lay volunteers, sponsored by the churches and the voluntary organisations engaged in development.  It was felt that through APSO, official recognition <Col N="1185" /> and support could be given to this work.  Since its inception, APSO has been funded entirely by my Department by way of a grant-in-aid under the Vote for International Co-operation.  This year, APSO'S grant-in-aid will amount to £1 million.  I am glad to acknowledge the work of Senator Whitaker, a member of this House, who was the first chairman of APSO and guided the organisation successfully through its formative years.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, it was decided to concentrate the bilateral aid programme on a small number of target or priority countries.  Given that Ireland could never hope to provide very large sums of money in absolute terms, it was felt that this method offered the best prospect of maximising the effectiveness of our aid.  It would enable us to build up a coherent programme in full co-operation with the host countries.  It would also enable the public here to see more easily the results of our efforts which would help to secure the necessary public support and encouragement for the programme.</P>
    <P>The bilateral aid programme is now concentrated in four &lsquo;priority countries&rsquo; in Africa &mdash; Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan &mdash; which between them receive more than 60 per cent of annual expenditure.  The other major elements of the programme are the co-financing of development projects with Irish voluntary organisations, assistance for the education and training of students from developing countries and development education, of which I will say more later on.</P>
    <P>From modest beginnings in 1974, the bilateral aid programme has expanded rapidly.  Expenditure in the first year was £275,000 and this will rise to £5.15 million in 1981.  Ireland also gives aid bilaterally in other ways besides the bilateral aid programme.  I have already mentioned the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, which is funded entirely by the Government. In addition a provision is made for disaster relief, by which bilateral assistance is given in the immediate aftermath of a disaster such as famine, earthquake or war.  A small grant is also given to Gorta towards its administrative expenses and the costs of the advisory <Col N="1186" /> council on development co-operation are met from development aid funds.</P>
    <P>Taking all these areas together, total expenditure on bilateral aid this year will amount to over £6.5 million which makes this the second largest element of our ODA programme after the EEC contribution.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the bilateral aid programme is the extent to which many State, semi-State and private bodies spanning all sections of the community are involved in its implementation.  This has been deliberately encouraged in order to make the development effort as truly national as possible and to foster greater interest in and awareness of developing countries in the country as a whole.  Many of the development projects financed under the bilateral aid programme are implemented by Irish State, semi-State and private bodies.  Most of these projects are technical assistance projects since they involve mainly the provision of specialist skills accompanied in some cases by small amounts of capital aid.  The choice of this type of project is both logical and sensible for a small country like Ireland which, as I have said, can never hope to be a major donor of capital aid.  What we can offer are the skills and experience that we have gained in the course of our own development which, we should all remember, did not pre-date that of developing countries by very long.</P>
    <P>From my own experience of developing countries, I am quite satisfied that this sort of assistance is in great demand and highly effective and this may go some way towards explaining the enthusiasm with which certain sectors in Ireland that are not directly concerned with developing countries &mdash; for example the higher education sector and the semi-State bodies &mdash; have become involved in our bilateral aid programme.  Clearly, these bodies regard their co-operation with developing countries as both productive and rewarding.  People who serve in developing countries come back to Ireland enriched by their experiences abroad and better able to serve the community to which they return.</P>
    <P>If I have concentrated on bilateral aid so far, it is only because of our extensive <Col N="1187" /> involvement in this area at governmental and non-governmental level.  But the field of development co-operation is a much broader one involving many complex and interrelated issues in the areas of food production, energy, commodities, trade, industrialisation, and finance. The European Community has repeatedly emphasised that co-operation between developed and developing countries and the intensification of international economic relations serve the interests of all countries.  In an interdependent world, it is not simply a matter of increasing the flow of aid funds to developing countries, it is much more a question of integrating them as rapidly and as fully as possible into the global economic structure.  Many of these issues have far reaching implications for our own domestic economic and social policies that must be faced up to.  There are no easy solutions and, indeed, in some cases it is not entirely clear what the real problems are.  But we must begin to look at the full range of development problems in a coherent and integrated manner. If we have learned anything from the Brandt Report it is that, in the long term, the problems of developing countries are also our problems and if we are to look forward to a world of peace and prosperity for all countries and peoples, we must start now to search for solutions to these problems.</P>
    <P>The importance and the complexity of these issues make it both necessary and desirable that Members of the Oireachtas should consider them in greater detail than has been possible hitherto in debate in the Dáil and Seanad.  For this reason the Government have decided to establish a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas to provide a forum for the comprehensive analysis and discussion of these matters.</P>
    <P>The proposed terms of reference of the joint committee are set out in the motion before the House.  The joint committee will cover all aspects of Ireland's relations with developing countries in the field of development co-operation including the Government's Official Development Assistance Programme.  I would like to assure the House that both I and my <Col N="1188" /> Department will be anxious to give the joint committee every possible assistance in its work.  I would propose to brief the joint committee personally from time to time and supplementary briefing material will be supplied by my Department as required.</P>
    <P>I believe that this joint committee will make a very positive contribution to the formulation of Government policy in this field.  There already exists the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation whose function is to advise the Government on all aspects of development co-operation. I would see the joint committee as complementing and reinforcing the work of the council by involving in this process the Members of the Oireachtas who are, after all, most directly concerned with the economic and social issues which are at stake here.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another way in which I believe this joint committee can be of benefit and that is in the area of development education.  I have already said that there is very extensive involvement in our bilateral aid programme on the part of many organisations and individuals in Ireland.  There is also a great deal of public support for developing countries as evidenced by the very large and sustained financial support given to the voluntary organisations in this field. Despite this, however, a recent survey conducted by the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation revealed a widespread lack of awareness among Irish people both of the problems of developing countries and of the Government's response to these problems.</P>
    <P>Clearly, therefore, there is an urgent need in Ireland for development education, the objectives of which are to increase public awareness of and interest in developing problems and to disseminate information on the Government's Official Development Assistance Programme. It is, I believe, of vital importance that public consciousness of development problems should be increased. As I have said already, many of these problems will have very direct repercussions here in Ireland in the future and we need to begin the process of educating people on the nature and extent of the <Col N="1189" /> problems involved and the ways in which we can help to solve them.  We also need to inform the public of what is already being done by the Government on their behalf through the official development assistance programme.  In this way, the necessary support and encouragement for its expansion will be generated.</P>
    <P>The involvement of Members of the Oireachtas in the development education process is of fundamental importance since their attitudes and opinions have considerable influence on public opinion. If Members of the Oireachtas take a sepcial interest in the problems of developing countries, their lead will be followed by others, which will result in a greater level of awareness of these issues among the public.</P>
    <P>I believe that the joint committee, by focusing attention on this area, will have a very considerable impact on the formation of public opinion and, in this way, will greatly increase Ireland's contribution to development co-operation.</P>
    <P>In establishing this joint committee, the Government are seeking to build on the foundation of Ireland's co-operation with developing countries which has been laid by generations of missionaries and lay workers and by successive governments, particularly since 1973.  Ireland's reputation as a friend of developing countries is very high.  Our history has much in common with many of them and the development problems which we ourselves encountered not so long ago are similar to the ones which they are facing at present.  The goodwill that these countries have for us imposes an even greater responsibility on us to contribute to their development from our own resources and to use our good offices and influence to encourage the adoption of global policies that will lead to a more equitable sharing of resources.  I believe that the joint committee will have a vital and integral role to play in this process so that Ireland's contribution to development will fully live up to the expectations that exist both at home and abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of all parties in relation to co-operation with developing countries is a positive one and I <Col N="1190" /> welcome this proposal.  Our record in regard to developing countries has been somewhat erratic.  We have, in some cases, given a good deal of help in one way or another but, on the other hand, any time when we sit down to consider what we have contributed we must feel that we have fallen far short of what we should be doing.  That is party due to our limited finances and resources but we should be able to do something better than we have being doing in the past.  We have the advantage, as the Minister said, of being not far removed from the category of a developing country.  We appreciate many of their problems and for that reason we are in a position perhaps to do something more than wealthier countries to help them by knowing what their problems are.  The idea of setting up a joint committee is a good one.  It is important that the Members of both Houses should have a part to play in such a joint committee. It will perform a very useful function. It is an area in which a joint committee can be very useful.  We have on many occasions in the past discussed the desirability of setting up more committees, more joint committees, of involving both Houses more closely in the administration of the affairs of the country and the administration of this kind of procedure. This is an area in which a joint committee can play a very useful part.  I welcome the setting up of this joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with pleasure that I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Keeffe, to this House.  The setting up and establishment of a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas on Development Co-operation is an enlightened step and one I wholeheartedly welcome.  In recent years it has become clear that many Members of the Oireachtas are especially interested in matters relating to the Third World and they would be glad of an opportunity to extend their involvement in this area.  Their ability to do so, however, is somewhat hampered by the complexity and diversity of the issues involved and by the pressure of business with which they are involved in their separate <Col N="1191" /> Houses.  This does not permit a comprehensive analysis or discussion of these issues.  The joint committee would respond to this need by providing a forum in which Members of the Oireachtas could increase their knowledge of development co-operation and critically examine Ireland's role in relation to the Third World.  By the end of 1981 the Government will have contributed £18 million to the Third World and the intention is progressively to increase the amount each years so that the UN target of .7 per cent of gross national product can be reached by 1990.  It is important, therefore, that the joint committee examine all aspects of the Government's relations with developing countries, including the development co-operation programme and the policies pursued by the Government in international forums.  It would be useful too if the joint committee might be empowered to receive oral or written submissions from the public and from the various individual and non-Governmental organisations which engage in development co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presentation of reports to both Houses of the Oireachtas would stimulate further thought and, hopefully, action and would increase interest in and awareness of development programmes among elected representatives and, through them, enlighten the public generally. Prior to 1973 almost all of Ireland's official development assistance was directed to the multilateral agencies of the United Nations such as the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the World Bank.  In 1974 the bilateral aid programme was set up with the primary objective of channelling official Irish aid in the most effective way possible to the poorer countries of the developing world and to the populations of those poor countries.  Since 1974 the bilateral element has been built up as a proportion of overall overseas development aid in order to make a direct, distinctive and identifiably Irish contribution to development. Within the bilateral aid programme assistance is concentrated on four priority countries, Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania and Sudan, which between <Col N="1192" /> them receive over 60 per cent of the total expenditure.</P>
    <P>When entering upon any programme of development aid it is vital that there should be a cohesive, on-going and united approach.  In the past there has been a tendency for a lack of continuity from successive Governments here.  This stop-go approach has been bad enough when witnessed here in Ireland but its effects on development work overseas has been demoralising for the very many enthusiastic and dedicated field workers and has left in its trail uncompleted projects and disillusion.  The establishment of this joint committee of the Oireachtas would help to even out the bumps and hollows which are an inevitable part of political change at this end and ensure continuity of input.  We must guard against building up expectations in Third World countries which cannot be realised. It is well high impossible to reconstitute a collapsed project especially in a co-funded situation.  We must never lose sight of the fact that at the bottom line is the child in an impoverished rural area who must eat clay when rice and beans run out, or the man or woman roaming the slums of a crowded city street searching garbage for something to eat.</P>
    <P>We must be totally honest in facing up to our motives for involving ourselves in development co-operation which has become big business.  Contracts have been won from the World Bank and UN agencies as well as from Governments of developing countries.  DEVCO, the State agency set up to help the various State and semi-State bodies to bring in revenue from development projects have been very successful with an annual gross turnover of IR£22.7 million.  There is nothing wrong with Ireland benefiting commercially from such projects so long as the developing countries also benefit.  However, if programmes become confused with commercial considerations they are no longer part of a legitimate development co-operation programme.</P>
    <P>In recent years the havoc created in developing countries by multinationals destined to seek markets and outlets for powdered milk products has been highlighted. In countries with poor educational <Col N="1193" /> structures, poor sanitation and lack of controls, bottle feeding with powdered milk products has become the cause of epidemics of malnutrition and infant mortality.  This kind of commercial activity is criminal and we in Ireland must ensure that we are not a party to it and we must face up to the economic and political consequences of, perhaps, scaling down our milk production and at least ensuring that every tin of babyfood leaving this country proclaims the use of powdered milk as only second best after breastfeeding and that every tin carries a clear picture of a breastfeeding mother. I put these forward as suggestions.  It might also be a very good idea if instructions on such tins were printed in the language of the country in which they are to be sold, printed in large, clear type and not as a small footnote in indecipherable print.</P>
    <P>We may be faced with painful choices as a result of our involvement with the Third World, and in the euphoria surrounding aid programmes it is time that a cautionary note was sounded.  It may be that the time has come when we in Ireland could be faced with job losses in order to provide a job in the Third World.</P>
    <P>In the area of sugar production, which has been topical of late, we must recognise that here we have an antiquated high-cost production system while in the Third World sugar can be produced relatively cheaply and is an export cash crop providing much needed foreign exchange.  We must be big enough to take the long-term view and not be limited by purely narrow and selfish considerations. If this means changing and diversifying our own system, so be it if our commitment is real and if our motive is true.  All aid must have a built-in redundancy factor as we ought to be involved in encouraging self-development and self-reliance. Aid must be related to the needs of those whom we intend to help and should not be influenced by ego considerations and the desire for self-perpetuation.  We must always examine the quality of the aid and be quick to recognise the type of aid which is a mere dumping of a surplus of production on an unsuspecting populace.</P>
    <P>In the past, and indeed it still happens. <Col N="1194" /> Third World countries have been flooded with toothpaste and toothbrushes all of which are worse than useless in this context and lead to black marketeering and a resultant disenchantment with the entire process of aid.  We must guard against making the same mistakes made by the United States Government some 13 to 15 years ago.  Because of the economic recession, the cold breath of which we all feel whistling around us, there is a danger that we in the developed world might be tempted to get out of our difficulties at the expense of the Third World.</P>
    <P>Many developing countries are even now feeling the pinch as the commodity market shrinks.  This temporary expedient is in the long run counterproductive and would result in widening the gap which is ever increasing between the rich countries and the poor.  We must maintain our awareness that our future depends in part on our relations with the Third World.  It would be hyprocisy or blindness on our part if we claimed to foster industrial and agricultural development without making room for Third World exports on our market.</P>
    <P>In the long run we are talking about changing the world order and seeking for a new and fairer system.  The first step should be made through greater public awareness of the problem of development. This would range from a very detailed understanding of the complex issues required by the policy makers to the general awareness that the man or woman in the street would need if he or she is to give general support to the policies. In a democratic society this general awareness is critical.  Awareness should be followed by sufficient concern for the problems to cause leaders to do something about them and the people then should support what their leaders have decided to do.  The concern could be based on the feeling that it is right to give, from a sense of duty to others or, as is probably more common, a recognition that it would be to everyone's benefit to solve the problem.  The setting up of the joint committee is one further step along the road and if it works well &mdash; and I am convinced that the goodwill and the <Col N="1195" /> enthusiasm is abundant &mdash; it can only contribute gainfully to our objective.</P>
    <P>We must never forget that the number one problem of the 20th century is the fact that two-thirds of the human race languishes in hunger and misery and elicited this anguished cry from Dom Helder Camara, Archbishop of Recife in Brazil, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is a pity that as we begin to reach out towards the stars we leave behind us on earth an absurdity, a folly; more than two-thirds of humanity living in sub-human conditions and suffering from poverty and starvation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of this joint committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome his appointment as the first Minister with specific responsibility for development co-operation.  It was part of the policy of the Labour Party that such appointment be made and that goes also for Fine Gael. A common programme was reached amicably on this issue and the continued co-operation and common position of mind on this issue augur well for the future.  I welcome, consequently, the statement by the Leader of the Opposition which would seem to indicate that the committee when fully established and operational will have the potential of performing a positive role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is that role?  It is not about arbitration as to how much aid we will give each year to different countries and it is not about arguing over which country is most in need of aid or which projects are most beneficial and most productive in terms of the best way in which that aid can be made.  On the countrary, the concept of aid in the post-second oil crisis of this decade is totally outmoded.  We are, in short, on a much more heroic and a much more necessary course and that is to attempt to change, in co-operation with others, the present world economic order which is the real legacy of the imperialist world of pre-World War II Europe and the globe.  This is expressed in detail in the document on development <Col N="1196" /> co-operation published by us.  It is not enough for the western world to give people political freedom to form economies and to presume at the same time that the imperialist economic structure which propped up the relationship of colonies through the metropolitan countries can be maintained in its original form.</P>
    <P>I concur with what Senator Ryan said in relation to the kind of history we have had in recent times in our approach to developing countries to the extent that we have been through the process of self-liberation and of developing our own country.  That is a unique experience as far as western Europe is concerned and it is one to which the developing countries have referred on many occasions.  But the task now, whether it is within the EDF or within the EEC or through the various United Nations agencies and specifically through our own highly effective bilateral programme, is to make a positive contribution in terms of development co-operation which will result in a transformation of the world economic order.</P>
    <P>Though I listened with great interest to the very well argued and clearly passionate contribution from Senator Bulbulia, it is as much in the interest of our grandchildren yet to be born as it is in the interest of the unfortunate people to whom she referred, that such a transformation in the world economic order be brought about.  I say this because we share this rapidly increasing load together.  They will live out their future together in harmony or alternatively they will destroy each other in a globe which is now confronted with a population explosion of unprecedented levels, of food scarcity of disastrous proportions, of rising unemployment, of environmental destruction on a scale that was unforeseen in the Book of Genesis, and of the ever-pressing prospect of nuclear holocaust. It is against that background that this committee is being formed in this House today.  This is a small but nevertheless significant step.  I should like to congratulate the Minister of State for the way in which he has moved in his Department since his appointment in July.</P>
    <P>When the Brandt Report was published more than two years ago, an initiative <Col N="1197" /> was taken in this House in conjunction with Members of the Dáil and in consultation with the NGO organisations around the country to try to establish the most effective way in which the provisions and the recommendations of the Brandt Report could be implemented in this country &mdash; what kind of contribution Ireland could make.  It was agreed that a seminar should be held in the premises of Leinster House to which a very important contributor to the Brandt Commission Report, Mr. Jan Proule, a former Minister for Development Co-operation in the Netherlands, came as the guest speaker.  That seminar which was organised by CONGOOD played a significant role in leading to the commitment that is now being shared by all sides of this House towards the establishment of this committee.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to speak on this motion on behalf of the Labour Party as it is the result of a long time of trying to get this committee off the ground.  I am pleased that the Minister of State has seen fit on every occassion to pursue this matter strenuously.</P>
    <P>If I may, without having to open up an entire debate on development co-operation because the purpose of such a joint committee is to transfer such a debate to the committee and not to maintain it on the floor of this House, I should like to remind Senators, particularly new Senators, that the last Seanad, in contrast to the other House, did have a substantial and very good debate on the Brandt Report.  The report of that debate makes extremely constructive and positive reading for the kind of work that the new committee should concentrate on.</P>
    <P>In my experience the question of development co-operation in this country either between the political parties represented in the Oireachtas or alternatively between the politicians, the Government of the day and the NGOs, has tended exclusively to concentrate on the scale of money being made available for the ODA programme.  The argument has invariably resolved itself down as to whether we are on target to meet the UN projection of 0.7 GNP by 1990, or whether we have slipped behind in our <Col N="1198" /> commitments in gross money terms.  It has become, regrettably, a political football which is of no benefit to the process of establishing a commitment towards the transformation of the world economic border and it has far from contributed to the need for a positive debate on development education.</P>
    <P>I should like therefore to suggest to members of the incoming committee as well as to both sides of the House as I have suggested before in Estimate speeches on Foreign Affairs in the other House, that we should once and for all, on an all-party basis, clearly agree a timetable within which the commitment to meet the UN target of 0.7 per cent would be agreed by all parties.  I suggested this to the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, as much for his protection from the ravages of the Department of Finance as for the ideals embodied in the suggestion.  It is to ensure that all Ministers for Foreign Affairs and now Ministers of State having responsibility for development co-opertion, will be able to present to those people in the Department of Finance who seek to cut back expenditure from time to time that in this context this item of expenditure is not up for negotiation, that it is a fixed cost, a fixed item.</P>
    <P>There are two benefits to such a proposal if it is accepted by, in effect, the Fianna Fáil side of this House because both Labour and Fine Gael have in their common programme committed themselves very clearly and explicity to such a timetable.  First, it will remove the sterile argument about amounts of money. Secondly, it will enable the Minister to concentrate more energy on what is increasingly the core of the matter in our multilateral and bilateral programmes, that it is not, in effect, the quantity of development co-operation available, but its quality and concentration.</P>
    <P>We have now got, as the Minister so rightly pointed out in his very accurate and succinct summary of our participation both in multilateral and bi-lateral terms, enough experience on the ground both in the host countries, the four priority countries that he mentioned, and also in the large number of countries in which <Col N="1199" /> NGO agencies are involved, to be able to evaluate from direct experience how effective certain kinds of programmes are, how wasteful some others are and where we can learn from mistakes and how we can reallocate resources.</P>
    <P>In that context the decision of APSO to facilitate Comhlamh, the association of returned voluntary workers from overseas, is an extremely good one as they, from their unique field experience, can make a positive contribution to the cyclical process of experience in development education.  Therefore, I would like to envisage a situation where this committee will open their doors very quickly to those organisations who have specific experience on the ground and who have dealt with the kind of problems that Senator Bulbulia talked about.  It is not sufficient for an Irish Government with the best intentions to despatch to a disaster area tins of powdered milk or whatever if it has the negative effect to which the Senator correctly and accurately referred.  We will not know this kind of thing until such time as we hear it directly ourselves from those people who have worked with Concern or with APSO and who have tried to make something positive out of the contradictions with which they were confronted.</P>
    <P>I hope that the committee will respond very quickly to the wealth of experience that exists in this country now from the missionary orders, who were the first in the field and who by and large transformed themselves from purely theological organisations to largely development co-operation organisations, and that they will respond also to the many lay people who have been motivated by humanistic compassion and concern for their fellow global citizens.  We can learn from them and put their knowledge to more effective use on the ground with our development co-operation programme.  It is only right and proper to recognise that the NGOs themselves have attempted to make our jobs easier in forming CONGOOD, which is their federation of such organisations, so that they can present to those people who wish to listen a clear coherent voice that brings together in a <Col N="1200" /> co-ordinated way their collective experiences and focus this on the ears of those who wish to listen and who have some active power and some possibility of influencing the quality, nature and shape of our multilateral and bilateral aid programmes.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I wish to repeat my personal thanks to the Minister of State for his dedication in this field.  It augurs well for the future.  I wish to re-emphasise for the record of this House that it is as much in the interest of Ireland today and of Ireland's children tomorrow that a programme of development co-operation should be consolidated and expanded between us and those portions of the globe which at present are impoverished. There is a very positive commercial self-interest in this and we should recognise it and indeed celebrate it because the developing countries throughout have approached us openly and honestly on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual interdependence.  We should respond in like manner and like kind.  We are in the business of dismantling not the trappings of an imperialist order but the actual structure and its framework which locked the vast majority of the world's population into a position of subjection and exploitation to a minority of the globe's population.</P>
    <P>We in this country, more than most, know what the physical struggle for political liberation has been about in this century. In fact history will show that we were the first colony to gain independence in this century.  The struggle to get political independence was comparatively easy in contrast to our continuing struggle to achieve economic independence and economic prosperity.  For that reason, we have a very common interest with former colonies who now wish to provide a level of development and prosperity for their own people.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that politicians on all sides of the House, both at Oireachtas level and around the country, become instruments in the process of development education itself.  Until such time as we educate ourselves and our constituents in regard to the interdependence between the economy of this country <Col N="1201" /> and the economies of the rest of the globe, we will put perpetually at risk the prospects for a real transformation of the world economic border.  Until such time as everybody, every school child in the country and every politician at local and national level, is made abundantly clear of that crucial relationship and crucial interdependence then, regretfully, I suspect that development co-operation will always be seen as marginal extra which can be cut back in times of difficulty, as something which is an extension to the main task facing this country.  It is my sincere belief that increasingly as international capitalism stumbles now through its third crisis in ten years and shows every prospect of hitting two or three more before the end of this century, the task of constructing a new international economic border becomes absolutely critical.</P>
    <P>We have a very simple and stark choice on this global aspect.  Those who have some ability to change the world economic system must move fast now through the halls of the EEC, through the halls of the United Nations and attempt to do it in such a way that when the change comes about some degree of order, of justice and of compassion are applied to that transformation.  If we fail to do that, then the people to whom Senator Bulbulia referred will do it for us and I fear that it will be done with less of the compassion and less of the concern which we would like to see exercised.  We ignore this issue at our own peril and it is for that reason that I say that the concept of aid is totally defunct.  This is a committee which is about the salvation of our children and our children's children.  It is no longer about giving aid and assistance to black babies.  I warmly welcome its establishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this motion by the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation, Deputy O'Keeffe.  With the other Members I should like to congratulate him on his appointment.  It is the first time we have had him here in the Seanad and I should like to congratulate <Col N="1202" /> him, too, on his activities since taking up his appointment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the motion, Senators Bulbulia and Quinn have said much that I would have liked to say, so I will not repeat their remarks.  However, I would like to refer briefly to a few points.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that this motion is being introduced in the Seanad because certain initiatives have been taken here in particular during the tenure of the last Seanad.  The debate took place here on the Brandt Report and the Members of the Seanad were very active in the other committee meetings which took place within this building at that time on issues relating to the Third World and to the Fourth World.</P>
      <P>I support completely Senator Quinn in his point about the level of support which we, as a country, should give to the developing countries.  I support him in his view that this question of the level of aid from this country is a case apart from all budgetary issues.  The relative problems which the country has in a year such as this are irrelevancies when we compare our wealth in the broadest terms with the poverty and misery in the Third and Fourth Worlds.  Regardless of whatever arguments there may be within Government Departments about the level of support for various projects from various semi-State bodies, this is an area apart where we should seek to increase the level of support from this country each year to the recommendations of the United Nations by 1990.  This is in line with our commitments prior to the election.</P>
      <P>The support is already significant and I am glad to see the institutionalising of support for the Third World through the setting up of this committee.  It is really the institutionalising of a great deal of voluntary work which has been done historically by people from this country for centuries.  I should like to pay a compliment to the work which has been done by missionaries and by lay volunteers over the years and more recently by the lay volunteers who are members of the various organisations concerned with this issue and who have been in the forefront of this particular aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> In so far as the mechanics of the committee are concerned, I should like to express one reservation I have regarding the format which is suggested.  It is in contrast to the format, for example, of the joint committee which is proposed for the secondary legislation of the European Communities and which is also on the Order Paper today.  I would like to suggest an amendment that might be made.  I am not certain what the mechanics of it are at this late stage since it is on the Order Paper, but in the European Communities committee there is provision whereby Members of either House not being members of the joint committee, be allowed to attend meetings and to take part in the proceedings without having a right to vote.  There is no such proposal in the motion before the House. I should like to see an amendment in that area.  Perhaps that could take the form of a separate motion later on.</P>
    <P>In part 3 of the motion for the proposed Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, it is stated that representatives of the Assembly of the European Communities who are also Members of either House, be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and to take part in the proceedings without having the right to vote.  That section would also be desirable in this motion especially since there is a link-up in this area of development aid between this country and the European Economic Community, through the support which is going formally through the Community to the developing world and of which Ireland pays its due share.  Those are two points I would like to put to the Minister. It would be a better format if these two sections were added.</P>
    <P>I am completely in favour of the establishment of the committee.  It is appropriate that it should be introduced in the Seanad because of the debate that took place previously on the Brandt Report. Indeed, the Brandt Report points out, as Senator Quinn said, that this is not an entirely altruistic activity of which we are speaking.  We are talking about the immense problems which the world and <Col N="1204" /> the established order will face in the future unless we have the wit, not to mind the altruistic and the moral sense, to help these poverty-stricken countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>From this side of the House I would like to support Senator Ryan in welcoming this motion.  Indeed, I would like to welcome my fellow countyman from west Cork, the Minister of State, on this occasion.  The motion is an excellent idea.  It deserves support and goodwill from all sides of the House and from the entire nation.  This brings us as a comparatively wealthy nation into this sphere, to help those less off people in other parts of the world.  We, as an independent nation, have a proud history in what we have done, maybe not with money, but we have certainly done it with missionaries over centuries and, of late, with lay volunteers.  That is something that should be encouraged because we have coming from our schools and universities better, more highly educated young people who are eager to do something for the less well-off in the world.</P>
      <P>We could show also with our independence what inter-dependence is necessary between nations of the world.  Senator Quinn put it quite clearly that every nation is depending on another nation.  I would not like to get hooked up on the idea &mdash; I am not one who advocates the capitalist system &mdash; that only the people in the capitalist systems suffer from jolts, revolt or anything else.  This is a worldwide phenomenon and it affects every nation in progressive times.  That could be broadened without using any ideology or with any special tag on it.  I would be a bit worried about what Senator Bulbulia said regarding the sugar beet industry. It is very laudable to promote industries abroad but I suppose charity begins at home.</P>

      <P>Quite true.  One of the American Presidents said &ldquo;You do not make one nation richer by making another nation poorer&rdquo;.  We have to look after our home store first.  Perhaps in years to come those types of changes will <Col N="1205" /> take place.  It is not an outright criticism. It is a very laudable project.</P>
      <P>We have much to offer by way of personnel to help develop the social, economic and educational spheres in these other countries.  We have the available talent and, by bringing together the Members of the Oireachtas to monitor and initiate schemes &mdash; special priority schemes &mdash; in these other developing countries, it brings the nation closer to getting something done.  We might be paying lip service but lip service is no good unless we see that the projects are carried out.  That is why it is so important that Members of the Oireachtas should be involved.  Much could be said about this matter.  I wholeheartedly welcome this motion and I assure the House that it will get every co-operation from this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to extend a warm welcome to the Minister coming into this House to speak to the motion establishing this joint committee. In view of the very valuable comments and remarks that have been made by a number of Senators, with which I very much agree, I do not intend to speak at any length on the merits of having a Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the whole area of Ireland's approach to development co-operation, the existing programmes and our commitment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to confine my remarks to two issues.  First of all, I think it is important to reaffirm the need to take the global commitment by Ireland to meet its targets as a member of the United Nations, out of the annual budgetary considerations of any Government.  I very strongly support the stand that Senator Quinn has taken previously and that he has reiterated this afternoon on that issue, that this has to be an all-party commitment and that it has to be one that will be firmly adhered to.  This is more necessary than ever because over the next decade in this country we will be faced with very critical economic problems.  We will be faced with tough decisions, with having to select between services, with having cutbacks, perhaps in our own services and <Col N="1206" /> what we would desire to do for our population.</P>
    <P>It is important, despite that and because of our broader understanding of the relationship between ourselves and developing countries and because of the far greater needs of developing countries, that we sustain that as a fixed item to which we are committed across the political board and which is not subject to paring or cutting back because of our own internal budgetary problems.  I say that because there appears to be some apprehension about a potential cutback in our committed aid to developing countries. I hope that it is not in any way an accurate leak of the present discussions. I hope that that commitment will be very firmly adhered to.</P>
    <P>This is, as already has been mentioned, a new parliamentary development.  It is a new committee.  It sprang, I think it is accurate to say, out of a realisation by some individual Members of the previous Oireachtas, helped and sustained and even prompted by the representations made by individuals working in non-Governmental organisations who are concerned with developing countries under the general umbrella of CONGOOD.  It arose, first of all, out of a personal interest and commitment by some Members of the previous Oireachtas.  Although there were others involved I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record of the Seanad a tribute to Senator Ruairí Quinn who was the convener of these meetings.  It is fair to say that out of those discussions between Members of the Oireachtas and those with active service in developing countries, members of organisations concerned with the problem, the realisation grew that if we were to have a structured knowledge of and response to the critical need for a greater economic and political commitment by developed countries to the developing world, a commitment identified in the Brandt Report, it would not be enough to have these informal discussions and gatherings.  There had to be an actual Oireachtas committee.  This was part of the political commitment of the parties who are now in Government.  We have the terms of reference before us today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> I would like now to turn to those terms of reference and to concentrate on the kinds of problems which may arise and might be helped by having a response from the Minister on them at this stage. First of all, there is the problem of staffing. Any new Oireachtas joint committee being established has teething problems. We only have two other comparable examples.  The first is the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, the second is a Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister has in mind potential staffing for this committee and if that staffing will be available if, for example, the Dáil were to pass its own expendiency motion following this motion and if we were to have the establishing motions next week: would it be possible for the committee to get under way either this side of Christmas or certainly in very early January?  Has he thought through what the staffing requirements might be?  To some extent, it might be a matter that he might feel might be left to the members of the committee. I do not think so.  It is a kind of catch 22 situation.  Unless there is staffing and back-up there at a very early stage then the committee can be much slower to address themselves to the important terms of reference which they have been given and be able to operate properly. There has to be at least a core staff there from the very beginning with a possibility of further staff if that is required.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it seems to me that the terms of reference of this committee, although they are very broad and the Minister has made it clear in his speech, which I welcome, that they are and that they concern every aspect of Ireland's relations with developing countries in the field of development co-operation, are also quite unspecific.  If you look, in comparison, at the terms of reference of the EEC committee, that committee has a statutory function under the European Communities (Amendment) Act of examining the statutory instruments implementing European Community legislation.  Then, the committee have rather specific terms <Col N="1208" /> of reference to look at the draft regulations and directives, to look at the regulations or directives when passed if they wish and to look at the statutory instruments and report thereon.  That is just because of the nature of the work of the committee but it is specific.  The committee divide into sub-committees related to the subject matter and apply themselves to that task.  If you look at the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies that committee examine a number of State-sponsored bodies out of the potential pool that is within their terms of reference.  Again the committee have the specific job of looking at different State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is possible, because of the nature of this committee, to give them that kind of specific terms of reference. For that reason, it is all the more important that the committee have a fairly clear perception of what they will do so that they do not spend too long pondering on what they might do.  The allocation of experienced full-time staff at an early stage is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Another important issue is the precise relationship between this committee and other bodies.  The Minister mentioned the advisory council on development co-operation. How does he see the advisory council and this committee working together?  Is it envisaged that there would be any structured relationship between them or would it be a question of members of the advisory council attending from time to time or making written submissions to the committee?  It would be useful to have some idea of what is intended there.  Clearly, the joint committee would have the power to look for assistance from the Minister's Department and from the Minister, who indicated in his speech that he would come along to meetings of the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee also could invite written and oral submissions from the various non-Governmental organisations involved on the ground in development co-operation or like Comhlamh, returned workers from developing countries. It would be helpful if we had some idea of the kind of structure which might be placed on this.  Perhaps it is up to the <Col N="1209" /> joint committee when constituted to select their own order of priorities, but we have not selected them in any structured way.  We have not spelled out in these terms of reference what the areas might be.</P>
    <P>One area that the Minister refers to in his speech, which is a very important area which would warrant particular discussion, is the whole question of education, not only of ourselves, by participating in a committee and having that committee report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, but also development education as a matter to penetrate into the curriculum of schools, to become something which is very much part of adult education and the perception of our society for the reasons already eloquently argued by other Senators.  This in itself is an important area which the joint committee will no doubt consider.</P>
    <P>There is one small difference that I have &mdash; it may only be an unintended difference &mdash; from the comment made by Senator Ruairí Quinn when he said, in response to the contribution by Senator Bulbulia that this was not the time to have a full scale debate on development co-operation, that we were setting up a committee in order to remove the debate from the floor of the House to the committee. I think I know what he meant, but I am not prepared to see the debate removed from the floor of the House.  I want to see more debate on the floor of the House, but more structured and focussed debate.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this joint committee, as they are empowered in their terms of reference, will rather quickly identify priority areas, examine them, look to the public service side, the Minister and also non-Govermental organisations, individuals, any expertise which is in our community and then report to both Houses. I hope we may have a series of debates during 1982 on different reports of the joint committee.  In that regard, it would be necessary to have a procedural mechanism in order to trigger off a debate.  We have done this before with the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and a motion has been tabled in this House providing <Col N="1210" /> that if the report contains a recommendation within itself that it is important that the attention of both Houses be drawn to the report, that this would trigger off a debate on the next sitting day during the Government time in the sense of business ordered by the Leader of the House for that day.</P>
    <P>It is very important that when the joint committee are established and identify their own order of priorities, their own areas for discussion, report on them and submit the report as they are entitled to do, we should also debate those reports. That is very much part of the whole idea of the background to the establishment of this committee.  One of their primary functions is that in the process of educating ourselves we create a greater awareness and a greater sensitivity to the immense challenge.  I agree very much with the sense of both the immensity and the urgency of the challenge which is posed by the present economic order and by the needs and legitimate aspirations of developing countries.  It will be in the context of the very tough decisions which we will have to take ourselves over the next few years and of the need for ourselves to have a greater sense of social justice, a greater redistribution of income, a greater fairness in our society, that will be a part of the measure of the nature of our response to the needs and aspirations of developing countries.  The two are very much linked.  If we fail in one I would not have great hopes of how we might do in another.  There is a learning process in relation to both.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the areas I wanted to cover.  The relationship of the Minister with the committee was something which I very much welcomed in his introductory speech because, again, the experience of the other two committees, the EEC committee and the State-sponsored bodies committee, has been that there has not been an active participation by the Minister in the particular ministerial seat at the time.  Possibly we had two members who had meetings with Ministers for Foreign Affairs during the existence of the previous joint committees on EEC legislation.  That is a great pity.  It causes a certain loss of political <Col N="1211" /> impact and the committee tends to become too technical, a committee for the technical details of particular measures. I feel that it will be important to hold the Minister to the commitment that he has made today on record, that he as well as his officials, will pay fairly frequent visits to the joint committee when it is in operation and that there be the kind of discussions which will inform at a political level as well as a technical and factual level the members of that committee so that they in turn through their reports may inform the House and the public generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister and the Committee. The Minister will take away with him some measure of the interest in this House and from the anxiety of Members to speak and the very high level of contributions which have been made.  Given that high level I do not intend to speak long.  Most of the points I might have made have already been made much more eloquently.</P>
      <P>The significant passage in the Minister's speech and the one which has been the theme of many of the contributions is when he says:</P>
      <P>If we have learned anything from the Brandt Report it is that in the long term, the problems of developing countries are also our problems and if we are to look forward to a world of peace and prosperity for all countries and peoples, we must start now to search for solutions to these problems.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, one thing to theories about world aid, the Third World and the fourth and fifth worlds <i>ad infinitim</i> and to have very vague feelings and vague expressions of solidarity with the suffering peoples of those areas.  What this committee do and what they reflect in the attitude of the Government and the Minister is a practical approach and one in which we get down to the actual nitty gritty of doing something of a concrete nature to change the situation as it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The passage which I quoted from the Minister's speech emphasises the fact that we must approach these problems <Col N="1212" /> from a global point of view in the sense that these problems will not in the long run be solved or approach a solution until such time as we begin to see the world as one unit, as a system which is out of control and over which we, as the human race, must eventually exercise some control. We must eventually exercise this control at some stage if it is not to take us all to disaster.</P>
    <P>Some Members may have seen in the magazine section of one of our Sunday papers very recently a dramatic picture. It was in connection with a collection of photographs of various kinds.  This was printed on the front page of the magazine section.  I am not incidentally referring to another picture which was printed on the front page of another part of the same newspaper and was, possibly, equally horrifying in a different way.  The picture to which I am referring was that of an extremely well-fed northern hemisphere hand holding in its palm what one did not realise for a few seconds was another human hand, which looked like something which was not human.  Just in passing, I might suggest to the Minister that if it is feasible to do so he might consider taking a copy of that photograph and using it for publicity, because few things in recent months have emphasised to me at any rate so much the disparity.  I said a dramatic picture in the beginning but it was not a spectacular or sensational picture. It gave its message in no mean terms.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome this committee because, though we have the commitment in personnel through the missions, through overseas aid to countries other than our own, it is very easy for us as an island to subside into parochialism.  We must realise that these problems are, as the Minister said, our problems.  If we do not move towards a solution or towards something more than a gesture to the solution of these problems they will rise up and confront us closer than they have ever been before, and the methods which will be used to bring about a resolution of these problems may not be methods that will conform with our aspirations.  I welcome the Minister very much again. I welcome this move and I look forward <Col N="1213" /> to the reports which this committee will produce.</P>

It is right that both Houses of the Oireachtas should monitor closely and with understanding and sympathy, conditions in the Third World about which, with others, I have spoken several times in this House, and the manner in which we in Ireland, one of the 26 richest countries in the world, can help towards the fundamental and permanent alleviation of the poverty, ill-health and deprivation that afflicts such a high proportion of mankind.</P>
      <P>I like the description &ldquo;development co-operation&rdquo; which is to be preferred to &ldquo;aid&rdquo; or &ldquo;assistance.&rdquo; There is no room for paternalism or superiority in this matter. We are all engaged in what has rightly been described as reciprocal human development.  We have as much to gain from this as we have to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank sincerely the Senators for the very warm and unequivocal welcome they have given to this proposal.  It is clear from the number of contributions and indeed the quality of the contributions that the response from this House to this proposal will ensure that the work of this committee, as far as the Members of this House are concerned, will be a very useful one.  I should mention that, in fact, in the proposal itself we hope to have 11 Members of the Dáil and seven Members of Seanad Éireann.  In fact, this provides a proportional weighting in favour of the Seanad, which is one that is fully justified in the context of the response which I have had to the introduction of this motion here.  I should also say that I was very glad, from the initial response of Senator Ryan on behalf of the Opposition, to note that this particular proposal has all-party support.  He felt that this <Col N="1214" /> was a committee which could have a lot to contribute.</P>
      <P>In a very thoughtful speech Senator Bulbulia highlighted many of the problems of developing countries which the joint committee will have to consider.  In particular she mentioned the need for development education which would in my view be an important aspect of the committee's work.  I do not want it to be thought that development education is a hobby-horse of mine, but I cannot underestimate the importance which I put on the need to bring home to the public in general the extent of the issues involved and the type of response which is required from this country in facing those issues.  Senator Bulbulia mentioned the question of oral and written submissions. Of course the committee will have power to receive both oral and written submissions.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn dealt in a very broad way with the whole problem, and this is as I would expect from someone who for many years has had a very deep interest in the area of development co-operation. I agree fully with him that the problems of developing countries are no less our problems and that the ways in which these problems are tackled will have far-reaching implications for us in Ireland. I hope that the joint committee will consider these very complex and wide-ranging problems in detail.  I also agree with Senator Quinn that we must give as much attention to the quality of our aid as to the quantity.  Since our contribution will never be very great in absolute terms irrespective of how close we are to the UN target, it may be that the quality of our aid merits greater consideration than the amount.  The suggestion of an agreed all-party timetable for reaching the UN target is one of the matters to which I hope the joint committee will address themselves and I look forward to receiving their views on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn also highlighted the fact that we ourselves in the not too distant past have gone through both the liberation and development process.  Many Members may not be aware of how recently we were classified as a developing country.  Just before this debate I was <Col N="1215" /> reading a new paper by Dr. Helen O'Neill on Irish aid wherein she brings out the fact that as late as 1964 this country received development aid from the United Nations special fund which was used to help the establishment of An Foras Forbartha.  This brings it home to us that we have just moved from the developings category.  In discussing these problems I always point this out as giving us a closer link with developing countries, countries who understand the fact that we have just emerged from this situation. Accordingly it should give us greater understanding of the problems which now confront them.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia also mentioned the question of commodities, and this was taken up by Senator Cogan.  There are complex issues here which may result in conflicts within our own society where it is possible that in some way measures which are taken to help the developing world may have repercussions at home. This is one of the most important issues that the committee should consider.  We should at as early a stage as possible try to foresee these problems so that the necessary steps can be taken to safeguard the interests of any workers who might be affected by developments in the future so we would be prepared and would not be faced with the grim choice of either helping a struggling industry in the Third World or of putting some of our own workers out of work.  This joint committee can help in looking ahead at these problems and advising on the steps necessary to ensure that this will not be the grim choice, that we will be able to help that struggling industry in the Third World having taken the necessary advance measures here to safeguard our own people.</P>
    <P>Senators will know that the common fund for commodities is the focal point of the international effort to manage commodity markets in a manner equitable to producers and consumers.  I am happy to say that the International Common Fund for Commodities Bill, 1981 was introduced in the other House and circulated last week.  Senators will shortly have an opportunity to discuss it also.  I am anxious <Col N="1216" /> that the Bill should be approved quickly so that Ireland can ratify the common fund agreement by 31 March 1982.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised a number of very specific issues which I should deal with in detail.  She referred to the background and the prompting, as it were, of the voluntary bodies &mdash; CONGOOD in particular &mdash; in the past.  I am quite happy to acknowledge that there were such promptings which to a large degree stimulated my own interest and decisions in this matter.  Prior to the last election we had a number of meetings in the House which were of an informal nature arranged as a result of promptings from CONGOOD with the organisational efforts of Senator Quinn.  This is the informal background.  I felt that despite the good results that were achieved from such informal meetings, it was necessary to have a structured joint committee so that we could take the matter further from here.</P>
    <P>On the question of staffing, I have certainly considered this matter.  Basically the secretariat will be provided by the parliamentary staff.  I am glad to say that during discussions they agreed to provide the necessary service despite other pressures on them.  Briefing material will be supplied by my Department and, as I mentioned in my opening address, from time to time by myself.</P>
    <P>On the question of the terms of reference, I deliberately felt in better to have these rather broad and non-specific.  The function of the committee will not be to produce a single report on a single aspect of development co-operation.  They will look at all aspects of development co-operation and report as often as they wish.  They will also, to a large degree, decide their own priorities.  I feel it would be wrong to limit the areas which the committee could consider by specifying particular items in the terms of reference and I thought it better to have the terms of reference on a broad basis.</P>
    <P>On the question of the relationship between the committee and the advisory council, it will be appreciated that the advisory council have been doing very good work since they were set up.  Their main function is to advise the Government <Col N="1217" /> on all aspects of development co-operation. I would see the joint committee having a role which would complement and reinforce this work.  As to the relationship between the advisory council and the joint committee, this is very much a matter for both bodies to discuss and decide.  I do not envisage such a relationship being a formal, structured one.  I would expect that the members of the joint committee would arrange some pragmatic, flexible relationship with the advisory council.</P>
    <P>I also share Senator Robinson's concern that reports of the joint committee should be fully debated in both Houses. I believe also that adequate time for these debates should be provided and I will be concerned to ensure that this is done as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell put his finger on the central core of the whole question of development co-operation when he highlighted the fact that the problems of the developing countries are our problems. This is a thread which ran through many of the speeches, but it was highlighted in particular by Senator O'Connell.  It is an aspect that is not fully realised in this country.  One of the jobs of the joint committee through the aspect of development education will be helping to spread this message loudly and clearly throughout the country.  Senator O'Connell also mentioned the commitment of missionaries and voluntary bodies and I take the opportunity to agree totally with his sentiments in this regard. The trail has been blazed by the missionaries and voluntary bodies but I have a feeling that perhaps in the past this effort and commitment of the missionaries and the voluntary bodies were to some degree used as a camouflage for official indifference and inactivity.  We pay tribute to the work of the missionaries and the voluntary bodies and certainly point out that any official efforts in this area will not be in any way to supplant that work but rather to extend it, reinforce it and supplement it in any way possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker rounded off the debate and in my opening address I paid particular reference to his role as founding chairman of APSO.  Senator Whitaker <Col N="1218" /> summed up the whole debate in stating the need for greater interest in development co-operation.  I have no doubt that the joint committee, when established, will contribute in a major degree in the years ahead to ensure that there will be greater understanding of the need for co-operation with developing countries.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and support.</P>

      <P>I understand that the traditional understanding of life insurance under our law is derived from the 1936 Insurance Act.  This, however, will be superseded by this council directive which defines life business somewhat more widely.  I have one example in mind, permanent health insurance, which is not part of the understanding of life insurance in our existing law but is part of it in the terms of this council directive, and the intention is to adapt or amend the understanding of our own law in such a way as to clear this up and allow the Irish Life Company or a subsidiary that may hereafter be formed, although that is not now in contemplation, to get into this kind of business, to do the kind of business not in the terms of the 1936 Act but in terms of the EEC directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>When replying to points on the Second Stage the Minister confirmed <Col N="1219" /> my presumption that the basic reason why, in our law and in the EEC directive, a separation is prescribed between life assurance and other insurance business was that nobody wanted to have life assurance funds, and particularly life assurance policies, in any way harmed by losses that might arise on general business.  He went on to say that the point does not really arise in this particular case because what we are doing here is to &ldquo;remove the barrier as far as it concerns the acquisition by this largely State-owned company of a subsidiary engaged in non-life business.&rdquo; I do not follow the Minister's point.  Does he mean that because this is a largely State-owned life business the danger of loss to life policy holders is not present? That leads me to ask him what would happen in the unlikely event of losses being incurred by the subsidiary?  Would the parent company have to bear those losses?  Or is the subsidiary, as it were, cocooned and would have to meet the losses, if any, on its own without recourse to the parent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly understood when replying to the Second Stage debate that the second of the two alternatives the Senators mentioned was the case, that the parent company and the subsidiary would be cocooned against one another.  I tried to make it plain that this, so far as the instant case is concerned bearing on the Irish Life Company, was exceptional.  So far as any subsidiaries themselves are concerned the ordinary principle of the 1936 Act will continue to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite know why the Senator says &ldquo;fear&rdquo;.  I have inquired about this in the specific case of the company we are talking about and I am assured &mdash; and I have no reason to suspect the genuineness of the assurance &mdash; that there is absolutely no intention at the moment of doing such a thing.  What the company are mainly concerned with <Col N="1220" /> is making it possible by the passage of this Bill to alter their memorandum in such a way that they can validly acquire a company doing non-life business.  There is no present intention to move any further than that.  That does not exclude the possibility that the company may subsequently form such an intention and in order to make room for that possibility and not have to come back to the Seanad and the other House to get fresh legislation, these plural alternative phrases have been inserted.  There is no intention at the moment, or even in so far as I know any prospect of an intention, to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1978 Insurance (Amendment) Act allows licensed banks to undertake certain types of guarantee on suretyship business which were previously regarded as insurance business. Some doubts have arisen as to whether within the specific terminology of the 1978 Act licensed banks are able to guarantee loans from the European Investment Bank to industrial development projects in this country.  The EIB require such bank guarantees for their loans and it was the intention when the 1978 Act was introduced to facilitate, <i>inter alia,</i> the giving of such bank guarantees.  The position under the 1978 Act as regards European Investment Bank loans is open to interpretation.  The difficulty which has called forth this section arises from the use of the word &ldquo;sole&rdquo; in section 2(1)(a)(ii)(c) of the 1978 Act in the phrase &ldquo;the sole obligation of the person under the contract&rdquo;.  In the case of EIB loans it is common for an obligation <Col N="1221" /> which is quite subsidiary to be part of the understanding.  The person borrowing the money here is not only required to repay the loan but also to undertake other conditions such as completing the project on time as per schedule.  Under the existing law since it would not be a sole obligation it would not fall under the benefit of the scheme.  The proposal is to replace the word &ldquo;sole&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;primary&rdquo;.  Clearly the repayment is the primary obligation but there are subsidiary or ancillary obligations and we are anxious to make sure that no problem can arise in respect of the EIB loans through the fact that there are these subsidiary or ancillary obligations.  They are secondary to the principle which remains the repayment of the money outstanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a general comment on section 4.  Irish Life have come a long way from the time of the penny policy when they assured sums as low as £8 or £10, which were important. Nowadays they are talking in terms of premiums as high as £1,000 and more. My hope is and I am sure it is the hope of the Minister, that they will enter this general field with the same fair and enthusiasm as they have shown over the past number of years in the life field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this is the appropriate moment to say this but I share the Senator's hope and I would hope for more than that.  This Bill is before the House in the context of a world radically different from the world of 1936 or 1938.  It is a world dominated as far as we are concerned by the European Communities and by the right to the free passage not only of goods but also of services between countries.  The Irish insurance companies already are feeling the effect of this right being taken up and vigorously exercised by foreign insurance companies, not only from Britain.  There <Col N="1222" /> has begun to appear activity on the side of continental insurance companies.  I made it quite clear in an entirely informal contact with Irish Life that the Government would be very anxious that any freedom of movement for services such as the provision of insurance should not be one way.</P>
      <P>It would be a very unfortunate attitude and completely out of keeping with the aggressive and progressive spirit with which this company has grown over the last 40 years if we were to regard ourselves as merely the victims of this freedom of movement.  I hope that Irish companies, despite all the difficulties which they may have such as a small base, linguistic problems and an unfamiliar setting and so forth, may with the same vigour take up the opportunities in this enormous market which the European Communities situation now offers them.  We may find, gradually at first but subsequently in greater measure, large slices of continental insurance business as well as British insurance business being held by Irish companies here.  Income for this country in the form of insurance premiums is the very same in terms of our balance of payments and of bringing wealth into the country as earnings through exports or tourism.  Certainly the Government to which I belong &mdash; and I am certain any alternative Government we may ever see here &mdash; will be very anxious to give whatever help they can to the Irish insurance business as a whole in pushing its services, offering its facilities and promoting them in this enormous market of over 200 million people to which we now have access.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) For the purposes of this Act &lsquo;the inability or failure of a tour operator or travel agent to meet his financial or contractual obligations&rsquo; means that, in relation to that tour operator or travel agent, one or more of the following events has occurred&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a petition is granted by a court for the compulsory winding up of the business of the tour operator or travel agent,</P>

      <P>This amendment effectively sets out the circumstances in which a call could be made on the tour operator's or the travel agent's bond.  It is accomplished by linking the term inability or failure on the part of the operator to recognise insolvency situations, bankruptcy, winding up, liquidation or other process.  In addition, under paragraph (f), there is a general discretionary clause under which in a crisis the Minister could on reasonable grounds call in a bond to protect or rescue customers without having to wait for the completion of the formal processes which are mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) and which, of course, as the House will see could take quite some time before they might be initiated, and consequently there could be a situation where speedier action would be required, and the reserve power is contained under the paragraph (f).  I might mention that the insurance industry who, of course, are going to be very actively involved in the implementation of this Bill through the provision of the bonds, asked for clarification of the Bill to clarify what will constitute inability or failure on the part of an operator or agent.  This point was made by Senators during the Second Stage debate and this amendment is designed to meet those queries and to meet that general position.</P>

During the Second Stage debate a number of speakers had the impression from the existing wording of sections 4 and 5 that there would be only one licence that would cover both operators and agents. This is not so.  There will be two separate and distinct licences.  A person who is doing both types of business will have to be licensed separately.  An operator's licence will not permit a person to operate as an agent and <i>vice versa.</i> The purpose behind these amendments is to make that crystal clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention to confine the licences to members of any particular trade organisation.  Any person who wants to set up as a travel agent will be entitled to have a licence, provided he meets the criteria that have been established &mdash; financial, administrative and other criteria.  Whether that person then seeks and is admitted to membership of a particular trade association will be a matter for him and the association. But the fact that he might not be a member of the association will not make the people dealing with him any more vulnerable <Col N="1226" /> than those dealing with members of the association, because at that stage the licensing régime will have been introduced and it is from that licensing régime that the protection will come, not from membership of the association.  At the moment membership of the association is not a guarantee, but almost, to a member of the public who is trading with a firm that has had to pass certain criteria established by the association.  After the legislation is passed, membership of the association, as far as the public is concerned, will not be so important to ensure protection for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference to the fact that the licence shall remain in force for such period as the Minister thinks fit. Is it a once off licence, or is there a renewal each year, or two years or something like that?  On the question of licence fee, and having regard to what the Minister said a moment ago regarding two licences if a person was engaged in both the travel agent and tour operator business, is there a lesser fee for one as opposed to the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the duration of the licence, the Bill does not set out the duration.  Our minds are running on the basis of an annual licence.  In order to effect the protection we all want to give to the public, the licences will have to be renewed annually, and the necessary criteria could be reviewed annually. At the end of a trading season, when a person comes to apply for his new licence, one will see if it has been a successful trading season and if there will be financial viability for the next season. Biennial licensing could be risky, and it is the intention at the moment to have licences issued annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of fees has not been set.  The general idea is that the level of fees to be set would pay for administration.  Where a person is both an operator and an agent, there could be something equivalent to a quantity discount; there could be some concession, and the fee for the agent &mdash; because it would be a smaller operation generally and the inspection would be less detailed &mdash; could be smaller.  This is <Col N="1227" /> a matter of detail that will be worked in the regulations, and, as I emphasised on Second Stage, they will be worked out in consultation with the trade to devise something that will be satisfactory to the trade.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the problem of a person carrying out a business, as a tour operator or a travel agent but not actually coming within the definitions laid down in the Bill?  I am thinking of somebody carrying on an airline business.  I am aware that it is possible for some people to get registered as airlines and carrying on businesses which, as far as the general public are concerned, are practically indistinguishable from a travel agent, but not carrying out business as a travel agent.  Has the Minister given any consideration as to how these people would be affected by the Bill?  If he has not given such consideration already, would he do so now or when this goes before the Dáil?</P>

      <P>Before the Minister answers, I would like to ask him about Aer Lingus.  They took over a tour operation <Col N="1228" /> business and a retail business.  I mentioned this fact last year when the Minister was present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the last point first.  I remember the Senator mentioning this at the time.  Aer Lingus act as agents and possibly operators through subsidiary companies.  Thus subsidiary companies would fall within the Bill and would have to be licensed under the legislation &mdash; not Aer Lingus itself, but its subsidiary companies who engage in the tour and travel business.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Senator O'Leary has been considered in the drafting of the Bill and has had a lot of consideration. Carriers are specifically excluded from the Bill.  There are many reasons why it would not be practical to include carriers within the ambit of the Bill though they might on occasions be acting as tour operators as defined in the Bill.  We defined a carrier as being a person whose principal business is the provision of transport.  In the type of operation the Senator has in mind it could be clearly shown that the principal business would not be the carriage of people.  Some of the people he has in mind might find it hard even to produce a single aeroplane or a single ship, and it would be very difficult for them to show that carriage was their principal business if they had no means of conveying their customers. It would be quite clear on examination that they were, in effect, travel agents trying to masquerade as an airline.</P>
      <P>The definition defines a carrier as a &ldquo;person whose principal business is the provision of transport ... on aircraft, vessels or other modes of transport owned and operated by such persons;&rdquo;.  That is tight enough to exclude the type of operation the Senator is worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be a tiny loophole here for a person who is engaged in the carrying business who is not one of the flag-carriers with which we normally associate airlines.  There are none of them operating here at present.  If one were to come and were operating principally as a carrier and doing some tour operating as well, he would not come within the ambit of the Bill.  For a person to be at <Col N="1229" /> that level of business where he would comply with the definition of carrier, we would be happy enough to allow him to carry on and I would not reckon there is any real loophole.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister for confirmation of a point which relates to a discussion we had on Second Stage? I suggested the desirability of flexibility in the kind of conditions that might be imposed.  The Minister agreed that the point was valid.  I am really asking whether the licences granted under this section may be different in their terms and conditions from one licensee to the other.  Is that how one should read subsection (4)?  Where we refer to regulations later, the conditions that shall be complied with before a licence is granted are conditions quite apart from those that are in the licence and are probably intended to be standard conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator said, I dealt simply with the point he raised. When we are talking to the trade about the details of the regulations, we will obviously consider whether that point can be honoured.  There would almost certainly be a constitutional difficulty if one were to devise differing licences for the same trade.  A person who has a licence with more onerous terms than his competitor might feel he had valid reason for objecting on constitutional grounds, that the law was not bearing equally on all citizens and that the rule of law to that <Col N="1230" /> extent was being infringed.  There might be a real difficulty there.  But when we come to draft the regulations and, as I said, that will be done in close consultation with the trade who, after all, are the people who will be affected by this, we will see if they suggest that there is a particular stratum within the trade that is not in a position to carry all the conditions we would like to impose.  Having thought about it I would have some doubts as to whether we can get out from under the constitutional difficulty.</P>

      <P>This is the most important section of the Bill as it deals with the question of appeals.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Minister proposes to revoke, other than pursuant to section 10 of the Act, or to vary the terms and conditions of, a licence granted under this Act, he shall notify the holder of the licence of his proposal and of the reasons for such proposal and shall, if any representations are made in writing <Col N="1231" /> by such a holder within seven days, consider the representations.</P>
    <P>In other words it is saying that in pursuance of section 10 of the Act, the revocation of licences in certain circumstances, of financial and contractual obligations, there is no duty on the Minister to notify the person whose licence he is going to revoke.  I can understand that there would not be a possibility of giving seven days' notice, but some notice should be given.  I would like the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (5) dealing with appeals says:</P>
    <P>an appeal shall not lie in any case where the Minister refuses to grant a licence to an applicant who does not comply with the provisions of section 13 of this Act....</P>
    <P>Section 13 talks about the bond.  I am very concerned that when the Minister revokes a licence under section 10 it will stick.  The Minister has substantially met the point that I was going to make by defining in the first amendment the inability or failure of a tour operator.  His defination of financial or contractual obligations under section 10 &mdash; the wording in section 10 is not now the same as is used in amendment No. 1 &mdash; may not be the same as the tour operators' definition. The operator may seek to go to court and say that the Minister, in arriving at his decision, said the operator had a contractual obligation to certain clients and he did not believe he had that obligation. The Minister could be put in the position of having to say why he thought there was a contractual obligation.  Then we are back to the court area and whether the person had a contractual obligation, or it was valid for the Minister to revoke the licence.</P>
    <P>In so far as section 9 limits the ability of the applicant to go to the High Court on the question of his contractual or financial obligation and whether he has fulfilled it, that might be a mistake and might give rise to difficulties in the future. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <Col N="1232" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot exclude any aggrieved person taking an action to declare that the Minister has unlawfully or wrongfully exercised the authority or the powers given to him under the Act. That is a basic legal right and cannot be excluded.  If some aggrieved operator or agent felt that the exercise of ministerial powers did not conform with the Act, he would be entitled to challenge the exercise of that power and go to the court for whatever relief would be appropriate, irrespective of whether he would go by way of appeal or not.  In this case that would not arise, he would not be going by way of appeal, he would be challenging the very basic nature of the ministerial act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of whether there should be notice of revocation when it falls to be made under section 10 &mdash; similarly there is a notice provided for under section 9(1) &mdash; I think we can distinguish section 10 particularly because it envisages a situation where there has been a failure or inability by the operator or agent to meet financial or contractual obligations, or the bond has had to be called in, or payment has had to be made from the fund.  If we take it that there has been failure to meet a contractual or financial obligation, the revocation in that situation could happen very quickly and suddenly, and I think it would be entirely appropriate that it would, and that the person would not be left trading for any length of time after such an event occurred.  The danger of such a person continuing to trade justifies not giving notice of revocation in that situation. Should the revocation fall to be made consequent to the bond having to be called on or payment to be made from the fund, obviously those two events would only take place quite some time afterwards and there would be a history of collapse, there would be no need for notice.  Subsection (5) excludes an appeal in the two circumstances mentioned in the subsection.  I am advised that it is legal to include such exclusion.  I had some doubt about it, that it was a constitutional right for every citizen to have an appeal to the highest court of the land, <Col N="1233" /> but I have to accept the advice of my legal betters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kearney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the points made by Senator O'Leary.  While the Minister's legal advice may be that section 9 (5) is all right, I wonder as to the advisability of the provision and what there is to lose by allowing an appeal. Senator O'Leary dealt fairly adequately with section 10, but section 13 provides that, where an agent has entered into an arrangement satisfactory to the Minister, it is purely at the Minister's discretion.  I suggest that it would be better if there was a provision in this Bill, even if it is not legally essential, to allow an appeal from the Minister's decision.</P>
      <P>The second point I wanted to make was on section 9(2).  Why has the Minister decided that the appeal should lie to the High Court rather than to perhaps the Circuit Court?  There might be certain advantages in allowing the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  One could envisage situations where this appeal would need to be made fairly quickly, and one would have the problem of the cost of an appeal to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The High Court is the appropriate forum for an appeal of this nature where the subject matter is of substantial gravity.  Secondly, I would not agree with the Senator that the speed of the matter would be better served in the Circuit Court, because the Circuit Court serving the town of a particular agent might not sit in that town for three months after the event.  There could be difficulties of delay there.  The delay in the High Court at the moment is on the jury side, there is not any delay for matters such as would be dealt with by this appeal.  I think the High Court would be a more suitable forum having regard to the gravity of the matter and it would be speedier.  It would, as the Senator said, possibly be somewhat more expensive, but I think only marginally more expensive than an appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> Subsection (5) provides that an appeal shall not lie in any case where the Minister refuses to grant a licence to an applicant who does not comply with section 13.  Section 13, of course, is the very heart of the new protective regime.  It is the one which makes provision for the bond.  If a person is refused a licence because he has not a bond I think it is fair to say that that should be that.  It is hard to imagine a situation in which an appeal would lie because he has not provided a bond.  If it is a question of an insurance company refusing to give him a bond that would be a separate matter between the aggrieved party and the insurance company. The other situation in which an appeal does not lie under subsection (5) is in a case where the Minister revokes a licence pursuant to section 10.  Again, section 10 envisages a situation of collapse. If a business has collapsed an appeal at that stage could be well nigh vexatious.  That is not to say that a person who may have suffered difficulty having his licence revoked might not come back into the trade at a later date when his financial house is in order and when he can satisfy the Minister, and the bonding company, or can satisfy the bond requirements, that he is a fit person to recommence trading.  It might be difficult to do but there is no prohibition on it.  Section 10 envisages a collapse and section 13 envisages a person unable to meet what is <i>sine qua non</i> of the entire protective scheme.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the various points made by the Minister.  Of course, he is quite right that section 10, the one I specifically drew attention to at this stage relates to section 9 because it is referred to in section 9.  It is obvious that there is a need for speedy action if the circumstances which give rise to action under section 10 even occur.  The need for speedy action there must be agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 is referred to section 9(5) and it is very hard to discuss one without referring to the other, they are inter-related.  I want to refer to subsection (1) where it is not proposed that there should be any notification to a person who under section 10 is going to have his licence revoked, or even to vary the terms of the licence.  If the Minister is to take an action like that it is reasonable that he should indicate to those against whom he is taking the action the reason for the action.  I am not suggesting that he should give seven days notice because it is quite impractical under the provisions contained in section 10 which is referred to in section 9 (1).  It is quite unrealistic to expect him to wait for seven days while the notice is, in fact, germinating, or something like that.  The Minister should be under some statutory obligation to serve upon the people against whom he is taking the action some notice which would not delay &mdash; this is the kernel of the point I am making &mdash; the ability of the Minister to take immediate action.  There is no reason why we could not impose an obligation on a Minister to serve a notice on somebody and give him power to act immediately having served the notice on somebody.  Where a Minister proposes to revoke or vary a licence under section 10 there could be a clause dealing with that.  There could be a clause to the effect that the Minister may revoke a licence at any time after such notification.  In other words, he would not have to wait for the seven days but he would have to give notification to somebody to tell him that he is revoking it under section 10 and give the reason he is revoking it, that his financial or contractual obligations were not being met or whatever.  That is the point I want to make under section 9 (1).  I will make a different point under section 10 when we reach it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is implicit in section 10 that notice be given to the defaulting agent because obviously in a situation of a failure to comply with financial or contractual obligations customers and an <Col N="1236" /> agent would be involved.  The agent would know that the Minister is involved because the Minister's men would have been in inspecting under the earlier Act. The whole scene is such that the agent will be informed and could not avoid knowing that he is going to lose his licence. It is inherent in it that that revocation is notified to the agent and inherent too following the inspection when the Minister satisfies himself that the failure and inability have occurred.  That can only be established by involving the agent and his books and his staff.  The agent will be well aware of what is going on and what is about to happen to him.  I do not think there is any need to alter that because after all that there will have to be some sort of a formal notice.  The Senator adverted to the question of notice.  The Minister must give notice because it is a mandatory direction to him.  He is required to revoke any licence granted in situations envisaged in section 10.  That is why section 9 (1) does not provide for the giving of the seven day notice as would be necessary in other cases.</P>

      <P>I had a problem with section 10 as it was originally because there was no definition of financial and contractual obligations.  The Minister has gone a long way in an excellent amendment which he brought in, No. 1 &mdash; unfortunately I was not here when he was discussing it&mdash;in which he said that for the purpose of this Act the inability or failure of a tour operator or travel agent to meet his financial or contractual obligations meant... and he went through a whole list of things which are very worthwhile. The problem I am trying to highlight is that the Minister will have to make a decision on certain items &mdash; it is covered in (f) of the Minister's previous amendment, which states that: "the Minister has reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is my interpretation of the legislation as it now stands that somebody who feels aggrieved could go to the court and say that the Minister had unreasonable grounds for acting under section 10 and as a result of that the prohibition in section 9 no longer is valid because somebody can go under this new definition and say the Minister has not acted reasonably. I understand that while appeals are pending licences will continue to exist.  I am trying to avoid the situation where the Minister feels he has to act under section 10.  Because the question of the Minister's reasonableness or otherwise could be a valid issue for the High Court to decide, the Minister's decision could be the subject of an action in the High Court.  Pending the decision of the High Court as to whether or not the Minister acted reasonably the safeguards which section 10 is designed to bring into the Bill could be frustrated by the fact that it appears that under section 10 somebody can go to the High Court and have the matter examined.  It is not something on which I have any specific amendment to make.  I merely make the point that the Minister might like to have a look at it and consider how best to tidy it up if he considers it needs tidying up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I will have a look at it in the light of what the Senator has said.  My first reaction is that the sequence that would take place would <Col N="1238" /> obviate the difficulty the Senator envisages. The sequence would start with the Minister believing he has reasonable grounds and then revoking the licence.  If the person from whom the licence is revoked feels that the Minister's grounds are unreasonable he can seek court action to quash the Minister's action on the ground that he did not have reasonable grounds, that it is an injustice and all the rest.  That action would not have the effect of reviving the licence.  The licence would stay revoked until the termination of the High Court proceedings, and if they terminated in favour of the aggrieved agent then obviously the revocation would not be lawful and the licence would have to be restored.  That is the way it would work.  The licence would stay revoked until such time as the person succeeded in showing that the Minister did not have reasonable grounds, and consequently the public would be protected in the meantime.  I will, however, check to make sure that there will be no question of a person seeking an injunction to restore the licence pending the hearing of the action.</P>

Nevertheless we have a problem to deal with here.  We have hard evidence of the nature of the problem, how quickly it can suddenly come to light and how necessary it might be for a quick inspection even at an unorthodox time. Because of the evidence we have from what has happened there are people operating or who might want to operate in this scene but who might not be reasonable. It might behove the supervising authority to go in quickly and at a time which might seem to the rest of us to be unreasonable but might be the most effective time in order to find out what we want to find out to protect the public.

      <P>On the point raised by Senator Bolger about reasonable time, certainly, the Minister has a very valid point because there are few areas of commercial activity that the expression of fly by night activity could be more appropriate.  If one is dealing with scoundrels <Col N="1240" /> even the middle of the night could be reasonable.  I will go along with what the Minister had said if he said reasonable time during the day.  A reasonable time merely puts a restraint on those who are carrying out the functions under the Bill to behave in a reasonable fashion.  It may well be that going in at 3 o'clock in the morning is reasonable if there are circumstances to lead the people to believe that 8 o'clock or 10 o'clock in the morning would be too late but there are other circumstances in which going in at 3 o'clock in the morning might be totally unreasonable.  The Minister should think about the matter and give it some consideration because if we can put into our legislation the general tenor that it is progressive then the necessary powers which are given to the organs of the State must at all times be reasonably carried out, even if that reasonableness differs with regard to the particular circumstances in which they call to be acted on.

If we were to put in the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;&mdash;as the Senator rightly said there have been some peculiar people operating in this trade &mdash; they might refuse us on the grounds that it is not reasonable for them at that moment and then there would be litigation to decide if it was or was not reasonable.

    <P>In subsection (1), page 7, lines 30 to 32, to delete "have, during the period of validity of the licence entered into, <Col N="1241" /> or who may enter into, contracts with him relating to overseas travel" and to substitute, "during the period of validity of the licence, enter into contracts with him relating to overseas travel".</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment to subsection (1) is to tidy up the original wording of section 13.  The amendment makes it quite clear that the bond is to protect travellers who book their holidays during the period of validity of the licence, whether the holidays occur during the same period or after the licence period has expired.  The amendments to subsections (4) (b) and (4) (d) are just to improve the original wording, again by clarifying the intent.  The new subsection (4) (b) would allow the bond to be used to reimburse a customer for reasonable expenses incurred, for example, if he was to be evicted from his hotel while on holiday.  The new subsection (4) (d) would allow the Minister to send out an officer of the Department to look after the interests of the holidaymakers evicted or in danger of eviction.  The wording in subsection (4) (b) provides for reasonable expenses because we do not want to have serious claims for consequential loss and have long arguments about the remoteness of damage and all the rest.</P>

      <P>On section 13, as amended, I do not think that the trade is quite as clear about the bonding of the retailer, or the small travel agent, as the Minister seems to give the impression. There seems to be a member to member agreement between the travel agents and the tour operators.  I understand this is the association and the group the Minister said last week that he had met in Limerick.  When bringing in a Bill of this nature I wonder why a much stronger line was not taken to try to control those fly-by-night agents.  I find that they can still be there without licences or bonds.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>There is another point about legal liability.  This is where the small travel agent has strong views on why he should be bonded, or asked to be bonded, in the same manner as the big tour operator.  When one goes to a travel agent in a small town in the country, or anywhere, that agent books the ticket by telephone.  The deposit is put in the post that night.  Therefore, the legal liability for anything that may happen is directly on the tour operator or the wholesaler. The retailer, the agent, only has responsibility while he is waiting for an acknowledgement. That would amount to about <Col N="1243" /> two days and not 14 days as mentioned earlier.  The tour operator has the legal responsibility once the order is laid or the ticket booked and a deposit only paid, not even the balance.  I understand we are talking about a bonding figure of £5,000 to £6,000 and how could a small travel agent see his way to pay such a bond?  Maybe my figures are wrong.</P>
      <P>Last week I pointed out that the small agents had set up this funding of their own and that by February or March it will be £120,000.  By next July that fund will be £200,000.  If I book my ticket this evening with a travel agent in Ennis his responsibility to me will be until tomorrow only when that ticket is booked with the tour operator.  From there on it is the tour operator's responsibility.  Is it right to ask &mdash; or maybe the Minister is not asking &mdash; the small agent to pay this large bonding?  I notice that the Minister has not mentioned a figure on the bonding or mentioned a figure on the licence.  The Minister said they agree with everything in this Bill, but travel agents and the small business people who are in the travel business here are not agreeing with the bonding arrangement.  Is there a looseness in this Bill that will cover the control of people who might do a duck and catch people?</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy for the arguments Senator Honan has put up.  No section of this business, whether they be at travel agent or tour operator level, should be exempt from some type of bond.  It would be possible in theory for fly-by-nights in that area to offer a package which could be fantastic.  Many people in good faith would lodge their deposits and overnight the person could go.  I feel that the bond must extend to cover all involved in the business.  I am concerned about the availability of the bonding.  The Minister in his reply to Second Stage assured us that he was aware that there were people in this business, and not altogether in the insurance business, who were prepared to come up with the necessary bonding.  If he would like to elaborate further on that I <Col N="1244" /> would be pleased to hear it, because I want to be sure that bonds are available. I want him to consider the possibility of having a different type of bond, possibly a two-tier system of bonding, one for travel agents and one for tour operators where the risk is much greater.  I would like to know if it is administratively possible to do that, and how in fact would the bond be applied.  On what basis would it be applied?  Is it to be on the turnover of a person's business or on what basis do we determine that a bond is necessary? If it is to be based on turnover what percentage does the Minister envisage? Have those details been worked out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Honan in her comments with regard to the division between the wholesaler, that is, the tour operator, and the ordinary retailer, the ordinary travel agent.  There is no question that the real problem in this business has been the failure or the collapse of tour operators. We have had that in the past.  The retail agent is a completely different animal. Those retailers who are members of the International Air Transport Association have been well and truly vetted by the airlines.  If a person purchases a ticket from them in the month of November the money must be paid to the airline by the 15th of the following month.  In this way there is clear control, a clear hold by the airline on the travel agent.  Failure to pay over that money would result in the agency being cancelled.  Therefore I am stressing that the airline has a very strong hold.  Furthermore I understand that the retail agent people have a fund of something like £82,000 or £85,000 which is substantial and which would more than compensate for any failure of a retail person.  The case for not bonding the retail agent is valid.  The tour operator can work the price of his bond into the overall package but the unfortunate retail person cannot do that.  Any bond premium that is paid by the retail agent is eating into his profits.  He cannot pass it on to the consumer.  I was heartened by what the Minister said in his Second Stage speech in this regard because it led me to <Col N="1245" /> hope that perhaps the Minister was having second thoughts on this one.  He said that the Bill gives the Minister for Transport power to apply the measures proposed to tour operators at first and to travel agents later.  Perhaps the Minister at this late hour would consider reviewing the retail agent person in the light of what Senators have said.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris referred to a package. Anyone who organises a package holiday must be treated as a tour operator, but the honest retail agent who has been in business and dealing with different airlines is a different kettle of fish.  A bonding situation will make very serious inroads into his over-all trading and his profitability.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider what has been said with regard to this matter.  It is something that is worrying many of the small retailers throughout Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is anxiety on the part of some agents as to how this section will operate with regard to them.  I have been at pains to assure them, individually as I have met them, and through their association that it is not our intention to enforce a regime that will be commercially difficult for them.  There would be no point in driving them out of business or in making business unprofitable for them.  That is not the intention. In that regard may I say about the figure mentioned by Senator Honan of £5,000 to £6,000 being the cost of the bond, that I have not heard that figure and no figures have been mentioned up to now as to what bonds might cost.  Obviously the cost of a bond will vary depending on the amount involved.  The agent has to come within the ambit of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan gave a graphic example of the involvement of an agent.  She indicated that she goes to her home town and hands to an agent what could be a very substantial sum of money and says that he is only passing it on.  That is so, but if there are a lot of people coming in and handing very substantial sums of money to agents, they in turn have a very substantial sum of money to pass on.  What we want to guard against is the agent who does not pass it on.  This is the reason <Col N="1246" /> why agents are being included within the Bill.</P>
    <P>The bond does not have to be a bond in the normal sense that we think of &mdash; an insurance company providing a guarantee bond for a builder for a large public works contract or the like.  It can take many forms.  The Bill is quite flexible as to what way the protection envisaged by the concept of the bond should be.  For example, Senator Honan mentioned that the association have accumulated voluntarily a very substantial sum to meet any obligations that might arise out of default of any of their members.  It is possible that in our discussions with the association we might be able to devise an arrangement whereby that sum could be added to or the fruit of that sum could be the premium to buy an umbrella bond for agents below a certain level of business. Agents above that would have to do their own depending on turnover.  The Bill provides lots of flexibility as to how the actual bond will be operated in practice. We will be having discussions with the trade to tease out what will suit the needs of the trade and at the same time &mdash; and this must be the bottom line so far as the Bill is concerned &mdash; what will protect the public and what will implement the Bill. It is possible that even after that there will be some agents who will find it a little bit harsh but unfortunately that is the way it has to be because what we have to do is to protect the travelling public.  I am most optimistic, having regard to the attitude of the trade that I have encountered so far, that we will devise a system of bonding that will meet the needs of the trade and at the same time satisfy the requirements of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the correct members of the trade are behaving correctly and in 15 years I understand that there has not been any default by any member.  But what I did ask was whether there is room still for one of the others to slip through the net.</P>

      <P>Developing this point, with respect to Senator Honan, the bond, as the Minister has pointed out in his Second Stage speech and pointed out again today, is obviously very flexible.  It is open to development having discussed it with the people within the trade.  Would it be possible, and it would appear to me that within section 13 it would be possible, for the Minister to consider whether at least part of the bonding arrangements might be what we could call piggy-back bonding arrangements?  In other words, if I go into my local travel agent and I am booking a holiday through a tour operator and if he is an authorised agent of that tour operator, that that local travel agent can, in respect of that transaction by quoting a number, become part of the bonding arrangement of the large tour operator.  As a result of that, the amount added to my holiday would be just one payment to one tour operator which would cover both the cost to the travel agent in respect of my transaction and also the cost to the tour operator in respect of my transaction.  The travel agent's bonding arrangement could be made up of four or five different agreements with different tour operators and something quite small to cover the remainder of his business, such as dealing directly with CIE or with Aer Lingus. Would the Minister consider that such an arrangement would be possible?  It would overcome many of the problems mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a point that Senator O'Leary made.  I could imagine the type of situation he referred to whereby a travel agent was arranging a package through a tour operator. Surely in such case the onus is on the tour operator at that stage.  He would be <Col N="1248" /> bonded, we would hope, under the Bill. The Minister referred to the instance of Senator Honan buying a ticket from a travel agent in Ennis.  In that case she gets an airline ticket, and surely the good name of the airline is paramount and vital to that airline.  So that even if the travel agent goes out of business the airline, to protect their good name, will allow Senator Honan to continue to travel out from Ireland to her destination and back. Would that not be the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his response to our questions has mentioned the possibility of the existing travel agents' association using a fund that they have accumulated for a possible umbrella-type bonding system if that could be agreed.  Am I not to take it from that that other people are precluded from entering into this area of business in the future?  The conditions for entry into that association are stringent.  I mentioned at Second Stage that at times some of the restrictions were there for the preservation of the association and not so much for the preservation of the travelling public. That was something that concerned me.  In this area we must have an element of free competition.  In the Minister of State's introduction to the Bill he did say, in regard to new people coming in, that if they are genuine and committed, and are prepared to go through the realms of accepting a bond and being licensed, they would not necessarily have to be members of the ITAA and that if they meet the Minister's criteria, they may set up legitimately in business.  I would like an assurance that that will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised by Senator Fallon with regard to the airline ticket delivered, this could be true of an Irish airline but a lot of package tours are sold by relatively unknown airlines and tickets from them may or may not have the same validity that an Irish airline would have. If the tour operator was not dealing with our national airline what would the situation be or how would we afford protection? The two ends of the trade must be protected.  They must answer the same criteria, but I still feel that a double system of bonding or a different level of <Col N="1249" /> premium would be required.  Perhaps that is a matter for the bonding people rather than for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris is really saying that ITAA is a closed ahop.  It is not a closed shop but it is hard to become a member because the rules are quite strict.  The Minister is well aware of what I am saying.  They have to be as strict as they are, and if you are ready to abide by the rules and run your business properly you can straight away become and will be accepted as a member of ITAA.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Leary asked if it would be possible to have a piggy back arrangement.  I would see no objection to it.  What we want to do is to have an arrangement satisfactory to the Minister for the protection of the travelling public, and if such an arrangement ensures their protection it would then comply with the requirements of the Act and there would be no objection to it.  Likewise it could be a two-tier system.  You could have different levels of different types of bonds, but that is something to be teased out.  It would be no business of the Department to act in a restrictive trade manner so as to confine the availability of this umbrella thing to certain members of the travel trade only.  Again this is something which will have to be worked out with the association, because it is their money and their members are the people who are providing it.  Nevertheless, if it were to be used in order to provide an easier bonding system there would be a certain element of discrimination involved.  Any negotiations we would have with the association would have to be designed to ensure that all members of the trade would get the benefit of that.  That might mean that the fund might not be available at all.  Then <Col N="1250" /> in that case you are back to a simple bonding system.  So that is obviously a negotiating point.</P>
      <P>So far as the cost of the bond is concerned it will be a matter for the operator or agent as how to deal with it.  It will be an extra part of the expenses of their business and undoubtedly it will be reflected in the charges they make to the public.  To that extent one can say that it will be passed on.  If there is enough competition between agents in trying to keep their prices down there may be a saving and it may not, in effect, be passed on.  They may decide to carry it in order to keep their prices down.  This would be a normal feature of commercial operation.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon raised the example of a person buying an airline ticket.  In that case the ticket was sold and that was it, the job was completed and no loss could result to the customer.  I agree that if the agent's business was entirely confined to selling tickets for scheduled airlines we would not have any need to grant-aid it. But where much of the business is involved in selling other travel activities but mainly package holidays, where the protection of the airline ticket in your hand does not arise, it is in that sense that we need the protection.</P>
      <P>The requirement as to the bond is worded in such a way as to allow a flexible arrangement to be introduced.  I want to emphasise that.  It is not our intention to prejudice anybody in the trade but at the same time we must bring the Act into effect and I have no doubt that we can achieve both objectives.  I have indicated my goodwill in that regard to the trade and they have reciprocated.  I am confident we will devise a satisfactory working arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, it is just a comment arising out of the previous discussion which the Minister had &mdash; if you read the section it goes on and says that:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall establish a fund to be known as the Travellers' Protection Fund... from which payments may be made in accordance with the provisions of section 18 of this Act in respect of losses or liabilities incurred by customers of tour operators or travel agents who held a licence under this Act or whose licence has been revoked and the revocation is the subject of an appeal to the court....</P>
      <P>That gives the impression that if the Minister revokes a licence and it is the subject of an appeal to the court, business may be carried on in the meantime, or at least if it is carried on in defiance of the law it will be covered by the Act.  Section 10 gives the impression that the revocation of a licence does not end the matter but that business can be carried on pending the appeal to the court.  If there is the possibility of an appeal to the court under section 10 it would appear that the protection afforded by section 10 might not be as copperfastened as it might have appeared at the start.  The Minister might consider that aspect when considering the other point.  The provision is repeated in section 18 (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have undertaken already to look at the possibility of an injunction to restore a licence pending the hearing of an action examining the grounds for revocation.  I would read this section somewhat differently: that the funds shall come into being to make good losses incurred by people who held a licence.  In other words, what took place <Col N="1252" /> was during the currency of a licence, but that person is no longer licensed. Obviously if the fund comes into play that person would not have a licence. Regarding the words, &ldquo;or whose licence has been revoked and the revocation is the subject of an appeal to the court,&rdquo; I would read that as meaning that the licence is gone and that although there is an appeal to the court the people who have been at a loss can be compensated without prejudice to whatever the court may do.  The court might decide to restore the licence but the court obviously has no power to give compensation to people who have lost money.  This section gives power to pay those people out of the fund pending the determination by the court.</P>

      <P>Am I to take it that tour operators only will contribute to the fund?  I raised this matter on Second Stage.  It is linked to section 18.  While contributions to the fund will come from tour operators only, disbursements from the fund can be made to victims of failure on the part of tour operators or of travel agents.  These are two distinct categories. The situation could arise where tour operators' moneys were being used to compensate the victim of a retail agent's carelessness.  Several references have been made already to the potential for carelessness or dubious behaviour by the said agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator says, the section provides that the fund will be contributed to by operators.  The intention is that the contribution will be on the basis of so much per head per passenger carried on tour.  If the agents also have to <Col N="1253" /> make a contribution or pay a levy on the same basis, they will be paying the levy in effect under the same heads because the operator is selling all his seats through a variety of agents and it is at this point the levy will be put on for all the seats coming in through the agencies.  If the agents had to pay levies too, there would be a double payment in respect of each head carried.  That is why it is confined to the operators.  What would happen then is that the customer would be paying twice because this charge would be referable to a customer's journey.  If it were to be imposed by both the operator and the agent the customer would end up paying on the double.  It is correct to say that that fund when it is gathered like that, will be used not to meet the obligations of an operator, but to meet the losses of the public.  It is the public who will be paying it in.  It will be a loss to the public to be made good out of this fund. It will be collected by the operator.  It will be immaterial whether it is the agent or the operator who collapses.</P>

      <P>In section 18 (4) is the Minister saying that if, for example, a tour operator has problems in, say, Miami he would send somebody over immediately, pay all the bills and then reimburse from the insurance companies on the bond?

      <P>There is one point I would like to raise with the Minister <Col N="1255" /> which also relates to section 23.  There may be an omission in the Bill or perhaps I am not reading it correctly.  Is there a provision in the Bill to provide for the following circumstances?  Where, for example, you have a company carrying on business as a tour operator and that company are unable to meet their commitments and the fund is called on to rescue the people who are in difficulties, is there provision to allow the Minister to go against the liquidator of that company in the event of that company having assets but having run into difficulties because they had a cash flow problem? Section 23, quite rightly, takes away from the right of customers to get a double payment but I think there should be provision, which I cannot see in the Bill, to subrogate the rights of the customers to the Minister to allow him to recoup from the company in the event of the company having assets in a liquidation situation.  If we do not do that we are then providing in this Bill a situation where the travel fund which is contributed to by all travellers could be subsidising shareholders in companies which go bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a consequence.  I would not quite put it in those terms.  We considered that it would not be practical to provide for the Minister to take part in winding-up proceedings in regard to the length of time they go on and complexity of them.  All that we are concerned with in this Bill is to provide through the trade the bonding arrangement and also from the public the protection fund to pay for any collapses.  I considered whether we should then be in a position to take part in the winding-up procedures to recoup the fund but decided against it, that all things considered it would introduce an unnecessary complication and, again, the right of the Minister to take part in the liquidation proceedings as creditor of the company could be questionable.  There would be no direct relationship between the Minister and the company.  The Minister is merely there administering the bond provided by the company and administering the protection fund gathered in.  He is <Col N="1256" /> only there in a trustee position to administer those funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I raised the question whether the building up of a substantial protection fund to be invested in trustee and like securities is a sound procedure in an era of high inflation. The Minister took my point as referring to the desirability of finding investments that would hold well against inflation.  I wish I had a list of those.  I had a more fundamental point in mind.  The question I had in mind was whether the aim should be to build up a substantial fund or whether it might not suffice to aim at a reasonable degree of liquidity in the fund.  In other words, to aim at keeping the amount in the fund at a reasonable but not necessarily a substantial level and so reduce the erosion hazard attaching to investments.</P>
      <P>I realise that if the fund were not substantial, and even if it were, the risk may arise from time to time of it being deficient in relation to the payments that have to be made from it.  That could be dealt with by some temporary limited borrowing facility being provided for the fund. The liquidity aim would enable one, if there were a deficit, to make good the deficit out of contributions over a reasonable future period in much the same way as motor insurance policy premiums are raised from time to time according to the actual experience of claims arising from accidents.  The Minister may have either of two reactions to that.  He may say that whatever about the erosion of the investments he jibs at having any borrowing facility for the fund or he may say, in an optimistic spirit, that he thinks the era of high inflation is rapidly approaching an end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but not immediately. There are plans in that regard.  Leaving that aside, it is not the intention to start the fund and let it keep on building without putting a stop to it.  It is the intention that when it reaches a certain figure to stop.  It will of course be guesswork as to what is the appropriate figure to stop the levies coming in at which the fund will be big enough to meet any likely claims on <Col N="1258" /> it.  This is something that we will have to be fairly conservative about and look at in the light of the experience of the trade over the last few years and look at the English situation, where they have stopped contributions to the fund on the grounds that it is big enough.  We can look at the two scenes in proportion and decide what would be a figure at which we would stop contributions to this fund. It is not the intention to let it build up <i>ad infinitim.</i> It will be stopped and in the meantime we will do our best with the investments.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider re-wording the beginning of this section to read &ldquo;Any person who acts as an officer of a limited liability company or who carries on business&rdquo;?

      <P>The whole question of limited liability must be brought into it.  I am a little taken aback by what the Minister says about section 21 (3) which seems, according to the heading, to deal only with summary offences.  Would the Minister also consider as a possible penalty under this to cater for the situation where an officer of a limited liability company has carried on such business the additional possible disqualification of the <Col N="1259" /> person holding the office in such company from holding an office in a company registered under the Companies Act 1963?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is, of course, provision in the Companies Act where the registrar can take such a view. Would the Minister consider if a person abuses &mdash; this is the crucial point &mdash; the limited liability company screen and tries to hide behind a limited liability company as an officer or a nominee that the additional disqualification would be available to the court?  That, of course, does not mean that it would be mandatory on the court to impose it, to disqualify that person from carrying on business in a limited liability company as an officer in that company.  There is a whole range of offences for which this kind of penalty should be imposed.  I do not suggest that this is the only such case in which it should be imposed, but the question of people abusing the officerships in limited liability companies and then being free to remain as officers in such companies at a later date is something which has to be tackled somewhere.  There is no reason to suppose that this is not as good a Bill as any to tackle it in.  I do not expect an answer from the Minister now but I would like him to consider it and see in the case of a person abusing the protection of a limited liability company that it should be open to the courts to impose that penalty on him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Senator if he was referring to every company when he sought this bar or if he was referring to a company that will supposedly carry on business in the travel trade, and he surprised me by saying every company.  That would be draconian and would be putting an extra and heavier penalty on a person who was persecuted for a breach where the breach was committed by a company than on a person who was carrying on trade as an independent person.  He would suffer the penalties set out under section 20 with the added penalty of being <Col N="1260" /> prohibited from acting as an officer of a company.  There would then be two levels of punishment available for individuals. That would be harsh.</P>
      <P>The Senator answered the point himself when he queried whether this is the appropriate Bill for it.  I think not.  I think it is probably more a matter for reform of the company law.  I sympathise with his point that the code of company law is sometimes abused by persons.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that people who would abuse the protections and privileges given by that code should be prevented from taking advantage of it at a future date.  That raises wider matters of policy and is more suitable for another Bill.</P>

      <P>The Chair has received notice from Senator Robinson that on motion for the Adjournment of the House she proposes to raise the following matter: the level of co-operation between the Department of Health and the Women's Aid organisation.  Before I call on Senator Robinson I might say that the procedure adopted this evening was entirely exceptional and the House should understand that it is not a procedure which I will regard in future as a precedent.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by apologising to the House for the fact that I was absent.  I was dealing with a personal family problem in my own home, and I was not here to deal with this matter when it might have been much more convenient for all Members.  I would like to thank the Leader of the House and the Cathaoirleach for the facility I was afforded.  It does give me an opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and Senator McGuinness will also contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wish to draw attention to the essential need for and desirability of close co-operation and involvement between the Women's Aid organisation and the Department of Health.  I would even extend that to other agencies such as Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dun Laoghaire Corporation as housing authorities and the Department of the Environment.  We are all aware of the present crisis relating to Women's Aid, which is the voluntary organisation concerned with the position of bettered wives and their families and which has been providing a vital service to these very vulnerable families in our community since 1974.  We are aware of the present urgent crisis because an already difficult and unacceptable situation has been worsened dramatically by <Col N="1264" /> the accident of fire on 4 September last. Prior to that, and indeed ever since 1974, the situation has not been a satisfactory one.  Women's Aid, as a voluntary body, have been trying to bridge an important gap in our social services.</P>
    <P>However one of the first points I would like to make in outlining the position is that there has been considerable support from the relevant agencies, the Eastern Health Board, central Government, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  What appears to have been lacking, and I refer to the situation under successive Governments, is a degree of co-ordination, of proper identification of the problem and the political commitment to ensure the follow-through by establishing the kind of structural supports that are necessary for battered wives and their children in our society.</P>
    <P>It is really that problem of co-operation and co-ordination that is central to this motion.  We are aware of the immediate crisis because the existing location of the refuge of Women's Aid at Harcourt Terrace was damaged by fire on 4 September last, and it can no longer be used overnight as a refuge.  This meant that there was a critical need for a short-term refuge, and also for our society to face up to the urgent provision of a more planned, service-built or adapted building to be used in the longer-term as a refuge.</P>
    <P>If I might refer now to the human details of the situation.  Women's Aid published last February a booklet, <i>Family Violence</i> in which they identified the serious nature of the problem in our society.  It is not unique to our society but we do have quite a serious level of family violence, which is in many cases aggravated by alcoholism.  This booklet shows that over the period they have operated, since 1974, Women's Aid have provided shelter and a refuge to a constant flow of battered wives and a considerable number of children of those wives.  This has revealed part of the demand for this kind of refuge and shelter.  Because it is a voluntary organisation, Women's Aid has only tapped some of the demand and real needs in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In May last, the Women's Aid organisation was served with a notice to quit <Col N="1265" /> their premises at Harcourt Terrace.  So at that stage there was an urgent crisis. They were warned that if they did not leave those premises by May 17 legal proceedings would follow.  Their present landlords do not yet appear to have issued a summons and so there have not yet been legal proceedings.  All during that period and since then it appears that both Women's Aid itself and the Eastern Health Board have been seeking to find suitable alternative premises.  There have been conflicting views of the precise responsibility both for locating those premises and for allocating money for the premises.  Women's Aid have made the point that until the money was allocated they were not in a position to bid for premises which they had located as being either suitable or reasonably suitable for adaptation.  Here again the level of co-operation on both sides does not appear to have been as adequate as it should have been in view of the extreme need to provide for the families concerned.</P>
    <P>What do we mean when we are talking about suitable premises?  It would be helpful if the Minister of State would give the view of the Department on the kind of premises which would be reasonably suitable for adaptation as a refuge.  In my view such premises would have to be sufficiently large.  It would be desirable that there would be a garden, because of the number of families and children involved.  Obviously the premises would have to be structurally sound, and there would have to be either in existence or through adaptation the facility of a large kitchen to be used by a number of families in a community setting.  Similarly, a large sitting room and play room space would be required, as well as sleeping accommodation.</P>
    <P>Women's Aid and others who are aware of their work are of the view that this refuge, whether it is a purpose-built refuge or whether it is an adapted building, should be used as a short-term stay refuge, that it would be desirable to have a process involving perhaps three stages. The first stage would be the refuge, to which families would go in the emergency of their particular situation, where they would stay for a period of six to eight <Col N="1266" /> weeks, where they would benefit from assessment, help, an initial breathing space even, and then they would be moved to a second stage, a family therapy centre.  I understand that the premises which the refuge are using on the north side are capable of being used as a family therapy centre.  This is an important second stage because of the complex needs of the families involved.  There would also be a third stage, when families could be helped to be less dependent, given the privacy of living either in one family unit or sharing a house, or flats in a house. This could be while waiting to be allocated housing on the corporation housing list, having satisfied the residential requirements or possibly to give the wife who does not wish to return to her husband an opportunity to be retrained if she wants to work, building up a capacity to be more self-sufficient and less dependent.</P>
    <P>This whole process involves a great deal of sensitivity, co-operation, back-up and support.  At the moment the structures are not there for that back-up and support.  It is true that the Eastern Health Board are funding the present staffing costs, including a social worker and three full-time workers for the children involved.  It is important to stress the particular needs of those children, some of whom are inevitably disturbed by the trauma they may have suffered in their family life.  Also on the staff there is an administrator, a house-keeper and a secretary. So there is at the moment a corps of specialist staff being funded by the Eastern Health Board.  Also, Dublin County Council have allocated £14,000 as a housing aid, and Dublin Corporation have allocated £5,000 in aid which still has to be approved by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>So there are various kinds of assistance available, but what appears always to have been lacking &mdash; this is really a problem of successive Governments &mdash; is a clear examination of the needs and a structured approach to the problem of battered wives.  It is not just a question of providing a physical refuge and then forgetting about it.  It requires providing a proper refuge, then a second stage process, <Col N="1267" /> and then a third stage process, thereby helping those families to become self-sufficient again; either to return to the family home, if that is possible, or alternatively to establish an independent existence with their children.  It may therefore involve re-training, work opportunities and so on.</P>
    <P>The present situation is that money has been allocated now by the Government if suitable premises can be found.  Here again, I feel there may be a sort of catch 22 situation.  Obviously it is difficult for a voluntary body to find suitable premises without a definite allocation.  We now have the definite allocation but I feel something more is still needed.  Perhaps it requires the secondment of an official from the Department of Health.  I am not sure, and perhaps the Minister would comment on this.  But it seems as though now that the money has been allocated &mdash; despite the very difficult economic climate &mdash; that the co-operation which I am talking about requires an active involvement by the Department in locating in the first instance perhaps a temporary premises, and then a suitable premises for adaptation as a refuge as the first stage of the process which I have been describing, because even if premises were found tomorrow, it is still very likely that there would have to be planning permission for adaptation of those premises, which could take a certain amount of time, and that there would have to be some work done in adapting those premises for the particular purpose.</P>
    <P>Inevitably there would be a time lag &mdash; perhaps a time lag of a couple of months &mdash; even if the premises were to be located tomorrow.  So there is a short-term crisis.  This short-term crisis is all the more serious because unfortunately the Christmas period is one when the problem of family violence tends to be at its most severe.  This is borne out again by the numbers of families and children who have been in the refuge in previous Christmases.  Over Christmas 1980, for example, there were 24 women and about 60 children.  Immediately after Christmas this had gone up to 26 women and 90 children &mdash; a very high level of <Col N="1268" /> women and children &mdash; in the Women's Aid refuge last Christmas.</P>
    <P>This Christmas the problem is that they cannot stay overnight at the refuge.  They stay in an Eastern Health Board hostel at night and the situation is therefore most difficult for them.  Just to give the figures as of today, as of this afternoon: there were five families in Harcourt Terrace with a total of 19 children.  Indeed, one woman with five children arrived today. So it is a very pressing problem.  It is a very critical problem.  It is not just a question of locating a refuge and putting all the battered wives into it and forgetting about it.  It is extremely important that we see the necessity for a structured process of providing the immediate need through a refuge, the second stage of family therapy which can help cope with family problems identified and which can give the sort of follow-up and even self-confidence that is necessary.  Then the third stage for those who have a housing or returning to work or an independence problem.  They too must have the resources and facilities.</P>
    <P>This element of sustained co-operation between the Department and Women's Aid as the voluntary body which is coping with one of the most urgent problems in our society has never been fully responded to by any Government.  I welcome, therefore, the earmarking, even at this difficult time, of the sum of money for a new refuge, but I think this is only part of the overall social problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for facilitating us in having this debate now because, as Senator Robinson said, it is a problem of very grave importance.  The problem has become acute on account of the fire in the Harcourt Terrace shelter in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who is involved in the family law scene I know what a large number of family violence problems arise and how important it is in a scene of crisis in a family that a wife who is subject to violence and whose children are being damaged by family violence should have some place to turn to.  This should be a well thought-out and well organised process <Col N="1269" /> in which she and her family can be rehabilitated as well as just sheltered from the present crisis of violence.</P>
    <P>As far as the Harcourt Terrace shelter was concerned, this was a problem even before there was a fire.  There was the matter of the landlord serving notice to quit and the threat of legal proceedings against the Women's Aid organisation. In any case, Women's Aid and anyone who knew the Harcourt Terrace premises knew perfectly well they were physically very unsuitable and that they were a fire hazard.  This is something to which some of us drew attention last May.  Having gone to Harcourt Terrace to consult with clients who were taking legal action on account of the family violence, I can certainly bear witness to the fact that it was far from being an ideal premises or in good condition.  I very much welcome the assurance that there will be money available for a new premises but I would emphasise again what Senator Robinson has said, that it would need quite a bit of co-operation.  Not only will they need planning permission to alter premises, they will probably need planning permission to use it at all because I would think it is probably a change of user.  Other charitable organisations have come up against this before.</P>
    <P>The Government were committed in their Programme for Government to instituting a charter of co-operation for the voluntary charitable bodies and for voluntary bodies working in the social work field.  This is an opportunity to show an earnest of their goodwill in the co-operation between statutory and voluntary bodies.  This can be an example of what may be done in the future through this charter and I am vitally interested that this kind of co-operation should develop. If we can show in the case of Women's Aid that the statutory bodies and the voluntary organisations can work together to produce an acceptable solution to this problem, then we will have set a headline for this to happen in other fields.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of co-operation in the past.  The social workers working in the Women's Aid centre have <Col N="1270" /> been seconded from the health board and have been employed and paid by the statutory agencies while working in Women's Aid, but it probably needs a better thought-through system.  Up to the time of the fire they were running a two-stage system of houses where they had Harcourt Terrace for the immediate problem and they had a couple of half-way houses that the women and children moved on to, but they have been forced by the fire to use the half-way houses for immediate occupation.  This has created a very grave problem because they now have no half-way stage and it is not enough to put a roof over the heads of these women and children.  They have to be helped gradually to get back into society.</P>
    <P>There is just one other problem as regards the choice of premises.  The premises should be capable of being reasonably secure against attack because it has been a problem in Harcourt Terrace that from time to time violent husbands have come to the premises and tried to gain entry.  It was a good thing that the premises was opposite the Garda station. This is one point I would draw to the attention of the Minister when selecting a premises.  It must be reasonably secure.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to confirm last night's decision to commit money for the finding of a new and suitable refuge for Women's Aid. This is, I hope, a milestone which will possibly turn what was a dreadful tragedy into an ultimate benefit.  I am glad that both the speakers recognise that the crisis, while it has had a new immediacy recently, is one which has been with us for a very long time and one with which successive Governments have so far failed to deal.  That is why I welcome last night's decision to commit the money.  It is very much a step in the right direction. Even today the results have indicated that that commitment has led to a great deal of extra movement in the whole area of finding premises and I will return to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in relation to battered wives in Dublin and throughout the country has <Col N="1271" /> not been dealt with seriously up to now. This reaction in this particular case is not enough and we are committed to looking beyond it.  The situation in which Women's Aid in Dublin have found themselves is one which I do not think any Christian community could tolerate for much longer, and it was in the face of that crisis that the response emerged last night.</P>
    <P>The response of the Department to the crisis in Women's Aid pre-dates the fire in Harcourt Terrace.  The helping of Women's Aid did not start with yesterday's decision.  The organisation have been in receipt of help from the Eastern Health Board in the last six years.  Senator Robinson referred to the staffing support which is given.  Payments have been made since 1975 and in 1979 the Eastern Health Board purchased a house for Women's Aid in Howth Road, Dublin.  There has been no shortage of official support for Women's Aid either in the Department of Health or the Eastern Health Board and I know that the individuals who run the organisation recognise this fact.  The only lack was the kind of commitment that was given last night and had that commitment been given previously the crisis of September might have been avoided.  There has been a willingness to help but I will refer now to the actual difficulties that have emerged.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Eastern Health Board in each case where Women's Aid have suggested premises since September have looked at those premises.  Only two have come directly to the Minister.  The first of these, all involved agreed, would be totally unsuitable. The second seemed superficially suitable, but turned out to be lacking in planning permission.  The Senator asked me to outline what would be a suitable premises.  Obviously a suitable premises will have to cater for a large number of families and children and will have to have potential for being developed into a number of small units.  There is no one type of premises that would do.  It is conceivable that something on a large community basis, something collective in <Col N="1272" /> small units might be suitable.  The Department are encouraging Women's Aid to look as far afield as possible and at as many options as possible and this might lead to more choices.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that following last night's decision Women's Aid informed us today that they have had quite a number of approaches from various persons who would be aware of or have property which might be suitable.  That decision has already led to some significant movement in the area.</P>
    <P>I accept that while the health board and the Department have sought to help the organisation as much as possible there has been some failure to co-ordinate and the Department today have worked out a system by which they will attempt to co-ordinate better the architectural aspects of the efforts by Women's Aid, the Department and the Eastern Health Board.  This response has emerged in part from a crisis but it is also part of our Government's wider commitment to the whole area of problems in families.  While Dublin is a very pressing case, we are conscious that in all the major cities this is becoming a problem which we must accept as permanent and for which permanent solutions need to be found.  We are very concerned that, as well as Dublin, these other areas will be looked at and that a national plan for the problem will be developed.</P>
    <P>The danger in this particular case is that the crisis nature of the situation might lead us to accept a solution that would simply leave the women and the children in as bad a situation as they have been in for the last three years.  Women's Aid themselves accept that despite the urgency it is important that decisions should not be too hasty now and that the solution we find should ensure a permanent and acceptable and homely refuge for women and children who have undergone sufficient problems and stress without having to face the stress of appalling living conditions as well.  Because of that awareness the Government have committed themselves to making this money available in this case and the Department are committed to redoubling their efforts <Col N="1273" /> to move speedily towards the discovery of a suitable location.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness referred to our charter for voluntary bodies and there has been a certain amount of discussion going on.  The example of the kind of co-operation which exists already in this area and the commitment to develop that co-operation will, perhaps, be a case study for co-operation between voluntary bodies and statutory bodies.  Certainly, I think it is the ideal development.</P>
    <P>I give Senator Robinson my personal assurance that there is no catch 22 here in terms of the limitation that a place must be suitable and must be within reasonable cost.  We have no mandate to spend wildly the country's money but we have a mandate to support people in need.  We are committed to avoiding the danger of accepting somewhere for the sake of disposing of the problem but we are concerned that the solution will be a permanent one and that the building found will be suitable.  If necessary, consideration will be given to the possibility of a new purpose-built premises.</P>
    <P>I conclude by confirming that the commitment given last night to make funds available will be followed through by maximum co-operation with Women's Aid, with the health board and the Department of Health in the finding of a speedy solution to this problem.  If it <Col N="1274" /> proves impossible to deal with it in a relatively short time due to the complexity of finding property, further consideration will be given to other short-term measures for the refuge until the permanent refuge can be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the short-term measures, clearly I welcome very much the Minister's own commitment and the fact that the allocation has definitely been made by the Government but it appears that no matter what goodwill there is, and no matter how earnestly premises are sought, there will be a necessary time lag even of a few months. The Minister did mention the possibility of a short-term measure.  Surely that is necessary now, say over two months or maybe even three months, while the permanent refuge is coming on stream.</P>

      <P>Our meetings go on regularly with Women's Aid, and at present they are willing to cope with the present circumstances if they are satisfied that a solution will come relatively quickly.  If a particular building is agreed upon and we are clear that work on it will take some time, obviously the situation will have to be looked at again.</P>
