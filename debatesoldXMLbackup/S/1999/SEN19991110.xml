      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to grant the Irish Seal Sanctuary the once-off donation they require in the upcoming budget.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise and Aer Rianta to give proactive assistance to the Ryanair proposal to open up five new routes with daily scheduled services from Shannon Airport and to recognise the importance of such a proposal to development in the region.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1, Planning and Development Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee Stage; No. 17, motion 16. Business shall be interrupted between 1 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. No. 17, motion 16, shall be taken from 6 to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. The office of the Director of the National Library has been vacant for three years. There was an excellent Acting Director but recently a further attempt was made to fill the office and no appointment was made. The reason for this is quite simply that the salary being offered is lower by about two points down the scale than for those working in university libraries, in other words, the salary being offered to head up the most prestigious national cultural institution is derisory. It is well known that good candidates cannot be attracted and the position is almost permanently vacant. This is not good for the National Library <Col N="1298" /> or for our reputation in cultural terms. I ask the Leader to make immediate representations to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and to the Department of Finance, which is where I believe the real problem lies. If not, will he allow time for a debate on the matter in the next couple of weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like this House to indicate its total support and confidence in Mr. John Lonergan, the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, whom I believe is being subjected to an excruciating attempt at zero tolerance and moral arbitration by some of the media this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business. To allow the matter to be discussed here this morning would be to establish a precedent we might all regret in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely agree that there should not be a debate on the matter at this time. I raise the issue in the context of the need for a discussion on the press council and related matters. The Leader said recently that he intended to raise this matter. If we reach a point where the news that a leading public servant who has done a good job might owe the Government the cost of a stamp takes up half the page of a national newspaper, I think it has gone beyond the stage of tolerance. It will do the media no good if they now take the place of the hierarchy in the past in deciding on moral arbitration for the rest of this country. This is unfair and we, as public representatives, should be prepared to say that there should be balance in media coverage. If things are wrong, they should be rooted out and if not, we should also say so clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call that the position of Director of the National Library should be filled without delay. It is long overdue that we address the matter. If it is a question of finance, this is something that should be dealt with urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is galling to read in the newspapers today that the vote which took place yesterday in the other House on the Partnership for Peace is presumed to be a<i> fait accompli</i> and that there is no requirement for any reference to this House in relation to the matter. It is bad enough that the issue has not been put to the people in a referendum as promised by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government, but now this House is not even being consulted about the matter. That is disgraceful. It may not be a statutory requirement to refer the matter to the House, but I would like the Minister to explain the position when he comes to the House next week. It is a slight on the House that the decisions to send Army Rangers to East Timor and to join Partnership for Peace were taken without reference to it. Will the Leader bring it to the attention of the <Col N="1299" /> Government that that is no way to treat this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Government the position on the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into law? This was reported in newspapers, especially <i>The Irish Times,</i> where Patrick Smyth had an article on 27 October stating categorically that this would happen. Denis Coghlan had an article in the same paper on 1 November saying it would not happen and that the Government had yielded to pressure from anonymous conservative groups within the country. That is very worrying and the House is entitled to know what is going on. Will the Leader ascertain the position?</P>
      <P>Will he arrange for a debate on the question of the limiting of access to certain medicinal products, such as St. John's wort and other such items? They may have funny names which are easy to laugh at but it seems extraordinary that people will need a prescription for simple things like evening primrose oil and garlic pellets. It is a complete nonsense and someone is making money out of it. Can we have a debate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's last point. Perhaps the House, or the Minister if it is not in order for the House to do so, could discuss the move by the Irish Medicines Board to classify certain herbal remedies as needing a prescription. In terms of issues which have hit a nerve with the public, I have not had as much correspondence in a long time on an issue as I have had on this one. The annoyance of the public is palpable because it neither accepts nor understands why St. John's wort this week or another herbal remedy next week is classified in such a manner. Perhaps the House could turn its attention to and discuss procedures which classify herbal remedies as medicines and as needing a prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise the embarrassing position in which Ireland has found itself in Europe recently. Will the Leader allow for a debate or statements on this matter some time between now and Christmas? It concerns the recent four occasions in the European press where the European Commission condemned the Government for failing to transpose matters of environmental and health and safety legislation and a range of other areas into national law. When one is an MEP, one represents Ireland. As far as the Europeans are concerned, all Irish MEPs are the Government and we are all Irish. I am very embarrassed by the four occasions &ndash; 19, 25 and 29 October and 9 November &ndash; when the Commission issued press releases condemning Ireland with regard to the health and safety directive, the major accidents hazard directive and for failing to respond to complaints. Others include the habitats directive, the birds directive, the pollution of rural drinking <Col N="1300" /> water, the directive on dangerous substances, waste management plans, sheep overgrazing in the west and environmental impact assessments. The list is as long as my arm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. This is an important issue where Ireland stands indicted in the transposition, in part or all, of European law. Could we have a discussion or debate on, or give serious attention to, this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Norris and Avril Doyle regarding the recent announcements that ordinary preparations which have been accepted as and are part of daily life are to be brought under the control of the Irish Medicines Board. This is an attempt by the medical profession, chemists and the Irish Medicines Board to create a monopoly. It is all about money and control. A debate on the matter would be relevant at this time. The majority of the public does not want these preparations to be brought under the control of the medical profession and associated bodies. I ask the Leader to afford us an opportunity to debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the 350 jobs in the Great Southern Hotel Group in County Kerry and the future of the families of the people involved. The hotel group employs many people throughout the State but the Government is continuing to fudge on this issue. The hotels have always been in State ownership and it would be wrong to sell them on the basis of Aer Rianta not wanting them. We can be sure Aer Rianta will cherry pick and hold on to the hotels at Dublin and Shannon Airports and the one due to be built in Cork. Will the Leader ask the Government to arrange immediately that an independent analysis or report will be carried out on how the hotels can best remain in State ownership? The hotel group has a proud and honourable history and tradition and staff members have provided great service over the years, particularly in County Kerry where the group has three hotels. The staff would clearly prefer the hotels to remain in State ownership. I would like to hear the Leader's views on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Senator Doyle's intervention and am glad to note that one of the terms of the Maastricht Treaty is now being implemented, namely closer liaison between the European and domestic parliaments. I welcome the interchange of ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="ÜfcMr. Dardis ÜfcMr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finneran's comments on herbal remedies in regard to powerful vested interests in the drugs interest attempting to exercise control. However, it is worth stating that some naturally occurring substances can be equally or more toxic than manufactured products. There must be some degree of regulation in the market but I concur that the Irish Medicines Board may not be the appropriate body to exercise that control. A debate on the issue would be useful.</P>
      <P>I welcome the vote which took place in the Dáil yesterday on Partnership for Peace. I know the Leader will deal effectively with Senator Costello's request. It will be useful when we come to debate these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the issue of the heritage grant for buildings of architectural and historical merit. As a result of the overwhelming response and demand from the public, will the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to extend the closing date for applications which are still being processed? The building must be completed between now and the end of the year and if the applications are still being processed I do not know how it will be possible for anyone to adhere to such a tight timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello. It is a matter of great regret that this House is being ignored in regard to decisions on matters such as PfP and the deployment of Defence Forces overseas. I do not remember that happening before and I have asked the Leader to inquire about it on successive occasions. Perhaps he will do so now when the matter has been brought to his attention yet again.</P>
      <P>As a matter of urgency, will the Leader arrange for a debate on the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals? It ought to be a specific commitment of whoever is in Government that these conditions in our prisons and hospitals will be brought to an end within the term of Government. We no longer want promises about additional funding. Nobody in any prison or hospital in Ireland &ndash; many hospitals are effectively prisons &ndash; should have to remain in those conditions any longer.</P>
      <P>The role adopted by the Irish Medicines Board on herbal remedies is extraordinary. There are vested interests involved. There are drugs on sale in the State which do not require prescription and are potentially lethal, for example, paracetamol. We know some drugs are lethal but the risk is deemed to be acceptable. Now we are imposing a burden of proof of harmlessness for many remedies people have been using for generations. This is a classic example of someone who has not enough work to do in their own field and tries to find other work to interest them. This should be brought to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> I support Senator Doyle's concern about a number of issues. We are allowing our waterways to be destroyed by increasing pollution, as the Environmental Protection Agency has identified. This will continue as long as we have a Government and a Minister for Finance who believe we should not increase public expenditure. We have the most reactionary Minister for Finance in the history of the State and we are going to have a national disaster&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support issues raised by Senators, particularly the plea made by Senators Manning and Costello for action in relation to the filling of the directorship of the National Library. It is a disgrace that this premier institution cannot attract people. It is clear that they are not paying the market rate.</P>
      <P>I also share the concerns of Senators about the attempt to over regulate the field of herbal remedies. I would like the debate to be widened to include the relationship between alternative medicine and general health provisions. I share some of the concerns expressed by Senator Dardis about toxicity. This issue could be dealt with under trade descriptions, by proper labelling or letting people know what the preparations are.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle made a helpful intervention on our failure to implement a number of European directives. Would it be possible to have a league or audit table once or twice a year against which we could see where we are falling down?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Doyle said about EU directives, particularly about waste management. Direct responsibility for agricultural waste management and its conversion into energy is divided between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader tell me if there is any advancement on a Government policy to deal with this matter? This issue is causing havoc, pollution and a lack of development in the Border counties, particularly Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday An Bord Gáis announced a new pipeline from Dundalk to Athlone, Galway, Limerick and Cork. Can the Leader arrange for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come here as a matter of urgency <Col N="1303" /> to explain why this pipeline could not be extended to Mayo? Recently a major gas find off the Mayo coast in the Corrib basin was announced. It is unbelievable that An Bord Gáis has announced a new pipeline without taking into consideration a county with the largest gas find in the history of this State.</P>

      <P>I ask for the Minister to come here as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>When is it hoped to take the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill? This is an important Bill which includes significant changes in the set up of the various boards under the control of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the continuing crisis of the supply of nurses to our health services and hospitals? It is a disgrace that, as we approach the new millennium, hundreds of people are lying on trolleys in hospitals and are not able to be admitted to medical wards because there are no nurses to man them. Agency nurses are not available to fill this demand. We need to fast track a scheme to get former nurses back into the service or, if necessary, to find nurses abroad. Something must be done about this matter immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate Senator Ryan's views that the Minister for Finance would entertain proper funding for the different issues he mentioned, we have had sufficient opportunities over the past two weeks to debate these issues, and I am sure the Minister is well aware of the needs. Will the Leader ensure the Minister for Finance provides adequate funding for the National Development Plan over the next seven years and provides funding for different amenities and facilities for the disabled? Substantial money was provided in the last National Development Plan and there is a great need for&mdash;</P>

      <P>I respect your opinion, a Chathaoirligh, and accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Burke's request in relation to the gas pipeline. When the first gas pipelines were introduced and after the connection to the Scottish finds, there was a proposal to have a pipeline from Dundalk to Sligo. That pipeline got as far as Kingscourt in County Cavan. Like Senator Burke, we in the north-west lack basic infrastructure and he is right, there has been a <Col N="1304" /> huge find off the Mayo coast. I would like the gas company to take into consideration the fact the west and the north-west do not have these facilities. It was intended that the pipeline would go as far as Sligo. On the northern side of the Border, it is proposed to construct a line from Belfast to Coolkeeragh to the power station. There has been much talk but nothing is happening. I fully support Senator Burke on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello and Maurice Hayes expressed concern regarding the position of Director of the National Library. As Senator Manning stated, this post has been vacant for three years, which is totally unacceptable. I will pass on the Senators' views to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for Finance after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole called for a debate on the setting up of a press council. I will arrange such a debate before the Christmas recess. Senator Costello and Senator Dardis raised Partnership for Peace. I, too, welcome the decision of the Dáil yesterday. We will have a full day's debate on this matter on Thursday next. I look forward to many Senators being present&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senators Costello, Norris, Hayes, Finneran, Dardis, Avril Doyle and Ryan called for debates on various matters relating to the European Parliament, reports from and matters pertaining to Europe. It is a matter which I am discussing with the leaders of the House to see how we can facilitate the considerable number of reports and proposed legislation from Europe, tease out how relevant they are and what recommendations the House can make to Ministers and Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Avril Doyle, Finneran, Dardis and others called for debates on health matters. We will have a debate on that before Christmas, if possible. I will pass on Senator Coghlan's views on the Great Southern Hotel Group. I know the 300 jobs in Kerry are of great importance to that area's economy. The Great Southern Hotel Group has been a great credit to the country. Their facilities have provided a flagship for the country for many years. Long before the tourist boom and the private sector became involved in the hotel business, the Great Southern Group played its part. The people of Kerry, Senator Coghlan and other Kerry Deputies are worried about this matter and I will pass on their views to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will convey Senator Jackman's views on the timeframe for heritage grants to the Minister. <Col N="1305" /> Senator Ryan raised the Mental Health Bill, which is to come before the House. I will allow time for a debate on this Bill, which is to be published before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke called for the gas pipeline to be extended to Mayo. As Senator Dan Kiely said yesterday, there are a lot of advantages to this project and I hope the gas pipeline goes to every county to sustain the rural population.</P>

      <P>Senator Bonner wanted to be associated with this request. Senator Burke also raised the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. This is a Dáil Bill and will be published this week. We hope to debate it here before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator O'Dowd's views to the Minister for Health and Children. Senator Leonard called for a debate on waste management. I can facilitate the Senator but not before the Christmas recess. There is a lengthy list of legislation to debate before Christmas. Today we are to take Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill and so far 356 amendments to the Bill have been put down. This shows that there will be a heavy workload for the House to deal with before 16 December. I hope to allow time for Senator Leonard's debate early in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 20, to delete &ldquo;Development&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Sustainable Land Use&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We will try not to delay the House too long on this amendment which is, however, a substantial one. It relates to the Title which we feel is a little too narrow and treats the Bill as dealing only with development and things that need to be done as opposed to conserving and defining other uses for land. Basically, nothing needs to be done with wetlands, rivers, estuaries, etc. The Bill should not be seen in terms of development only. This amendment suggests the use of the term &ldquo;Sustainable Land Use&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Development&rdquo; which is the principle the Minister is addressing in this Bill. We want a situation where land use can be sustained so the best possible use is made of our land resources and that they are not thought of in terms of development only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment because the term &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; underpins the Bill. There is no reason &ldquo;Sustainable Land Use&rdquo; cannot be included in the Title. There is no argument against it and it will broaden the scope of the Bill, as intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great number of amendments to this Bill and I hope we do not get into semantics on many of them. I do not see any reason for the amendment. The Preamble to the Bill mentions sustainable development. Surely the interpretation of planning includes the ethos of sustainability. However, development is also important and many people depend on planning structures which sensibly encourage and allow it. I hope we move on to amendments of substance rather than dealing in semantics.</P>

      <P>We are not engaged in semantics. This is significant and important legislation. It is the role of this House, and particularly the Opposition, to examine it, discuss it in detail and put down constructive amendments. This Bill will become law and it is our responsibility to ensure it works as well as possible. It will be useless coming back in a few years and saying we should have done x, y and z. The Senator's comments are extraordinary. We are here to do a job, let us get on with it. This is an important amendment, not a semantic one. It is clear from the Bill that the issue of development is treated broadly. Development is not about bricks and mortar, it has much wider implications and greater objectives. Development affects communities, the environment and land and this should be reflected in the Title. We put down this amendment so the Title would more accurately reflect the objective and substance of the Bill. This amendment is constructive, not semantic, and I hope the Senator's comments do not mark the tone of this debate. We are here to be constructive and supportive of the Minister. This is fine legislation and our amendments are designed to improve it, not to be negative or semantic.</P>

      <P>I hope we do not get off on the wrong foot today because legislation is often a matter of semantics. It is a requirement of the House to parse and analyse. If we do not do so, some of this material may wind up in court. It is important that the Title of the Bill clearly reflects the reality of the material contained within it. Also, it ought to give a signal that we are not just committed to the world of developers, which has caused some little difficulty for politicians in the not too distant past. We ought to be sensitive to and aware of it, although I will not make a meal of it. It is not useful at this stage, when we have shown goodwill, to start talking about semantics. We are not involved in semantics; these are amendments that have been seriously considered and which have been tabled with a reasonable intention.</P>

      <P>Over 300 amendments have been tabled to the Bill, which, in <Col N="1307" /> itself, is a good indication of the interest of Members of the House in the legislation. The approach to the Bill has been generally positive and I have no reason to doubt that this will continue. While we would all have appreciated it if there could have been fewer amendments, it is everybody's right to table them. There are a number of good amendments which I will be able to accept as we go through the Bill, while others can be referred to Report Stage. I intend to be positive about the amendments. I hope Senators on both sides of the House will accept my usual approach to legislation, which is that I do not believe all wisdom resides in the Custom House or in my head. I am pleased to accept amendments which I think will add to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 would change the Short Title of the Bill to Planning and Sustainable Land Use Act. Senator Henry's amendment, which was disallowed, sought to change the title of Part II Chapter I from &ldquo;Development Plans&rdquo; to &ldquo;Sustainable Land Use&rdquo;. I do not propose to accept this amendment because my aim, and that of the departmental officials, in drafting this legislation has been to make it as straightforward and simple as possible. As Members will appreciate, that is not an easy task in a planning and development Bill. We have tried to employ words in their normally accepted usage wherever possible.</P>
      <P>The Title of the Bill and the thrust of the legislation concerns planning. The term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; is now being used for the first time and is woven into the Bill. It is a broad term which is not defined and we will debate that fact later on. The language we are using in the legislation makes it quite clear what the Bill is about. It concerns planning and proper and sustainable development. Sustainable land use must be taken into account in all those things. The broader term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; covers what Senators have proposed in the amendment. In some ways, changing the wording to Sustainable Land Use Act would make the definition much narrower than it is, and I would not like to do that. I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment because the Title and the Bill itself are wide enough to cover what is contained in the concept of sustainable land use that they are talking about. We must talk in the broader terms of sustainable development and we are at one on this. The Title should remain as it stands. The accepted Title of the legislation is the Planning and Development Bill and that is what is being discussed on Committee Stage. The Title is sufficient.</P>

It was appropriate to refer to this matter and my view is still that the emphasis needs to be pushed in the direction of sustainable land use. However, I accept the Minister's comments <Col N="1308" /> that this is incorporated in the Bill and I will not delay the House by fighting over the Title.</P>

      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), line 11, after &ldquo;balloon,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;inflatable structure,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendments cover the same general material and would extend the definition which states &ndash;&ldquo;&lsquo;advertisement' means any word, letter, model, balloon, kite, poster, notice, device or representation employed for the purpose of advertisement, announcement or direction;&rdquo;. The next provision deals further with this area. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that inflatable structures of any type are covered. There are other types of inflatable structures which may or may not technically qualify as balloons. These include teddy bears, shells and Coca-Cola cans and they cannot always be defined as balloons. However, they may be covered by the term &ldquo;inflatable structures&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 states: &ldquo;In page 16, line 17, after &lsquo;advertisements' to insert &lsquo;or any attachment to a building or structure used for advertising purposes'&rdquo;. The ingenuity of the advertising industry is remarkable and I have no doubt there are many ways of getting around the Bill's provisions. However, I applaud the Minister's aim which is to cover as much of this territory as possible because of the visual pollution which is often involved. One sees petrol stations with enormous tigers which overwhelm the station. It appears <Col N="1309" /> almost as if they are committing some type of unspeakable act on the petrol pumps.</P>

Could it be blanketed that way with some reference, particularly to three-dimensional? Words, letters, hoarding and boards cover quite a lot but is there room for or would it be technically correct to include reference to any three-dimensional structure?

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;structure&rdquo; in the Bill further on is very wide so it covers quite a lot. There are two distinct amendments here which we are discussing &ndash; amendments Nos. 2 and 3. Senator Henry's amendment No. 2 seeks to extend the definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; to include &ldquo;inflatable structures&rdquo; and, as Senator Norris has stated, there is a huge number of different types of balloon involved. This amendment would probably clarify it even further and I am happy enough to accept this clarification of the types of advertisement that we put, subject to planning permission. We will include it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would be more than reluctant to take on amendment No. 3 precisely for the reason that Senator Norris himself outlined. It is actually covered at present in the previous Bill we passed and in the planning laws generally. I am afraid that, if we go into further definitions of it, we probably would give lawyers an opportunity to start arguing whether a thing was attached or if it was attached according to the meaning of the Act, or whatever else. I can assure the Senator the information I have is that the principle he is trying to cover is already clearly covered in the various Acts and it is not necessary. I am prepared to accept amendment No. 2 and ask the Senator to withdraw amendment No. 3 because it is already covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point made by Senator Coogan, I am accepting amendment No. 2 but we will look at some of the further definitions that have been suggested, such as the dirigible and the definition <Col N="1310" /> Senator Doyle proposed, before Report Stage to see whether it would make it clearer. In the meantime I will accept amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 25, after &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or stucco&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is really a very simple amendment. It is to ensure that the term &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; does in fact cover stucco. Stucco and plaster by some people's definition would be the same thing but in real terms stucco also involves paint, where there is paint work going into it as well. I simply wanted to ensure this would be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this strongly, particularly in view of the remarkable reputation this country has for eighteenth century stucco work. Senator Coogan is quite right, if it is left just as &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; it can leave out things such as gesso and all the rest of it, which are important elements of stucco ornamentation.</P>
      <P>Dublin's stucco work is internationally known and it could be taken that it is not covered by &ldquo;plaster&rdquo;. Most people, the general public, would regard stucco work as simply another aspect of plaster. Senator Coogan may very well be right, that technically it might not be protected. I am sure the Minister would wish to protect this important element of our heritage.</P>
      <P>My amendments Nos. 5 and 14 involve in page 16, line 25, after &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; inserting &ldquo;or the removal or alteration of doors, windows and roofing materials such as slates, tiles, timber, metal or concrete&rdquo;. This is rather an important amendment because the character of a building can be completely altered by changes in fenestration. We have had a lot of problems with this in the city of Dublin where windows have been removed, have been altered and different and unsympathetic fenestration put in. The removal of doors is a classic example, where buildings can be left open to winds. Damage can be done by the inappropriate removal of slates or the removal of original slates which are of particular character and their replacement with something completely unsympathetic. It is important that we extend the protections to cover these other kinds of building materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 proposes simply to extend the definition to include slates, windows, doors or roofs. The Bill specifies &ldquo;the removal of plaster, paint, wallpaper, tiles&rdquo; and then refers to &ldquo;other materials&rdquo;, which is a catch-all phrase. If one says <Col N="1311" /> that these other materials are contained in the phrase &ldquo;or other materials&rdquo; it leads one to ask why paint and wallpaper are specified. That specific inclusion would indicate that they are regarded as the most important and the other ones do not need to be specified. My experience, and I have worked a long time in conservation, would be to suggest that slates, windows, doors and roofs are important elements of a structure and in most cases a good deal more important than wallpaper, which will not keep a house standing. Doors, windows and tiles will be inclined to add more to the stability of the house, although I am not denigrating the necessity to keep, in certain circumstances, rare wallpapers. We have some very fine architects. One of my neighbours, John O'Connell, is an international expert on eighteenth and nineteenth century wallpapers and he has done some wonderful work in semi-derelict buildings in preserving wallpaper. I am not sneering at the inclusion of wallpaper. I simply say that these other items are absolutely fundamental. If we are going to specify wallpaper we ought to specify these other elements as well.</P>

      <P>By way of explanation on these two amendments, I would ask the Minister to assure me, if he is in a position to do so, that the definition of &ldquo;alteration&rdquo; on line 25, page 16, which refers to &ldquo;any plastering or painting&rdquo;, includes change of colour of paint. I support both amendments discussed already.</P>

      <P>Having looked through the Bill &ndash; I will not say I have spent hours studying it, though I have checked with colleagues &ndash; I notice there is no specific reference to change of colour of paint. We all know of rural hamlets, little maritime areas or lovely old towns and cities of our heritage that have been blighted by a sudden change to luminous yellow from what was a lovely backdrop colour which heretofore meshed beautifully with its surroundings. Is control given, through this legislation, to the planning authorities in relation to what I would call the blight of some of the paintwork and artwork used on the exteriors of our built heritage and structures? If this is not tied down in the Bill I would ask the Minister to consider taking an amendment from me on Report Stage. I would be pleased if, under the definition section we are discussing now, it read &lsquo;includes any plastering, or painting, including change of colour, or removal of plaster' etc. and then the addition of the amendments we have just discussed. I would like to see it specifically named unless the Minister can assure me that, somewhere else in the Bill, it has already been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments made, particularly in relation to stucco. While I am no expert on plaster work, there is much to be preserved. The architectural protection Act which was introduced earlier this year covered many aspects of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>To illustrate that I do not always disagree with Senator Norris, some of his comments on colouring should be looked at. This relates in particular to external colouring, which Senator Avril Doyle also mentioned. We could go too far in that respect, however. If every small alteration required planning permission I would be concerned about the ability of the system to cope. I have seen new housing estates constructed on prominent landscapes where the colour used has been appalling, but planners tell me they have no control in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We should try to ensure that provision is made in the Bill for planners to have an input. I understand that alterations to external paintwork may be covered by the terms of the Bill. The display of a consistent colour scheme throughout an estate should be protected against those who might break the pattern by using their own choice of colour, such as purple, although I have nothing against that colour. Within the ambit of the Bill we should safeguard against colours being chosen which are totally inconsistent with the general decor of an estate. To simplify the process the local authority could publish a list of colours which individuals would not require planning permission to use. If one went outside those colours, however, a planning application would be necessary. We must examine the practicalities as well as the effects of what we are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 4, I am sure that stucco is covered in our definition. Senator Coogan will remember that we had a long discussion about this previously and as a result of amendments that were tabled we included painting, wallpaper and plastering. It will not cause huge difficulties to make sure it is included. On that basis, even though I am quite satisfied from what I have been told that legally it is not an absolute necessity, we will insert it to make absolutely sure. I will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking &ndash; and I have done this myself when in Opposition &ndash; one goes through a Bill in great detail and one tends to pick up things in particular sections, but one can become confused with so many amendments being tabled. We must guard against becoming too prescriptive <Col N="1313" /> in legislation such as this. In effect, the more detailed we become the easier it is for people to find loopholes in the legislation, so we should maintain a balance.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to accept amendment No. 5 for the reason adverted to by Senator Walsh. The effect of the amendment would be to extend the definition of alteration for all structures to include &ldquo;the removal or alteration of doors, windows and roofing materials such as slates, tiles, timber, metal or concrete&rdquo;. One would have to apply for planning permission for all structures, no matter where they were, to do any of these works. That would totally submerge the entire planning system. It would not be an effective way of doing business and in most cases it is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I accept the case that has been made regarding protected structures and townscapes which are already included in the architectural protection Act, passed earlier this year, and which has been subsumed into this Bill. About six months ago we discussed this issue in the architectural protection legislation, which made provision for protected and proposed structures.</P>
    <P>Any kind of painting refers to changing the colour scheme. In fact, painting the same colour is covered in the Bill, but this relates to protected buildings and structures. Amendment no. 5 would extend the same provision to every building and I do not think that is reasonable. For the sake of certainty I will accept amendment No. 4 but I cannot accept amendment No. 5 on the basis that it would impose a huge burden on local authorities. Amendment No. 14 is already covered by the architectural protection legislation which was passed by the House about six months ago, so it is unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some concerns about the Minister's response. As he said, the architectural protection Act is being subsumed into this Bill. Does that only deal with what we generally refer to as the different categories of listed properties or does it extend, for example, to villages such as Kilmore Quay in County Wexford? I give that as an example because I know it so well. It is a beautiful old maritime village containing many thatched cottages with whitewashed walls and some new developments which have to mesh in with the older structures. The village has a unique maritime character but there has been the odd example of a house being painted luminous yellow or purple, as Senator Walsh said. Will the Minister assure me that the architectural protection legislation, as subsumed into the Planning and Development Bill, will give the local authority sufficient powers to prevent people from painting their houses yellow or red in villages such as Kilmore Quay, where there is not a blanket listing? Is there a way in which the planning authority can exercise control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> I do not want planning authorities to operate like a police state and I take the Minister's point that if we go too far people will be afraid to move without planning permission. That is not what we should do, but we should free the hands of the local authority to tackle blatant abuses of planning law. The Minister should examine the culture of building first and applying for planning permission only if one is caught, which is rife throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We should refer to specific paint colours, bearing in mind there is a range of colours for which no permission will be required. If, however, someone steps totally out of sync with the surrounding environment there should be some control that local authorities can exercise, if they wish to.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has not already done so he should examine the relevant UK legislation. In Britain, if someone paints their door a different colour, the authorities do not run up and down hammering on the door. In beautiful villages and towns in the UK they have done a wonderful job, although there was a little pain in terms of public acceptance. One recognises what has been achieved there when one drives through such places which have undergone outstanding development. Over the years, the best of the past has been conserved in Britain.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure something is put in place without dictating what colour all houses have to be painted. Will the Minister give an assurance that a reference, including colour, can be made, if not in this section then at an appropriate part in the Bill? Perhaps the Minister will reassure me in regard to my concerns if he is not accepting amendment No. 5? The point is well made by the proposers of the amendment, Senators Norris, O'Meara and others that we are leaving ourselves slightly open in this area.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister telling us that the Architectural Protection Act specifically includes the points made by this amendment for properties other than what we generally refer to as listed or heritage properties, that there are different categories of listing? The vernacular architecture is as important as what we refer to as our built heritage; it is part of our built heritage and should be protected in the same way. I am concerned about the character of the Irish countryside, towns, villages and seasides. The vernacular architecture impacts perhaps more in terms of the feel of our country than Georgian Dublin and various other places which are extremely important. I want to ensure that the Architectural Protection Act will cover this matter if the amendment, which I strongly support, is not accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take an example of windows, which are important not only in terms of list one buildings but also because there is a proliferation of the awful PVC windows, which open out, replacing sash windows which open up and down, <Col N="1315" /> and doors. They can have a disastrous impact on the appearance of an entire streetscape and this should be included, not just in respect of list one buildings but also those which are not yet at least considered so important.</P>
      <P>A former Member of this House, Alderman Carmencita Hederman, had a long and difficult campaign against these PVC windows which open out. They disastrously affect the appearance of buildings. I am not convinced yet by the Minister on this matter. I will not push him but will leave it so that we can raise it again on Report Stage. I will meet the people who briefed and advised me on this matter and return to the Minister with their views after this debate. I am not completely reassured yet. If we are prepared to include paint and wallpaper, which is a fairly invasive interest in somebody's property, and if local authorities are prepared to take an interest, surely to God they should be prepared to take an interest in doors, walls and slates.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy with what has been said in support of the amendment but I am concerned, being familiar with the increasing number of applications to planning authorities, that people who apply for permission for very minor alterations, many of which do not cause any difficulty to anyone and do not detract from the general appearance either of the house or the locality, have to go through this process. Is there not already scope for the planning authority within its development plan? In Wexford a booklet was produced, Building Sensitively in the Landscape, which received much criticism from the Members. I do not like referring to it because in other fora I have been highly critical of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it is excellent. The Senator mentioned Kilmore which, as a strong heritage location, although not designated as such, has an inherent and intrinsic value. Anything that would devalue such areas would detract from that heritage, to the detriment of the enjoyment of future generations. That almost became the doctrine for planning applications across the county in every area. I strongly disagreed at the time and still disagree. It showed <Col N="1316" /> there is a mechanism in the system to deal with the sentiments in the amendment without becoming overprescriptive whereby everybody would have to go through the loop, incurring costs and unnecessary difficulties in many cases. The planning authority may have the scope to control the worst excesses we are trying to guard against. Perhaps that line should be taken rather than channelling everything through a planning application.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I agree fully with what Senator Avril Doyle has said on painting. If people lost the run of themselves and painted their cottages in Kilmore pink, green or red it would destroy the area. It would take only one person to do this to detract completely from the amenity value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Members that we are talking about definitions. Section 55 of the Bill covers most of these points. In answer to Senator Doyle's questions, the local authorities under the Planning and Development Act, 1999, have power to designate conservation areas. The places to which she referred in the UK and Britain where the character of villages and towns is preserved are dealt with under similar legislation. Under our legislation, the local authority can have a listed building or a conservation area such as Kilmore Quay. Another good example would be Adare, County Limerick. There is power in the Bill for that to be done. Section 55 outlines the various rules and regulations of works affecting the character of protected structures or proposed protected structures and also in the Act which was previously passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law protects against the activities we have talked about such as changing to PVC windows and doors and any kind of a material alteration without planning permission. The planning regulations being drafted under the 1999 Act provide that works to exterior structures which are usually exempt elsewhere will be included. They will not be exempt from planning regulations where they are inconsistent with the provisions of the architectural conservation area. It is up to the local authorities to declare the villages of Kilmore Quay, Adare, etc. as architectural conservation areas. That will protect the whole area and individual buildings will get the same treatment as individual buildings in other sections of the Bill. The regulations are being drawn up and will clearly cover, as does the Bill, changing the colour of paint to alter the exterior of a building. It also covers the issues mentioned about windows, doors and so on. We are merely dealing with a definition. The meat of the protections is contained further on in the Bill. The planning and development Act passed earlier this year is sub<Col N="1317" /> sumed into this Bill and the details are contained therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am less and less satisfied as I read this. We are not saying that planning permission should be sought for any alteration. This would mean a huge proliferation in applications to local authorities. We are talking about anything that materially alters the external appearance of a structure and renders its appearance inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures. We are talking about a fairly major intervention, not just any little change. If we decide that, because of the level of bureaucracy involved, we will permit work to be carried out, we are saying that we are prepared to tolerate alterations to windows, doors, roofs, tiles and so on even in circumstances where they would materially alter the appearance of a structure or render it inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures. This is very worrying. The Minister is shaking his head and perhaps he can reassure me.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this issue, particularly in relation to windows. At the moment, I am doing a huge job on my house and windows are being restored. I have an extremely good architect and very decent fine builders, an old family firm. It was suggested putting in a small window which would open out in a small bathroom at the top of the house where it would not be noticed. I would not allow this. It was difficult to get the weight boxes in and was a lot more expensive but I know it would have ruined the appearance of the house. This could only be seen from my back garden or from Rutland Place, which at the moment is a pretty squalid lane. However, I felt so strongly that this would alter the character of the houses that I insisted on putting in the correct windows.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which needs to be considered. I will not put this to a vote this morning but I will go back and consult the people who briefed me. I am not happy that the amendment is not being accepted. The principle of this amendment should be considered to see if it can be accepted. Neither am I happy that the issue is covered under section 55.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;approval' means the grant of a detailed permission by a planning authority subsequent to the grant of an outline permission which enables an applicant with an outline permission to commence works to implement this approval permission; an approval permission can also be conditioned by a planning authority when granting per<Col N="1318" /> mission for a development which it considers acceptable in principle but for which it will require an approval permission due to the nature, scale or phasing of a development particularly if the life of the permission granted may be longer than 5 years;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a definition of &ldquo;approval&rdquo;. There are definitions of &ldquo;advertisement structure&rdquo;, &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;, &ldquo;alteration&rdquo;, &ldquo;appeal&rdquo;, &ldquo;attendant grounds&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Birds Directive&rdquo;, &ldquo;Board&rdquo; and so on. We need to insert a definition of &ldquo;approval&rdquo; so that the whole machinery is clearly and adequately spelt out and we know what we are dealing with. It is important to include in the Bill a definition of what an &ldquo;approval&rdquo; is, the limits placed on it and the procedures by which an approval is sought, granted, continued, extended and conditioned, where conditions are attached by the planning authority to limit the scope of development or to ensure that certain guidelines are followed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason a definition of &ldquo;approval&rdquo; is not included in the Bill is that we are getting rid of the concept of approval from the system. The Bill does away with the previous approval system in the context of planning permission. Section 35 provides for outline permission which is subject to further permission. Outline permission is defined as the agreement in principle to the development of land subject to a further planning application. This further planning application replaces the previous approval process which was, in effect, a <i>de facto</i> full planning permission. This has been removed because it simplifies and makes clearer the planning process. If a person receives outline planning permission, they can apply for full planning permission within three years.</P>
      <P>The second element of the amendment is linked to section 40 and it would be probably better to discuss it in the context of that section.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 31, after &ldquo;townscape&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any open space between such structures or adjacent to such structures&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to allow for the inclusion of open space, gardens, green spaces and so on, in addition to merely the structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would include the words &ldquo;or any open space between such structures or adjacent to such structures&rdquo; to the definition of the architectural conservation area. The definition of &ldquo;architectural conservation area&rdquo; already includes this concept of open space between or adjacent to structures. It refers to townscapes, which is the term we have used. The dictionary definition of a townscape is &ldquo;a portion <Col N="1319" /> of the town which the eye can view all at once&rdquo;. This clearly includes buildings, open spaces and so on. Obviously it must include the open spaces between buildings.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I have a fear of legal people looking for loopholes in the legislation. I would be wary of attempts to amend the legislation as this could lead to attempts to designate parks, gardens or whatever on their own, not in the context of being within an architecturally special area. During the debate on the 1999 Act, we changed the definition of &ldquo;architectural conservation areas&rdquo;. It was accepted at the time that this was a welcome clarification. I believe the definition of &ldquo;architectural conservation area&rdquo; is very clear. It meets the Senator's concerns and in that context I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;material contravention' is where an application if granted would be in breach of a specific policy, or a specific objective and a specific zoning in a development plan, local area plan, an area of special amenity or a landscape conservation area;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is important. Again, it seeks to add a definition. We hear much about material contraventions but there is no definition. In practice the determination of what constitutes a material contravention is left to the manager. It may well be that a reasonable determination is made but it is inappropriate that there is not a definition. It should not be exclusively within the remit of the manager to decide what constitutes a material contravention. The amendment spells it out in simple, clear language and moves it from being a decision of one individual within a bureaucratic structure. This is an important amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is correct in saying that we have not previously attempted a definition of &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;, although it is a long-standing concept in planning law and is generally well understood. There may be merit in defining it, but any definition would have to be carefully worded. It is something I would like to consider before Report Stage. While I have no difficulty with examining how it may be defined, I cannot accept the wording in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; do not appear in the Bill but the phrase &ldquo;would materially contravene&rdquo; is used. That concept is not confined to planning applications as the amendment suggests. For example, section 162 prevents local authorities from carrying out developments which materially contravene the development plan. The Senator has raised an important point but it is not <Col N="1320" /> met by his amendment. It is something I would like to consider and perhaps bring forward an amendment for Report Stage. I will examine the situation. If the Senator withdraws his amendment, he can always resubmit it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable reaction from the Minister as it would be necessary to obtain proper legal opinion on this. There is a need for a clearcut legal definition so that councillors and managers can refer to the law to defend their position. The Minister's proposal to bring forward an alternative wording for Report Stage is acceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's flexible response. I am not hung up on the definition as I am not a legal expert, although I am extremely litigious. The Minister accepts the need for it to be examined. It is inappropriate and unfair on a manager to leave the matter to his discretion. A definition is important. Although the Minister said the words &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; do not appear, the principle is contained in the phrase &ldquo;would materially contravene&rdquo;. I will be happy if the Minister, with the assistance of his advisers, formulates a definition as it would solve our problem. I look forward to this amendment being produced by the Government on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(i) any prescribed body in relation to any appeal in an area zoned for amenity purposes or affecting any listed structures or architectural conservation areas.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is important in that it refers to the parties to an appeal or referral and defines who they are. This is consistent with an inclusive approach to planning, especially in local areas, and it ensures everyone is allowed to make a contribution and is part of the process. This is a significant amendment and I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add to what I said as my mind was still on the other amendment. This amendment is important as it gives bodies such as An Taisce and the wildlife trust a status rather than their just being an applicant. It is important for that reason that a discussion with these groups is included. I say this to make my intervention a little more forceful as my mind was still occupied with the previous amendment when I made my first contribution to this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>No one would object greatly to the principle of this amendment. The thrust of the Bill is to involve as many people as possible in consultations. However, the amendment appears to require prescribed bodies to be parties to an appeal or that notice of appeals should be referred to them automatically where they concern areas zoned for amenity purposes or they affect listed structures or architectural conservation areas. This amendment would overwhelm the prescribed bodies. They are unlikely to want to participate in all such appeals and involving them automatically in this manner would mean a great deal of valuable administrative time would be taken up dealing with material. Perhaps Senators should consider the implications for prescribed bodies.</P>
      <P>At present, they are notified of applications relevant to them and they can participate in the decision made at that stage if they wish. However, it is their choice; it is not compulsory. We are also conscious of and have retained their right to appeal a decision to the board, even if they are not notified as required. The prescribed bodies have important rights of participation but, on the basis of the amendment, I foresee them being needlessly deluged with paper. Perhaps the Senators should consider the amendment and withdraw it with the option of tabling it again on Report Stage. The amendment as it stands would not do the prescribed bodies any favours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not push the matter at this stage, but the amendment came from one of principal prescribed bodies and was supported by the others. They do not seem to be as intimidated by the proposed blizzard of paperwork as the Minister suggested they might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would give them that opportunity. Their intention is to keep the participation as broad as possible. As long as that is met, we will be happy. This amendment came from and was argued for by the prescribed bodies and they seem to have an interest in it. The Minister referred to notifications. Even those can be sometimes bothersome, but they are important. The small but significant preservation society in which I am involved receives notices of everything. We try to become involved in anything which alters the character of the area and we feel passionately about it. Obviously these bodies feel the same because it is at their request that I tabled this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind what the Minister said, which is pertinent, I would have difficulty with being selective about who these parties should be. Senator Norris referred to An Taisce which does a great deal of good work in this area. However, there are other bodies which would not be identifiable but which could have a more <Col N="1322" /> important connection to a particular planning application. I am thinking in particular of residents' associations where an application might be made which could impact materially on their local environment. While they could not be identified, they would obviously have a direct interest. I am not sure we would be doing the right thing in being selective in the legislation.</P>
      <P>All bodies with an interest in planning issues are on local authority mailing lists and would receive a list of planning applications as they are submitted. Therefore, they would have a direct knowledge of the various applications made and would have the scope to pursue those in which they would have a particular interest. That mechanism is perhaps sufficient to meet the purposes of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment only refers to areas zoned for amenity purposes or affecting any listed structures or architectural conservation areas. In that context, we are only talking about a limited number of appeals. Senator Norris has made it clear what prescribed body we are talking about in the amendment. The amendment is important, particularly in the context of later provisions in the Bill. Section 36 proposes that only persons who have already made submissions to local authorities on relevant planning applications can lodge appeals. That is one of the more contentious elements of the Bill which will undoubtedly be opposed. This amendment seeks to ensure that specific prescribed bodies, and An Taisce in particular, would be notified of appeals. I put it to the Minister that since the amendment only refers to areas zoned for amenity purposes or affecting any listed structures, we are not seeking any great concession here.</P>
      <P>In the context of inclusiveness rather than exclusivity and our continuing desire to ensure that information is disseminated in relation to planning, this is an amendment which the Minister could embrace. It would certainly strengthen the Bill and the role of An Taisce which, over the years, has done such good work throughout the country in regard to conservation and planning. It is often the case that it is the members of An Taisce in local communities who are up to speed on what is going on. They are the people who take it upon themselves to stay up to date on planning issues and who keep an eye on particular buildings in a locality in which ordinary members of the public might have a passing interest but would not have the expertise or ongoing experience to watch out for any potentially damaging planning applications. In that context, I would see An Taisce as a partner with local authorities in the entire development and conservation process. It would act as an outside observer, one which local authorities should be happy to have on board. This amendment would ensure that would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I think about it, the more I think it would be absurd to exclude An Taisce. <Col N="1323" /> Its members are the people principally involved and concerned with planning issues. They have acted as watchdogs when other bodies, including councils, corporations and Government, betrayed the country's heritage. Now the Minister is telling us that they do not want to be involved when they have clearly indicated that they do. An Taisce does not feel it will be overwhelmed by this provision and, surely, the circumstances to which the amendment relate are those in which one would most want An Taisce to be involved. The expertise, knowledge, passion and commitment of its members would be very valuable. I certainly have not received any instruction from An Taisce to withdraw this amendment; indeed, it seems to be in favour of it. An Taisce has a track record in this area and I feel strongly that the amendment should be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be somewhat at cross purposes here. An Taisce is a prescribed body and we are not doing anything in this legislation to change its status. An Taisce has an entitlement to obtain any information on any planning applications or appeals which directly affect its duties. Its duties are widely defined as anything which affects the natural or built heritage; that covers practically everything.</P>
      <P>I would not like Senators to be under the illusion that we are attempting to proscribe An Taisce's rights as a prescribed body. I take the opportunity of reiterating the very valuable role played by An Taisce and some of the other bodies referred to, some of which are prescribed and some of which are not, in the planning and development system and in the protection of our heritage and environment.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to receive an invitation from An Taisce last Saturday week to address its conference in Dublin Castle at which it looked forward to the role it would play in the 21st century. The speech I delivered was a positive one in which I sought to encourage An Taisce to expand further. Those Senators who are familiar with An Taisce will be aware that in recent years, An Taisce's membership base has decreased and it is experiencing difficulty fulfilling its current role. I have encouraged the organisation to reorganise and redevelop. Like many other organisations throughout the country, An Taisce was formerly well spread throughout the country but a generation change is now required. A gap has developed in the organisation and that must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Senators that An Taisce will not be restricted. Its functions will continue as they are. The amendment refers to areas zoned for amenity purposes. The phrase &ldquo;amenity purposes&rdquo; is extremely wide and could have huge effects on the organisation. Being party to an appeal under the planning system does not merely mean one is notified of the existence of an appeal, one actually receives all documentation involved in the appeal and is expected to be <Col N="1324" /> actively involved in the appeal. That is the concern I have for some of the organisations.</P>
    <P>While we may be talking at cross purposes, we all want to preserve the participation of outside groups and bodies and, in particular, we want to protect the rights of the prescribed bodies as we have done in the Bill. Perhaps if people stand back from this, they may see a better way of achieving the amendment's objectives. As I said to the Senator earlier, if they want to talk to the people and the people want to talk to us then we could look at it again on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Have many of those groups, including the Heritage Council, An Taisce and An Bord Pleanála, the resources to carry out an indepth study of planning applications on appeal? Recently the Heritage Council lodged an objection to a planning application without visiting the site. This application will set a precedent for the county concerned. The council examined a planning application by looking at a map in its office. That is disgraceful. Recently, an engineer who visited a site made a recommendation and An Bord Pleanála made a different decision. It was completely at variance with what the engineer or inspector who visited the site had recommended. Other than holding up many planning applications throughout the country, can the Minister tell me if those groups have the resources or can be given the resources to carry out thorough and fast inspections?  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 2(1), page 19, lines 8 to 9, it says, &ldquo;&lsquo;party of an appeal or referral' means planning authority and any of the following persons, as appropriate&rdquo;. It does not mean they are automatically involved. That is already covered. In the light of remarks I passed in this Chamber on the subject of councillors and members of county councils, I have friends in this area of public life. A number of them have expressed the view to me that if these prescribed bodies were not specifically named, they would never be included because of the nature of county councils and they would not be involved in the process. It is no harm to push this amendment. I will not push it to a vote and I will take it back and consult people. I am glad the Minister has indicated some degree of flexibility. Perhaps we can come to some kind of an arrangement on this. It is quite an important point. If Members read the Bill they will see that it is not as black and white as they might think in the beginning because it says &ldquo;any of the following persons, as appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain who decides whether they are appropriate. Is that clear in the Bill? Do they make themselves appropriate by applying if they are a nominated prescribed body? Is it required that they be sent notification and they would then be put in? It is just a matter of my own ignorance. I would like to know.  </P>

      <P>It comes back to my earlier response in relation to the definition of the Bill. There needs to be a perspective and that is why I was anxious that it would be a Planning and Development Bill. Senator Burke has reminded me that there have been instances where some of these bodies have involved themselves in applications with a total disregard to the economic well being of an area, and large areas at that.

      <P>There are some prime examples of that; Senator Burke might have alluded to a case with which I am familiar. The purpose of legislation is to ensure that a proper approach is taken to this area. Within this Bill and what has operated to date, there is adequate provision, particularly for those bodies which have played a constructive role in the planning process &ndash; there have been significant aberrations with which I strongly disagreed &ndash; but in the main they played a constructive role. There is adequate scope within the regulations for these people to be consulted and actively involved, and they are. However, I would caution against setting up a system which is anti-development. That message should not go out. It is all very fine to talk in today's economic climate when we have significant growth and high employment, but it not long since we had high unemployment. People and parties represented in this Chamber, particularly in Leitrim, and I will not say that the company involved has covered itself in glory since, but the Minister of the day with other members of the Heritage Council far from excelled themselves in the manner in which they dealt with that and the signal it sent to overseas investors. I would be wary of putting anything in legislation which would promote that type of approach as it would be undesirable in the long term.

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Burke about various groups, the Heritage Council is a State body and, therefore, it is a matter for another Minister. I have not heard of difficulties in discharging its planning remit. The Heritage Council restricts its participation in the planning process to buildings of national importance. An Taisce has a wide remit &ndash; the protection of natural and built environments and dealing with any proposed work or development that might affect that. The Office of Public Works used to have that role. Dúchas probably has it now or perhaps it discharges it through the Heritage Council as well; it was a prescribed body. In response to Senator Norris's point about the term &ldquo;as appropriate&rdquo;, that means as appropriate to the type of appeal or referral, not to the function of the body itself. Therefore, the term &ldquo;as appropriate&rdquo; does not work in that instance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the conflict, we can all cite cases where a body, such as An Taisce, an environmental group, an NGO or a residents' group, has objected to planning and development of a work we all thought should have gone ahead and we can cite examples where we think some of them were unreasonable. Equally, we can all point to developments that have been allowed to go ahead by local authorities, even by An Bord Pleanála, which many of us felt should never have been given planning permission. Planning and development are strictly covered by law, regulation, etc., and there is a certain amount of subjectivity involved. It is very important that we have checks and balances in the system. This is inconvenient at times, particularly with regard to a development that we think would be worthwhile in our constituency but someone does not like it because it affects something they are concerned about.</P>
      <P>It is very healthy that we have that divergence of views. Whoever is looking to alter the natural environment by development should have to justify fully what they are doing. All we are trying to do in this Bill is to continue that and to ensure people justify fully what they are doing. On the other hand, our response should be reasonable and those who want to object should have a reasonable chance to do so. Once that procedure has been gone through and whatever amendments are made, the development should go ahead in a reasonable period. That is the object of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> We will always find pluses and minuses, no matter who drafts such legislation. There are changes which can be made as we go through this process. What we are talking about in terms of this Bill is balance and sustainable development and if we keep those two elements in mind we will achieve something significant for the environment. Those are the main points which have been raised in relation to it. There will always be conflict when it comes to planning and specific developments. The Bill and the various provisions in it will help to minimise that conflict and ensure the protection of the environment as well.</P>

I under<Col N="1328" /> stand Senator Norris's proposal but the amendment is not as innocuous one would think. It looks innocuous but it would change the definition in a very subtle and important way, of which the Senator would not approve.

      <P>The amendment the Senator proposes may have the unintended effect of lessening the overall protection of architectural heritage, which we already agreed in the 1999 Act. It could be read to mean that it would be sufficient to preserve the character of part of a protected structure rather than the whole structure.

      <P>I appreciate what the Senator is seeking. The amendment seeks to extend the definition of substratum of land so as to include land required for the extraction of resources. This is a misunderstanding of the purpose of this definition. It is only used in the context of the local authority compulsory acquisition of land under Part XIV of the Bill. The definition is merely a technical one and is included as a result of the transfer of the Minister's powers in relation to CPOs, road schemes and so on to An Bord Pleanála. The Senator's amendment makes no sense in that context. The extraction of minerals and so on is dealt with in other legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following new definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;sustainable development' means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs which is the definition provided in the World Commission on Environment and Development as published in its report entitled Our Common Future in 1987. The Minister shall by regulations make specific definitions relative to sustainable development for specific sectors in a planning context e.g. transportation.</P>
      <P>This is an attempt to flesh out the Bill by giving a definition. We already had some discussion about including &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; in the Title and have agreed it is one of the significant purposes and objectives of the Bill, therefore, it seems strange there is not a clear definition of what constitutes sustainable development. We really should have one. I am not particularly stuck on this definition but it seems reasonable because it comes from the World Commission on Environment and Development, a body of long standing on which Gro Harlem Bruntland, Willy Brandt and Ted Heath served, and presumably, they are in a position to give us a reasonable definition of what constitutes &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo;. If the World Commission on Environment and Development comes up with this we should bear it in mind. The inclusion of a definition is important. If the Minister has a difficulty with this definition and wants to come up with his own, I will be happy enough.</P>

      <P>I am not wedded to the wording of the amendment we put forward but we are try<Col N="1330" /> ing to insert the principle of defining sustainable development in the Bill. This would be very welcome. The concept is a fundamental one and is a cornerstone of environmental policy. It is important that this Bill contains such a definition. Though this amendment is not perfect by any means, I hope the Minister will accept the principle behind it and return with a tighter and more focused amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Senators are trying to do in inserting a definition of sustainable developments, though such a definition would exercise the mind for a considerable period. The definition cited here, the Bruntland definition, was developed in 1987 and is commonly accepted. It is the one we worked to and the Bill tries to incorporate it.</P>
      <P>I assure Senators that there was a considerable amount of discussion about this and we listened to various opinions on the matter. We feel that the concept of sustainable development is a dynamic one and is likely to continue to change. Putting a definition in the Bill would either tend to stifle the dynamism of the concept or else it would be so vague as to cause endless problems for those in planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála in deciding planning permissions on the grounds of whether developments were sustainable or not. We felt regulations allowing the Minister redefine this for various sectors would be a way of kicking the problem to touch. It was decided to try to weave the concept of sustainable development throughout the Bill and I agreed with that decision. I have given examples of the ways in which we have tried to do this.</P>
      <P>The development objectives to be contained in a development plan obviously reflect the environmental concerns of the modern age and that has been worked into the Bill. There is a provision for enhanced public participation in planning for their locality through local area plans, for instance. The environmental assessment of regional planning guidelines is specifically provided for and that is also the case for development and local area plans. There are new environmental measures within the Bill to protect landscapes. There are tree preservation orders and measures to facilitate the protection of public rights of way included also. There is also a section dealing with protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures are all woven into the Bill and they make the concept of sustainable development practical. I was persuaded by the arguments that this is the best way to incorporate the concept of sustainable development in the Bill. We carried out research throughout the world to see how other countries have incorporated sustainable development and if they have included definitions in their legislation. Finland is regarded as the country that pioneered the concept of sustainable development but it does not have a definition of sustainable development. The only country which has attempted a definition is <Col N="1331" /> Canada, although Senators can correct me if I am wrong. However, Canada included that definition in a sustainable development Bill rather than a planning and development Bill.</P>
    <P>We are at one on the concept and ensuring that it is respected in the Bill, but we could defeat our purpose by including a rigid and strict definition. People may think I have a fixation with lawyers, but if a definition is included, one allows legal people the opportunity perhaps to create loopholes that were never intended. As this is such a dynamic concept it is not right to include a definition in the Bill and for that reason I ask Senators to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Birds Directive is defined on page 16, the European Communities (Natural Habitat) Regulations are referred to on page 17, the Habitats Directive on page 18 etc. I raised this matter on today's Order of Business and I am glad to have the opportunity to put this question directly to the Minister, instead of the Leader of the House, who is also present, making representations to him. In view of the fact that these directives are incorporated in the Bill, is the Minister concerned that as regards the Habitats Directive, Ireland is the second worst member state in terms of its progress in the designation of sites and that inaction in relation to this directive could cause problems for Ireland in the next round of Structural Funds? There is a case before the European Court of Justice in relation to the Habitats Directive. What are the implications for this Bill of our inaction in transposing these directives into national law, either in part or completely?</P>
      <P>The same case can be made for the Birds Directive. The Commission is considering similar moves as per the Habitats Directive but they are less advanced. How will that affect this Bill? We have also been slapped on the wrist for failing to transpose the Directive on the Pollution of Rural Drinking Water. We have been indicted by the Commission as regards the Dangerous Substances Directive, which is extremely important for proper planning and development, and our waste management plans. The European Court of Justice decided against Ireland as regards the environmental impact assessment. I could continue but in the spirit of the debate and as this applies to section 2, I will not. I would appreciate answers from the Minister and I hope he will outline his concern about our lack of progress in these areas. Perhaps he will explain whether the failure to transpose these directives, fully or in part, will cause problems for this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are widening the discussion on the definitions in the section. I wrote to each local authority 12 to 15 months ago and asked them to review their planning departments. I assured them that whatever needs they had would be met by the Department and if they needed extra staff they would be provided. As a result we have increased the number of planning staff by 14 per cent throughout the country. I am not aware of the refusal of any reasonable local authority request for extra staff. I am not worried about the Department holding up the appointment of staff. There are difficulties in retaining staff in local authorities because of the economy. There is a more rapid turnover of staff than previously which is causing difficulty. However, this has nothing to do with the Department holding up the appointment of staff but is a problem of the local authorities being unable to fill vacancies, even though we have increased the number of positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard reaction to planning problems is the suggestion that more staff and money should be allocated. All of us are aware of practices in local authorities which could be changed in order to streamline the effectiveness of planning offices. Some local authorities are making these changes. One local authority is providing computers for the public to check their planning applications and they can access a fair amount of information. It is now working on providing three dimensional drawings of planning applications. This should cut <Col N="1334" /> down on a certain amount of the work. I will probably not be popular with Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities for saying a huge amount of the time of county council staff is taken up by public representatives raising queries and making representations. This system could also be streamlined. Most councils have area meetings, at which files for particular areas could be discussed. Representations could be noted on the file instead of clogging up the system. Organisational measures such as this might reduce the workload for staff.</P>
    <P>We are aware this Bill will increase some of the pressure and Bord Pleanála and local authorities will need extra resources. We are discussing this with managers and planners to try to ensure that as soon as the Bill is enacted, the staff and systems will be in place. We are conscious of this and we have already begun to work on it. However, because of the booming economy, local authorities are having difficulty retaining staff. This problem will not be easily resolved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 23, subsection (2), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)the change of use of any land for any purpose other than agricultural use shall be <Col N="1335" /> considered a material change of use unless the proposed use is consistent with the zoning of such land in an existing development plan.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope these amendments will be accepted also because they are substantial and important and, if necessary, we will press them. Amendment No. 16 is most important because it covers anything that is inconsistent and it would strengthen the protections envisaged in the legislation. It also excludes changes that may be necessary for the agricultural development of land. I will deal further with this matter in the context of the Minister's response and those of my able colleagues. I wish to put on record my appreciation for the work of Senator O'Meara in assisting with the amendments and her courtesy in coming to a composite proposal where the Labour Party allowed my name to stand first on the amendment. This may not be directly relevant to the Bill but such a good working relationship between individuals and parties is a valuable part of the parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>I have a strong conviction on amendment No. 17 not due to any virtue or special intelligence on my part but because I was listening to the radio recently and I heard a former colleague of mine who is a little eccentric. Professor Hugh Sacker used to be the professor of German in Trinity College, Dublin, but he withdrew from that conventional life and lives close to nature in the Glen of Immal. I think it was on Pat Kenny's show that Professor Sacker complained bitterly that his life was being radically disturbed by the redevelopment of a sand quarry. This is precisely the type of subject which will be covered by the amendment.</P>
    <P>Professor Sacker accepted that the sand quarry had existed for many years, but it was an ancient facility where sand was drawn out with an ass and cart by local builders who used it to build sheds, etc. However, with the building explosion, it was an unrealised asset in the possession of a farmer and it was sold. A new, big commercial developer became involved but there was a grey area and the council refused to go after him because it was not sure about the position in law and whether it could pursue him. It did not want to waste money because its legal advice was that it was a muddy, grey area.</P>
    <P>The area around Professor Sacker's house is becoming a muddy, grey area also. There is constant noise, disruption of the landscape, a fair amount of shaking and very large vehicles moving in and out. There is also the noise of Caterpillar trucks which make an odd beeping sound when they reverse. There is huge disruption from an existing site because of intensification of use. This is one example.</P>
    <P>Another example is pig farming. Anybody who has driven around the country will notice the strong odours associated with intensive pig farm<Col N="1336" /> ing. This relates to the increased use of land because in the past, a farmer might have kept one or two pigs, a sow and a couple of bonhams, which would be used for home curing. Although people might say they are only developing an existing operation, the impact on the landscape and on neighbours of intensive methods of farming may be extremely troubling. There is a town in the west which has problems in this regard but I cannot remember its name. I heard people from there&mdash;</P>

I think it is a meat rendering factory which started off innocuously. However, the problem has become increasingly bad to the point that businesses are being affected. This is my case for the amendments.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for showing flexibility but I regret that I revealed my hand and displayed my ignorance. However, that is my innate honesty. On the previous amendment I said that originally neither I nor the person who suggested the amendment understood it. However, we teased it out and I wanted to find out if the Minister understood it. It has only dawned on me that perhaps he did not understand it at all and he just decided to accept it as a way around it. That is a light-hearted point but Senator O'Meara and I consider that amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are most important and we hope they will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I concur with his views. The Senator mentioned a colleague of his who decided to go back to nature. Something similar happened in my area involving an old quarry from where a small amount of stone used to be removed by light machinery. However, there are now many machines and the noise has increased to extraordinary levels. In addition, there is a huge amount of dust. Where there is an extension of use to such a degree, an application should be made to the local authority. This case was taken to court by Galway County Council. They lost the case because the present law allowed them to go back and then develop this. The intensity of the increase has been extraordinary. Not only did it happen in that case but less than a quarter of a mile away they did exactly the same thing, impinging directly on a residents' area, where blasting is now carried out. Blasting was not being carried out 30 years ago to the degree it is now. I <Col N="1337" /> support this amendment, about which I feel very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the reasoning behind perhaps the second of these amendments rather more than the first. The two amendments would specify that the definition of development includes, firstly, any change of use or land for a purpose other than agriculture unless it is consistent with the zoning of the area. The second specifies any intensification of use leading to a greater impact due to increased noise, smells or whatever. The Senators are absolutely right that these are so fundamental that they would amount to a complete and total change of the planning code that we have had since 1963, particularly the first one, because since 1963 the planning code has only been concerned with material changes of use, that is, material in planning terms. Changing from material changes to any changes is a huge step.</P>
      <P>To give a practical example, it is not material to one's neighbours or the authorities if one begins teleworking two days a week from home, for domestic reasons or perhaps to be with one's children more often. It is regarded as material if a doctor sets up a clinic in his house, or adjacent to his house, because that involves increased pedestrian and motor traffic, parking etc. That is obviously material. If I were to accept the change suggested in this amendment, I would have to make a long list of exemptions from the regulations so that people could go about their ordinary business without having unnecessary planning controls imposed on them.</P>
      <P>The alternative would be that the development plans would have to be drawn up in such detail as to cover all of the possibilities which could be considered with the proper planning and development of the area. I foresee a situation where local authorities would see this as being so onerous that they would just put everything as being permitted under every particular zoning in this matrix used by them to determine which development is permitted and which is not under various headings. This would defeat the whole purpose of planning and development control.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 involves a very fundamental change. I understand what the Senators are trying to do but I do not think it is possible. One cannot remove material changes or the consideration of changes in development and planning if the term &ldquo;material changes&rdquo; is taken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 concerns intensification of use, which because of a whole range of court decisions and judgments is now accepted as a material change for the purposes of the Planning and Development Act in certain circumstances. Probably the reason this amendment has been put forward is that the case law and the judgments are very wide and varied in many circumstances and quite complicated. There are relevant court cases and court decisions in both <Col N="1338" /> Ireland and England. Intensification means more use, that is the development is more productive or more clients can be seen or whatever. There is more activity generally. While I accept the examples that have been given, which are particularly good examples relating to quarrying and so on, it is not often that this greater use is so detrimental to proper planning and development of an area that additional planning permission should be required. It is not often but I have to admit that it does actually happen and has happened, particularly in quarrying. Senators should remember that in those kinds of circumstances the planning authority already has power to step in to enforce legislation or to force a person to apply for planning permission because a more intensive use is contemplated. If we need a vote on amendment No. 16, we will have to have one because I am not going to change that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 concerns intensification and in spite of the fact that court judgments on this exist, this could be examined for Report Stage. The Senator might be inclined to withdraw it on that basis. I have concerns about quarrying because there is quite a lot of it in my own constituency and I heard the examples that he and Senator Coogan have outlined. I feel that there probably is a need to remove, if possible, this exemption based on pre-1963 working of quarries. I have heard examples of how difficult it is to prove that a quarry has not been worked continuously since 1963. I am aware of that difficulty and I would certainly be inclined to examine bringing in some amendment to tackle this, particularly in that area, if I cannot do it generally. Case law on intensification exists that might be of assistance, but if it could be clarified it would be useful to do so in this Bill. On that basis I am not accepting amendment No. 16 but I would certainly be prepared to consider amendment No. 17 again and listen to suggestions which Members might have on intensification for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister is clearly accepting that there is an issue around intensification, particularly concerning quarries. He says it does not happen that often but he has instanced a number of examples in his own constituency and other Members have referred to cases in their areas. It clearly is a problem arising countrywide and one which needs a legislative response. It would be unreasonable of us not to take note of what the Minister has said, which is that he will examine this, even though the case law is, as he says, wide and complex, and the judicial response is clearly quite wide. It is our duty in that context to come up with a legislative framework and it would be unreasonable not to take note of the Minister's proposal and wait for what he comes back with on Report Stage. His proposal is made in good faith.</P>

      <P>The very fact that so many court decisions have varied on this matter indicates that it is necessary in some way to tie it down and make it more clear cut. I gave examples and I did not intend to be parochial about them. Let me give one further example. Beside this main quarry another person decided he was going to start quarrying. He claimed that it had been in use and nobody could deny it because there was no way of proving that it had not been. That is the difficulty. He took the machinery out and put it on farmland beside someone else's house. This went to court the other day and the case was lost.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that part of the machinery that goes in could be declared as agricultural machinery for levelling purposes or large dozers etc. I know that the value of the individual's house beside him went down. They lost the case and the corporation which had taken the case lost it as well. This is the difficulty with this section. We have to make it clearcut. I accept the Minister will review the position prior to Report Stage and I do not wish to push it but it is an area we have to look at very stringently.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being reasonable. We will not waste the time of the House at this point on a vote as it is a long process and we want to get on. The Minister has given fairly clear undertakings about amendment No. 17 and it is remarkable that a majority of people in the House have had some experience of this. I have spoken to some Members who have not contributed. There is a wide experience here of which I was not aware. I thought I was being clever and lucky that I had come across this example but the Minister knows of it, Senator Coogan knows of it and other people have had experience of this. Although the Minister says there is case law, he is open and honest in acknowledging that its application is patchy. I know from the case to which I referred that the local authority were unwilling to go to the law because they were aware of the patchy record and they did not want to waste public funds.</P>
      <P>An amendment in this area would be necessary though there is no point in wasting time having a vote. We accept the Minister's undertaking that he will look at it to see if it is possible to produce an amendment and if not we will re-submit. The commitment is there.</P>

Senator Fintan Coogan's name should be added to this amendment and the word &lsquo;such' in this <Col N="1340" /> amendment should also appear before the word &lsquo;development'.

      <P>In page 23, subsection (1), line 24, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;so long as such development does not impinge on a protected structure, any structure or area protected under the National Monuments Acts, a European site, or a National Heritage Area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a section that deals with exemptions from the process and it is logical that, if we are committed to the protection of archaeological and architectural sites, areas of amenity and so on, these should continue to be protected, except in the most exceptional circumstances. For this reason amendment No. 18 seeks to insert a clause, &ldquo;so long as development does not impinge on a protected structure, any structure or area protected under the National Monuments Acts, a European site, or a National Heritage Area.&rdquo;  That does seem to be logical. It could hardly be one of the purposes of the Planning and Development Bill to assist in the destruction or negative alteration of any of these mentioned areas, sites or buildings. Can I speak about the related amendments at the same time?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 19 seeks to delete paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) because they exempt local authorities from the provisions of the Act. That has been shown over a long historical period to be a bad move. It is not good practice to allow local authorities to derogate from their own plans. What is the point in their having plans if they exempt themselves automatically from such developments?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 seeks after &ldquo;road&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided any new road is one that is contained as an objective in the relative development plan.&rdquo;  I must look through my notes while I listen to what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment I tabled, one of those now disappeared, differed only in the use of the term &ldquo;such development&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;development&rdquo;. It is not a large issue but it ties it down somewhat more. Regarding the amendment itself, Senator Norris has clearly outlined that the intention is to protect the structures. If it is, they are already listed in the Monuments Act, the European sites and the natural heritage areas and as such should be included. It is not a difficulty. These are the people who are making the judgments about the structures, that they are worth protecting, and it should be mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding amendment Nos. 19, 20 and 21and the Senator's objection to the local council having to be exempt, the present situation is that local <Col N="1341" /> authorities must apply in the same way as anybody else and are open to objections. They are quite well covered in that. If the local authorities are excluded and asked to go through the entire process, it will have the effect of slowing down all procedures in local authorities where it might be necessary to move at a faster pace. In general, while there are some exceptions to the rule and I know some areas where local authorities have caused some destruction, today it is not so. They are aware of structures that have to be protected and they often make great advances in maintaining those structures, in maintaining the curtilage around them, in building roads into them. Amendment Nos. 19, 20 and 21 should stay. I have no difficulty with amendment No. 20, as regards inserting &ldquo;provided any new road is one that is contained as an objective in the relevant development plan.&rdquo;  I would see no great objection to that but local authorities cannot be constrained to such a degree as proposed in amendment No. 19. I would push amendment No. 18.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is considerable merit in amendment No. 18, the effect of including it in the Bill would be to exclude always the possibility of any development which would not just destroy a protected structure but would impinge upon it. We are into an area the Minister mentioned this morning, that of subjectivity, and what one person's protected structure may not be another's, although I accept the Senator's statement that there are independent lists of these matters.</P>
      <P>The fact that it would impinge upon it is not sufficient grounds for this amendment. You could not include in law an exclusion that, in all cases, it would be impossible to proceed because there are cases where there has to be a 'trade-off'. That is not a word I particularly wish to use but it gets at what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A county council would not be able to derogate, as has been suggested, from its county development plan. It does not arise. As to the exemption of the council from seeking planning permission, it strikes me as sensible because if the council were to apply to itself for permission, logic dictates that it would grant permission to itself. The way around that is the existing method of public consultation. Provided there is an adequate public consultation process, which takes into account the concerns of people, that is adequate. That has applied under the existing legislation in the case of an arts centre being built in Newbridge, where the Part X process was used. The observations that were made during that process were taken into account in modifications to the design of the building which is now being erected. As long as there is adequate public consultation, the need for a local authority to apply to itself does not arise. Though I can imagine circumstances where there would be tensions between the planning department and the county council and the engineering department and the management of the <Col N="1342" /> county council. It is implausible that the council would not grant itself permission for something it was seeking to build.</P>

      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Dardis on amendment No. 19. If a council, an urban district council or a corporation decide that this is what they want they will grant themselves permission. What happens with appeals to the Planning Appeals Board? If they do not require permission then it is not possible to make an appeal to the appeals board. If they are required to have permission then they would grant it, but at least it announces the intention to grant permission which gives an opportunity to appeal. Perhaps the Minister could put my mind at rest on the appeal structure.</P>

      <P>The theory of the council adjudicating is perhaps appealing in regard to amendments Nos. 19 to 21. To the best of my knowledge, in practice the operation of Part X has been satisfactory. That is certainly the case in my local authority and others with which I am familiar. We should recognise that it is a reserve function of the councillors. The councillors in the area are sensitive to what needs to be done and are susceptible to pressures from those opposed to developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have a concern if we went the other route. It is significant that the councillors' input is to some extent diluted if one goes through the planning process, which is an executive function rather than a reserve function. At a time when houses must be constructed as speedily as possible to meet the increasing demand, most objections to local authority housing can be motivated by people opposed to social integration and so on. It would open it up. I am fairly convinced it would not be better than the current system. The <Col N="1343" /> Part X operation in practice is working reasonably well and amending it along the lines suggested would not improve the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments are intended to remove the exempted status of a number of developments. Amendment No. 18 qualifies exemptions to state they would not apply where a development would affect a protected structure, a national monument, a European site or an NHA. Members will note there is no specific mention of NHAs in the legislation as it stands. Because NHAs have not yet the force of law, we cannot provide for them as much as we would like in this Bill. There is a provision at a later stage of the Bill for including NHAs to the list of areas that need protection. The amendment is designed to protect the environment, particularly sensitive areas and so on. As it stands, it is unnecessary and unworkable. The planning system is not the only one used to protect the environment, natural or built. One example is the Habitats Directive where regulations control exempted developments such as agricultural land use in European sites in a manner which the planning control system cannot do.</P>
      <P>National monuments legislation has comprehensive protection, development measures and structures and is deemed to be exempted under section 55 of the Bill. What Senators are trying to achieve in amendment No. 18 exists already and inserting it in the Bill would only add confusion. There is specific legislation to cover the protection of habitats, national monuments and so on.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 would abolish the exemption for local authority development, effectively requiring them to obtain planning permissions from themselves, which does not make sense. In regard to Senators' concerns on the development plan being varied or broken by the local authorities, section 162 of the Bill makes it clear that a local authority cannot contravene its own development plan. That would meet some of the difficulties intended to be met by the amendments. Except for very small-scale works where local authorities carry out development, they must either undergo the public notification procedure set out in section 163 of the Bill which is subject to the democratic control of the elected members or undertake an environmental impact assessment which is subject to the approval of An Bord Pleanála under section 159. Those protections are built in and replace the existing provisions which come under planning regulations only but will become primary legislation here.   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments provide that the exemption for development carried out in partnership with the local authority would only apply where planning permission was already sought. However, such development must undergo the procedures set out in either section 159 or section 163. This would mean they would have to go through two <Col N="1344" /> sets of procedures under the Bill and makes a nonsense of it. Amendment No. 21 would make it more difficult for a local authority in conjunction with, say, PPP to get permission to undertake a development.</P>
    <P>To return to the Part X procedure, politicians often complain about the public perception, their lack of power and so on. They very often talk in terms of power being taken from them whereby they have no say in anything. The argument here is a classic case of politicians arguing to take a democratic responsibility away from themselves, admittedly from members of a local authority who are elected locally. The more this happens the lower politicians will be held in public esteem. I have more complaints from members of the public &ndash; they can be very fickle in their approach &ndash; that councillors have no say; managers and others have all the say. Up to the time Part X was introduced councillors, when approached about various developments, could shrug their shoulders and say, &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot do anything about it as it is a manager/executive function. We have no say in it at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an in-built appeal system in the Part X procedure whereby appeals can be made to councillors as the decision is being made as part of the consultation. They can then make an input and influence the decision of the manager. The decisions might not be perfect because none of us is perfect, democracy is not perfect, but it is the best system available. We should bear this in mind when talking about taking away powers. The Part X procedure is democratic because public consultation is built in and it allows for the democratic input of the local councillors.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to managers, various officials and a number of councillors throughout the country and they have indicated that Part X is causing serious problems in relation to housing. People now know that under that section local authorities must consult and members must give their approval before developments can take place. People who are comfortable in their three and four bedroomed houses with nice gardens and so on are using this section to object to houses being built for those whom local authorities have an obligation to house. These people are putting intense pressure on local public representatives. This is the down side of going too far in a particular direction.</P>
    <P>We have achieved a balance. People have a right to express their views because in the past decisions were probably made which should not have been made where neither the councillors nor the public was listened to. It is a question of balance. In relation to the various amendments, I assure Members that these areas are protected under legislation. Sections 159 and 163 meet the requirements and principles laid down in amendments 19 and 20. In relation to amendment No. 21, no development should have to go through a double procedure and that is effectively what is <Col N="1345" /> being proposed. On that basis, I ask Senators to withdraw the amendments.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister can reassure me. The concern of those briefing me was that in the case of a joint development an exemption covering a local authority might be used by the local authority to say that their partners would not have to make an application. There is the possibility of something sinister happening. I have been promoting recently the Mitsui Corporation being brought in to help develop the Luas, particularly to put it under ground. While I am in favour of this but I believe the planning process should be followed. Perhaps local authorities might be exempted but it could be extended to cover commercial bodies to protect them from having to obtain planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's concern. If a local authority decides it wants a particular development, something with a commercial flavour perhaps, they could go through the procedure under sections 159 or 163. In some cases a local authority might decide it had not the commercial know how to proceed any further and it could decide to advertise for a partner which would carry out the development work. That is conceivable. The Senator is concerned that this might be used in an underhand way, as it were. In an era of public-private partnerships, we must put in place legislation that will allow local authorities to undertake these partnerships. To an extent, this is a matter of trust. I do not foresee local authorities abusing this in the sense of deciding willy-nilly to build shopping centres etc., and making applications under sections 159 and 163 in case partner companies would not get permission.</P>

This section is designed to help that development.</P>

      <P>Regarding amendment 19, I accept the Minister's indication that these areas are covered in other legislation. Senator Norris mentioned the possibility of a joint partnership in relation to the Luas. I was thinking about the establishment of thermal treatment factories. This will cause great controversy throughout the country and local authority members will face an outcry against these plants. The &ldquo;not on my doorstep&rdquo; factor will be one aspect but there will also be genuine fears about emissions etc. It was in that context that I am concerned that if we do not have full consultation or an intensive procedure this might occur. I will be pleased if the Minister tells me I am wrong in this belief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I was thinking when the Minister mentioned public-private partnerships. I attended a meeting in my constituency on Monday night when public-private partnerships were being discussed in relation to waste management and huge issues arising in this context. As a member of both an urban council and county council, I take on board what the Minister has said that he is not in the business of tying the hands of local authorities or to place more onerous requirements on them for developments which are not applied to private developers. On the other hand, it is extremely important that the set of obligations on local authorities is as open, transparent and accountable as possible.</P>
      <P>One hears regularly, especially regarding sensitive developments such as an extension to an existing landfill site or the development of a car park, that there is no need for the local authority to apply for planning permission. If it was anyone else, they would have to go through the hoops. I accept that we are not in the business of tying the hands of the local authority. However, as the body charged with implementing planning decisions and especially as the body charged with acting against illegal developments, it is important that the planning authority is seen to be acting within the same set of rules that applies to everyone else. If the local authority acts against someone whom it says is engaged in an illegal development and at the same time develops a car park but is not subject to the same rules, what confidence can the public have? While not wishing to tie anyone's hands, the standards that apply must be very high and open and transparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> I am aware of a situation in my constituency where the Part X procedure broke down. What appeared to be at first a positive development for the area has turned into a nasty row and the reputation of the local authority is now in shreds. The Part X procedure has clearly not worked and a dreadful problem has arisen from it. We can talk about consultation but it does not always work. One of the reasons for that is that it is seen not to be as powerful or to have the same standing as the planning rules which apply to everyone else. We must be very careful to achieve the right balance in this area. The Minister has put his finger on what will be a huge issue in future &ndash; public-private partnerships where local authorities are partners. We must explore that carefully in the context of the legislation because time is upon us and it behoves us to do it properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been well made and I agree with Senator Coogan. I would hate to think a thermal treatment plant would be developed under the Part X procedure, even though I have every confidence in my colleagues on Wexford County Council to make the right decision. We may have to do that soon. It is important that anything of a quasi-commercial nature should be subject to the same rigours of the planning process as if it were undertaken by a private concern. It is a point of principle that it should have to go through that type of procedure. Perhaps there is something the Minister can do to take that issue on board.</P>
      <P>Public-private partnerships will become the norm in future. Perhaps there is a need to define them and perhaps on Report Stage the quantum of local authority involvement could be defined. Where the local authority has a 95 per cent stake, it is primarily a local authority venture, but where it only has a 5 per cent stake, that is a different issue. It must be seriously examined because it should be open to the public in issues of significant concern and impact that they would have recourse to the planning appeals process which is a valuable part of the planning procedures available to them. I would support anything the Minister can do to accommodate what has been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeal process is the nub of the issue. As the debate progresses, interesting details emerge. We have been told about the consultation process. However, according to CIE, there was massive consultation about Luas but this turned out to be defective. Consultation is a buzz word that is thrown around to obscure what is often a lack of democracy in local authorities and that is precisely why I am dissatisfied with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Walsh for his honesty and the clarity of mind with which he addressed this issue. When Senator Coogan raised another interesting example of thermal treatment plants, Senator Walsh immediately replied that the same rigour <Col N="1348" /> must be expected of local authorities. That tells me that the same rigour is not required under the legislation. I thank Senator Walsh for highlighting that useful point. We are not applying the same rigorous standards to local authorities as we are to private developments.</P>
    <P>I wish to record my experience in North Great George's Street. It may have been what is called the &ldquo;bad old days&rdquo; but it is similar to an example of the Minister's, although varying in one aspect. The local authority compulsorily acquired, allowed to go derelict and demolished a set of houses at the bottom of North Great George's Street in the days when no one gave a damn about such houses. In fact, it was almost regarded as a national objective to demolish them because they had some vague association with an occupying colonial power. The authority intended installing local authority housing and a number of us did not like that plan. However, it was not because it was local authority housing. I made it abundantly clear at the time that I would welcome local authority housing but that it had to be in architectural sympathy with the remaining fabric of the street. That did not protect me from being attacked by some rabble rousing members of Dublin Corporation who said I was part of the gin and tonic, liberal middle class &ndash; the usual rubbish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly Irish. The local authority intended installing a grossly unsympathetic development which was out of scale and lacked any reference. If it were to be tested against everything that was said this morning, it would be found to be lacking. However, the authority was exempted from applying for planning permission. There was no question of appeal. Local people and consultation bodies knew what was wrong but they had no recourse except to councillors, many of whom, for their own political reasons, were unsympathetic.</P>
      <P>It seems a dictatorial power that local authorities can demolish buildings, erect whatever they like, blackguard anyone who objects to it and they are not required to apply for planning permission. I accept there is a slight Alice in Wonderland situation in the authority applying to itself for planning permission. However, as Senator Dardis pointed out, the planning section sometimes has a principled objection to what either management or the elected representatives want to do and it has that objection because it comprises professionally qualified planners. We are excluding them from this and that is wrong.</P>

      <P>However, I have one advantage in that I have been a local authority member for some time and have experienced the operation of the Part X procedure. It has certainly worked well in our local authority area and in others. When the Senator refers to it as being dictatorial, I do not see how that is compatible with the democratic exercise which takes place in the council chamber where members independently come to a conclusion and then vote on a decision. To me, that is the essence of democracy and far from dictatorial. The procedure has worked well.</P>
      <P>The point I tried to make was that, in issues which can and do impact environmentally on local people, it is important that the appeals process is available to them. That is the message I was trying to convey. I remind Senator Norris that there is a significant divergence of impact from various planning applications and I would only argue this particular point in relation to those which could have a serious impact. At council level, members approach these matters in a conscientious manner and are accessible to the public at all times. Members of the public are not shy about making their views known on issues about which they feel strongly. There is a vibrancy in the system which Senator Norris's comments undervalue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Walsh's point. There is a very important issue here which relates to checks and balances within the system. The fact that a person may not like a particular course of action does not constitute a sufficient reason for not proceeding with that course of action. We must ensure, through the legislation, that the system is fair and open, that the proper procedures are followed and that, even if a person does not like what is taking place, the correct decision will be made at the end of day. There is a tendency for people to veto issues left, right and centre merely because, in their personal views, something is undesirable. The merit of the local authority system is that the elected representatives represent the views of the communities from which they come. The good of the community should prevail rather than the narrow views of a particular group or individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this important matter. The subject of <Col N="1350" /> thermal treatment plants was raised. Those plants are subject to EU directives which require that an environmental impact assessment be produced whether the plants are built by a private company or by a local authority. Private companies will obviously be subject to planning procedures and local authorities which build thermal treatment plants will be subject to section 159 of the Bill which requires that an EIA be produced. The environmental impact assessment can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage of the Bill, we will include a provision in section 159 parallel to that which is included in section 163(1)(c) which states: &ldquo;This section shall also apply to proposed development which is carried out within the functional area of a local authority which is a planning authority, on behalf of, or in partnership with the local authority, pursuant to a contract with the local authority.&rdquo;. I realise this will be a very sensitive topic in the future and although the provision is not absolutely necessary, I will include it in deference to Senators' concerns that the position in the Bill should be very clear.</P>
      <P>We have strengthened the procedures in the Bill to ensure that the planning reports under Part X will be of the same standard as those required for a planning application. Those reports must be submitted to local councillors; it will not merely be a matter of somebody in the council drawing up a report stating that a particular housing development is absolutely necessary. It must be treated in the same way as a third party planning application made outside of the local authority. That strengthens Part X and brings it into line with current planning applications.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that in trying to protect people's rights to object, have their views listened to and engage in consultation, we could suddenly decide that the right to object overrides every other right. It could be seen to override people's right to have a house, the right of the travelling community to a halting site or that of a local community to a landfill facility. We must ensure a balance in these matters. These facilities must be provided. Nobody wants certain developments next door to them and I do not blame people for having legitimate objections. However, certain facilities must be provided for the greater good and benefit of the community. There are certain people who believe that because a decision does not go the way they want it to, the entire procedure is flawed. I do not concur with that, nor do I think would any Member of this House.</P>

Even though such routes may not be frequently used or seen by the public, they may have the effect of seriously scarring the countryside.

If the Minister does not accept this amendment, we will be licensing commercial companies to construct this type of development wherever they wish across the landscape without having to make a planning application.

      <P>I intend to revisit this on Report Stage. My proposal was to remove every word from the word &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; backwards in section 4(1)(i). This would ensure that any application for new roads or expanding existing roads would have to go through the planning procedure. This is critical. After deforestation there could be a roadway that would be ideal for a housing development. It is not too much to ask that applicants go through a process for these projects, such as construction, improving and developing new roads or ancillary works.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Senator Norris and the proposal made by Senator Coogan. It is right that planning permission should be sought for roads that are built within afforestations. As Senator Coogan said earlier, when Coillte Teoranta or whoever is responsible is up and gone we could be left with a road which is not suitable for anything and is an eyesore. There is every reason to believe that planning permission should be sought for the construction of roads within afforestations.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that Coillte, through its afforestations and the removal of timber from afforestations throughout the country, is doing unbelievable damage to the county roads network. More penalties should be imposed on the weights that are being carried by lorries, particularly timber because they are doing excessive damage to the county roads network. Perhaps constraints on the removal of timber from afforestations could be built into this amendment.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to distinguish between two different situations. One is where woods are being made and the other is where felling is taking place. There is no exemption on the planting. I support the idea that it will be subject to planning regulations. In the past there has been too much indiscriminate planting without reference to the environment or other aspects. In other words, the construction of roads at that stage is subject to planning. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong in that assumption. It would seem sensible that where felling is to take place there must be a provision to get timber out. I accept there can be undesirable visual and other side effects to that. I am sympathetic to this amendment but it is important that we do not confuse the two things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can help me with two aspects that were raised on Second Stage. First, some Senators seem to believe that felling could be done on an indiscriminate basis. I believe sections 141 and 188 mean that this is not the case and that felling is controlled. I also noticed that broadleaves are excluded under this section. The <Col N="1353" /> second aspect has to do with the lower limit below which permission would not be required. I assume that can be done by regulation. Perhaps the Minister would indicate what he thinks the lower limit should be and if he considers the present limits to be desirable or in need of amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to remember that this section removes the blanket exemption for afforestation under the 1963 Act. Afforestation is not covered under the planning and development Acts. No matter what size the afforestation is, it is exempted. In this section we are bringing it within the planning and development Acts. Again, we are back to the subject of balance. We are moving from a situation that people probably did not expect to change into one that is changing, and significant changes as well. Senator Dardis spoke about the difficulty relating to existing forests that have grown, and have been growing for some years, and the new forest that might be created. The exemption we refer to in this section relates to existing forests only. In order to practice good husbandry these forests must be thinned and replanted and as a consequence forest roads have to be constructed.</P>
      <P>I accept the point made by Senator Burke about county roads but it is separate from this exemption in the Bill. I have had some discussions with colleagues and Coillte in relation to county roads being affected. Some county roads are badly affected. If we do not allow roads to be exempted in existing forests, they would have to apply for planning permission to build roads. At this stage that would be <i>pro forma.</i> Having allowed the forest to be created I am sure we would be in all sorts of constitutional difficulties if we prevented people from felling and thinning trees as part of that work in existing forests. It is also important to remember that if roads could not be properly constructed within the forest area county roads would be used instead. This is what happened in various places for a variety of reasons but largely because some people wanted to maximise their profits. Timber would be brought in smaller lots onto the nearest county road and that road would then be used as a conduit for all the timber traffic in an area. This would cause even greater difficulties.</P>
      <P>This exemption is for existing forests. The amendment would remove that exemption for the construction of forest roads in existing forests. Forest roads are essential for the day-to-day operation of forests, management and logging and requiring planning permission for those roads would severely restrict the proper management of forests. In response to Senator Dardis, there will be regulations which will deal with thresholds but under these new regulations an applicant will have to get planning permission for roads and future developments but it is not practical here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> In response to the question on what levels we might introduce planning permission, I have an open mind. I have indicated to the various groups that I will speak to them again and that there will be consultations between them and officials before those regulations are introduced. My colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, is also anxious to ensure that we do not do anything that will make it uneconomic for people to provide for us, which is an important national aim. At this stage it would be premature to say exactly what the regulations are. It will be dealt with by regulations. It would not be a good day's work to accept the amendment. It would be bad for forestry, and I do not intend to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in assuming that where it says &ldquo;felling and replanting&rdquo; both activities would have to be undertaken in order to qualify for exemption? In other words, if a decision was made to fell without replanting planning permission would be required. The reason I raise this matter, and I did so on Second Stage, is that I remember the Barrow Valley-St. Mullins where there was much felling of trees a number of years ago. The place was totally changed. It is a most beautiful spot and there was much adverse comment. It was replanted subsequently and, in time, it will return to its former state. I would hate to think the felling of that area and areas around the country like it, which are quality environmental and amenity locations, would be exempt without an onus to replant. I seek clarification that both conditions would have to be satisfied and that if somebody was going to fell only it would be subject to a planning application.</P>

      <P>I find it a little contradictory that in the future one will have to apply for permission for roadways whereas in the past one did not have to do so. What difference will it make in time? Anybody planting or who has planted forestry has a plan. They know what they are going to thin and what they are going to reseed. They know exactly what they are going to do in the future so there is no reason that they should not put in their application for the new roads, developments or constructions at this stage. If they do not have such husbandry in place, they should not be running forestry or anything else for that matter so I find that difficult to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the maintenance of existing roads but I have a problem defining what we talk about as a road in forest. If one makes a track to get some thinnings out does that become a road? What do we define as a road? I have difficulty in providing that future operators will have to make an application whereas existing operators do not have to make such an application, although there is no reason they should not because they have plenty of time. They know exactly what their plans are for the future and what areas will be grown at a particular time. <Col N="1355" /> There is no difficulty in putting in an application at that stage.</P>

      <P>I have gone over the area of the new plantation and the old one. I would say to Senator Coogan that technology has changed dramatically in forestry. If one takes a plantation made 25 years ago, it might have been considered at the time desirable to put it in a very large block, as a single unit. That would have been in anticipation that felling would be done by hand and that the timber would be carried out by hand but, increasingly, what is happening, particularly in Scandinavia, is that machinery is dealing with the felling and the carrying, so the technology changes and that introduces new conditions. It is reasonable, in the circumstances, that it should be possible to construct in an existing forest.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply in regard to the regulations. He is taking a very sensible approach. From my perspective &ndash; I do not think he would disagree with this &ndash; a distinction needs to be drawn between farm and commercial forestry. The argument is when does one become the other and what is the benchmark. I will leave it up to the Minister's good judgment to decide what the benchmark should be. That distinction should be made. We are trying to encourage farm forestry at European Union level and nationally, which is important. I do not know the size of the block should be, perhaps 150 acres, 200 acres or less, but I am prepared to accept the good judgment of the Minister and his advisers in coming up with the figure.</P>

      <P>This is not an unreasonable amendment if one considers that a person building a house must show clearly the access to a county road or, if they are lucky enough, to a national route. In the interests of planning the local authority should have some say in where timber is extracted from a forest. That is not an unreasonable. It could involve access on to a national primary or national secondary route and there may be a county road which could be used instead. Where timber is brought out onto a county road there may be a better or worse place for the access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is not unreasonable in seeking that a local authority should have some say in where those extracting the timber from forests build a road. We cannot do anything about roads which have been built but from the implementation of this Bill it would not be an unreasonable request. Will the Minister accept this amendment or table one on Report Stage? We have seen the work of some of those extracting timber from forests and it leaves much to be desired. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment because, as I said, there may be better locations and the local authority may impose a condition in respect of an <Col N="1356" /> area which would be more suitable than that from which the timber is being extracted.</P>

      <P>We do not have to have this incessant inferiority complex. The poor dear, we will club together and buy him a tie. That will surely make him feel better.</P>
      <P>We are not suggesting that operators should never be allowed to get in to extract the timber &ndash; we are only suggesting that it be done in a proper manner. We heard earlier about how responsible councillors and councils are and how they are the best people to make these decisions. Now we are prepared to hand it over in a certain situation where, for example, Coillte is privatised and commercial firms come in and we think they have better planning advice and are in a better position to make these decisions.</P>
      <P>What about a traffic hazard, for example? If it is easier for a commercial company to produce an exit on to a road which may be more hazardous from a traffic point of view but commercially more practical, which does the Minister think they will do if they are exempt from planning permission? Nobody will stop them extracting their timber but we require only that they construct these roads in a reasonable manner.</P>
      <P>What if, for example, there was a proposal to build one of these roads right beside a private house &ndash; within inches of it &ndash; which would certainly cause nuisance and noise, possibly late at night? One might be plonked right beside a school. I say this not just because of Coillte but because Coillte may be privatised fairly soon. We will have a situation where these people are exempt from planning. I do not think that is a good idea at all.</P>
      <P>We are living in the real world. We are not suggesting that they will never be allowed to extract or build roads. We are saying that there should be a responsibility to the public where these roads are constructed. We accept that in terms of thinning, felling and the maintenance of existing roads there can be an exemption. However, we are saying that when a new road is being constructed there is a requirement that it should be done in a responsible manner, especially where there is a possibility of the enterprise becoming totally commercial. Given human nature, one cannot guarantee that a decision which is more commercial than one tilted towards a level of social desirability will not be made. So we are insisting on this amendment.</P>

      <P>If the wording of this paragraph remains as drafted we are in danger of creating an anomaly whereby existing afforestation is exempt from the rule while new forestry developments are not. We have already referred to our concerns about intensification of particular developments. The Minister referred to his concerns about the ruling pertaining to quarries operating since before 1963 and there is a similarity here to some extent in the sense that owners of existing forestry, being exempt from these rules, have the opportunity of intensifying and constructing roads. Other Senators have referred to what might happen in that case. One can only take the example of a person who may now be living near a forest. A road may appear near that person's home which suits the forestry company but there is no possibility of that person doing anything about it as the construction of the road is exempt under the Act. We are in danger of creating quite a problem for the future. We have already discussed intensification and I ask the Minister to take our views on board. He might come back to the matter on Report Stage if he does not accept our amendment.</P>

There are various layers to the Minister's overall grand plan which are identified in the Bill, but that is for the future. Regarding new developments, the Bill does not set out to deregulate anything already in existence and rightly so &ndash; that would not be reasonable, fair or balanced.</P>
      <P>My understanding of this amendment is it proposes telling people that there are new rules which are going to be applied to those whose developments are 30 years old just as they will be applied to all future developments. That is not in the interests of fairness or balance and the Minister has given a fair and reasonable response to Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to state once again what we are doing. To reply to Senator Burke, for the first time we are bringing forestry under the control of the planning and development Acts. Let us keep that in perspective. That is number one. If the owner of a forest needs access to a county road or anything else, that access will be subject to planning permission. Permission must be granted for access to a county road or a national primary or regional route and that situation will remain the same. If one is putting an extra exit onto a county road or a public road of any kind, then the current procedure will still apply.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about internal forest roads. If that needs to be clarified a little further we will see if it can be done on Report Stage, but we are talking about internal forest roads. Also, those Senators who are familiar with the guidelines on forestry will be aware that there are comprehensive rules regarding forestry which take into account matters such as nearness to houses and so on. Good environmental practice must be subscribed to by those involved in this industry, be they in the private or public sectors. Acceptance and adherence to such practice is a condition of grant receipt in the private sector, as I understand it, so it is not a question of willy-nilly planting of trees wherever one wants. I concede that regulation of this area was less than satisfactory in the past. Senators should keep this matter in perspective. Someone listening to this debate would be forgiven for thinking that roads were going to be built willy-nilly all over forests. I do not think that will happen as there are costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said this already but I reiterate that for all new developments, planning will apply once the regulations are in place above the threshold we decide. However, to put the other side and offer the balance I mentioned earlier, we are talking here about people with existing forests which were planted 30 years ago or earlier. This provision means they must apply for planning permission for internal roads so that the forests can be thinned and felled. I am mindful of what I have said about the grant regulations and guidelines, but it is not unreasonable to say that this will put the person who owns the forest, the local authority and perhaps, at a later stage, An Bord <Col N="1359" /> Pleanála, through a procedure whereby a person will have to apply for planning permission for a road through an existing forest. One cannot do that. The reality is that while one may be able to change some of the details, one cannot refuse planning permission. The person who owns the forest has a constitutional right to earn a living and the forest is his or her living. We will ask people to go through this procedure. I am not saying it will clog up the system but they will go through a procedure which is, in essence, <i>pro forma</i>. The end result of this procedure is known before the application is submitted. Permission will have to be granted, perhaps with slight variations. I ask Members to remember that we are trying to maintain a balance.</P>
    <P>We will look at this again to see if there is any way we can clarify it or include a measure which will meet Members' concerns. However, I will be honest and open and say I cannot remove this exemption, whatever about clarifying it. It would be ridiculous to put people through the procedure of applying for planning permission for existing forests when we know they will get it. Perhaps someone in their wisdom, apart from myself and my planning officials, will, in the next few weeks come up with a different provision to this. However, the exemption is necessary, being mindful of the difficulties which could be created on the other side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be tedious as this discussion has certainly been helpful to me. The Minister has satisfied one of my principal difficulties by indicating &ndash; which I had not fully recalled &ndash; that planning permission will be required for access on to a county road. That is important and removes one of the examples I gave. I am glad of that clarification. However, the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; has crept into this debate somewhere; I am not quite sure how. One cannot build a road retrospectively, to be honest about it. Even in an old forest, it will be a new road. Let us not say one has to apply retrospectively for planning permission. One will have to apply for planning permission for a development. Whether it is an old forest or a new forest, it is a development. It is not a question of looking at it retrospectively and saying &ldquo;we will put roads here so we have to look backwards for planning permission&rdquo;. That is not the case. If the principle being instituted in this Bill is that planning permission must be applied for in a new forest, I do not see why it should not also apply to existing forests &ndash; it does not seem to me to be an enormous quantum leap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another area which could do with further illumination and one of my colleagues, I think it was Senator Coogan or Senator Burke, brought this to the surface &ndash; precisely what constitutes a road? Any of us who has walked in a forest knows there is a difference between paths, boreens and tracks which would be suitable for a machine but which the average person would not <Col N="1360" /> regard as a road. This may be a very silly question. Is there any thought given to the point at which this kind of work becomes the construction of a road? I would have thought that to gain access for the thinning of trees, particularly using sophisticated machinery, one could probably get away with what the public would not regard as a road. A road is a fairly substantial development, which is obvious in the minds of the people who helped supply me with the information to put down this amendment. When they briefed me they spoke of the serious scarring of the landscape. One cannot do that with a track or a boreen but one will do it if one builds a fairly substantial road.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clarified a number of matters, as have the gentlepersons on the Government bench. I am not 100 per cent happy because if we are going to make this requirement &ndash; I was almost going to say down the road &ndash; down the boreen, the track, or the winding path of a road&mdash;</P>

Commercial enterprises will buy into old forests where they can get away with ten times the amount of nuisance than if they developed a new forest.</P>

The Minister said it will incur costs for those who already have forests and it will incur costs for those who will develop the forests. What is the difference between the two? Senator Norris asked about the definition of a road. I am aware of the machinery which is used in forests, very high vehicles which can drive over all types of terrain. My concept of a road is one that is hard surfaced. My amendment requires the removal of certain sections because of the works that are ancillary to the development. I do not know what works are ancillary to the development of a road but I am sure somebody with a little imagination could build this and that if he so wished under this definition. The word scarring is an excellent description. I deal near forests and I know the effect this has on scenery &ndash; to be honest, I detest conifer trees &ndash; but then, to add insult to injury, there are roads which take the shortest distance between two points and nobody is concerned about the topography or how it will appear from <Col N="1361" /> the main road and they will do what they want on a commercial basis. It is hard to blame them for doing that. However, I have difficulty with the combination of the roads and the ancillary works.</P>

Those extracting timber could develop a quarry to construct a road. Are we saying this would not require planning permission? The Minister must accept this basic but genuine amendment. The construction of roads, especially from the main artery of a county road through afforestation, should be subject to planning permission.</P>

      <P>Could we have some proportion in relation to this? This is proposing nothing more than that the <i>status quo</i> should operate. Even in the wonderful county of Mayo, I have not seen any roads going willy-nilly through plantations. There is a clear fell above Newport in County Mayo with which I am very familiar.

The existing roadways that were built by Coillte are hugely beneficial for tourism because they give access to areas that otherwise would not be visited. The effect of the amendment would be that the forest would be dead and lying on the ground when permission for the road came through, after an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. Even some of the fellows of the holy and undivided college of Trinity would have passed on to their great reward at that stage.</P>

      <P>I will not take construction, maintenance and repairs of roads outside it. If I can clarify that, perhaps by inserting the word &ldquo;internally&rdquo; of &ldquo;serving internally&rdquo;, I will examine it for Report Stage. The difference between old and new forest that Senator Coogan asked me about is simply that people planted forests at a particular time when a particular set of circumstances prevailed. If we applied the new procedures now we would be changing the goalposts in mid-game. Therefore, we are not talking about retrospective roads, but about legislation having a retrospective effect and we are trying to avoid that in so far as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the point about seriously scarring the landscape, but we should be careful about hyperbole. Anybody who knows this business &ndash; and I would not claim to be as expert as Senators Dardis, O'Brien or Burke &ndash; is aware that the margins are tight enough. Nobody will construct highways or runways through forests at this stage; they will go for the minimum. A more serious scarring of the landscape would occur if we made it so difficult for people that they would just send these machines willy-nilly all over the place, even with no roads, thus causing even greater damage to the environment. That is the other side of the argument.</P>
      <P>This aspect has received a good and fair airing. If it requires clarification that this is internal &ndash; and I accept that may be the case &ndash; I will try to do so on Report Stage. Any new roads that are constructed opening onto county roads already require planning permission. If they do not get it I suggest that councillors and Senators from the relevant areas should raise the matter. That is as far as we can go on this question. I will try to clarify whether the matter is internal and I would ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 24, subsection (1)(l), line 24, after &ldquo;land&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including rivers, lakes and estuarine waters)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is because land is not always taken to include rivers, lakes and estuarine waters and I am quite sure the Minister wishes to protect these areas as well. It is again simply extending the definition slightly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the amendment is unnecessary because, as the Senator says, the definition of land always includes land under water. If a lake, for example, has been opened to the public it may not be enclosed in accordance with this particular provision and that is aside from any other public right of way that might exist already. It is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the Minister's clarification. I am quite sure that he must have received advice on this and he must be quite correct. However, I received contrary advice on the basis that it was a slightly vague area, that whereas some streams and tributaries and so on were covered, riverine waters, estuaries and lakes were not covered. The Minister has given an undertaking and I presume he will be vindicated in the future if there is a problem about this.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 25:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 24, subsection (2)(f2&gt;a), line 28, to delete &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Where he or she is of the opinion that, by reason of its <Col N="1365" /> size, nature or limited effect on its surroundings, it would not be contrary to proper planning and sustainable development, the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Attorney General's office that where the Minister is granted power to make regulations, it is necessary to outline in the section the principles and policies to be considered in making those regulations. This is as a consequence of a recent Supreme Court decision on the delegation of powers by the Oireachtas. These amendments, therefore, set out the basis, first, on which the Minister may exempt development and, second, on the types of local authority-owned development which the Minister may designate by regulation as subject to the notification procedures.</P>
      <P>When making regulations under these amendments the Minister will be obliged to consider the type of development, that is the size, nature and effect on its surroundings. The Minister will also be bound by the principle that any exempted development must not be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. However, because the things people do change every day, the wording cannot list the type of developments that may be exempted. It can only set out the general principles and policies to be considered in making those regulations.</P>
      <P>I smiled when I had to table this amendment myself because it was one of the areas that I championed when I was in opposition, that is, Ministers assuming power to make fairly substantial regulations under legislation. Deputy Dukes has championed the same matter since he took over my role as opposition spokesperson, so we are making some progress. Somebody in the Supreme Court is listening to us.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister view the development of local authority buildings or housing, which is exempted from planning, under the new regulations drafted two year ago? Does he feel that the consultation process which takes place on local authority development or dwellings at the moment is adequate? Is it adequate for the protection of the environment and for the protection of the surrounding neighbourhoods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I made comments on this, which I do not intend to repeat in any great detail, but the Part X consultations on which we introduced the regulations are, I believe, working reasonably well. The positive side is that it gives people a right to consult, to make views known and so on and that is always useful. The negative side has <Col N="1366" /> been, as I outlined earlier, that it is becoming more and more difficult for the local authority to reach decisions on the very necessary provision of housing, travellers' accommodation and various other developments.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with the principle of it but there are some practical difficulties that have arisen, mainly because of the pressures that are being put on local councillors. The Senator will be aware that it has always been my view that there is no power without responsibility and councillors have acquired some power in this area. They will have to exercise their responsibility for the greater good of the community but sometimes that is not easy.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 27:</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks more formidable than it is. Essentially these are technical amendments. As part of the consolidation process it was decided to ensure that, as far as possible, a standardised approach was adopted to describing time periods within the Bill itself. Therefore, time periods are described in weeks. In the nine Acts we are consolidating here, &ldquo;days&rdquo;, &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; and &ldquo;months&rdquo; are used in the various provisions. However, in proof reading the consolidated Bill, a number of references to months were missing and amendments Nos. 27, 217, 312, 325, 326, 344 and 345 are intended to make the necessary changes to &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; from either &ldquo;days&rdquo; or &ldquo;months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry's amendment No. 191 seeks to restore the period for taking an appeal to the board to one month, from four weeks. The use of &ldquo;months&rdquo; is unsatisfactory because of the variation in the time period involved and it has caused much discussion and confusion through the years and can be unfair on people who get what we call a short month, particularly February. For that reason, and for reasons of efficiency, the period has been set at four weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry's amendment No. 218 seeks to reduce the period within which one can appeal an order requiring the removal or the alteration of a structure or the discontinuance of use from two months to one month. It will then be the same period as for other appeals to the board. I accept the thrust of that amendment but again she is using &ldquo;months&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; and to conform with the standardised approach in the Bill it will have to be stated as four weeks but I am accepting that in principle. We will return to that on Report Stage when the Senator can resubmit her amendment or the Government will put down an amendment instead.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 110 to section 23 is to replace &ldquo;bear in mind&rdquo; with &ldquo;take account of&rdquo; and is a technical amendment aimed at harmonising the language throughout the Bill. Elsewhere in the Bill, for example, in section 12(4)(f2&gt;d), the words &ldquo;take account of&rdquo; are used and we are trying to use the same phrase throughout the Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendments to sections 18, 142, and 144 are typographical errors which were not detected in proof-reading and we are taking the opportunity to change them now. As I said, these amendments are mainly technical, designed to harmonise everything in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something seductive about the Minister's tidying-up operation but it is all an illusion. The Minister is saying this will make things easier, people will feel more at home, but they will not. It is going to make things infinitely worse for people, for example, who want to lodge an appeal, and I am opposing this amendment vigorously because people who are told they have one month to appeal know they have from 15 March to 15 April. If they have four weeks, people very often do not appreciate when the four weeks are up. It is much easier for members <Col N="1368" /> of the public to have, as they always have had in the past, a period of one calendar month.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims that it is sometimes shorter. It is never shorter than four weeks. Seven fours are 28 and I do not know of any month which has less than 28 days. Perhaps there is one, but I am not familiar with it. It has been represented very strongly to me by all the bodies involved in the preparation and submission of planning appeals and other elements to do with this Bill that &ldquo;one month&rdquo; should be kept.</P>
      <P>I am opposing all those amendments where there is a change from &ldquo;one month&rdquo; to &ldquo;four weeks&rdquo;. The reason I do it is to make the Bill consumer friendly. Consumers in droves have indicated to me that this is what they are comfortable with. They feel that if the period for lodging an appeal is reduced to four weeks they may miss out on an appeal because they will leave it until the last minute and assume they have a calendar month when, in fact, they have three or four days short of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris. Most planning officers and county managers make planning decisions on a Friday and in most cases they are posted on a Friday. That would mean that the majority of applicants would not receive their planning decision until Monday or Tuesday. In effect, while you can say they are losing four days from the month, in addition to that they may lose Saturday, Sunday, Monday and possibly Tuesday. They could only have 16 or 17 days in which to get all the advice they need to lodge an appeal to An Bord Pleanála or any other body. I have no problem supporting the <i>status quo</i> of the one month period. The Minister should accept that because there is nothing wrong with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just asked in an aside which month we were discussing, that of 28 days, 30 days or 31 days.</P>
      <P>When I first read the Bill and I understood what the Minister was trying to get at, the aspect that struck me most was in relation to the decision on planning and that it was shortened to eight weeks. At first this seemed like a reasonable idea, because we all want to see planning go through as quickly as possible, but when I looked at it again I knew that the Minister was trying to get the same structure through the entire Bill. However, like Senator Norris, it is not something that descended upon me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who came to me about it said they felt secure with the traditional method because they always knew where they stood. As was pointed out by Senator Burke, there is the possibility of the loss of a number of days if we adopt &ldquo;four weeks&rdquo;, whereas the monthly period is one that has traditionally been accepted and people know exactly what is involved. They know if they get the decision on 17 April they will have until 17 May to appeal but with the four weeks time period, some will confuse it with one month and they will <Col N="1369" /> be too late anyhow. I do not agree with this amendment or the related amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say much about this as obviously our views differ. Let me illustrate the confusion that has been caused. If someone gets planning permission on 15 November, they only <Col N="1370" /> have until 14 December to appeal it, not 15 December as cited by the Senator. Four weeks is much cleaner. People will know they have exactly four weeks. All Members who have spoken have illustrated there is confusion and this will clarify it.</P>

      <P>If a planning authority refers a planning application to An Bord Pleanála to see whether the development should be exempted and if at a later stage a planning application, which comes within this jurisdiction, is referred to An Bord Pleanála, how can it deal with that planning application? Would there be a conflict of interest from the board's point of view given that it had already made a judgment on the application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The original decision of the board would be on whether it was exempted. In the second case, it would be making a decision in relation to a specific planning application giving the full details. There would be no conflict of interest in this case. I recall a case where a person applied for planning permission after they had already submitted the application. This was refused and they then discovered that it could possibly come within exempted development. It went to the courts; they were refused exempted development status and the courts decided that the local authority acted properly. Once one gives up exempted development status and applies for planning permission, the full rigours of the planning and development Acts apply. This shows how complicated the planning and development Acts are. These are two quite distinct procedures and two quite distinct decisions of the board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (2)(f2&gt;a), line 17, after &ldquo;application)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall be recorded under the appropriate place name referable to a six inch Ordnance Survey&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of harmonising legislation and establishing a uniformity but he has just had his wicked way after the recent vote on the subject of four weeks as opposed to a month. I hope his principled stand regarding uniformity will bring him to accept this amendment. It is because of this desire for uniformity that I tabled it.</P>
      <P>The practice of different authorities varies widely and sometimes it is difficult for a citizen to gain access to the required information. Some councils require a person to know the name of the developer to obtain the file. We have tabled the amendment for the purposes of openness, transparency, accessibility and making the legislation workable for citizens. It is an unanswerable argument. I have been told, although I do not have experience of it, that in certain circumstances, one must know the name of a developer and that can be terribly difficult to find out. In the amendment, if one wants to clarify matters regarding a development, all one needs is the Ordnance Survey reference, and that is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised by the amendment because I am not aware of any difficulty with local authorities making information available, even when the least information is given to them by members of the public. If there are examples of local authorities insisting on details before they seek planning files, I would like to hear about them because it is something I would not condone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of locating files.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people's experience in requesting a planning file, usually by giving the name of the person who has applied, or the townland or even broad details, is that local authorities can locate the files and assist them. If there are local authorities which are not that obliging, I would like to hear about them. It would concern me if local authorities were not operating to maximum openness. A person is entitled to gain access to the files when a planning application is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are difficulties with the amendment other than that. It requires that the appropriate name place be included referable to a six inch <Col N="1372" /> Ordnance Survey map. While I accept the principle of the amendment and that the Senator is trying to achieve absolute clarity regarding applications, the amendment would not add anything to the clarity. Six inch maps would only be useful in rural areas, not urban areas. The sad experience of most of us, most likely including Senator Norris, is that most or a good number of these maps unfortunately have not been updated since the 1930s. The only useful name that could be included would be a townland name which would form part of a rural address in any case. Six inch map names would be meaningless in urban areas where most development takes place. The amendment will not add to the transparency and openness of the system.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator welcomes, as do I, the fact that the new developments in technology mean that a number of local authorities have linked the planning register to GIS systems which can at least provide accurate co-ordinates for the location of properties. Section 224 allows local authorities to take advantage of developments in information technology and make the system more open and transparent. However, because the maps are out of date, among other reasons, I am not of a mind to accept the amendment, although I accept the principle of trying to ensure everything is as open as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. The Minister has given an interesting reply, especially regarding information technology. It is important for people to have clarity. The Minister might be prepared to meet An Taisce who made what seemed a strong case to me and explain matters to them because there are some matters which need to be resolved. Obviously the Minister is correct when he says the Ordnance Survey maps referred to here are outdated. Howecer, that does not ameliorate the fact in the way we thought it might.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter comment of the Minister deals with what I was going to say, that those sections might be the point at which to deal with this. Also, given the changes being made in this legislation, the planning register would need to be kept up to date. While that happens in general terms, I have had experience of the planning register being circulated to us two months after applications were made and decisions would already have been made in that time. It would be important that we consider that at some stage because it is important from a practical point of view.</P>

      <P>Section 7 deals with the planning register. Much of what is outlined is already taking place. Additional information is being made available and additional requirements are being statutorily imposed. The Minister would want to examine all local authorities in the context of the point made by Senator Walsh regarding the staffing of offices. It is necessary to make more staff available to planning sections of local authorities to ensure all sections of the Bill are complied with. Planning offices are under great stress and face many difficulties. Staff are overworked and are under stress. That matter must be considered when the section is implemented.</P>

      <P>Go raibh míle maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. Gabh mo leithscéal, a Aire, ach ba mhaith liom mo chás a dhéanamh ar an ócáid seo as Béarla. I want to say my few words in the English language. One reason is that, yesterday, I had the nose bitten off me when I said to a friend, who I thought was a distinguished literary figure, &ldquo;Conas atá tú, Mícheál?&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;Don't you patronise me&rdquo;. I fear that my Irish may not be sufficiently good to meet the standards of the Gaeilgeoirí who creep around the place although I am happy to say they are currently being replaced by people with a wider vision. Even though one might not personally have the fullest command of Irish, it is important that we respect the rights of those who choose to speak our native language and who live in Gaeltacht areas. For this reason I want the words &ldquo;linguistic impact statement&rdquo; to be inserted after &ldquo;environmental impact statement&rdquo;. Sometimes developments can impact on an entire area, for example, a development of holiday cottages catering principally for English speakers in a Gaeltacht area. It is important that these would be included in the planning register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will speak principally to amendment No. 31. The amendment is intended to protect the linguistic integrity of areas within the Gaeltacht and to facilitate Irish speakers. While the Mini<Col N="1374" /> ster is responding, I will attempt to locate the related amendments.</P>

      <P>The thrust of these amendments, including amendments Nos. 46 and 47, is to ensure the conservation and promotion of the Irish language in an area where Irish is the prime community language and to seek the protection of the language and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht. I live in a Gaeltacht area and have witnessed the extraordinary changes which have occurred because there is not any great commitment to achieving the above objectives. I live in Galway city, a section of which comprises part of the Gaeltacht. When I first moved to the area some 20 years ago, Irish was the native language and one spoke Irish to one's neighbours. Now, their children will not speak Irish, not because they are unable to but because they cannot be bothered.</P>
      <P>There is a need to make a commitment in this area and, although the Bill may not represent the exact forum through which to make such a commitment, we should underline our commitment to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language by including these amendments. The amendments are important in that they would provide a recognition by this House and by a Department, which would not normally be involved in this area, of the importance of the Irish language.

      <P>N'fheadair an bhfuil cead agam labhairt as Gaeilge anois agus an méid atá ráite ag mo comhleacaí a labhair romham. Tá sé tábhachtach agus tá sé ainmnithe agus leagtha amach sa Sceideal go bhfuil ar údarás pleanála tagairt a dhéanamh do pé damáiste a dhéanfaí don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge ins na pleananna forbartha nó rudaí mar siúd. Tá tagairt don bhunfhealsúnacht sa Sceidéal ach tá sé an-lag. Baineann an cuid is mó de na leasaithe lena chéile agus ní fiú iad go léir a lua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to consider the wording of Government amendment No. 47 which proposes to insert the following new paragraph in section 10: &ldquo;(f2&gt;j) the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, where there is a Gaeltacht area in the area of the development plan.&rdquo;. Nobody would dispute or object to that phrase except in so far as ní théann sé leath chomh fada agus is gá. Tá deachrachtaí nua ag an Ghaeltacht anois, deachrachtaí nach mbíodh ann. <Col N="1375" /> S'iad an bochtanas agus an laghdú daonra na deacrachtaí ba mhó a bhí ag an Ghaeltacht. Anois, is a mhalairt ar fad iad na deacrachtaí atá acu.  </P>
    <P>The problems the Gaeltacht is experiencing today are those of prosperity and all that comes with that. While nobody could object to the Government amendment, it is far too defensive. We must build more into the legislation than an obligation or requirement to seek the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage. We need to create a positive disposition in favour of the advancement of the Irish language. It is not merely a question of preserving an endangered species or an area of scientific interest, rather it is a question of using planning for what all of the &ldquo;gluaiseachtaí na Gaeilge&rdquo; have referred to as an integrated public policy based not merely on the protection of something which is endangered but also on the fostering of what already exists. Planning is a fundamental element in that.</P>
    <P>I accept the Government amendment is more than an aspiration but it is a defensively worded aspiration. All of these amendments require one phase of public policy but a number of other phases must follow in regard to State agencies and so on. My own view &ndash; although it would be impossible to incorporate it into this Bill &ndash; is that Údarás na Gaeltachta should be the planning authority for all Gaeltacht areas. That would be the only correct and logical way to deal with this matter. I have long believed that Gaeltacht areas should be treated as a separate region for planning and development, European funding purposes, etc. A properly and democratically elected Údarás na Gaeltachta without the degree of ministerial influence which still persists should be the planning authority for Gaeltacht areas. We will not achieve that through this Bill but we must create a philosophy which is greater than one phrase contained in a Government amendment and another in the Schedule. We must develop a recurring theme throughout the Bill. For example, amendment No. 136 states that &ldquo; . where an application relates to a Gaeltacht the need to maintain Irish as the primary community language&rdquo;. We must not merely look at the linguistic and cultural heritage but must do what is necessary within the planning laws. It may not be possible to do that; sometimes things cannot be changed.</P>
    <P>We live in a completely different environment now. The problem in the past, as I said earlier as Gaeilge, is that the Gaeltacht areas were dying on their feet because of a fall in population levels. The problem now is that many of those areas may die because there are too many people there including people like me who have holiday homes in Gaeltacht areas &ndash; I may as well say it before someone else does. This matter will prove to be an additional burden for planners but it is as important, if not more so, than any other areas of heritage and special conservation value and <Col N="1376" /> addressing it will require great delicacy and considerable ingenuity.</P>
    <P>The one great thing we have is the constitutional status of the Irish language. This would make rules about the Gaeltacht and how planning should apply to it more likely to be sustainable against any constitutional challenge than similar rules in other areas. Iarraim ar an Aire féachaint ar an cheist seo go léir athuair agus níos mó ná leathnú cosantach cosúil le uimhir 47, &ldquo;The protection of the linguistic and the cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht&rdquo;. We need more than that. We need a statement that the purpose of planning is to advance where appropriate the use of the Irish language as the community language within Gaeltacht areas. The Minister could speak to his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands or the Minister of State and suggest that as a start in doing something like this they could redefine the boundaries of the Gaeltacht in a way that has some approximation to where the Irish language is spoken. Then we could begin to foster the real Irish speaking community. If we do not make it a centre of our planning there will be proposals for gargantuan house building in places like Spiddal which will turn those communities into predominantly English speakers overnight.</P>

      <P>I could not agree with Senator Ryan's view that Údarás na Gaeltachta should be the planning authority in the Gaeltacht areas. Nearly all Gaeltacht areas have people elected to local authorities and these people are the planning authorities. I agree with the amendments that have been tabled because the people in Gaeltacht areas are proud to be living there and proud of their heritage. Something should be included in this Bill and in statute to protect the heritage in Gaeltacht areas. On this basis the Minister should accept the amendment. Most local authorities have elected members from the Gaeltacht areas and they can give effect to or include these amendments in their county development plans.</P>

      <P>I have raised this issue at local authority level on several occasions. Increasingly, when it comes to naming estates we are confronted by Hawthorne Downs and similar nomenclature which has little to do with indigenous placenames. It used to be the practice that places were named Pairc Mhuire and St. Patrick's Park.</P>

      <P>That placename could hardly be described as indigenous. Most placenames are not indigenous. Kildare County Council has endeavoured to encourage people to use indigenous pla<Col N="1377" /> cenames but it has not been successful. One of the reasons names like St. Patrick's Park and Ard Mhuire are rejected is that these names were traditionally used for local authority estates. People do not want to use similar names on the more upmarket estates because of snobbery. Some consideration should be given to this topic.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Burke that planning permission is a matter for the local authority rather than Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled a large number of amendments in sequence but when we have to deal with a cluster of 15 amendments it is not always easy to get across them on the hoof.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Ryan for making the point about having a positive approach to the Irish language. He selected amendment No. 136. Amendment No. 46 does this as well. It states:</P>
      <P>in the case of development plans which relate to the Gaeltacht the objectives to be included shall include the conservation and promotion of the Gaeltacht as an area where Irish is a primary community language.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 252 is an important amendment which proposes to create a new section. I hope the Minister will consider it because it brings the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands into the whole matter and requires notice to be given to her. It states that she shall&rdquo;. . . issue regulations to planning authorities concerning the identification of planning applications . . . . the criteria to be used in assessing such planning applications . . . the preparation and context of linguistic impact statements . . .&rdquo;. The involvement of that Minister in this Bill, if we are doing anything other than giving a formal obeisance, a token nod in the direction of the Irish language, is very important.</P>
      <P>I did not draft these amendments. I simply agreed to table them but they seem to form a consistent and coherent thread. I examined them to see if they covered another amendment which I put down after briefing by the lobby group concerned. My amendment referred to the requirement for notices and so on in Gaeltacht areas to be issued in the Irish language. I did not see it included with this group of amendments so I presume it will come up under another heading.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the need to promote a positive attitude to the Irish language, not a defensive one. The promotion and conservation of the Irish language should be part of the text of the Bill. These 15 amendments constitute a thread which runs consistently through this legislation that contains not just a conservation angle but a promotional angle as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider the Government's amendment to be sufficient. It will be tokenism if the Minister does not accept any of the other amendments. The Government amendment is a response to the amendments that have been <Col N="1378" /> tabled and, therefore, we can claim a degree of movement. It would be interesting if the Minister accepted that this was the case. I urge him not to leave it at the small gesture of tabling this rather compressed Government amendment and ruling out all the others.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused. I understand what is meant by an environmental impact statement with regard to planning because I am a member of a local authority in County Clare, but I am not sure what is meant by a &ldquo;linguistic impact statement&rdquo;. None of the Senators who have spoken about this amendment has explained how it relates to planning. I want a greater definition of what is involved other than the gracious aspirational statement &ldquo;to be put into a county development plan where a Gaeltacht area exists&rdquo;. Recently, the local authority in County Clare revised its county development plan and it is undergoing a public scrutiny review at present. Does the insertion of those words mean that we will have a quota for a certain number of houses in a district electoral division? Does it mean that once that quota is reached people who cannot speak Irish will not be granted planning permission in that electoral area?</P>

      <P>This is a matter we need to clarify. If that is so, does it follow that English speaking people would automatically be discriminated against in Irish speaking areas at a certain point? If so, we are in favour of discrimination. Let us establish where we are. Senator Norris is saying, therefore, that we are in favour of discrimination. Does that mean, for instance, if a local GAA club applies for planning permission to build a GAA pitch that it will automatically get permission, but if a local soccer club applies for planning permission it will not get it because it is an English game? Let us be realistic and practical about how this would apply when one is dealing with planning applications in a local authority area. These are matters which need to be clarified in detail.</P>

      <P>&mdash;it is a matter which should be dealt with by a Department other than the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is difficult for that Department or a local authority to deal with the cultural aspect. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gael<Col N="1379" /> tacht and the Islands has a specific responsibility for that and that remit should be left with it.</P>
      <P>The proposal to allow Údarás na Gaeltachta to deal with planning permissions in the various county council areas in the west rather than the councils is ludicrous. The local authorities should have full responsibility for their areas. As Senator Burke and Senator Coogan said, there are elected members from the Gaeltacht areas on the various local authorities who can well represent the interests of the Gaeltacht. Let us be practical. It is great to be aspirational but people will have to implement this legislation and they are usually officials of local authorities. We must put ourselves in their position to see how they can to it. While this may be commendable at one level, it is not practical within the planning process.</P>

      <P>These amendments mean that a preferential form of planning would have to be introduced which would give clear preference to the number one public policy in this area &ndash; the maintenance of Irish speaking communities in what are real Gaeltachtaí. Unfortunately, it no longer applies to the suburbs of Galway city about which Senator Coogan talked because they are not Gaeltachtaí anymore but it applies in many areas which are still Gaeltachtaí. County Clare used to have a thriving Gaeltacht 60 years ago but they managed to lose it somewhere along the way, and we will not hold that against Senator Taylor-Quinn.</P>

We use the law to protect wildlife and bird life but, apparently, we cannot use the law positively to promote something which is supposed to be a fundamental aim of the country and, indeed, of the dominant party in Government &ndash; the preservation of the Irish language, as a spoken language, in Gaeltacht communities. If the difficulties of this are beyond members of local authorities, it confirms my view that we should leave it to the people of the Gaeltacht because they have done remarkably well in keeping the language alive in the face of extraordinary pressures.</P>
      <P>We have an opportunity to give them the chance to have a decent community life with a decent standard of living and with a large number of young people in an Irish speaking community, but to do that we will need to use planning, education, industrial development policy and so on.

Like Senator Taylor-Quinn, I do not have a clue what they are and I doubt if anybody at local authority level has either.

      <P>The idea behind these amendments is to give recognition to the special nature of the Gaeltacht and to support and protect the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. I know they are the two aims of those putting down these amendments and I fully support the general aim. For the first time, this Bill gives recognition to the special nature of the Gaeltacht. Without any amendments it contains provisions on the Gaeltacht, the development plans and the regional planning guidelines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Coalition Government for its total failure to provide essential services and resources for people with physical and mental disabilities at a time when the economy is booming; and calls on the Government to make available the necessary funding to provide for day care, respite care, home care, residential care, personal assistance services, and independent living as needed by people with disabilities and their families, and as promised regularly by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuirim failte roimh an tAire. We seem to have seen a lot of the Minister in recent weeks and I <Col N="1382" /> have considerable intellectual respect for him. He sometimes does a difficult job very well and sometimes he does a very difficult job very badly. I am entitled to make that judgment.</P>
    <P>I persuaded my colleagues to put down this motion because we are at a decisive moment. We have to make decisions now about whether we are prepared to use resources that were unimaginable five years ago, not to mention ten years ago, we now have to end things that we all used to agree 20 years ago would be at the top of our priorities if we had the resources to deal with them. Homelessness would have been one of my top priorities when I started in politics, but I accept that homelessness is a complex and difficult problem in which resources are not the only issue.</P>
    <P>However, it is quite clear when dealing with the problems of people with physical or mental handicaps or physical, intellectual and sensory disabilities, that the organisations representing those people have, over a period of maturing, developed a very clear strategy of what is needed in order to dramatically transform the lives of people who are physically or mentally handicapped. I will refer to the submissions of two of those bodies, the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped in Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association. I hope this will be the last year people in wheelchairs will have to feel obliged to sit outside the gates of Leinster House.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association has a succession of proposals, the total cost of which is £32 million. There was a time when the expenditure of £32 million on perhaps 7,000 people would be regarded as enormously generous and in a time of severe budgetary restrictions perhaps it would have been irresponsibly generous. However, we now have so much money available to our society and to the Government in particular that only ideology, an ideology that is quite wrong, stands between us and meeting these demands.</P>
    <P>There is not one Member of the Oireachtas who would go to the Irish Wheelchair Association and say, &ldquo;You do not need these things.&rdquo; Nobody would say they do not need what they are asking for &ndash; personal assistants, respite and resource centres and a cost of disability payment scheme to give people with physical disability a fair income to live on. Nobody would meet these people and say anything other than: &ldquo;Yes, we acknowledge that you need these things and that they are reasonable demands. We acknowledge that this is not somebody seeking excess, this is not somebody seeking to live well on the munificence of the State. We acknowledge that every penny of the £32 million the Irish Wheelchair Association is seeking would be well spent if every penny of it was given to them.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One can only have enormous respect for physically handicapped people, those in wheelchairs and their families for their resilience, good humour, courage and for the enormous spirit they <Col N="1383" /> show in overcoming profound disability. That spirit is epitomised by a former Senator who is now a Member of the European Parliament, Mr. Brian Crowley. I have enormous respect for him both for his stances on many issues and because of the extraordinary way in which he has chosen to deal with the hand life dealt him.</P>
    <P>The same is true of those who have family members with mental handicap or learning difficulties. Again, they are not looking for something any Member of the Oireachtas would say is not needed. They have quoted figures produced by the Department of Health and Children showing that 3,380 people with mental handicap and intellectual disability will require a new service in the next few years. They quote the Minister as saying that it is clear from a preliminary examination of the figures that waiting lists for services are on the increase. The Minister has a record on this. In 1997 he said:</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that a parent of a son or daughter with a mental handicap should have to worry about who will look after their child when they are no longer able to care for them. I intend to ensure that their fears are allayed.</P>
    <P>The Government programme states, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families and carers are comprehensively addressed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The trouble is that we all agree with this. The trouble is that there is nobody in this House or the other House who does not agree with this. The trouble is that families and people who suffer from these disabilities have been listening to this agreement for ten years. They have lobbied all the political parties and everyone they could who said, &ldquo;Yes, of course it is terrible&rdquo;. Wonderfully moving television programmes have been made, crusading journalists have written about them and everyone said &ldquo;Yes, it is awful&rdquo;. The people who work with them have experienced, as have many others working in the voluntary sector, an unintentional but nevertheless superior patronisation, almost a patting on the head, saying &ldquo;You are doing great work, keep it up, we think you are wonderful&rdquo;. Once that is said, people forget them.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister and the Government of last Saturday's opinion poll which showed that four out of five Irish people believe that improving public services is more important than reducing taxes. The extraordinary fact is that we could do both. This country is so awash with money that we could build a fair tax system for those on low or fixed incomes and have more than enough resources to do all of the things so many people have demanded for ten to 20 years.</P>
    <P>What I am saying to the Minister and the Government is quite simple. The total sum sought by NAMHI and the Irish Wheelchair Association <Col N="1384" /> is about £60 million every year plus an appropriate level of capital investment to enable that money to be spent. That is only one of a large number of areas in which public expenditure is needed. The resources are there &ndash; the only obstacle is the determination of this Government to meet a target on the increase in public expenditure which is wrong, unrealistic, unrelated to development, which has not been achieved in any other civilised country in northern Europe and which is based, not on economic necessity or the so-called laws of economics, but on ideology. The ideological belief that public expenditure must be reduced as a share of gross domestic product is no more than that.</P>
    <P>There is no economic, empirical or other evidence to suggest that we should not spend this money. The only reason we will not make provision for the handicapped, the homeless and a dozen other groups in society in the next two years is not because we do not have the money but because we will not spend it. It is the job of this Minister, now he has one major obstacle out of his way, to tell his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to forget it, a 4 per cent increase in public expenditure is not enough. There are a many hurts to heal and many gaps to be filled. We have the chance to do it and public opinion is telling us we should. The only reason we will not do it will not be practicality or resources but because somebody somewhere with an ideology of pain and privatisation says we should not spend public money on public services. We should and we can. If this Government will not do it, a different Government will. If this Government will not do it, it does not deserve to stay in government. Any Government which lets ideology stand in the way of doing what everybody knows should be done does not deserve to be in office. It is time to move beyond ideology to what we can do which is spend the resources we have on those who need it most.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. As my colleague Senator Ryan asked, who can disagree with this motion? Last Monday night in Nenagh I met four women, two of whom work in services for the mentally handicapped and two parents. They requested a meeting because they wish to establish a fund to set up a day workshop for mentally handicapped children and adults who currently have no service. They have to date identified 157 people in Nenagh town and its catchment area, that is, a five mile radius, in the age group of infants to 65 years and over with mild to profound learning disabilities who have no service available to them during the day. The vast majority are over the age of 18 years because most of those under 18 are catered for by St. Anne's of Roscrea or Lisnagry. However, there is a considerable number of people who spend their days effectively doing nothing, who are at home with their families and have no outlet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> This group of four women have begun an action programme to build a centre in Nenagh town for these people and their families. In doing so, they are doing what we are used to seeing happening &ndash; they are taking the initiative, which is to be applauded. They had an initial meeting with the health board which gave its full support, but said it will depend on resources. They are likely to get a site, which I hope they do, from the local authority for little or nothing. They will get their skates on and do what parents of the mentally handicapped have become so used to doing &ndash; they will organise, fundraise and receive great support from the community. Having taken the initiative they will basically get the service up and running. It all comes down to resources and money.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan said, we have the money to provide resources and ensure that the adult mentally handicapped are not confined to a life without quality. Their families are forced not only into full-time care but into providing full-time social activities for these people, who, in effect, have a reduced quality of life and are second class citizens as a result of the absence of services they require. Until a number of years ago, the answer was always &ldquo;If only we had the resources; we are a poor country, our resources are limited, we have a national debt and we cannot make it stretch to everyone&rdquo;. However, we have the money now and the time for excuses is over. We should spend the money, not only on helping groups such as this, but on very basic services for members of the Irish Wheelchair Association who were here last week. We all went out to meet them at the gates of Leinster House where they come year after year to lobby for their case. The Minister knows what their case is.</P>
    <P>This year they are requesting £16 million to make personal assistants, respite and resource centres a reality for 4,000 people with significant physical disabilities. For many such people, personal assistants mean the difference between being prisoners in their own homes or getting out and having some quality of life. Respite and resource centres are required by their families who have 24 hour responsibility. They want £16 million to establish a costed disability payment scheme to give people with physical disabilities a fair and equitable income to live on and they want £32 million to make independence, inclusion and equity a reality. It is time we acted on that request because these people have waited far too long. As Senator Ryan rightly said, we have the money so let us do it. It comes down to a question of political choice and our decision as a nation on how to spend the fruits of our prosperity which people have worked hard to achieve but which are not benefiting everybody. We have an opportunity to generate an equal quality of life for those with physical and mental disability and it is now time to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> In its pre-budget submission the Disability Federation of Ireland has raised a number of issues, including the carer's allowance, personal assistant services, VAT relief for voluntary organisations registered as charities and funding for properly accessible transport facilities. The federation is also seeking funding for the financial deficits of organisations that provide services to people with disabilities. Such organisations have to spend so much time fund raising that their main work is often relegated to second place on the agenda.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been huge advances in providing the carer's allowance, which has gone from a pittance to a level that recognises the job carers do. Last year's initiative involving a pension style arrangement for full-time carers was very welcome and has made a huge difference to some people. It has also led to a recognition of the work being done particularly by full-time carers, the majority of whom are women. In the years to come I hope the Government will decide to develop the idea of supporting carers both at home and in the community, if only because the value for money is much greater than supporting private nursing homes whose cost is escalating all the time. Consideration should be given to a policy of supporting full and part-time carers whose services are an invaluable asset to the many elderly people who would prefer to stay at home rather than moving into a nursing home.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. Let us make the choice for a proper quality of life for the many thousands of people who deserve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments, which includes the provision of additional funding of £91.662 million.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Everybody in the House, including the Minister, would admit that there is more to be done, but it is also fair to say that much has already been done in this regard. I commend the work done by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association. Both organisations are innovative and dedicated to the cause they serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair to say, as Senator Ryan suggested, that the Minister has taken the attitude of giving people a pat on the head and telling them they are doing great work and to carry on. He has not let the situation go at that and I do not agree with <Col N="1387" /> that sentiment. I do not know how the issue of reforming the tax system arose in the debate, but Senator Ryan mentioned it. We did not only talk about it, however, we actually did it and there is more to come, but I will leave that to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, when he presents his budget.</P>
    <P>When one sets out to do anything, the most important thing is to know where one is coming from. If one does not know that, one cannot know where one is going. Last year, preliminary data from the national intellectual disability database showed there was a balance of approximately 1,353 residential and 752 day places to be provided when the 1999 new service developments are taken into account. Since his appointment, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has provided additional funding of £53 million, increasing in a full year to £59 million in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of £28 million has been provided for the development of services in 1999. This funding comprises the following: £12 million additional Revenue funding with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000; £6 million to meet identified needs in existing services and £10 million capital funding to support the new developments. This funding is providing 400 new residential/respite places and 200 new day places. While this additional funding has made a significant impact, the accelerated provision of further additional resources for these services remains one of the Minister's stated priorities. He is currently pursuing the provision of this funding in the context of the Estimates process for 2000 and the national development plan.</P>
    <P>A major £30 million capital programme was put in place in late 1997 for intellectual disability services to run over the four years 1998 to 2001, inclusive. This programme is providing for new residential and day facilities and the upgrading of existing facilities; the provision of alternative accommodation for persons with an intellectual disability resident in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and the provision of facilities for persons who require specialist services in a secure environment. Some £50 million of this programme has been allocated to date. The programme is now part of the national development plan which will provide a significantly enhanced level of capital funding for services, priorities for the development of services to persons with an intellectual disability, additional day residential places, the transfer of persons from inappropriate care settings and meeting the needs of an aging population.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals. In my time as a practising nurse with the psychiatric services at St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar, I recall carrying out a survey of people with mental handicap and related disabilities in <Col N="1388" /> psychiatric hospitals. At the time I was quite surprised that the numbers were so high. It is to the eternal credit of the current director of nursing, Mr. Pat Lynch, and his staff that a fine facility was developed at the Lough Cheever centre in Mullingar. I am also pleased to say that other upgradings are taking place in St. Finan's, Killarney, St. Canice's, Kilkenny, St. Raphael's, Youghal, Kelvin Grove, Carlow, St. Peter's, Castlepollard and the Alvernia Centre, Portlaoise. Improvements are taking place in all these centres for people with sensory and other disabilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to physical and sensory disability services, it has been estimated that the number of people involved is between 100,000 and 200,000. The report, Towards an Independent Future, highlighted the lack of reliable information on the number of people with physical and sensory disabilities and their service needs and recommended the establishment of a database of the service needs of this group. It is anticipated that the database will be put in place in 2000 and it will be an invaluable aid to the planning of services.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, was published in December 1996. It set out the requirements for the development of services over the five years from 1997 to 2001, inclusive. It estimated the cost of implementing its recommendations at £50 million over the period. A total of £18 million was provided between 1997 and 1999 as part of the £21 million which will have been spent over the four years to 2000.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the review group is the establishment in each health board of a co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. Membership of these committees comprises health board officers, representatives of voluntary agencies, disabled people, who were nominated by the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, and the National Rehabilitation Board. The functions of the committees include the planning and co-ordination of the services and advising health boards on priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services. I am pleased to note that such committees are now in place in all health boards.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the review group is that existing services should be put on a firm financial footing to provide a firm basis for future development. In the years from 1997 to 1999, funding has been provided in the Estimates of the Department of Health and Children for the elimination of underfunding by the State. Revenue funding of £2.186 million in 1997, £2.4 million in 1998 and £3.2 million in 1999 has been provided for the purpose of eliminating core funding deficits. It is anticipated that further Revenue funding will be provided in future years. Additional fund<Col N="1389" /> ing for 1997 was £3.695 million with a Revenue amount of £10 million, which gave a total of £13.695 million. Additional funding for 1998 was £5.4 million from Revenue with a once off payment of £7.862 million, giving a total of £13.262 million.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the position of personal assistants and rightly so. This service is a must for people with physical disabilities. I have discussed the matter with the Minister and he is conscious of the problem. However, from experience in my county, it should be pointed out that there is a difficulty in getting people to take up positions as personal assistants. This is probably indicative of the number of jobs available at present. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that everything possible is done to provide personal assistants where appropriate because it involves people who depend on assistants. Otherwise, they are prisoners in their own homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I and the Fine Gael Party are pleased to support the motion. If the Labour Party had not tabled it this week, we intended to table a similar motion for our next Private Members' slot. The Minister will listen to a Fine Gael Private Members' motion in the other House next week. It is obvious that, at a time of plenty and on the eve of the millennium budget, this nation which considers itself Christian should not forget its people with physical and sensory or mental and intellectual disabilities.</P>
      <P>The many issues involved were reiterated during the nurses' strike when I visited hospitals, although the nurses had other things on their minds. The most important issue is the need for respite care services and the elimination of waiting lists for such care. Other major issues are the need for residential day care, aids and appliances and the need for expansion of the personal assistant service, which is in big demand. In the Fine Gael Private Members' motion, which will be discussed next week in the other House, a figure of not less than £100 is mentioned in terms of financial support for carers of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I thought that at this stage there would be definite figures available regarding the number of people with physical and sensory disabilities. The estimated figure available to me is 140,000, although other speakers mentioned different figures. However, such people cannot achieve what we can achieve in terms of full social, economic and educational integration as equal, independent and participative members of society. Sometimes we do not appreciate that we have the facilities to achieve those goals, but it is not within the ambit of the people who are the subject of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was sad to meet representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association last week who were protesting for the second successive year. For them, the difficulty of travelling is almost insurmountable and it should not be necessary for them to <Col N="1390" /> protest annually. The emphasis of the millennium budget in the health area should be on funding the expansion of community based and residential care facilities, their services and requirements.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan quoted from the report, Towards an Independent Future. We do not want that report to suffer a similar fate to other reports. We should seek the implementation of the recommendations in the report by the end of 2000. For example, the cerebral palsy unit in Mungret in Limerick, which does tremendous work, is seeking funding. It relates its needs to those outlined in the report, such as the basic issue of regional child assessment. It also refers to the need to provide 1,600 places nationally for day service facilities for people with disabilities with the objectives of maintaining and improving personal independence, an issue which constantly arises, and mobility and communication skills. They are basic needs. Another issue is the integration of people with disabilities into community life, which should be our aim.</P>
    <P>The advisory group, which emanated from the Department of Health and Children, said there should be three different levels of personal assistance. One relates to severe disability, another to care attendants for primary tasks such as washing, dressing and limited assistance with education and the third is respite care, another matter which arises constantly.</P>
    <P>The replacement of aids and appliances appears to be virtually impossible. New highly technical appliances are available and we must think in terms of the replacement of old technology. It is difficult to explain to people who tell me their appliances no longer fit and they need replacements that they must wait for months. This is not giving them quality of life and it is not equality. The issue of respite continually arises. There is a need for 100 residential places in dedicated facilities for people with disabilities. The Minister is aware of all these issues because the report for his Department highlighted them.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to NAMHI and the 3,380 people, according to departmental figures, with mental handicap and intellectual disability. It wants phased funding of £40 million in 2000 and £35 million 2001. I will not repeat the details mentioned earlier with the exception of one item which is the most important. The Minister said it is not acceptable that a parent of a son or daughter with a mental handicap should have to worry about who will look after their child when they are no longer able to care for them. He said that he intends to ensure that their fears are allayed. I believe the Minister because everybody would accept that is an extraordinary burden for parents who are ageing. They have had to deal with the situation for many years and they must think about entering the next world and leaving the problem behind. The Minister made his statement in 1997 and I appeal to him to deal with the matter. I hope he will ensure that their fears are <Col N="1391" /> allayed. On the issue of aids and appliances for the voluntary sector, because of funding that was brought forward to them, it might be better if any funding for aids and appliances were filtered through the health boards.</P>
    <P>There is a need for more small groups concerned with, for instance, blindness or deafness to combine and share facilities. There is a pilot study being carries out in the Mid-Western Health Board. They could join together, share experiences &ndash; they would certainly have a better quality of life &ndash; and they would have very practical approaches as to how they can deal with their problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of my hobby-horse issue of ADD or ADHD. I am still sad that the report, which will be a year old very soon, has not yet been debated in the Seanad. I would hope that the Minister would prioritise it for 2000 because, the mid-western support group, particularly the pilot group in the Limerick area, have done wonders. I do not know how they survive or how they find the energy to deal with what are nightmare living conditions for parents of children suffering from ADHD.</P>
    <P>As we reach the next millennium, the people would raise no dissenting voice if we were to say tomorrow that we will forget about the razzmatazz of having this monument and that celebration. These are all peripheral and passing events. A lasting monument to us in the dying year of this millennium, and in the spirit of the first millennium, would be to prioritise our money. Forget the celebrations. We are already, as a nation, forgetting about going out on New Year's Eve, wanting instead to be with our families, and in that spirit we should be putting our resources into the most basic need &ndash; providing a quality of life for people who unfortunately suffer from physical and mental disability.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in the House on this issue and to welcome both the motion and the amendment. It provides a forum for debate. Dealing with disability issues is unfortunately a relatively recent phenomenon in Ireland where Governments have been involved. As late as 1992, John O'Connell actually started a process which would allow the issues to be scoped for the purpose of devising a framework to address them. This is often forgotten. The State has come very late to this issue. The voluntary sector down the years has been providing the service and the advocacy for people, whether with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities. They are to be commended and complimented and it is important in this debate to acknowledge that the transition we are moving into now is a new partnership between the voluntary and the statutory sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> A framework must first be developed within which we can determine the size and scope of the problem, and how we can deal with not just the need for continuing developments, existing developments, but with historic under-funding of services which have been filled by the voluntary sector. This Government, on its election to office, has dealt with that issue in a way in which no previous Government has. That is only one part of a wider problem.</P>
    <P>It is important to make those points. The idea that we are in a settled position that simply requires resourcing does give cognisance to the work that has gone on since the beginning of the nineties under Dr. John O'Connell. It is not within the health services alone that disability issues are going to be addressed. Those who advocate for disability rights have been seeking, for a long time, a move away from the health model of disability. Services need to be mainstreamed and to provide services as a right to people regardless, rather than in a specific, managed way because people are disabled or providing services through a particular department, is not the way in which we are going to improve the disability issues. Therefore, a move away from the health based model of disability and towards a rights based model has been the new policy drive.</P>
    <P>There is no question, as Senator Ryan has indicated, of differing ideology. Agreement has been achieved as a result of the work of the establishment groups and the reports that we have on intellectual and physical disability. There is a consensus as to how we are to proceed in ensuring that disability issues get the priority within the public policy framework they deserve and that they have not historically got in the past.</P>
    <P>The establishment group for the National Disability Authority was set up in November when we came into office in 1997 and reported to Government in June 1998. The Government accepted the recommendations of the infrastructural arrangements for the NDA and mainstreaming of services are now at an advanced stage with a proposed implementation date of March 2000, which has been agreed.</P>
    <P>The changes being introduced will result soon in the relocation of responsibility for disability services from the National Rehabilitation Board under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children to the various Departments and Government agencies with overall responsibility for these services. That change in structure of service delivery is an absolute prerequisite if we are to successfully deal with the agenda that the disability organisations are quite rightly presenting to us on an ongoing basis. As a result of that structural change, therefore, vocational training and employment services, for example, for people with disabilities will be provided by FÁS under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="1393" /> Employment as they are being provided to other members of the community.</P>
    <P>A new mainstream information and support service, Comhairle, is being established under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the audiology, psychology and non-vocational services operated by the NRR will be provided by the relevant Government agencies such as the health boards and the new National Educational Psychology Service.</P>
    <P>The NDA is being established in conjunction with these mainstreaming arrangements. The authority will be an independent statutory body established under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Legislation to provide for the new authority, the National Disability Authority Act, 1999, was enacted on 8 June this year. The NDA will be responsible for research and development standards and codes of practice for disability services and for monitoring and assisting service providers to ensure implementation of standards and codes of practice. The NDA will also act as a coherent focus for disability policy and will play a key role in advising and reporting to the Minister in regard to disability issues. It will also facilitate and monitor disability policy and legislation and delivery of services across the sectors and will provide a focus at Government level through its advisory and reporting role to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The National Disability Authority will not be involved in direct enforcement, for which a number of mechanisms already exist, such as internal complaints procedures, the Ombudsman's Office and the new Equality Authority. However, the NDA will also intervene directly with service providers and where it is not satisfied with the outcome, it will report its findings to the Minister with recommendations for the review, reduction or withdrawal of funding provided for such services. Interventions by the NDA may be included in the annual report of the NDA which will be published and put before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The NDA therefore has a key role in monitoring and implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue to monitor further progress on the implementation of the commission's recommendations at interdepartmental level. Four pilot community services projects and two pilot community action plans are ongoing, focusing on accessible transport and undertaken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The backdrop against which the establishment of the National Disability Authority and each of the other developments is taking place is the new legislative framework for equality. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, was brought into effect on 18 October 1999 and prohibits discrimination in the workplace on a number of grounds including <Col N="1394" /> disability. This legislation will be complemented in the very near future with the expected enactment of the Equal Status Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Dáil and which will prohibit discrimination in services. Legislation specifically providing for disability has been enacted in education and is proposed for mental health and for accessibility of private housing.</P>
    <P>With this framework in place, preparatory work on a rights based disabilities Bill has commenced in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is intended to develop this legislation within the Department in an innovative and comprehensive way to ensure that the many issues which impact on disability and which remain to be dealt with are considered. Constitutional issues may also need to be addressed and this will be an evolving area as the provisions of the anti-discrimination legislation are challenged and developed.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the legislative framework is the one within which disability issues can progress. It is as a result of the work and consensus built up between all the disabilities bodies that that structural framework being put in place is seen as a necessary prerequisite for dealing with the issues. That is not to say that one postpones the operational problems that people with disabilities face on a daily basis. It does not absolve the State of its responsibilities to increase funding in this area. The record of this Government will show, on any objective criteria, a far greater commitment by this Administration than any of its predecessors. That is a fact.</P>
    <P>I have heard Opposition Deputies, since I became Minister, contend that suddenly, in June 1997, there were unimaginable resources that were not previously available. Let it be remembered by those who propose the motion in the House today that their leader, as Minister for Finance, had before him in three budgets a total expenditure of £40,000 million. The idea that resources suddenly became available in June 1997 is a fallacy, and a politically defensive mechanism by those who did not produce when they were in office. I can refer to the revenue and capital allocations, for physical and intellectual and sensory disability, during the term 1994 to 1997 when there are those who were then in Government who claim to have a monopoly of virtue in relation to this area. I can show clearly, if the Senator so wishes, the relative performance of both Administrations.</P>
    <P>Without making that political point, this is an objective financial point that stands on its own merits. In trying to deal with disability issues one is dealing with a different matrix of need all the time. There are emerging needs which are increasing and there is, therefore, a need to see in what way we can accelerate developments. That would be one of the objectives I have as Minister for Health and Children. Quite apart from meeting the recommendations in Towards an Indepen<Col N="1395" /> dent Future in terms of the funding they mention there, or the assessment of need report for intellectual disabilities, that in itself is not a static picture but simply a timeframe, snapshot or prediction of need that is changing and emerging all the time.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to put in place for physical and sensory disabilities now is something which has proven successful in dealing with the problem of intellectual disability, that is a database to put information on record. That issue will be finalised very shortly. It is only in that respect that we can get away from the perennial debate in which people talk about the resource requirement this year. Unless we acknowledge the historic under-funding of the past, the need to put in the proper planning structures and legislative framework now and unless we scope the problem for the future we will not find the sort of quality improvements that people with physical and sensory disabilities need. I see some of their advocates in the House tonight and I welcome them.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to intellectual disability, the fact that we have the assessment of need report has been an important driver in trying to bring forward not just the necessary resourcing but, concomitant with that, the necessary planning that is required, both within the voluntary and statutory sector on a partnership basis to make sure we provide the places we plan for. Unless we do that, we will find that increasing resources will not bring the sort of results we want. The involvement of the voluntary sector is absolutely critical.</P>
    <P>Statistical information on the numbers of people with intellectual disability, for example, provided by the National Intellectual Disability Database, in their first report published in 1996, shows that at that time the total number of people was 26,664. The preliminary 1998 data have identified an increase of 1,346 persons. We have gone, therefore, from 26,664 to 28,010 in the overall number of persons on the database. The data reveal an ageing population in the more severe range of disability and higher numbers of young adults and increased life expectancy, thankfully, will mean that the pressure currently being experienced by adult day services will increase as this group ages and requires residential services.</P>
    <P>There are, at present, no definitive statistics in relation to the number of people with physical and sensory disabilities &ndash; it is hard to believe. Based on population trends in other countries it has been estimated that the number in this country could be as high as 200,000. Towards an Independent Future highlighted the lack of reliable information on the numbers and service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities and recommended the establishment of a database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities. As a first step the review <Col N="1396" /> group recommended the establishment, by my Department, of a database development committee to prepare detailed proposals for the development of such a database. That committee hopes to complete its work by the end of this year and it will pave the way for the putting in place of the database next year.</P>
    <P>One recommendation of the review group was that the chief executive officer of each health board should establish a regional co-ordinating committee for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Membership of the committee will comprise officers of the health board, the voluntary sector service providers, the representatives of service users &ndash; that is, people with disabilities &ndash; and the National Rehabilitation Board. I am pleased to say that those committees have been established in every health board and we are pursuing a review of the operation of the committees in consultation with them and the voluntary organisations concerned, the purpose of which is to identify best practice, to encourage a cross-fertilisation of ideas across the regions to come up with solutions to any teething problems which may have arisen, and to contribute to the development of overall national policy.</P>
    <P>A major element of the review process was a national seminar which brought together all the participating parties to discuss progress to date and ways in which the operation of the committees could be made more effective. I am confident that that partnership approach will bring about real progress in the planning and delivery of services and we will continue to facilitate that process.</P>
    <P>In relation to carers, dealing with disabilities on the health model would be to fail to recognise the contribution that other Departments and agencies and other parts of the State apparatus can make. Carers are an obvious example. People with disabilities living at home require assistance with the tasks of daily living and often the responsibility for care rests with one person principally.</P>
    <P>The review group report acknowledges the need to expand and develop different levels of home support services for people with disabilities and their carers and a substantial package of improvements in the carer's allowance was provided in the 1998 budget, and graciously acknowledged by Senator O'Meara. All 11,500 existing carers will benefit from those measures, with an additional 3,300 new carers qualifying for the allowance this year. The total package of those improvements alone in last year's budget amounted to £18 million annually. That is a large additional increase on the existing £45 million spent on carers last year and indicates a substantial commitment to carers and our appreciation of their valuable role in society.</P>
    <P>In relation to personal assistant services there have been calls by the Centre for Independent Living for a personal assistance service funded by <Col N="1397" /> a designated independent living fund. A full PA service is defined by the Centre for Independent Living as the need for at least 20 hours service per week. The independent living fund is no more than a particular model for funding a PA service. The PA service is one of a range of support services designed to enable people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence. The range includes home helps, home care attendants, respite care, day care, etc. and the object of our policy is to develop the range of services as a whole. The amount of funding to be devoted to the development of this service is being decided in each health board area in accordance with locally perceived priorities. As I have already indicated, health boards decide on priorities for the allocation of development funding in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services, as recommended by those who sought to have these services and their delivery improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has put in place a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. That is a very important initiative that was taken under this Administration. The Minister considers that this initiative represents a major advance in the education of all children with special educational needs and demonstrates this Government's commitment to the provision of suitable education for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of a full or part-time resource teacher or child care support, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs. The sum of £8 million has been allocated, over the next two years, for teacher and special needs assistant support under that initiative.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science also reduced the pupil teacher ratio in all special schools and special classes catering for children with mild learning disabilities; children with moderate learning disabilities; children with emotional disturbance; and children with a physical disability. These reductions will bring the pupil teacher ratios in all special schools and classes down to the level recommended by the special education review committee and represent the full implementation of one of the key recommendations of that committee.</P>
    <P>In addition, £3.4 million has been allocated over the next two years to facilitate the introduction of escorts on all special school transport services and the provision of safety harnesses on such services when required. A further £800,000 has been allocated over the next two years for the <Col N="1398" /> purchase of special equipment for children with disabilities. The Minister for Education and Science is also extending the remedial teaching service to ensure all schools which currently do not have a remedial service will have access to it. I am sure Senators will agree that these measures provide concrete evidence of the commitment from Government to ensuring all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system. I assure the House that it is the intention of the Minister for Education and Science to continue to build on the very significant progress which has already been achieved in this area.</P>
    <P>Under the disabled persons grant scheme, local authorities may pay a grant for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to a house to meet the needs of a member of the household with a disability. In the last budget that grant was increased from a maximum of £8,000 where it stood for many years to a maximum of £12,000 &ndash; a 50 per cent increase. Far from that being an ideological response it is a practical response to the needs of people who saw that as a simple improvement in an existing scheme which works well but due to the increase in building costs the increased limit was introduced and has been used to great effect at local level.</P>
    <P>The arrival on our streets of buses which are accessible to wheelchairs is a major breakthrough in the pursuit of universal access. These buses are being operated currently by Dublin Bus on the No. 3 route. They are also being piloted in Cork city by Bus Éireann. At the request of my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Dublin Bus is preparing a broad programme of trials of possible low floor buses. Depending on the results of these tests, Dublin Bus should be in a position to begin ordering accessible double decker buses from 2000, another bone of contention &ndash; a basic need which was being sought by disability groups and progress can be reported in that area. In regard to my Department, many of the services for people with disabilities are provided by agencies in the voluntary sector. Very often the provision of services was in response to demands for services from their own members. Some of these services could be funded from fund raising income but not all and a situation developed over a period of years where services were not fully funded by the State. In recent years with falling income from fund raising some agencies have been running services at a loss and building up debts.</P>
    <P>One of the basic recommendations of the review group was that existing services be put on a firm financial footing in order to provide a sound basis for future development &ndash; an important point on the development of services. Existing services must be put on a sound financial footing and improved as we go along, not for the purpose of postponing increased resources but of <Col N="1399" /> ensuring that we do not end up building further blocks in a house without ensuring the foundation is sustainable in the long term. Within months of coming into office, this Government provided by way of a Supplementary Estimate £5 million to eliminate accumulated deficits of those agencies. These issues were brought before the previous Administration but fell on deaf ears. To help eliminate the ongoing under funding of services, £2.4 million revenue was provided in 1998 and £6.4 million this year.</P>
    <P>One of the areas singled out by people with disabilities, again a practical response rather than an ideological one, was the obvious aids and appliance package which again had been sought by people on the ground for some time for the replacement of basic equipment. It was a forlorn hope, almost like the east Germans waiting for their travel after 15 years. It was getting to the stage where people in the disability sector had no prospect of basic maintenance, repair or the provision of new wheelchairs or other physical and sensory aids and appliances. The practical response of this Administration and this Department with colleagues, Deputies Dermot Ahern and Mary Wallace, was to provide £4.825 million &ndash; £500,000 for the elderly, £4.325 million for appliances. This helped thousands of people. It was not a huge amount of money but it was an important amount given the gaps in the services because people seemed to have an ideological problem about doing practical things rather than being rhetorical about the need for an inclusive, fair and egalitarian society, yet nothing was being done in terms of providing a wheelchair replacement or a basic hearing aid. People wanted a practical response and that was provided by this Administration in a way in which the previous Administation was found incapable of doing, not because there were unimaginable resources but because the use of existing modest resources were not being focused on the people on the ground who needed those services. More than 10,000 people with disabilities benefited from that simple initiative.</P>
    <P>A further £1 million was provided for capital funding to health boards in 1998 for aids and appliances. Notwithstanding that funding, it was brought to my attention towards the end of 1998 that there were still substantial waiting lists in health boards for aids and appliances. I allocated a further £4 million to help eliminate those waiting lists. Despite these substantial injections of funding, health boards are still experiencing difficulty keeping up with demand for aids and appliances and discussions will continue in that regard. I do not have the funds available since I put them out at the beginning of the year.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to take any criticism from the Senator who was recently recruited to the Labour Party. He was not interrupted at the European Parliament convention, which was his real reason for joining. The bottom line is the aids and appliance initiative came under this Administration, was its brainchild and will be continued under it. The Senator can call me a socialist or a capitalist but the people with disabilities know the practical benefits of this and I will let them decide.</P>
      <P>In 1997, in addition to the £9.325 million made available for aids and appliances we also helped eliminate the accumulated deficits of the voluntary sector service providers with capital grants totalling £675,000 given to the voluntary sector service providers for the provision of additional respite and long-term residential care places.</P>
      <P>In 1998 a total of £8.4 million was allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £2.4 million was devoted to eliminating core under-funding which is a continuing problem. Nine of the main voluntary agencies in the sector received grants for that purpose. A further £3 million was invested in aids and appliances and the balance was allocated to health boards for the further development of services. Almost half of that funding was used to create 50 new posts in health boards, such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and public health nurses.</P>
      <P>This year a total of £13.4 million, rising to £16.4 million in the year 2000, has been allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. I do not say this in any self-congratulatory way but on the basis that, taken as an objective assessment with previous performance, that is a significant improvement. It does not suggest that we do not continue with increased resourcing. I am not prepared to listen to political claptrap. When the Senator's leader was Minister for Finance with £40 billion expenditure over three years and three budgets, the total amount given to disabilities in an election year was £1 million. That Government was disparate and distant from the people by the time they went out to get their answer in June of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, I have consistently identified the ongoing development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and their families as one of my priorities. I met them today. Indeed I had an excellent, straight and honest meeting with Alliance today; I had also met them when I attended the NAMHI Conference. I talk to people in an honest way about what can and cannot be done with available resources and within Government policy. It is my political priority to try to do something about that issue. The Estimates will be published tomorrow but I get Revenue funding not simply through the Estimates. <Col N="1401" /> There are the budget package and the National Development Plan where health capital funding has been included for the first time. An unprecedented amount of capital money will be made available for people in the disability sector as a result of negotiations with the Minister for Finance with whom it was very easy to deal when it came to this issue compared with some of his predecessors based on the success of what they have been able to get.</P>
    <P>Let us get honest and say that even when extra resources are provided over the next three years during the life of this Administration, there will still be the need for advocacy groups, for people to put forward disability issues, an emerging and changing need which will require constant improvement by whoever has the privilege to be in Government at that time. After our five years in office, I am confident that, in any objective assessment with any of our predecessors, and allowing for increased resources, we will be seen to have made a significant and sincere attempt to advance these issues so that people enjoy basic rights. I will not be rhetorical about it, I will not wear my heart on my sleeve, I will not go to any socialist international and sing the Red Flag but I will ensure that modern day republicanism will give real equality to those people who were left out by the previous Government for the three years they were in office. While in Opposition I remember the dismay of those groups having had meetings with the Government. They will have a slightly different tale to tell at the end of our term in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He is an invigorating performer. I do not envy him his job but he certainly seems to be well on top of it. It was a remarkable performance and a good speech. He showed considerable respect to the House by the detailed manner in which he replied to the terms of the motion. He gave a lot of interesting information. He is obviously passionately committed to the issue. I was entertained by the way in which, rather like myself, he demeaned himself by getting down into the political gutter and exchanging a few fisticuffs &ndash; it is a temptation I find very difficult to resist. I probably would not have belted them out at the socialists in quite the same way but it is invigorating stuff. I believe the Minister is committed to doing what he can and if anyone can squeeze money out of a turnip he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the motion, it is part of the interplay of democratic politics for Oppositions to criticise. Fianna Fáil never hid behind the bush when it came to criticising &ndash; they regard it as a central part of Opposition. However, it seems to me that the Government's amendment is realistic to a certain extent because it recognises the need for further development. That is a good thing and I am pleased they are not saying everything is wonderful. The Minister did not say that either. <Col N="1402" /> However, even though I am an Independent Member, I will probably vote with this side of the House; that is politics. I compliment the Minister on his speech and for including solid serious information. Often during Private Members' time in this House dealing with serious issues we have not been treated with such a degree of courtesy or intellectual honesty, although there may be elements in his speech with which I would not agree. That disagreement would be mainly a question of emphasis and I would like to push a few buttons.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of speech therapists, much more needs to be done. I raised on the Adjournment the case of a very devoted family with an autistic son. With great difficulty that family advanced that son's education and so on. A clinical psychologist's report was prepared in Stewart's Hospital but no speech therapy was available. This youth, for whom the world was beginning to open up, started sliding inexorably backwards. All kinds of bureaucratic reasons might be advanced but this child was a human reality left to fall between two stools. I hope something can be done in this case. The Minister was not able to be present for that Adjournment matter. It is in such matters that the Minister's energy needs to be brought into play to cut through the bureaucracy. There is bureaucracy in every Department. Sometimes visionary Ministers like Noel Browne in that Department and perhaps this Minister, if he lives up to his potential, can cut through the bureaucracy, secure funding and identify the human need. I hope he will live up to the kind of energy displayed in his speech.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, a gradual process. A Minister cannot wave a wand and immediately transform matters. However, there are matters of regret. Accessibility was mentioned in his speech. There was no wheelchair accessibility to this House until Brian Crowley was elected. Suddenly the crooked way was made straight and the narrow way was broadened because an elected representative was involved.</P>
    <P>On transport, provision is made in the budget for 150 new buses which are not wheelchair accessible. That is very regrettable. The Minister has given a commitment that this will not happen again and I hope it will not. It is tragic that we provide a public transport system yet buses are used from which citizens are disbarred. It is appalling.</P>
    <P>People from the Centre for Independent Living demonstrated outside the gates of Leinster House during the last session. It was extremely moving because they were full of good cheer. They did not get everything they wanted; they received a certain amount but I hope they will get more. The Minister said that the fund for the Centre for Independent Living is no more than a particular model for funding. It is the principal one, one which people with disabilities have selected. We <Col N="1403" /> must not fudge the figures but cough up the money to allow people the dignity of an independent life as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister indicated that £3.4 million is being allocated over the next two years to facilitate the introduction of escorts for special school services, harnesses and so on. Approximately two years ago I raised this issue as an Adjournment matter with the Minister for Education and Science. This is vitally important because children with special needs are vulnerable. To carry them on buses where safety is not addressed fully is abominable.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a couple of matters which, although not directly related to health, are part of the general debate. Senators received the brief from the Irish Wheelchair Association which cites what they see as broken promises from a series of Governments. They are not partisan. They are just saying that they asked, were promised and have not received. It seems like the Minister is beginning to deliver. I hope he continues in that vein and takes seriously the issues referred to here. I hope this was not just another rhetorical performance, the kind of performance of which he accused my colleague, Senator Ryan. The Irish Wheelchair Association made three central demands &ndash; day centres, respite and home support services. I hope there will be a significant move in this direction. People with disabilities often feel betrayed because they are promised services which are then taken away from them.</P>
    <P>I received literature during the week from a group called IntroArt &ndash; art services for and by people with disabilities. This may appear frivolous but I do not think this is so. Art, literature, painting and theatre enrich the human spirit and are part of living fully. This group received some funding from the Arts Council. In February they received £10,000 for funding a pilot magazine and that was the only element of their work that was funded. In February this funding was cut back to £4,600 &ndash; more than 50 per cent was slashed off it. Voluntary workers who were working for nothing were left stranded. This is what people with disabilities fear.</P>
    <P>There is a meanness in the bureaucracy and the Minister will need all his vitriol to cut through the greasy meanness of some minds. I recall seven or eight years ago raising the question of a man who was blind. He was clever, determined and intellectually ambitious. He received a scholarship to do a Ph.D. and the county council deducted the amount of his scholarship from his allowance. We managed to have it returned through an Adjournment debate and it was only because we embarrassed them and I received support from all sides of the House. This was a mean-spirited thing to do. I compliment the Minister on his speech and hope he will live up to all his promises.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a final point about FÁS. We should examine how these schemes are run. I <Col N="1404" /> know a person who has been emotionally and intellectually damaged by social conditions in this country. He has taken part in some of these disability schemes and worked with FÁS. He is a highly intelligent man but he has spent time in hospital suffering from depression. It is sometimes impossible to get out of or in to these schemes because of the bureaucracy. If one tries to push for a job for such a person, one is told they have only three months left of their European programme or whatever it is. Why can we not use the database which was spoken about to cut through this bureaucracy and release these people to a life free from depression?</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution which shows his understanding of the problems in this area and his commitment to solving them. Not only his commitment but that of the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, have been demonstrated over the past year. In seconding the amendment to the motion, it is important to realise, as the Minister stated, that dealing with the area of disabilities is not about throwing money at it. It is important to identify the real needs. That is the most encouraging aspect of the Minister's speech. This is being taken on board with the establishment of the National Disability Authority. Relatively small amounts of money can make a huge difference if they are directed at the right areas. This is the important aspect; it is not about throwing money at the problem. The real problems must be identified and the money directed towards those.</P>
      <P>One issue comes to mind regarding the provision by the Minister for Education and Science of an additional £3.4 million to facilitate the introduction of escorts on transport for special schools. This continues to be a problem for anyone in special schools, for the staff and for the transport provider. CIE has the contract for transporting people to these special schools but it is subcontracted to local people. Problems arise which cannot be dealt with for administrative reasons but which need to be solved. I refer to the requirement on carers on the buses to ensure passengers are cared for. The responsibility for this is the subject of argument between CIE and school principals. These matters should be sorted out because what is important is getting these children to school and back home safely. These are the real issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify matters regarding safety harnesses. The buses which transport children to special schools come under the primary sector and that means three children sit in two seats for adults. While special schools come under the primary sector, children attend them up to 18 years of age. They are fully grown adults. To have them three to a double seat in a bus is not safe. This is an issue which needs to be addressed. It is relatively minor but it must be focused upon and that is why the audit system to which the Minister referred is so important. It is <Col N="1405" /> necessary to identify where the problems are and to target resources at those areas.</P>
    <P>There is a greater need on the part of service providers to have an awareness of the problems of people with disabilities rather than paying lip service to them. I will not outline some of the problems which exist, but a great deal of lip service is paid to the problems of people with disabilities. One incident of concern happened in Carlow about two years ago. A new footpath was required at a junction in the town. The existing footpath was composed of slabs which were difficult for a person in a wheelchair to negotiate. It was changed, a different route was taken, tarmacadam was laid and wheelchairs could then use it, but only as far as a signpost placed in the middle of the path. That type of stupidity has to be seen to be believed. Anyone with common sense would say that this should not happen, yet people go ahead and do it. That is why it irritates me tremendously when I hear people paying lip service to the problems of people with disabilities. A little common sense and money in the right area will solve many problems.</P>
    <P>While there is care staff in special schools, there is a requirement in some schools for additional staff because in some cases care must be on a one to one basis. Some children in these schools have multiple disabilities and, while a ratio of 1: 3 or 1: 5 is normal for this area, it is difficult to make progress within such ratios where such children are involved.</P>
    <P>A danger exists for mainstream education at present regarding the pressure to maintain teacher numbers in schools. Some people need to attend special schools for a short period to bring them up to a certain level. Often it is only their self-confidence which needs to be dealt with. This must be handled carefully and should not be pushed in the manner it is being at present.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to the House. He is one Minister we see regularly and we thank him for that. He made an extensive speech and parts of it must be welcomed because he has taken positive action in certain areas and has ensured the provision of additional funding. Nevertheless, the problem is so complex and extensive that a great deal of work remains to be done and large areas remain to be addressed. That is the underlying concern of everyone. People with physical and mental handicaps and disabilities of various types are involved and they need to be attended to. Specific strategies must be adopted for the problems which arise, of which there are many.</P>

    <P>Why is there a need for so many advisory, review and implementation committees? Where is the common sense in many of these instances? One can see what is the problem and a common sense strategy should be adopted and implemented. There seems to be a large number of review groups, committees on committees and committees on a review group's proposals. Much of the funding set aside for this area is absorbed <Col N="1406" /> in this activity. There was a time when the Minister's predecessors would have taken the modh díreach and tackled a problem head on. Now we need advisers and people to give direction. These are common sense issues which can be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the National Disability Authority and hope its standards and codes of practice will be implemented, as has been agreed, in March 2000. The authority will be responsible for the research and development of standards and codes of practice for disability services and for monitoring and assisting service providers to ensure implementation of those standards and codes of practice. It will play a key role in advising and reporting to the Minister on disability issues. I hope the Department and health boards have sufficient information on these issues already and that they will be able to act upon them before the authority issues its reports and advice. While those reports and advice can be of assistance, surely the Department and the health boards are able to act on their own initiative.</P>
    <P>The authority will report on its findings and make recommendations to the Minister. One is always waiting for one group to examine the views of another before any action is taken. The Minister is an intelligent man who knows what the problems are. He does not need to wait for these gurus to come in and give him directions.</P>

      <P>We will be facing a budget in a few weeks' time. Thousands of people require the provision of new services or the improvement of existing services and that requires funding. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance owe the Minister for Health and Children a favour, especially after the nurses' dispute. If I were the Minister, I would ensure they deliver on that.</P>
      <P>About 26,000 people were registered on the database set up in 1996 and that figure has now increased to more than 28,000. Given that people's life expectancy will increase in the future, demands will become greater. It is important that a strategy is put in place to address those.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statements on residential care, giving priority to emergency cases, creating new residential places and increasing the overall level of respite care. I welcome the adoption of that strategy and hope the Minister will ensure funding is obtained to meet its objectives. The number of emergency cases throughout the country is quite high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carers of disabled people rarely, if ever, get breaks or holidays. I know a woman who took <Col N="1407" /> over the responsibility of looking after her disabled sister after her parents died. She has not had a holiday in over four years. There is no facility in place whereby she can get two weeks' holidays. Carers take on huge responsibilities and provide a service at a very low cost. They should be compensated for that and should be provided with the ancillary services which would make their jobs less stressful. Invariably, it is either the sisters or mothers of people with caring requirements who look after them. It is important to recognise that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of committees in the various health board areas and the ongoing reviews in the health boards. I hope those reviews will be completed in the near future and that the Department will act on the information obtained from them.</P>
    <P>The personal assistant service is very worthwhile and has been very successful where it has been implemented. However, the number of people who have access to the service is quite low. Local voluntary organisations more or less decide to whom priority will be given for this service. The scheme should be extended throughout the country as it would ease the difficulties faced by many people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done some good work, although he still has a monumental task ahead of him. I am sure he will present his case effectively and secure additional funding for the disabled between now and budget day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister who regularly attends the House for these debates. It has been his practice in the past to take away the views expressed in this House and put them to everyone's benefit. I do not think anyone in the House would disagree that there is a need for additional funding. The Minister said so and the Government has acknowledged it in the recently reviewed An Action Programme for the Millennium. The programme clearly outlines the Government's commitment to people with disabilities and the manner in which the Government will address areas of priority need. Those needs include the provision of substantial additional funds to address the shortfalls of which we are aware. Those of us who work in the sector deal with those shortfalls on an ongoing basis as part of budget deficits. The plan also refers to the provision of additional residential and day care facilities. I need not tell anyone who has read the budgetary submissions we have received <i>en route </i>to the Minister for Finance of the need which exists in that regard.</P>
      <P>Reading the motion before the House this evening, one might be led to believe that nothing has been done in this area when nothing could be further from the truth. A significant amount of additional funding has been provided, albeit on a gradual basis. We all know that Rome was not built in a day and we cannot expect things to happen overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The Government intends to enhance a range of services at home help level. More importantly, it has committed itself to the development of the disability strategy, underpinned by the National Disability Authority which is currently operating under an interim board. The board membership comprises people with disability, their parents and carers. This is one of the first opportunities afforded to people with disabilities to contribute to the way forward. I congratulate the Government in this regard. The authority will play a major part in the future and is probably already doing so.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the responsibilities which have been laid down for the authority in regard to research and development which will allow people with disabilities to set standards for themselves. People with disabilities should be charged with the responsibility of setting their own standards because they know exactly what their requirements are. The Government is also encouraging policies which support advocacy by and on behalf of people with disabilities as well as preparing a disability Bill, the heads of which are currently being drafted. I am delighted people with a disability are now in a position to advocate their own needs.</P>
    <P>Instead of condemning the Government we should be encouraging it to continue to do what it is doing and to enhance and improve the situation for people with disabilities. When I was trawling through information today I came across the statistic that out of a total of £42.357 million provided in 1997, 1998 and 1999 for the maintenance and development of physical and sensory disabilities £38.5 million was provided by this Government. We cannot fool ourselves. There will be an ongoing financial need. We will not solve this issue in the lifetime of the Government and we may not solve it during the lifetime of the next one. However, I am convinced that the Minister has fully committed himself to what Members and various agencies have said.</P>
    <P>I recently read an article &ndash; I think the author might be smiling at me as I speak &ndash; which said it was pay back time for people with disabilities. The article went on to say, &ldquo;People with disabilities and their families whose needs for support and an accessible service have not been addressed while the country worked its way back from the brink of disaster.&rdquo; This country has worked itself from the brink of disaster. We have done so under the good offices of this Government. We now find ourselves in a position where we can address these needs. We could not have contemplated what the Minister is contemplating five or six years ago because the money was not there. Unfortunately, as has always been the case, people who did not shout loud enough were left to one side. That is a fact of life and something we are addressing.</P>
    <P>Disability is a twofold problem because we have to deal with mental disability and physical and sensory disability. There has been an assessment of needs for the mentally handicapped <Col N="1409" /> which allows for any Government, irrespective of the Government of the day, to provide a decent plan setting out the need for services. Unfortunately, that has not been the case for the physical and sensory disability side. Statistics on the number of people with physical and sensory disability are not available. Averages are based on situations developing in other countries. It is stated that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 people with physical and sensory disability. If we use the average of 150,000 people then 50 per cent of the overall disabled population has a physical and sensory disability, on the basis that 10 per cent of the population is disabled.</P>
    <P>The Towards an Independent Future report highlighted the lack of reliable information on the number of people with physical and sensory disability and the service needs. It recommended the establishment of a database on the needs of people with this type of disability. Some time ago the Minister displayed his commitment to this issue when I asked him at short notice to visit an establishment that I am closely associated with. He looked at what we did and at the organisation's aspirations in certain areas. He then made a commitment to set in train a needs assessment, not just for that establishment but for similar establishments as well. I have no doubt that that has already taken place and I thank him for it. We need a database that will identify the needs of people and the way we need to attack the issue of disability, not just from a health financing side but from other aspects as well. People who are mobile in wheelchairs cannot access buildings, get transport to social functions and cannot educate themselves as a consequence of being unable to move around the city. As Senator Norris has said, Leinster House has been made wheelchair friendly for a specific reason. Another example is the City Hall buildings.</P>
    <P>The concept of dealing with people with disability, mental and otherwise, on a staged and structured basis must form part of the overall solution. I am confident that the Minister has grasped the nettle in relation to this issue &ndash; and I say that not in a party political way. I am equally confident that we can trust him to do what is right. As I work in this area and I am closely associated with it I look forward to arguing the toss with him on many occasions to come.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> This issue has been discussed many times in this House. I regret the language of motions in Private Members' time. It is not a matter of condemning or praising but of looking at the issues and how well they are being addressed. It is fair for a Government to accept that no matter what they do in this area it will not be enough because people will call for more. That is the nature of being in Government.</P>
    <P>I do not join in the condemnation of the Government on this issue but I share the view that not enough has happened, that we need, as a booming economy and a country that is creating wealth, to put more of a share of the wealth into this sector. Sharing is how we should approach this issue. One way we can deal with it is by putting figures on the problem. For instance, many years ago a Government gave a commitment that 3 per cent of all employment in the public sector would be available for the disabled. I cannot recall the hue of that Government but that is irrelevant. That commitment has never been fully discharged and I do not know who should be blamed. The private sector never matched that commitment. The private sector needs to recognise its lack of commitment and its need to be responsible in this area.</P>
    <P>As the general secretary of a teachers' union I know that it has always been a struggle to get recognition from Government of every aspect of the issue of physical and mental disability. It has taken 20 years for a Department of State to recognise autism. We have had the same difficulty through the years because there has always been a resistance and some people seem to know better than others. There needs to be more openness. The review group on special education made recommendations long before this Government came into office and there is a Government commitment to implement them. That commitment has still not been met, even though the Minister for Education and Science and his predecessor put forward that agenda. This is a classic example of two Governments giving a commitment but it still has not been discharged. This needs to be discharged and I hope we will see it through.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I do not have time to develop some major issues. First is the need for independence to stretch into the area of employment and further education. Very often education concludes at the primary sector, even though people may remain there until 17 or 18 years of age. There is no continuation beyond that in terms of further education. There is also the question of access of employment to which I have referred. The number of elderly people who need support is continually increasing due to advances in medicine. There is an increase too in the number of elderly parents who are reaching the end of their lives and are stretched to the point of not being able to sleep because they are wondering what will happen their Down's syndrome child who is a young adult and who has a life expectancy of maybe another 30 years after they are deceased. <Col N="1411" /> These are the issues I would like considered and on which there should be consensus on both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time but I disagree with his disagreement with the motion condemning the Government. We are condemning the Government and we make no bones about it. I am sure Senator O'Toole would be the first do the same if he was championing his sector and he would be very quick to condemn the Government if it was not giving them a fair crack of the Whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Senator O'Toole's sensitivities on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is important such issues are debated at this time because this is the critical time to bring them to the attention of the Government. The Estimates, the budget, the National Development Plan and a new social partnership, if it works out, will be introduced shortly. It is important to insist that this vulnerable section of the population is given its fair share when these issues are being decided. There is no reason that we cannot put in place a plan which encompasses the totality of needs in relation to the physically and mentally handicapped. That is how we should look at this matter. We should look at the audit of requirements and the timeframe in which we will deliver on them.</P>
      <P>The group protesting outside the Oireachtas includes people in wheelchairs and people who have various disabilities. It is a scandal. The Irish Wheelchair Association requires £32 million for urgently needed services. Some 1,273 people urgently require assistance with dressing, meals and personal care, 1,113 are prisoners in their own homes but for resource centres and 3,500 people are in urgent need of a break &ndash; residential respite. These are needs which must be addressed. It behoves us to ensure that we bring them to the Minister's attention and that we compel the Government to address them in a coherent and planned fashion. This is the time to do it because we may not have as good a budgetary situation again or the opportunity to plan to improve the quality of life for people in the most vulnerable section of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 12 months we imported 150 buses which were not wheelchair accessible. That is outrageous. The No. 3 bus, which the Minister mentioned, is wheelchair accessible but that is nothing to write home about. Recently, I dealt with a family which could not find a respite place for their son in this country. He will have to go to Northern Ireland or England to find respite care. How will that family visit him? What type of plan is that &ndash; sending somebody in need of considerable <Col N="1412" /> care away from their family? We do not have the necessary facilities here.</P>
    <P>I counted three motorised wheelchairs at the protest outside Leinster House last week, although there were hundreds of people in wheelchairs. The waiting list is so long for an electric or motorised wheelchair that it is not worth going on it. Consider how difficult it is to bring anybody into the House to witness this debate. There are no facilities. We have not even put our own house in order. There is a considerable number of issues to be addressed and the way to do it is in a planned fashion and the time to do it is now.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this issue. We are well aware of the problems for people with physical and intellectual disabilities. One could not disagree with anything which has been said but the language which is sometimes used by the Opposition parties becomes a little tiresome and hysterical &ndash; for example, when they say &ldquo;total failure to provide the essential services for people with physical and mental disabilities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the problems which exist but if one considers the Minister's foresight and vision for the future one could not accept there has been a total failure. Our amendment recognises there are problems. Nobody has said that we have solved the problems or that we have all the solutions but we recognise a need to further develop services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan that it is 20 years since this problem really manifested itself. The problem is that people with physical, sensory and intellectual have fallen behind in that time. During the past two years the Minister has been trying to catch up to deal with this anomaly which has existed for so long. One cannot solve such problems overnight. We should take on board what the Minister said. He has a definite vision for the future. There is a framework in place and the markers are down; it is a matter of moving forward. I have no doubt that given his persuasive ability we will see real inroads being made into this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for more residential services and more respite care. If an emergency admission to a unit with eight respite beds becomes resident for three or four weeks, three or four families cannot avail of respite care whereas an individual carer provides one week respite perhaps every six months. All one needs is one emergency admission for the system to break down and affect <Col N="1413" /> many families. I welcome what the Minister said on investment in residential and day care services. Everyone must recognise the developments which have taken place in the education system, particularly for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the special escort provisions for children going to school. Children travelling from rural areas to residential units in Dublin, for example, will also avail of that escort service as well as those attending school on a daily basis. The Minister has shown where he sees us going and, for the first time, we will see a real improvement in the lives of people with disabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Leonard for sharing her time and you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for your indulgence on a little extra time. I commend the Minister on what he said and am particularly heartened by his rights based approach to this problem because it is something about which I have argued for the past ten years. These are matters of rights and should not be looked on in any other way. I am also very encouraged by what he had to say about honesty because the days have long since gone when people with disabilities, whether sensory, mental or physical, can be codded about what is going on.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan's argument about the 4 per cent cap on spending is facile. There are two aspects to the request by the Irish Wheelchair Association &ndash; one is £16 million to make personal assistants, respite and recovery centres a reality for 4,000 people with significant physical disabilities. That has nothing to do with the 4 per cent figure which he quoted because it is on the capital and not on the current side, and the lid is on the current side. The £16 million to establish the cost of disability payment scheme to give people with physical disability a fair and equitable income to live on is well within the scope of the 4 per cent. It is also patently offensive to talk about the ideology of pain. Nobody inside or outside this House would subscribe to an ideology of pain. I do not and never have done since I became a Member. No Government of the last 20 years has a record of dealing with these problems that bears favourable scrutiny. I know the resources are there now and we look to the Minister and the Government to ensure that those resources are allocated fairly to people who have very little going for them and who need help. I am pleased that the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, which was published last week, deals with these matters and if I had time I would quote the review extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have corresponded with the Minister on the domiciliary allowance for children, a matter that has been raised in the Dáil by Deputy Lawlor and others. Children under two years do not qualify for this allowance, but I ask the Minister to look favourably on it, as it would cost £300,000 to £400,000 to address the matter. This anomaly is a huge hardship and we should be rid of it. When <Col N="1414" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, replied to Deputy Lawlor on 21 October he said departmental officials were discussing the possibility of funding being sourced in the Estimates for the year 2000 and I hope that is progressed.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his contribution. Access has been dealt with and I have had the Kildare Network of People with Disabilities and the Newbridge Access Group talk to members of Kildare County Council about these issues. Much more needs to be done with building regulations to ensure easy access to buildings and free movement for people with disabilities in our society on the same basis as other citizens, though that is outside the Minister's scope. I was in Wales over the weekend and in one car park with 200 spaces there were 12 to 14 spaces allocated to people with disabilities. One would not find a car park like that in Ireland and if one did one would find able bodied drivers parked there, which is an obscenity in itself.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked about appliances for people with disabilities and said that health boards are still experiencing difficulty in keeping up with the demand for aids and appliances. He went on to say he had no funds at his disposal. A Government with £6 billion in its kitty has no money at its disposal.

We do not need many studies, as the voluntary organisations that serve the handicapped know what they want and have spent ten years telling us. We do not need more studies. They have an immediate need for the money they know they can use well. Let us move through these matters very carefully.</P>
      <P>Of course things have been done. How could a Government with the present level of affluence not have done a lot? Is the Minister seriously saying I should congratulate him because, as the Government has a budget surplus between 1 and 3 per cent of gross domestic product, it is spending more money on services for the handicapped than a Government that had a deficit? It appears to be precisely that.</P>

That is three times what we need to meet the demands of those looking after the handicapped. The Government says it can afford that but it cannot afford providing basic services for people with physical and mental <Col N="1416" /> handicaps. That is ideological nonsense. It is driven not by reality or the needs of people but by an ideological belief in reducing taxes whatever happens. The second ideological issue is the determination that 4 per cent should be the cap on public expenditure, though that is a figure out of nowhere with no reason or empirical evidence for it. Why? Because it is nice and low and it causes pain. It will cause pain all across the public services and we will end up with the worst public services in Europe. They will be uncivilised because one cannot provide civilised public services with the level of public expenditure the Government seems determined to sustain into the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue I am raising is the future of the Irish Seal Sanctuary. This is one of those issues that is not earth shattering in any sense. This is something for which, in the good times, one would hope that a Government could find money. It would be very marginal in times of financial stringency, etc.</P>
      <P>The Irish Seal Sanctuary has operated for 14 years in Fingal, north County Dublin. I know of its operation and it is in my immediate area. I know the people involved, to whom I would have the highest commitment. I have no connection with it other than that. Over the past 14 years they have looked after more than 100 distressed seals, and they have done a lot more than that. They have developed procedures for seal handling and for veterinary care. They have been in the news many times and have created a new understanding of the needs in this area and have received much public support.</P>
      <P>They have the most basic of facilities &ndash; they really started from nothing. I give credit to Mr. Brendan Price, who was formerly working in the Zoo, and who is a qualified expert in the animal field. They started off working without the most basic facilities. They have a couple of mobile homes which have been transformed into mobile hospitals where they can deal with the seals. They have two overground pools filled with water for the seals. They have also two excavated areas, which are lined and waterproof, which they also use for the seals when they develop more and can cope with each other socially and in groups.</P>
      <P>This is all in the back garden of the home of Brendan and Mary Price in Tobergregan in Garristown. This country owes those people for their commitment. I would also like to put on record what they are trying to do, which is to develop this into something much bigger. To that end they have received a lot of support, support that should be recognised, from Fingal County Council, and in particular from Mr. Willie Soffe who is the Fingal County Manager. He has been extraordinarily supportive of them personally and by way of encouragement. Also Fingal County Council has given them financial support over the years, something which has been discussed by them on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of my proposal is that recently Fingal County Council very generously, and with great vision, made a new site in Donabate available to the Irish Seal Sanctuary, which is adjacent to the sea, in an absolutely appropriate place to develop <Col N="1420" /> a proper seal sanctuary. They now have the site and the expertise but they need the money to develop the site. Ireland is the only coastal European Union nation without a national seal sanctuary. I do not expect that to make national headlines tomorrow morning, but to put it in context, it would be seen as a responsible thing for a member of the European Community, particularly a seafaring and a fishing nation like ourselves, that we would show a certain consideration in this area and respond to it.</P>
    <P>The seal sanctuary has a coastal site of up to seven acres and the workers are available 24 hours a day. They are providing a service which will probably have to be provided by somebody, sometime, somewhere. If a basking shark is stranded, or if a seal comes ashore injured, somebody has to look after it. At the moment the people doing this are on 24 hour call and need support.</P>
    <P>To look after these mammals when they arrive &ndash; they may need veterinary care or other attention &ndash; would cost up to £2,000 a time. They are operating on a shoestring and they are making it work. I ask the Minister to put it to his colleague, Deputy McCreevy, that a small investment could be found in his budget to give these people support and to get this project off the ground. I am sure they will come calling again because these things never actually go away. We have talked in this House before about the importance of local government &ndash; the local authority is completely committed to this, is very supportive and has shown this by giving them a site.</P>
    <P>Could we take this to a national level? These people are fulfilling a national function. The Irish Seal Sanctuary is something we can be proud of. It has shown us to be a caring nation in many ways. I ask the Minister to suggest to his colleague in Government that, in the budget, money would be provided for the development of the seven acre site in Donabate which has been given by Fingal County Council to the Irish Seal Sanctuary so they can continue to provide an expanded and comprehensive service.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the Minister for Finance cannot be here this evening and he has asked me to come in his place. I listened attentively to Senator O'Toole and I note there were 40,000 visitors in its first full year to this significant attraction. There are many national monuments where it would be wished that there were 40,000 visitors a year.</P>
      <P>I join Senator O'Toole in congratulating those who have, in a voluntary capacity, sought to provide this necessary sanctuary for these sea animals when they require it. I do not question any of the commendations he has made on behalf of a project of which he has personal knowledge of its operation and the people managing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> The Minister for Finance would have me say that his Department does not provide funding directly to any organisation such as the Irish Seal Sanctuary but we are aware that requests for funding are considered by the relevant Department. At this time of the year the Minister for Finance receives an extraordinary number of pre-budget submissions from a broad spectrum of interests including public representatives, private companies, employer and trade union groups, other umbrella organisations representative of various interests and directly from members of the public. The majority of these relate to suggested amendments to the tax code and requests for the provision of funding for various organisations. In that regard the Minister for Finance states that he has already received correspondence in relation to the Irish Seal Sanctuary which, presumably, is consistent with the presentation Senator O'Toole has made.</P>
    <P>The submissions which have been received, including those on behalf of the Irish Seal Sanctuary, are being considered in the context of the preparations for his forthcoming budget and Members of the House will appreciate that for obvious reasons it is not the practice to divulge any of the detailed content of the budget in advance. For that reason he cannot give specific commitments on the provision of funding for any particular organisation prior to budget day. Although many of the requests for funding received each year at budget time are for deserving causes, he must point out that due to competing and increasing demands it is never possible to accede to every request. Ministers for Finance have always had to face this reality at budget time and this year will be no different.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator O'Toole and other Members of the House on behalf of the Minister that he has noted the case made on behalf of the Irish Seal Sanctuary. He will bear it in mind along with the many other requests he has received in the run-up to the forthcoming budget and we can only await in anticipation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for inviting the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, to establish a number of air services from Shannon to England and various European destinations. I understand that the initial invitation issued from the Minister and we appreciate that. Now that a proposal is before her and the Department we want them to seriously consider the proposals that have been presented by Ryanair.</P>
      <P>There has been much media coverage of this matter and the debate seems to have been conducted more in the media than in serious negotiations in the Department and between it and Ryanair. I suggest to the Minister that she would ensure that more discussions take place between the relevant parties to ensure that this proposal does not vanish. It is extremely important because, since the change in the status of Shannon as the sole transatlantic stop-over, there has been an evident decline in business relative to the expansion of other airports. Recent figures show that Shannon is not competing with the expansion rate of Dublin and Cork airports. Between 1996 and 1998 there was an increase of 28 per cent in traffic through Dublin airport and an increase of 17 per cent in traffic through Cork airport, we had only a 6 per cent increase in traffic through Shannon airport.</P>
      <P>Wherever Ryanair has located it has generated a dramatic increase in the traffic through that airport. This issue is not just about traffic through airports, it is also about getting people into the region of Clare, Limerick and the west. It is using low fares to get people to spend time as tourists in the west. It is extremely important because there has been a change &ndash; there are more American tourists spending time in Dublin and the trend has changed from the west to the east for American tourists. We are now in a position to generate traffic from Europe and England with low cost fares into Shannon to boost the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is a problem in Shannon that although there is a reasonable amount of flights to England and mainland Europe, there are not enough. We need to be competitive in the business sector. Many business people would like to set up business in the mid-west but find it impossible to get a proper air service out of Shannon. They must leave at a ridiculously early hour in the morning which is very unsuitable. Ryanair will offer five additional destinations, two to England &ndash; London and a regional destination &ndash; and three to mainland Europe. It has given a commitment that if it is allowed into Shannon and a deal is made it will make a ten year commitment to Shannon airport. It has agreed to use five airplanes from Shannon which may generate 150 <Col N="1423" /> direct jobs in Shannon airport. That is very welcome and, given the decline in traffic through the airport, extremely necessary. I appreciate that the Minister issued the invitation to the management of Ryanair to look at Shannon and to make a proposal to her.</P>
    <P>A number of allegations have been made by Aer Rianta and others. We are not interested in allegations or in conducting a debate in the media. We want the proposal examined closely and a deal hammered out in the Department because it is in the interest of regional development in the mid-west. It is important that factor is recognised. Allegations have been made by Ryanair and Aer Rianta about the £12 million for a terminal at Dublin airport. Last week at a joint Oireachtas committee meeting the chief executive of Ryanair said it would give £12 million to Aer Rianta to build a terminal at Dublin airport.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that it is wonderful, we are specifically interested in Shannon and in generating traffic there. The facilities are there &ndash; £40 million has been spent on a terminal there &ndash; and the infrastructure is in place but, unfortunately, it is under-utilised. Shannon has the capacity to deal with a greater number of people, while Dublin is over-stretched. There is a need to focus on regional development and on this particular issue, making a policy decision in relation to Ryanair and actively encouraging it into Shannon. I understand that the proposal is not contrary to EU legislation or regulations and legal advice has been taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Health and Children that he brings the message to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, that the people of Clare, the mid-west region and the west in general want to be able to travel in and out of this country as cheaply as people from the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>It is very expensive to travel out of Shannon compared with travelling out of Dublin and that is not acceptable, particularly considering we are an island nation on the periphery of the EU. It is important we have access to and from continental Europe at reasonable fares which are not prohibitive. It is also important for the future development of the country, for the opening of the minds of people and for inward investment into the region. Given the Minister's experience, I have every confidence he will convey this specifically to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. I thank him for his time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has experience of transport and will be very much aware of the problem at Shannon. When looking at the national development plan to be published next week, we will be asked to consider the whole concept of decentralisation since Dublin is dominating the economic and social life of the country. <Col N="1424" /> That is certainly true in regard to transport. I am sure there will be many ideas as to regional development and Shannon is of vital importance in that debate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn that we have attended various presentations where there has been a personality clash between strong-minded people, be they from Ryanair or Aer Rianta, and at the end of the day the issue is generally lost. Why are Ryanair competitors so worried about taking Michael O'Leary and Ryanair at their word and afraid to invite them to come into Shannon and see whether they can survive? I believe Ryanair can survive but we are hearing the negatives about its type of aircraft and that it is using Shannon to get its second terminal in Dublin, that we should not be so foolish as to think it is for the good of Shannon. If we were always to say that, we would have the same debate on how well it is doing in the UK. I do not know why Ryanair wants to come to Shannon, but I can only guess that since it is a profitable commercial body it can see the potential. The bottom line for Senator Taylor-Quinn, business people in the area, the people on the west coast and myself is competitiveness. If it survives well and good, but at least it should be given the chance to operate low-cost fares from the region for the economic good of the area. What are people afraid of?</P>
      <P>Let the Minister make the decision. Let it come in to see if it can be competitive. The bottom line is the passenger will benefit. I totally agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Taylor-Quinn and hope the matter will be resolved from a commercial viewpoint.</P>

      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to apologise for her inability to attend to reply to this Adjournment matter raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn and commented on also by Senator Jackman.</P>
      <P>Ryanair's proposal of recent months to open ten new routes to European destinations, five of which would be from Shannon, is in itself very welcome. The Minister has publicly welcomed the proposal on several occasions, as indeed has the chairman of Aer Rianta.</P>

    <P>This proposal comes at a time of unprecedented growth in passenger numbers and air services at Shannon. Ten new services have been introduced at Shannon in the past year alone. This is a clear indication of the successful and active promotion of Shannon Airport by Aer Rianta. These new routes and the positive passenger statistics flatly contradict the doom-laden claims that Shannon Airport is not growing. Only last month Virgin Express announced a Shannon to Brussels service starting in December, with connecting services to Berlin, Rome, Madrid and Barcelona. Aer Lingus commenced a Shannon/ <Col N="1425" /> Paris service last March. Additional transatlantic services were launched by Delta and Aer Lingus. Further transit traffic was secured from Pakistan International and Royal Jordanian. City Flyer Express started a flight to Gatwick in October, replacing the AB airlines service.</P>
    <P>This year alone the passenger numbers are expected to grow by more than 20 per cent, which is significantly greater than the growth which will be recorded at either Cork or Dublin Airports. Total passenger traffic at Shannon this year will be more than 2.2 million, up from 1.84 million last year. Over the past five years from 1993 to 1998 Shannon Airport has recorded a 40 per cent increase in transatlantic passengers. Cargo operations are also very buoyant with 73 per cent growth in the past five years in air freight traffic at the airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is strongly in favour of any proposal to further increase traffic at Shannon Airport. It has developed a marketing policy which is geared to provide very attractive incentives. Judging from the positive results in terms of new services at Shannon, these incentives are working. Aer Rianta has, in fact, been actively promoting its incentive package to Ryanair in a bid to encourage it to establish operations at Shannon. Both parties have held detailed discussions in recent times. What would those incentives mean for Ryanair's proposal to develop five new routes out of Shannon and to increase passenger growth by 750,000 within the next three years? Ryanair would pay no airport charges for the first three years in respect of either new routes or additional passengers on existing routes. Aer Rianta would then give a further 50 per cent discount on airport charges for the following two years. To assist with the start-up costs and advertising the route, Aer Rianta would also provide substantial marketing support to Ryanair. This is the same very generous incentive package which has been successful in attracting ten new air services to Shannon in the past year. Hopefully Ryanair will be persuaded of the value of Aer Rianta's marketing proposal.</P>
    <P>However, Ryanair's proposal for Shannon is not a stand alone one. It is linking it with a requirement that Ryanair be allowed to invest £12 million in facilities at Dublin Airport and that Ryanair obtain in return a low-cost charging arrangement of £1 per departing passenger for 20 years. Ryanair's proposal is, therefore, conditional on its being allowed finance new facilities at Dublin and securing low-cost charging arrangements in return.</P>
    <P>Much as she would welcome a return by Ryanair to Shannon Airport, the Minister for Public Enterprise has indicated that she would not be in favour of the provision of services out of Shannon being linked to the level of airport charges obtaining at Dublin Airport. The linkage of service provision at one airport to the charges <Col N="1426" /> applied at another smacks of special arrangements and special deals. The development of services out of Shannon and investment in facilities at Dublin are two distinct issues and should be considered separately on their merits.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has stated that, as a general principle, any proposal for an airline or other private funding of terminal facilities at Dublin Airport, even if it were structured on an equitable commercial basis between Aer Rianta and the airline concerned, could not be permitted exclusively for one airline. Indeed, it is her stated position that any such proposal would have to be on the basis of an open competitive tender process accessible to all interested parties to ensure fairness, transparency and value for money. An opportunity to conclude such a deal with Aer Rianta, or alternatively to get from Aer Rianta airport charges arrangements of equivalent effect, would have to be offered to all airlines.</P>
    <P>At its heart, the Ryanair proposal is about the level of airport charges. The Minister has made it clear that the best way of dealing with the economic regulation of Irish airports and, in particular, airport charges is by appointing an independent regulator. To that end, last July the Government approved the drafting of legislation to establish an independent regulator and that process is now well under way. Therefore, the next regulatory decision on any revised airport charges regime should be taken by the regulator as early as possible, rather than by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to the development of Shannon Airport and we intend that the airport should continue to expand and adapt to the needs of Irish business, industry and tourism.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the regulatory policy for transatlantic services at Shannon Airport owes its existence to the desire of successive Governments to promote balanced regional growth. Shannon Airport's commercial success is seen as a very important driver of the economy of the mid-west region. Aer Rianta shares the Government's commitment to Shannon Airport and to growing its business. This commitment is borne out by the extensive capital expenditure, amounting to more than £32 million, which was invested by Aer Rianta in Shannon Airport in the period 1990 to date to upgrade the facility.</P>
    <P>Construction totalling £40 million is currently under way to provide a new terminal building at Shannon to give capacity for 4.5 million passengers in the year 2000. This investment not only ensures that the airport is fully equipped to exploit new traffic opportunities to the benefit of the mid&ndash;west region, it also confirms Aer Rianta's commitment to and belief in the future success of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister and Aer Rianta have been very positive in their response to the <Col N="1427" /> Ryanair proposal for Shannon. Cabinet colleagues, of course, may have their own views and it may be that completion and presentation to the Government of the Warburg Dillon Read consultancy report on the strategic future of Aer Rianta over the next few weeks, or the Minister's considered recommendations to Government in due course arising from that report, could afford opportunities for the Government to consider any of these issues.</P>

      <P>We are aware of the War<Col N="1428" /> burg Dillon Read consultancy report which is awaited and we would not like to think that the Shannon proposals currently before the Minister will hinge on that particular matter. We appreciate that it is intended to have an open competitive tender process. We suggest to the Minister, as I am sure would Ryanair, that she goes ahead with that tender process to seek openness, transparency and value for money.</P>
