      <P>I have notice from Senator Chambers that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to outline efforts being made by Údarás na Gaeltachta given the proposed closure of Norsk Hydro Energy at Geesala, Bangor, Belmullet, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business, I express our sympathy to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and his wife, Mary, on the tragic loss of their baby son, Ruairí. Our hearts go out to them. To lose a child is every parent's nightmare. I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone in the House when I offer my deepest and heartfelt sympathy to them both.</P>
      <P>The Committee and Remaining Stages of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, which was to be taken today has been cancelled with the agreement of the leaders of the other parties in the House. The Order of Business for today is item 1, Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I join with the Leader in expressing our heartfelt sympathy to the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his wife, Mary, on the terrible tragedy which befell them last evening. As the Leader said, it is every parent's nightmare to lose a child in this way. All we can say is that our thoughts, sympathy and prayers are with them at this difficult time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader is right to cancel the education debate today. It would be unconscionable to proceed with it. We will co-operate with him in every <Col N="1438" /> way to ensure it receives a speedy and orderly passage at a later date.</P>
    <P>For the third day in succession the support of the House is with the Taoiseach and the negotiators in Hillsborough. I hope there will be a breakthrough for the second Good Friday in succession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is shocking news because the Minister was delighted at the birth of the baby just over a month ago. The birth was premature but everything seemed to be fine at the time, and he told me a few weeks later that his wife, Mary, was home from hospital and that they were looking forward to everything going well from there on. It is one of those crushing blows which we hope we never have to face. It puts things in sharp perspective. The Minister and I spent hours yesterday and the day before arguing and raising a range of difficulties and problems. Things which seemed important then do not seem so now. Both he and Mary have the support of everyone in the education sector. I can say on behalf of 40,000 teachers &ndash; my post-primary colleagues will forgive me for speaking for them on this occasion &ndash; and of the partners in education that they have our heartfelt sympathy and condolence. We hope we can show support for them. My heart goes out to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and condolence. It is a terrible tragedy for a family to lose a baby and our sympathy is with the Minister. It puts everything in perspective and we will co-operate with the legislation being dealt with at a later date.</P>
      <P>As this is the last sitting before Easter, I express our strong support for and good wishes to the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in their deliberations in Belfast to try to achieve another agreement. We are on the eve of Good Friday, and I hope their return to Hillsborough yesterday is an indication of a positive and a hopeful outcome today. I support what they are doing and hope we will hear good news over Easter.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will make a statement in the other House about the Sheedy case which I raised on the Order of Business yesterday. Will the Leader approach the Minister to see if he would find time to come to the Seanad to discuss the matter? The concerns regarding the case should be addressed to the satisfaction of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I offer my sincere condolences to the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his wife, Mary on this tragic loss. I find it very difficult to speak about such a matter. It puts our work into perspective. I hope he and Mary will be able to get through this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the Minister. I had the <Col N="1439" /> pleasure of spending an evening with him and his wife at a dinner in Cork and found them a most engaging and charming couple. It is always a tragedy when this kind of thing strikes and I know that our good wishes and prayers for him will strengthen him.</P>
      <P>I wish also to be associated with the continuing messages of goodwill being sent to the North of Ireland, to our representatives there and to people from all sections of the community. It looks tantalisingly hopeful at this stage. I hope this Easter we will have good news of a kind of resurrection of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I wish to add a sour note on a parochial matter about the city of Dublin. I am glad Senator Ryan is not here because I am sure he would reprimand me. We talk a lot in this House about the environment, our love of trees and so on and we have just had a festival where people have planted trees all over the place. I walked down O'Connell Street yesterday and I could not understand how approximately 14 mature, beautiful trees have been chopped down. It then struck me it was done because of the blasted millennium spike. Could the Leader, who I know is interested in the city of Dublin, although he is a country person, and is devoted to the northside, ascertain what is happening and why the trees in the centre of O'Connell Street have had to be devastated at this time of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say something in the hope that all our words will add to some kind of consolation and support to the Minister, Deputy Martin. It is very hard to find words but they are the only way we have to communicating our feelings and our thoughts. This is a very bitter blow to his family. I remember visiting his wife Mary in the Erinville Hospital after the baby was born and remarking how lovely was the child who was coming into a happy and good family.</P>
      <P>It is a cruel and bitter blow to that family, as it is to any family and to any parents who lose a child. It tears the heart out of everything and defies understanding. One of the most bitter things parents can do is to bury their child. I would like the Minister, Deputy Martin, to know he has all our support and sympathy on this occasion. I hope that will bring some comfort and consolation to him and his wife and their two lovely children who are very small and who will find it extremely difficult to comprehend how their little baby brother can be snatched away.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin and his wife Mary on the tragic loss of their baby and to be associated with the expressions of sympathy made by the leaders of the various groups on behalf of all the Members in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the Minister, <Col N="1440" /> Deputy Martin and his wife Mary. I also wish the talks in the North every success.</P>
      <P>I am confused as to when the new millennium will begin. Is it next year or the following year? I understand a decade always starts with the figure 1 and finishes with the figure 10, while a century starts with the figure 1 and finishes with the figure 100 and a millennium starts at 1 and finishes at 1000. We may, therefore, be a year too soon in celebrating the start of a new millennium.</P>
      <P>Has any progress been made on an issue I have raised on a couple of occasions regarding former Garda Superintendent William Geary? He was dismissed from the Garda Síochána in 1928 and is now living in America. He lived in my neighbouring parish. I have said before I believe an injustice was done in his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to join in the sincere expressions of sympathy&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, I am reluctant to interrupt you but the tradition is that on an occasion such as this the leaders of the groups speak on behalf of all their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to concur with what has been said. A request has been made to the Leader that consideration be given to monitoring the costs of the tribunals. While we all respect their independence, there is public disquiet regarding the fact that the first witness to one of the tribunals has been in the witness box for approximately three months. That has ominous implications for the taxpayer. Could the Leader find a mechanism whereby periodically the cost of the tribunals to date would be brought to the attention of the House? This might focus minds on expediting matters and in arriving at conclusions on the various issues before them.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Rory Kiely's request regarding William Geary. I met him in New York on St. Patrick's Day. Senator Jackman may also have met him. His forthrightness was impressive. It would be unusual for somebody to protest their innocence 70 years later unless there was good and proper grounds for it. I have taken the matter up with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I hope the House will lend its support to ensuring that a man of 100 years of age would be in a position to return to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Government to indicate its intentions regarding the exclusion of disadvantaged areas from Objective One status? This could result in a loss of income of up to 50 per cent to these areas over the period set out in Agenda 2000. Will he indicate if the Government intends to provide the necessary matching funding? I am sure he would agree that, in fairness and equity, the same rate of headage payments should apply to the different disadvantaged areas designated for Objective One status <Col N="1441" /> and those designated for Objective One in transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Finance to attend the House to debate the national plan? Perhaps he would then take on board the proposals made by Senators from various parts of the country. It is important that their local knowledge be considered, especially with regard to prioritising the requirements for areas designated for Objective One status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that An Post is an independent body, but will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to try to do something about the desecration of the pillar boxes around Dublin? I understood that only those grossly overused were being replaced. However, good ancient pillar boxes are being replaced by plastic ones which will doubtless be easily knocked down by vandals following which the old ones will have to be reinstated if they have not been destroyed.</P>
      <P>The street furniture of Dublin is very important. There is a sense of history in what is written on these old pillar boxes. For example, some of them contain the emblem of Queen Victoria painted green. It is a pity to see what is happening at present and I would be grateful if the Leader were to make representations to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Tá an díomá orm go pearsanta agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil díomá ar an chuid daoine eile freisin toisc an feachtas fógraíochta atá ar siúl ag muintir McDonalds i lathair na huaire agus dís beaga á dhéanamh ar Pheig Sayers. Is masla é seo ní amhain do Pheig Sayers ach dá chlann agus do gach duine sa tír seo go bhfuil suim acu ina gcultúir. Tá siúl agam go mbeidh an Seanadóir Ó Casaide in ann labhairt leis an Aire Ealaoíne faoi seo.</P>
      <P>I want the Leader of the House to express my disappointment to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands at the advertising campaign being conducted by McDonalds and the insult which it is giving not only to the late Peig Sayers but to her family and all who appreciate the artistic contribution which has been made to the life of this nation which has been acknowledged internationally. I can only suggest that it is the product of a sick mind. I ask the Leader to take up this matter with the Minister because no right thinking Irish person should accept what is happening in the name of McDonalds at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry about the official vandalism of street furniture which should be preserved. That is by the by because I indicated I wished to ask a question and I am aware that time is short. The Leader promised many debates. Will he give us a brief outline of which ones will take place after the Easter recess because he indicated he would take two in particular?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about the seriousness of the unemployment situation in the north Kerry region, in particular, after the recent announcement of the loss of 30 jobs at Stelrad in Listowel. This is the third such blow in the past two years in Listowel, where no employment has been created in the past 25 years. It is important at this time in the day of the Celtic tiger when Kerry is being removed from the Objective One region that something be done for the unemployment situation in the north Kerry region and, in particular, to find an alternative industry to replace the loss of these 30 jobs, which is been detrimental to that entire region. There should be a debate dedicated to the employment situation in the north Kerry region which is the biggest unemployment blackspot in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third time in 12 months, I ask for a debate on the Gaming and Lotteries Acts. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if a new Bill could be introduced to update the law. The law, which deals with lottery licences, gaming halls, etc., is antiquated. I believe that there is a huge loss to the Revenue and it would be worth the Government's while to look at the situation, review existing legislation and update it for the new millennium. It is totally outdated and unworkable. It is about time that this would be done. I hope the Leader would ask the Minister that such a Bill could be initiated in this House in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I asked for a debate on the report on the proposed privatisation of Aer Rianta and the Great Southern Hotels group. I believe the report is published although we have not received it yet, but I would like a debate on it in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government had discussions with other EU member states about a uniform response to the thousands of refugees who are exiting Kosovo? If the Government has not had such contact, I ask the Leader to request the Taoiseach to call a meeting of the European heads of Government to recognise that this is a European problem which deserves a European response on a humanitarian basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to produce legislation on Ireland's participation in the setting up of an international criminal court. We signed the protocols for this in Rome last July and Ireland was expected to be one of the first to introduce legislation because we have no baggage in these issues. We need the involvement of 60 countries to trigger it. A few months ago we enacted legislation to deal with war criminals in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda but, in the light of what we see taking place in the former Yugoslavia in Kosovo, this is important because the situation will yield up a number of people who ought to be brought before an international criminal court for crimes against humanity and international war crimes. It is important that this legislation be enacted in Ireland and that we would be one of the first 60 countries which would ensure that the court is put in place in good time. I hope that legislation will come before the House in the next session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loath to raise this issue, particularly in view of the events which are unfolding in Northern Ireland, where I hope by the end of this week solutions will be found. I want to raise an issue with the Leader which I raised last week because I feel that with the political system winding down for a number of weeks the issue might lose momentum. Will the Leader advise me of the up to date position on, or if he has spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about, the investigation into the murder of Ms Rosemary Nelson? I am concerned about the Hamill family and the loss of momentum in the civil case after the death of their son, Mr. Robert Hamill. I am particularly concerned about this issue due to the fact that there has been the case of Mr. Pat Finucane and the Law Society in Northern Ireland has refused to&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to hear it because I am concerned that with the political system closing down the thing might lose momentum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join the Leaders of the Opposition parties and others in sending our continued good wishes to the Taoiseach and his Ministers, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and his team, and all the leaders in the North. As Senator Costello said, we hope there will be a another Good Friday agreement to enhance the long awaited final conclusion of last year's Good Friday Agreement. I will pass on to the Minister the views of Senator Costello regarding the Sheedy case also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> Senator Norris called for various adjustments in O'Connell Street. Improvements are to take place there. I understand the Government is to spend £100 million on O'Connell Street and £130 million at the back of the Senator's residence at Summerhill. The Senator will be pleased to hear that massive badly needed developments are taking place in that area. That area is fortunate to have Senator Norris resident in it to keep these things highlighted in the public domain.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely and Senator Walsh spoke about Superintendent Geary. Yesterday I spoke with the Attorney General, who has looked at the file. He passed on his views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but, as we will all be aware, the Minister is occupied totally with the Northern Ireland talks. They are doing everything they can. There is a great deal of interests among Members of the Oireachtas, from the Taoiseach down, in this particular case. I would expect that there will be movement on the file as soon as the Minister returns to his Department after the Northern Ireland talks.</P>
    <P>I take on board the views of Senator Walsh regarding the cost of the tribunals and will pass them on to the Minister. Senator Coghlan stated his concern that his area in County Kerry will get matching funding. Given that the Clare-Kerry area is represented by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and many prominent politicians, with whom Senator Coghlan is extremely friendly&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;his concerns will not fall on deaf ears. He would not let that happen in any event.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox called for a debate on the national plan to convey Senators' views to the Minister and I will allocate time for that. I will convey Senator Henry's views on pillar boxes to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I will also convey the views of Senators Ó Murchú and Glynn on Peig Sayers and the McDonalds' campaign to the Minister as a matter of urgency. I will let Senator Ridge know on the first day after the recess the plan of action and progress to date on legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Dan Kiely raised his concerns about north County Kerry and the loss of jobs in the Listowel area, which can be included in the debate on the national plan. I will allocate time for discussion of any worthy proposals in this regard. In the past two years we have been generous in facilitating Senators' requests to discuss urgent matters related to their areas. Private Member's Business and Adjournment Matters also provide another opportunity for such matters to be aired. Senators should consider this when raising matters on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> Senator Donovan asked about updating the gaming and lottery licensing legislation. I will convey his views to the Minister and if he wants a debate after the Easter recess I will allocate time for it. Senator Jackman raised the report on the Great Southern Hotel Group, which I expect all Senators to have after the recess. I will convey Senator Taylor-Quinn's views on refugees from Kosovo and Senator Connor's views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Senator Bonner raised his concerns about the murder of Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill which I will convey to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I wish the staff of the House, the press, the ushers, the gardaí and Members a happy and holy Easter. I look forward to seeing everyone in two weeks, after their well-earned rest.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 19, to delete &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This amendment is straightforward. Are we in a position to legally change the title of Bord Telecom Éireann, the name of the company as stated in section 10(1)(b) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983? If a change is made an anomaly will be created as it will be a board and a limited company. This seems to be a contradiction in terms &ndash; either we drop the term &ldquo;bord&rdquo; or &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo;. Is the change to &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo; legally dubious? The company can issue shares, but nowhere in the 1996 Act is the company allowed to change its status to a p.l.c. Where will we stop? Is Bord Telecom Éireann p.l.c. the new name of the company or can it be changed again to Telecom Éireann or Éircom? What is intended by the Minister and is it proper to apply the term &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo; in present circumstances?</P>

    <P>Senator Costello's colleague, Deputy O'Shea, raised this matter on Committee and Report Stages in the other House, and we have made an effort to accommodate him.

However, we must follow the Attorney General's advice that the company should be called Bord Telecom Éireann <Col N="1446" /> p.l.c. It was registered as a public limited company on 20 December 1996, following the legislation introduced by the rainbow coalition Government. Once a company is registered as a p.l.c., it is obliged to use the term under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983. The deletion of p.l.c. would be in contravention of section 4 of that Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea said the name of the company should be Bord Telecom Éireann, as stated in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. He also said the company is exempted from using the term &ldquo;ltd.&rdquo; in its name under section 10(2) of the same Act. As regards his first point, immediately on the commencement of the IPO, section 10(1)(b) of the 1983 Act will be repealed. On his second point, the term &ldquo;ltd.&rdquo; refers to a private limited company, which Telecom Éireann was in 1983. However, in December 1996, the company was registered as a public limited company following the enactment of the legislation setting up the strategic partnership. The exemption in section 10(2) of the 1983 Act only refers to &ldquo;ltd.&rdquo; and does not cover the use of the term &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea also said that the name used in the recently published Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill is Bord Telecom Éireann. This follows a legal drafting convention, as it would be incorrect to pre-empt the outcome of the deliberations of the Oireachtas on this Bill. When and if this Bill is enacted, the reference in the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill will be amended on Committee Stage to Bord Telecom Éireann p.l.c.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked about Eircom, which is not included in this amendment. We had a discussion on that yesterday, as we also had in the other House when the matter was raised, and I told the Members of both Houses that Telecom Éireann remains as Telecom Éireann for the flotation. After that, apparently by board decision, the name will be changed to Eircom. It wanted to change the name to Eircom prior to the flotation but common sense prevailed. I explained this in detail yesterday.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann took a decision that it would change its name to Eircom but forgot to tell the main shareholder. Eventually, the company told the main shareholder and she did not like it very much &ndash; the same can be said for everyone in the country. Everyone thought it was a daft idea. I had a vision of the company saying it would sell Eircom shares although they would be Telecom shares, explaining how Eircom was Telecom etc. &ndash; extraordinary and unnecessary. The company is being floated as Telecom Éireann. I cannot have an input into the later designation.</P>

      <P>On the point about the registration of Telecom Éireann as a private limited company was Bord Telecom entitled to register as a limited company after 1996? There is nothing in the Act which appears to give it authority to do so. On what legal basis did it apply for limited <Col N="1447" /> status, why was it granted and under what circumstances? </P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister intervened with regard to Eircom. It would have been a messy situation to try to float Telecom Éireann had it become Eircom beforehand. What is wrong with the name Telecom Éireann? Telecommunications is the company's business. Eircell, which is in the business of mobile telephony does not have the same broad or strong international trading name. I do not know if any influence can be brought to bear on the title. It would be appropriate if the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Minister could give a direction with regard to its name to this major semi-State company, which is to be largely privatised and part-owned by the workers and which is being floated on the stock market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have no entitlement to give any directions once the company is floated. I have an entitlement now and have made my views known, as did others in various parties. The decision was taken in mid-December but I was not informed of it. The board has taken a decision that the name will change later.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, was to allow for the sale of shares in the company and to allow for there to be multiple shareholders. It was to allow for the strategic partners, KPN Telia. Implicit in this was that the company would be re-registered as a public limited company, which was done on 20 December 1996. That is noted in the records. They were entitled to do that.</P>
      <P>We did our utmost to establish if there was substance to Deputy O'Shea's point because he felt strongly about it. Having looked at the 1996 Act, the company's and the registration of the company, it was correct to re-register as a public limited company on 20 December 1996.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that but it was entitled under the Act to so register. Did it have a legal entitlement to seek registration?</P>
      <P>I presume that the new title, logo and so on will cost an enormous sum of money. To do this seems to be part and parcel of modern day trading, with a cost to the shareholders and prior to that, to the taxpayers. We can recall what happened in relation to Aer Lingus when it tried to get rid of the shamrock. What it sought to do was not impressive either. It seems strange and I am disappointed that Telecom Éireann should seek to change its name to Eircom, especially with the attendant charges to which it will give rise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cost the company a great deal of money but the board has taken that decision. I do not think they received with good grace my idea that it should not change for the flotation. I was worried on several fronts. First, how one could explain that Telecom Éireann had become Eircom and that it would be a good idea to buy Eircom shares because they used to be Telecom Éireann shares and so on. Second, it will be a public company at that stage and when one thinks of what is associated with Telecom Éireann &ndash; the logos, lorries, vans, headings, notepapers, kiosks and so on &ndash; the change of name will cost a substantial sum. However, it will be up to the company to decide what to do. Apparently, when the New York Stock Exchange was mentioned somebody said that Telecom Éireann could mean &ldquo;Telecom Iran&rdquo; and that Iran was a bad vibe. However, that was a dim conclusion.</P>
      <P>The advice of the Attorney General is that the main purpose of the 1996 Bill was to allow for a sale of shares. There would be multiple shareholders and, therefore, it would have to register as a public limited company. I can only give Members what seems to be common sense legal advice in the matter.</P>

      <P>I adverted yesterday to the Eircom proposal and the Minister quickly explained that the decision was deferred until after the flotation. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Costello. It is daft for a company which is so well known internationally to decide to change its name after flotation and, notwithstanding what the Minister said, that she will have no authority in that regard. The customers and consumers of Telecom Éireann will be looking more towards efficiency and greater productivity than snazzier titles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;Section  8(2) of the Act of 1996 is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (a) of the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(&ldquo;(aa)The Minister may not dispose of any shares in the company other than as pro<Col N="1449" /> vided for in subsection (3)(a) without the terms of such sale being laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The correction that Dáil Eireann should read &ldquo;both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo; is timely. I am reiterating a proposal from the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy S. Brennan, which he presented on Committee Stage of the 1996 Bill. I see no reason the Minister should not take on board what was proposed by her colleague at that time, that before any shares are disposed of, other than provided for in section 3(a), the terms of such sale should be laid before and approved by both Houses. That is a reasonable proposal. We are talking about the shares of a company that have risen from an initial £1 billion value to between £5 billion and £6 billion. The jewel in the crown of our semi-State companies is being privatised. However, not all the shares are to disappear in one fell swoop; there is a mix of shareholders including the private sector, employees and the State.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the level of State shareholding that will remain with the company. The Labour Party feels strongly that at least 25 per cent of the shareholding should remain with the State. I do not know if this was referred to by my colleague in the Lower House but that is my party's view. It is appropriate that we maintain a strong worker-director representation in the company and that the State has a significant say in the company's affairs. We will not accept anything below that figure.</P>
    <P>Before we dispose of more of the State's silverware, both Houses should be informed of the intention to sell, the quantity of shares to be sold and to whom they are to be sold. It is still substantially a State company and as such it would be appropriate that the approval of both Houses be sought in relation to the disposal of shares.</P>

      <P>The fact that Senator Costello omitted reference to Seanad Éireann does not matter. I am free to come before this House also. I accept Senator Norris's point that this debate is <Col N="1450" /> taking place in the Seanad. I do not think he was present for the Second Stage debate yesterday but his colleague, Senator Gallagher, who spoke very strongly on the matter was.</P>
      <P>The road to privatisation began with the Senator's colleague, Deputy Stagg, who pioneered the Bill through Dáil Éireann in 1996. I mention that not from any sense of retribution but to put the record straight. In so doing Deputy Stagg set in motion &ndash; I have proof of this &ndash; the process in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the Dáil record. Deputy Stagg steered this Bill through the Dáil to allow KPN Telia to become a strategic partner. Everybody knows that the next step is privatisation. Therefore, the idea that the Labour Party is to demand that the State maintain a 25 per cent shareholding is a little bit rich. I do not know what percentage the Cabinet will choose to float. That remains a matter for decision in April.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if Senator Costello is aware of this, but Deputy O'Shea won the day in that I gave my word that I would come to the Dáil and lay before it not the terms which would be completely incorrect and confidentially sensitive but the general principles of the sale. His amendment was altered on Fifth Stage to read &ldquo;. . . .  the general principles of the sale&rdquo; which he accepted. In turn, he agreed to speak to his colleague in the Seanad. I could not provide that I would disclose the terms of the sale because that would include confidential information. I would also come to the Seanad, if Senators wished, on the same day to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment. It is one of the most impractical pieces of Labour Party mumbo jumbo which I have come across for many years in this House. Do Senators Costello, Ryan and O'Meara understand what this means? It means that every time the Minister wishes to sell any of the remaining shares she must have every detail of that sale debated in the Dáil and Seanad. She would have to signal to the market that she wished to sell the shares at a certain price and the price, terms, vendor and buyer would then have to be discussed by both Houses. That is not how the market works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reluctant to approve the subsection in the Bill which states that the Minister has to spell out the general principles because that ties her hands to a certain extent. The idea that the State should be tied to holding a 25 per cent shareholding in the company is absurd. The Labour Party is harking back to former days, with one foot in and one foot out. It cannot make up its mind about privatisation. It told us a few years ago that there would be no sale of State assets. That was holy writ. It has now accepted the inevitable. I did not know it was Labour Party policy that we should hold onto 25 per cent of Telecom. It creates a <Col N="1451" /> false market for the shares because neither the Minister nor anybody else will sell these shares. The only value of these shares is in selling them. One will make a complete fool of oneself in market terms if you announce that such shares are of no value. The idea that we should debate each individual sale in the House is patently ridiculous. By the time we had done that the price of the shares could have halved or doubled. This is fairyland. I ask the Labour Party not to waste the House's time by coming forward with totally impractical suggestions. I reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is by no means a ridiculous amendment, it is very practical. Telecom Éireann is a State company which has attained its worth and status on the international and domestic market through hard work by its employees, the taxpayer and retired people. I cannot accept that we can simply dispose of a valuable asset without laying down some conditions. Why should we go from 100 per cent ownership to zero ownership in one fell swoop?</P>
      <P>It is important for us to retain some interest in what is probably the fastest expanding and most lucrative business area in the world, namely telecommunications. It has expanded dramatically in leaps and bounds. Senator Ross knows quite well, free marketeer that he is, that the value of Telecom Éireann has shot up by more than £1 billion each year since the original assessment of its value. That is a colossal increase in value. It is important for us to do what I am proposing, namely not to go below the 25 per cent shareholding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to the amendment. I am replying to what has been said about it. We should not go below that, which would enable us to keep two directors on the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the proceeds of the sale will be used for investment in infrastructure. We could get as much money for infrastructure, which is badly needed, by using State companies, which are being partly privatised and are entering into strategic alliances, as collateral. This is a very valuable asset and we should retain a significant involvement in it. That is part of the reason we should be able to monitor the sale of the shares.</P>
      <P>I am quite happy to accept the Minister's compromise whereby the Minister would provide for the general principles of the sale to be presented to both Houses.</P>

Can we <Col N="1452" /> not just get on with it? If we have to have this, please let it stay in the Dáil and spare us this affliction. I could not bear endless debates on the value of shares.</P>

      <P>I wish to return to the point raised by Senator Costello because I do not want to let it stand on the record. He said I was doing this in one fell swoop. In 1996 the Labour Party allowed the sale of 20 per cent plus an option of 15 per cent &ndash; which is to be decided upon any day now &ndash; a total of 35 per cent, to KPN Telia. That was the purpose of the legislation and it was done in one fell swoop. It is daft to talk, three years later, with rosy hued nostalgia because it has already been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>Thank you. Clearly, I am not tied, nor is any Government, to any notion that the Labour Party now has about a 25 per cent stake. The Cabinet will decide the matter on the basis of commercial realities, what is prevalent in the telecommunications market of the day and the likely outcome of the flotation but it will not make its decision on the basis that I want to keep my paws on Telecom, which I do not.</P>
      <P>I will not be talking to the House about the terms of any sale but will be laying out the timetable agenda and the general principles. It will be in the form of a statement followed by questions and answers.</P>
      <P>This Bill was passed with two agreed amendments. However, even if it were not, we are in a different world and we are not taking these actions for ideological reasons but based on plain common sense. They make sense for the consumer, which is the first consideration, and in terms of competitiveness, the proper running of companies and giving people a choice in their daily dealings with telephones and flights and, later, airport facilities and the ESB. It is better for the consumer and the employee. Telecom has surged ahead since we brought forward deregulation and is getting more business, as are the other companies. I am not infused with latter day ideological zeal for privatisation but, at this stage of my life, I am quite infused with common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we embark on this road &ndash; to make a backward reference to what happened last week &ndash; there are bound to be frissons, bumps, upsets and <Col N="1453" /> hiccups on the adventure road, as Senator O'Dowd called it yesterday. However, it is not possible to tackle Telecom Éireann and later Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and, perhaps, the ESB, and for everyone to be happy every after. That will not be the way. There will be people who will not feel happy ever after but it will all turn out for the best eventually.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;Section 10 of the Act of 1996 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (1) of the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(1A)In the event of the sale or transfer of shares in the company, the proportion of employee directors in relation to the <Col N="1455" /> total number of directors on the Board shall remain fixed at not less than the proportion of employee directors at the date of passing of this Act.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is an extension of amendment No. 3 in that it seeks to ensure that the &ldquo;number of employee directors shall not be reduced below 4&rdquo;. We want the Minister to come before the House in the event of the sale of shares to explain the general principles. We also want to ensure that a certain proportion of employee directors are accepted and recognised as being entitled to representation on the board, irrespective of the extent of the sale or transfer of shares in the company.</P>
    <P>It is part of the same principle that we should not divest ourselves of a say in the running of the company. I welcome the 14.9 per cent employee shareholding in the company. However, we should not allow representation on the board to drop to a level which is not effective. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as published provides for the removal of Telecom Éireann from the scope of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts. We can no longer have that obligation on the company because it will no longer be a State enterprise but a publicly quoted company. The implications of that are clear. The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act cannot apply to a publicly quoted private company. The issue of worker participation on the boards of State companies is one of the hiccups we must face.</P>
      <P>An ESOP director will be appointed once this Bill is passed. The Communications Workers Union and other unions have nominated Deputy Spring for the position. He cannot be appointed until this Bill is passed because an earlier section relating to Members of the Oireachtas being members of boards must be repealed. I welcomed his nomination because he is competent and professional and will be good on the board. I did not call it cronyism. I have the technical job of approving his nomination as an ESOP director.</P>
      <P>One cannot place the obligation of worker participation directors on what is no longer a State company. Mr. Peter Cassells and Mr. Dermot McCarthy, Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for partnership arrangements, are looking at this issue. Mr. Peter Cassells has written to me and he is speaking to Mr. Dermot McCarthy to see if there is a mechanism whereby someone whose thoughts are attuned to the general principles of workers and what they stand for can be nominated to the board. That issue is still being discussed by Mr. Peter Cassells on behalf of ICTU.</P>
      <P>The issue of worker participation on boards will apply to every semi-State company, including Aer Lingus. Whatever is decided in this case will apply generally.</P>

      <P>The Senator is saying it will be a them and us situation which is going back to the old days. We are talking about partnership, positive moves and all the &ldquo;P&rdquo; words which are supposed to be warm and evocative. Senator Costello is painting a picture of good workers and bad management. It is not, nor should it be, like that. Many of the companies are working very strongly at positive participation to try to avoid a situation where workers are in one corner and managers in the other. Such 'them and us' barriers should not exist. I do not understand the Senator's point about people being unable to get their views across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the general principles of the sale being laid before the Houses, will the Minister outline the form the promotional campaign will take? In the past 12 years the UK has initiated privatisation sales of state utilities and slogans and mascots are used in almost every case. I recall a ubiquitous individual called Sid popping up on television on a regular basis in relation to the sale of British Gas. The primary purpose of the exercise was to make the share flotation attractive to the general public.</P>
      <P>Ireland is generally conservative in terms of share ownership as we do not have a culture of that. Any surplus money is invested in banks and building societies. We are now in a low interest regime and putting money into fixed interest accounts in financial institutions is not the way to go if one wishes to maximise capital. In the US the public has tended to use shares, equities, stocks and bonds as savings vehicles and that trend seems to be catching on in Europe too. I would like to think it would be something which would be encouraged as a result of this flotation, which is the largest the country has experienced to date. The flotation represents an ideal opportunity to create a platform to inform people that while there is a certain risk element attached to investing in blue chip shares, it is a good thing to do.</P>
      <P>I am curious to know what kind of campaign the Minister envisages. Obviously, consultants and PR people will advise her in this regard. I do not wish to put her on the spot but I am sure that, as with all other details of this legislation, she has an intimate knowledge of what the consultants propose to do in the next two months. Will advertisements be placed in the newspapers or broadcast on television or will the campaign be an inventive one which will capture the public imagination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney's point is a very interesting one. The campaign will be a difficult one because we are not a shareholding nation and have, in the past, tended to put money into banks, <Col N="1458" /> building societies and so on. From what I have read, a massive and effective effort will be made to encourage everyone to consider investing some of their savings in Telecom shares. I gather that all subscribers will receive a letter to that effect and that certain incentives will be offered to induce people to purchase shares.</P>
      <P>I have very few criticisms of the flotation. The nonsense which we witnessed last week is totally irrelevant in terms of the flotation and has already been forgotten. Politicians on this side of the House attempted to damage the flotation last week. They behaved extremely irresponsibly and did not succeed. The flotation will be successful. The appointment of Mr. Ray MacSharry was a very fine one. He will be able to sell this flotation well. He has an international reputation, having been involved in the GATT talks and is well known in Europe and America. Mr. MacSharry is a man of superb ability and we are very lucky he was able to take Mr. Thompson's place. What happened last week was a political spat but it has nothing to do with the marketing of the flotation which will occur on the basis of the balance sheets, profits and figures.</P>
      <P>I have one criticism in regard to the costs and fees being paid in relation to the flotation. Provision has been made for expenditure of up to £40 million for fees. That is an excessive figure by any standards. Public relations people will receive almost £1 million for promoting the flotation. If the Minister visited New York, Japan and Europe a couple of times, she would do far better than any public relations people. The PR people persuade civil servants and politicians that they are necessary when they are not.</P>
      <P>I have experience of the flotation process and there is no magic or science attached to it. One does not need to be qualified in brain surgery, the process is based on common sense. One communicates the value of the shares to people and they make up their own minds. Marketing is a very simple business. I cannot for the life of me understand how the £40 million will be spent. If we ask the right questions and receive a breakdown of the figures, we would be amazed.</P>
      <P>Merchant bankers and other professional advisers in this country are ripping off the State in regard to this flotation. It may be that those who are operating behind the scenes in the Department feel they are inadequate to market the flotation. Professional expertise is too damned expensive. These people are ordinary people with a certain level of skill who charge far too much for their services and are happy to rip off the State because they get away with it. That has been a pattern in all flotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the importance of the Telecom privatisation being successful because of those which will follow it. A competitive tender was carried out and the correct procedures were followed completely. However, in future we must give serious consideration to the issue of costs. We should completely dispose of the nonsensical public relations people who make no valuable <Col N="1459" /> contribution. The Department could easily handle this matter on its own.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment on Report Stage in regard to share options. This flotation is likely to be extremely successful. It is likely to leave many small investors happy if well handled and small and large investors who will be very happy to hold on to their shares. The Minister stated it will be the third largest stock market capitalisation on the ISEQ, and I am sure she is right. It will be solid, blue chip, worth holding and safe. There will be a good story to tell, not only for the flotation but for the future.</P>
    <P>However there is one danger. This danger completely marred the flotation of Irish Permanent and overshadowed everything else to do with the Irish Permanent. The danger is the directors and management being allowed to write themselves lucrative share options to which they are not, by any moral code, justified. As I stated yesterday &ndash; and I am mentioning this as I have tabled an amendment for Report Stage &ndash; this was the one aspect which ruined the whole concept of privatisation in the UK and elsewhere. The media, rightly and fairly, seized on the privatisations and pointed to the number of people who became multi-millionaires because they happened to be sitting at the top of the pile when it happened and wrote themselves millions of pounds worth of options and then cashed them in a few months later. That is the one thing which the general public in the UK will remember about the privatisations. That is a great pity because they were very successful. They created a new shareholding public in the UK, which I hope we can create here whereby people own these utilities. They are happy to own them and have an alternative outlet for their savings.</P>
    <P>However, the executives of Telecom should not be allowed on day one to decide they will get 300,000 or 500,000 shares at the market issue price, which will probably then go to a premium, and I hope it will. These share options are free, they do not pay for them. If they are issued for the price of £1 the executives never pay the pound. They have an option to buy the shares for £1. If the share price increases by 10 per cent they can make £100,000 on £1 million on day one. That happened in the case of Irish Permanent. The amount of money made by executives there was a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The one thing which will be remembered about the short life in the public arena of the Irish Permanent shares is the amount made by the executives and directors. The one thing which will be remembered about privatisations in Britain when all else is forgotten is the scandal of what those people made. It is the one thing which will be remembered about the recent First Active flotation. The three directors there have already made hundreds of thousands of pounds on paper for doing nothing &ndash; and it is not related to performance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> The key thing about share options is that they are not related to performance. They are related to share price which is not necessarily related to profit. A situation could occur whereby Telecom Éireann is taken over &ndash; whether Senator Costello likes it or not &ndash; shortly after it comes on the market. If Telecom Éireann grants options to its executives, does not perform well and is then taken over as it is vulnerable to take-over when its performance is not good, the people who benefit most will be the executives who have not performed very well as the share price increases in the event of a take-over. That is the danger here and it is one of the great immoralities and injustices of the capitalist system and private enterprise. It does those of us who strongly and unapologetically support the enterprise, business and profit culture &ndash; after all, profit makes the business world go around &ndash; no good if we allow one or two people who are not even very good at making profit to reap millions of pounds. We will not only damage this flotation, we will damage Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, the ESB and all the others to come.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to consider inserting in the legislation &ndash; and I will not repeat this on Report Stage &ndash; a clause which forbids this happening for at least two years. The two years are necessary because the probability is that these shares will go to a premium. They almost have to go to a premium for it to be a success for political and other good reasons. If the executives are allowed to write themselves options at the issue price when we all know it will go to a premium, they receive an enormous preference over the ordinary punter who will be scaled down to a quarter of his size. The Minister should consider inserting this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross's speech illustrates the value of this House. It was a remarkable exercise in the incisive application of intellect to a complex problem which made it seem accessible to someone such as myself who has no economic training. I am proud to be a Member of this House when we get these kinds of contributions and the type of contribution we heard last night from Senator Glynn on the situation in mental hospitals. It is very refreshing and stimulating.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ross's point on lucrative share options. It is insufferable that these people should capitalise on their immediate advantage in respect of the position in which they coincidentally find themselves. This will stick in the craw of the public when they realise what is going on. It is unconscionable that they should abuse their position in this manner. After all, the company is currently in public ownership and they are digging their hands into the public till. I disapprove of it. Senator Ross gave an excellent analysis of why we should not approve of this.</P>

Senator Mooney raised this issue and spoke about the mascot of British Gas. I can think of a few more appropriate mascots but I will not sully the airwaves of this House with my suggestions. It is some comment on the intelligence of the British public that they needed to have zoo animals &ndash; I think it was a seal &ndash; in advertisements. Why do these childish tricks have to be employed to draw people's attention to the existence of a market?</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the flotation of the ESB. I am not too worried about the privatisation of Telecom and perhaps public transport, although I would have some reservations there. However we ought not to get completely carried away.</P>

      <P>No, I mean we as a House should not get carried away on this wave of privatisations. As a matter of principle I believe there are some utilities, such as electricity generation and water supply, which should be kept in public ownership because they are so vital to the welfare of the people. I would not support complete privatisation.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister's &ldquo;jizz&rdquo; levels have been restored. I was seriously concerned that they were dropping to dangerous levels. However she illustrated her comeback to life very clearly. I wonder what the transcriber will make of her wonderful gesture of flexing her muscles and exclaiming. It was terrific. I hope that with the benefit of computer graphics, we can insert an illustration to do justice to the Minister's colourful and invigorating performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also tabled an amendment on the distribution of share options. When I raised a few queries about the distribution of what appeared to be massive sums of money to the existing workforce in Telecom Éireann I was accused of begrudgery and people quoted the Bible to me, something I anticipated. The obvious parable was of the vineyard owner who hired labourers throughout the day, paying each of them, including the man who was hired at 11 o'clock, the same amount. At the end of the day when he was rebuked by a jealous and begrudging employee who worked the entire day and resented somebody who started at 11 o'clock getting the same wage, the owner said the labourer is worthy of his hire and that in any <Col N="1462" /> event he was the proprietor of the vineyard and could do what he liked with his money.</P>
    <P>I agree, but in the case of Telecom Éireann we are talking about our money and we have every right to monitor it. Indeed, we have a responsibility to monitor it and I am unrepentant in saying there seems to be an inequity in some whipper snapper who is only in the company for three months being given this enormous benefit while people on pension or on leave of absence get nothing. I have no personal interest in this regard. I listened to the executives of Telecom Éireann talking about the distribution of shares and how the workers were entitled to them as they had built up the company, given it its strength and made it so valuable. However, in terms of efficiency in this sector we are in the bottom 25 per cent in Europe. Therefore, I do not see why people should be rewarded for being about the worst in Europe. However, if we accept the argument of the company executives, then the distribution of shares should apply to those who contributed 30 or 40 years work to the company and I believe such people should be rewarded. I see no reason for excluding pensioners from this bonanza.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is a humane and charitable person and I ask her to examine the issue of requiring the company to make some provision for pensioners who built the company and whom I understand will receive nothing from the flotation. I also ask her to examine the case of people in other anomalous situations, including those on leave of absence, as an inequity seems to exist. As my Fianna Fáil colleagues would say, in fairness, those who worked all their lives in the company and who are now pensioners should be allowed reap some reward from this very generous settlement. I have tabled an amendment on this matter for Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate is taking a very interesting turn in some respects. The issues which have been raised are very important. We want people to be motivated not just by profit but by the philosophy of those who founded the State and who worked for many years to make these companies great. Those who founded the State gave everything they had. Last night I spoke to a man whose father fought in the Old IRA and then joined the Garda Síochána. The man made the point that his father refused the pension as he genuinely felt the State needed the money more than he did. Many people made great sacrifices in the setting up of the State and in bringing it to this stage of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one sense we are transferring ownership to those people who worked with goodwill and energy in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and Telecom Éireann, and to their successors, through the provision of shares. We are also transferring ownership to the ordinary people of the State whom we hope will buy shares. It is about much more than profit. We are trying to cultivate a philosophy by giving owner<Col N="1463" /> ship back to the people and rewarding them in the broadest possible way for the sacrifices they made. Our parents, many of whom had no cars, put us through school if they were able, and the philosophy underpinning this, based on community, sharing, partaking and belonging, is missing in our modern, dynamic State. If the flotation is directed at the ordinary consumer then it is good.</P>
    <P>Through this flotation, the first of many, we are trying in many respects to change our country. It is very important that the flotation is transparent and that the fees referred to by Senator Ross are openly available to the public. For some months I have been trying, under the Freedom of Information Act, to acquire information in relation to these fees and the amounts people are being paid for carrying out this work. As Senator Ross said, I totally accept the commitment that the work has been done properly, but I would like the system to be more transparent and open.</P>
    <P>Senators do not have the facility to ask parliamentary questions, etc. Therefore, I have used the Freedom of Information Act to discover the fees of these people, who have without question been properly selected according to proper procedures. In response I received a six page letter from the Department of Public Enterprise outlining why it cannot provide such information. The provision of information would not put the flotation at risk in any respect and such reasoning does not in any way justify the reply I received. The fees paid to the companies which have been successfully selected ought to be published. We do not want to know about those who were not successful or about business plans or strategies. We just want to know how much the companies are being paid and it is proper that we should have that information. I have now appealed to the information commissioner, following an internal review of the Department's decision. I would like to see much greater transparency and openness in terms of these facts.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to shares which the executive directors and the chief executive may receive from the flotation. I raised this issue during yesterday's debate and no doubt the Minister will provide the information when she receives it. It is important that the House sets down a marker that this information be made available so that we are in a position to discuss it. We are seeking the information in the context of the public's right to know. Yesterday's debate was very positive and I wish to continue that approach. It is important that the public has this information as it will contribute to the perception of the launch of this IPO. It is also important in the context of future flotations.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this section is valuable and it is at the heart of the privatisation debate. We have found that privatisation is not an altruism or a cosy caring sector we are embarking upon. It is a ruthless sector and its only principle is profit. In that context managers and directors will be looking for a killing.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason for Senator Ross to wring his hands because it has always been like that. Privatisation in the UK gave it a bad name but that was part and parcel of the way that its business was carried out. The vultures who hover around &ndash; advisers, public relations people, etc. &ndash; are part of the process and they will take advantage.</P>
      <P>We must remember that our semi-State sector is 100 per cent owned by the public. We, as public representatives, have a responsibility to ensure that we get the best deal possible, establish criteria under which any flotation will take place and prevent vultures from making a killing.</P>
      <P>The sum of £40 million has been provided for investment advice fees and £1 million on public relations and an incredible amount of share options will be allocated free of charge. Why should we go down that road? Why not develop a separate flotation model? If the Minister and we as public representatives are going along with legislation that will divest the public of the ownership of so many semi-State companies &ndash; this is just one but it is the biggest &ndash; then why can we not put together a model whereby we could avoid all these undesirable practices? There has been no response to date that would protect the public purse and the taxpayer who built up those companies.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris. It seems very narrow to be giving a substantial tranche of shares to the present employees. The company did not suddenly reach this stage of value just by using the present cohort of employees. Over the decades many pensioners gave a lot of attention and hard work, as will the future workforce. I agree with Senator O'Dowd when he asked for recognition for part-time staff.</P>
      <P>With regard to this section, the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, will be very disappointed that his recommendations and amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, in the 1996 Bill which we took on board are not acceptable. My party wholeheartedly supported him then and we are supporting him now.</P>

      <P>The debate over the past two days has been very good. The 12 speakers who contributed yesterday were knowledgeable, interesting and discursive on some points and had different viewpoints on this topic. This all makes for good debate.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Ross who raised the issue of fat cats, we talked about it yesterday when we discussed the privatisation of utilities in the UK and how they were mired by the resultant very large amounts of money which well positioned people were able to take out of such a flotation. Then the Senator went on to refer to the Irish Permanent and what happened here. That is morally incorrect behaviour for any person to engage in, particularly people who might have an inside track because of their positions. No management incentives, including share options, will be provided in advance of the IPO. I have already expressed this view and I will continue to do so. I will not have control over what happens after the flotation but a board will. No management incentives, including share options, will be provided before the flotation.</P>

It is morally incorrect that anyone who is perceived to be in a position of privilege should have the chance to leap in, so to speak, before a flotation. This will not happen here.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the advertising campaign of Bid and Sid in the UK in relation to the sale of British Gas. This leads to the question of fees for the main advisers. Up to £40 million was mentioned in the Estimates last December. I got a frenzied note that evening asking me to say nothing about the £40 million, even though it was written in the Estimates. This was daft given that the £40 million was mentioned in the Estimates. I have been advised that the fees charged by Merrill Lynch, AIB Capital Markets, and all the ancillary advisory groups to them, are modest. I do not have any other experience of selling shares.</P>

      <P>I believe that international precedents for costs associated with flotation have been between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent of <Col N="1467" /> the total process. Our costs will be less than that figure.</P>
      <P>This process will involve registration forms in every post office and registering of interests in the banks, etc. I will not be taking part in any of this, except for the initial launch. There will be massive billboards stating, &ldquo;It is a good idea to buy Telecom&rdquo;. Therefore, many people will probably decide to buy shares in Telecom because they have a little more money now, enough to believe they can afford to buy shares in Telecom. I would like to see ordinary citizens purchasing the shares.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Dowd and Ross said yesterday that we are not a shareholding nation. How could we be a shareholding nation. We have come from the Gregory clause and the quarter acre to being in a position to purchase shares in Telecom. Therefore, the inculcation of share ownership is new and it should be a good experience but in order for it to be a good experience, it must be extensively advertised. I am precluded, by the nature of my position, from discussing issues regarding Telecom. Despite the fact that the Taoiseach said we must not write books about our time in Government, I intend to write a book about Telecom. I am writing about Telecom at the moment while the subject in fresh in my mind. In order for my job to be successful, it would not be wise for me to speak on certain matters. What I feel about advisers is well known in the Department.</P>
      <P>There will be many costs involved in setting up the sales office, including media costs and so on. The investors I have met seem to be decent people. I do not have a quarrel individually with them; I have a problem with the concept. However, I accept this is new to me. I accept also that people who are much more learned than I on these matters have spoken and written about them; this is part of the debate.</P>
      <P>Public water was mentioned. I will not discuss this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we will not follow England. Electricity is open to competition from next February. This was a fine measure introduced by the previous Government when it signed the European directive. It will open at 28 per cent and will no longer be a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On pensioners and ex-employees of Telecom, I met with representatives of the pensioners last February and had a long conservation with them. I have sympathy with their point of view. The arrangement entered into with the union coalition is agreed and signed and will become law in the near future. These people were civil servants and forfeited entitlement to their pension of 5.3 per cent. They also forfeited their annual bonus and borrowed £95 million from a financial house which will take ten years to repay. This has not been reflected in media reports. First, 5 per cent was agreed by the previous Government for <Col N="1468" /> changes in work practices. Second, 9.9 per cent was purchased and £95 million of a loan was raised by each current employee. This will take ten years to pay back. This has been lost sight of in the general debate. One would have a general feeling of <i>sympathico</i> with those who built up the company. These people have surrendered their 5.3 per cent public service pension. I presume that those who retired receive their pension, to which they are entitled. It would not be possible to change this unilaterally because the arrangement is signed with the union coalition. These people have borrowed the money and will be paying it back when the flotation commences. We are considering special arrangements whereby pensioners will be assured they can purchase shares. I do not know if the flotation will be over-subscribed or by how much, but if it is, it will be ensured they will have a right purchase if they so wish. I am sure there is a general feeling that it reflects well that they would be able to do so.</P>
    <P>The agreement entered into between the company and the union coalition comprises a 5 per cent shareholding for changes and a 9.9 per cent shareholding purchased by surrendering pension rights and bonus entitlements and obtaining a loan of £95 million which will take ten years to repay before workers will see any return. The arrangement has been agreed between the company and the unions and both have signed up to it. I do not have a right to alter that arrangement, no matter how much I sympathise with any points of view expressed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. With regard to the share flotation, the largest one in recent times was Norwich Union, notwithstanding the First Active flotation in which the company changed its name from First National to First Active. The Norwich Union share flotation seemed to capture people's imaginations. It was the first time I became aware of a broad interest on the part of the public. The system operates in a graded manner whereby one can apply for a certain number of shares up to a maximum hold<Col N="1469" /> ing. However, there is no guarantee one will receive the maximum holding if one applies for it, mainly because, in practice, such flotations are severely oversubscribed &ndash; the ratio of oversubscription in the case of Norwich Union was about 3:1 or 4:1.</P>
      <P>A significant number of people who had never been involved in shareholding before became caught up in the frenetic activity surrounding the advance notice of the flotation and borrowed significant sums of money from their banks or building societies. The cost of a maximum holding for Norwich Union shares last June was £112,000. This was the amount of money a person was obliged to submit along with their application in advance of the share flotation based on the share price agreed at the time. There were several stories in the financial sections of newspapers at the time about this. Banks acknowledged that there had been significant borrowing activity in advance of the flotation.</P>
      <P>I declare an interest &ndash; I own Norwich Union shares. I know about this process because I went through it. I first received free shares because I have a pension plan with Norwich Union. Many people have received free shares, such as those who had mortgages in the First National Building Society and deposit holders in the Irish Permanent. This is not unprecedented. However, the fact I received free shares stimulated me to obtain more. The greed factor came into play.</P>
      <P>I discussed this question with a number of banks and the amount of money required to gain the maximum number of shares was £112,000. There was no question of a person who submitted that amount of money receiving that number of shares because the flotation was oversubscribed. Consequently, they received less shares than that for which they had applied and they were then in debt to the banks for £112,000.</P>
      <P>Norwich Union, not deliberately but because of the sheer volume of administration, held on to the balance of the money for some considerable time afterwards. It was at least a month or two before people received a refund of the balance and the shares they had bought. People had obtained bridging loans from banks for two to three months at the prevailing rate of interest, submitted their £112,000 but only received about £5,000 to £6,000 worth of shares, and found that Norwich Union held on to the remainder of the money which belonged to the bank. This meant they not only had to await the return of the cheque for a month or two months but also had to pay the interest due on the original loan figure of £112,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly advise in advance of the flotation that the Minister tries to minimise the grading system to spread the ownership of shares across the widest possible section of the population. If it means the highest number of shares people will receive is 250 or 300, at least people will know in <Col N="1470" /> advance and will not get themselves into debt with banks and building societies. I am sure the Minister and the Government do not wish to encourage that level of borrowing. There is a risk element involved for a start and it commits people, who in many cases can ill-afford it but who are driven by nothing else other than greed and are carried along by the excitement of the flotation, to borrow more money than is necessary. Experience has shown that no matter how much money a person borrows or how much they apply for at the top end, they will not receive the shares they applied for because of oversubscription.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a mechanism can be found by which it will become apparent to people in advance of the flotation that there is no need for them to borrow significant sums of money and that, if they apply for a certain number of shares, they have a reasonable chance of obtaining a high proportion of those. I will not state it otherwise because I appreciate the Minister cannot know until the shares are available how many people will apply. However, evidence indicates this flotation will be greatly oversubscribed.</P>

I am glad to hear from what the Minister said that, given the investment they made in the company during their lifetime and since via various ways, such as pension funds, they will be in a position to apply for these shares.

      <P>A very important point has been raised by Senator Mooney although it may not be within the remit of the Minister. We should look at the practice of stockbrokers in unjustly holding on to the money paid in over-subscription. It is very wrong. It is obvious what they do with it. The ordinary citizen borrows from the bank, the stockbrokers then deposit or invest it where they get interest. We are paying for that.

      <P>Given that the shares for Norwich Union were so heavily over-subscribed, and I agree with Senator Mooney's views on the way this was handled, is there is a need for such a flambuoyant and extensive PR campaign of the kind envisaged by the Minister? At this stage there is hardly anybody in the country who does not know that Telecom Éireann is to be floated and the shares will be good value. They will be over-subscribed without any PR campaign.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minster's indication that she will ring-fence a certain number of shares for purchase by those who have contributed to the development of the company over the years. Given that there are existing shareholders, including employees and prospective investors, why is the Minister left with the cost of the sale of the remaining shares of the company? What is the expenditure involved? Is PR advice on the sale necessary?</P>

I thank the Minister for giving us that important vital commitment for the future. It will do no end of good to the goodwill of the smaller shareholders in the Telecom Éireann floatation because if these options had been granted, it would have had the effect of diluting the smaller shareholders. People say it would not cost anybody anything but it would cost them something because it issues more shares and dilutes the whole issue. I congratulate the Minister and I thank her.

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ac)That in any distribution of shares to the existing workforce of Telecom Éireann, a similar and equitable arrangement shall be made on a proportionate basis for pensioners and retired workers of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be tedious about this. I made the argument on the section on Committee Stage. The Minister said that she cannot change the arrangement which has been agreed by the trade unions <Col N="1475" /> but I do not see why not. After all, this is legislation &ndash; we can legislate any way we like. We can say to the trade unions that they must look at this again. Perhaps I am wrong, but I still say it is inequitable and unjust. If the trade union representatives considered only those people directly and currently in employment, then they are letting down their pensioners and the other marginalised workers about whom I spoke and are in dereliction of their duty. We, as legislators, ought to do whatever we can. If there is the possibility of ministerial movement, then we should take action on this point. Senator Ross made some valuable points in an aside to me. I am not sure if he wants to put them on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I fully support the idea of equity in the distribution of these shares to pensioners, who obviously played as large, or a larger, part in the building up of Telecom Éireann. Some of them would have given 30 or 40 years service and would be out of the loop whereas other people who are just in the company for a year would be in the loop. That seems unfair because, as I said on Second Stage, these shares are an extraordinarily generous donation to the workforce. They are unprecedented and far too much from a company which has been inefficient and over-manned for too long.</P>
      <P>I want to finish in time to allow the Minister to reply. The Minister may be able to answer the following question. I understand that the deal with the Telecom Éireann workers was made at a time when the valuation put on the company was £2 billion. The present valuation of the company is £5.5 billion. The deal was made on an assumption of a certain degree of generosity but that degree of generosity is now multiplied. Should it not be revised on that basis and on that basis alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for withdrawing amendments Nos. 1 and 2. I can understand the feeling of a sense of equity because no doubt those who retired contributed in a major way to the build up of the company, but they have their pensions. It is right that they have them. The current employees gave up their pensions and an actuarial value was placed on their Civil Service pension. They will never receive it because they have given up their contribution to it.</P>
      <P>Second, they borrowed £95 million, which will take between seven and ten years to pay back, so they cannot get any of the 9.9 per cent of the shares until they have paid it back. The pensioners did not borrow to purchase part of the 14.9 per cent. In addition, they have the pension, the annual bonus, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial arrangement was entered into and signed by Telecom Éireann and the trade union group. I cannot change that in any way, but last February I met the pensioners' group and I, like others here, was troubled about the sense of history, as it were. The advisers and the Depart<Col N="1476" /> ment of Finance and my Department are working on an arrangement whereby the current pensioners will be entitled as of right to purchase shares so that if the issue is over subscribed and people's shares are cut back or they do not get them, the pensioners right to purchase shares will not be curtailed by numbers, market forces or the fact that the previous shares have been purchased.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross asked if we might revisit the valuation of the company as it appears to have increased considerably. I would also put the case of KPN-Telia. Although there is a clawback, they purchased at what would be seen now as highly favourable terms. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have no ideological hang-up about worker participation. I welcome worker participation in an enterprise as it means motivation and interest. I wish people would recognise that 14.9 per cent was not handed out &ndash; 9.9 per cent was purchased and 5 per cent was for change.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is waiting to take over, I pay tribute to this House for facilitating such an interesting debate. Giving people the chance to purchase share incentives is a huge issue. We have freely aired and debated the matter and made firm decisions. The debate was robust, interesting and related to the matter in hand. We are embarking on a big adventure, which is the first of many, not from an ideological point of view but from a practical one in the interests of competition and the consumer. We can no longer erect high walls around us.</P>
    <P>Sean Lemass set up a factory in Athlone called General Textiles Limited to give people jobs in a highly protectionist environment. My father and mother, who was pregnant with me, and three children went to Athlone. For over 20 years 1,000 people were employed in the factory; we lived in a house in the middle of the factory &ndash; the hooters sounded every eight hours and everyone went to work. The work involved looms, bleaching, dyeing, finishing and spinning and provided good employment; it laid the basis for the industrial town Athlone is today. I grew up to the sound of hooters, playing among the looms, at one with the workers. The factory had high walls around it; it was a protected industry providing paid jobs.</P>
    <P>However, tyrelene and synthetics arrived and cotton went out of fashion &ndash; if only it had lasted the pace because it is in fashion again. Seán Lemass began to take down the walls of protectionism and we learned a sharp lesson; one cannot live in a protected environment forever. I have experienced that and I can empathise with workers, with their concerns and their way of life. My father was a civil servant who was plucked from the Revenue Commissioners to go to Athlone; he never came back.</P>
    <P>Protectionism does not work, which is why I introduced deregulation. It was a daft notion that telecommunications could be protected. However, it is difficult for people to move from a monopoly to a free market. It is difficult to <Col N="1477" /> change mind sets and to work with companies, workers, the market and the political reality and then combine all those with European directives, legislation, strategic partnership and possible privatisation. It is a monstrous task but I am not overawed.</P>
    <P>I thank my officials who accompanied me here and in the other House. They have done tremendous work in this adventure &ndash; a good description by Senator O'Dowd which I will continue to use. A great deal more work remains to be done. I thank the Cathaoirleach and his colleagues for this good debate. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will come in now as I cannot talk from two places, no matter how bright I think I am.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister cannot change it; we can change what we like by legislating for it. This is legislation which takes superiority over any in-house agreement between unions. We can legislate in any way we please. I will press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already knew the facts the Minister put on the record. She has a right to do so and she did, clearly and firmly. However, there is another way of approaching these facts. For example, Senator Ross indicated that the value of these shares have increased by a factor of two and a half. The Minister may say that this has happened with other flotations, which it has. However, it negates the <Col N="1478" /> argument that pensioners are not being discriminated against; of course they are. An enormously more generous provision is made for the existing workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the unions borrowed £95 million. They will apply that money to the purchase of shares, on which dividends will accrue. As Senator Ross, who is intimately acquainted with this matter, pointed out, it is quite likely this debt will be paid off from the dividends accruing. It will not necessarily cost them very much, if anything. It is a gift. The money borrowed will be applied to the purchase of shares &ndash; the shares yield dividends which are then applied to the repayments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. The Minister should not try to break my heart by saying they had to borrow this huge amount of money, as if they were paying interest. They are using the dividend yield to pay back the loan. Pensioners are still disadvantaged. I will press this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's presence in the House was a pleasure. She brightened up what is a bright and sunny day outside; however, inside it was showing signs of becoming a little overcast. It was a joy to be here with the Minister in such sprightly form.</P>

      <P>My saying I am sorry we have not seen more of Deputy Treacy during the debate does not reflect on the Minister. I echo the sentiments expressed by Senators Fitzgerald and O'Dowd. We had an extremely useful exchange of views. There was very little political partisanship. It was particularly useful to have the Labour Party's views on this issue. I do not agree with them but it is useful to have a different point of view from what is now the consensus &ndash; that privatisation should go ahead. While for once I agree with that consensus, it is invaluable that those who disagree with it should table amendments to it. This is generally a constructive and non-combative Chamber and what we have seen is the Seanad working at its best.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister whose performance was classic. She is a Minister who, right or wrong about her views on the legislation she is putting through, is always on top of it and understands it. That is not necessarily true of all her colleagues. Nowhere was this more apparent than when particular subjects or detailed points were raised and she grasped them immediately. I pay tribute to everyone involved in this debate.

      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the remarks made about the manner in which the Minister dealt with the Committee Stage debate. I welcome Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. It is not often he is able to arrive when most of the work has been done.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross raised a point about share options for managers and directors and the Minister indicated that measures will be put in place to limit that abuse. She also indicated positively to Senator Norris that she will ring-fence a certain amount of shares for purchase by pensioners. Perhaps they could be offered at a reduced rate which would give them a proportionate input into this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party holds a different view. We do not believe in the wholesale privatisation of State and semi-State companies. We believe there is a social dividend and character to be attended to; that some companies like Irish Steel can be privatised entirely, some can only be privatised in part and others are sufficiently valuable and well structured to take on competition. We must look at each company individually. Our view is different from that of all other parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister treated everyone with courtesy and was very forthright and on top of her brief in responding to all of the questions raised. I thank her for doing so.</P>

      <P>Not all the contributions were in agreement with the Bill as proposed or with the Minister's views on the sale of shares in Telecom Éireann. That is to be expected in any good debate. However, all the contributions displayed an extraordinary depth of understanding of the issues at hand. The debate showed a broad understanding and appreciation of the importance of the proposed flotation of Telecom Éireann shares and of the importance of the need to ensure the development of the telecommunications sector in Ireland which is vitally important to our future economic wellbeing.</P>
      <P>The Bill and the resulting flotation of shares is an important step in the Government's strategy in this regard. That Ireland should have an open and competitive telecom sector is an absolute necessity for our economic future and for our competitiveness in the international arena.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister, I extend our deep appreciation to Members of the Seanad for the excellent contributions they made yesterday and today.

      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to raise the proposed closure of the peat production factory at Geesala, Norsk Hydro. That factory which employs 39 people, with four further sales employees in Galway, is an important integral development in north Mayo. It is situated on 700 acres of natural peatland which has tremendous natural resource potential. It has, in the past, been established under other companies and has received a substantial investment of £24 million. It is very important to the area. Over the last three years it has been under the ownership of Norsk Hydro. One could see the whole <Col N="1481" /> development on entering north Mayo and the substantial investment and huge refurbishment that has taken place. It has given great confidence to the people of north Mayo.</P>
      <P>It has been indicated that the factory is about to close and that redundancy notices are about to be, or have been, issued to those 39 people and the four people who work in Galway. The Government should, through the Minister and Údarás na Gaeltachta, which has had financial and other involvements in Norsk Hydro and has supported its development and reinvestment programme, seriously examine the position and work with the company on a strategy of partnership or reinvestment.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the telecommunications Bill this morning we spoke about floating companies and opening up shareholdings. The concept of this development in north Mayo was to provide energy and peat products in competition with the semi-State sector. There is a serious need to consider the involvement of Bord na Móna as a partner in this development. This concept should be examined to see if the State can be involved in this company so that it can reopen and function as an economic entity.</P>
      <P>If we do not do something soon there is a serious danger that some of the contracts and business operations in the company will be discontinued and the company might become run down. I would not like to see that happen. I know of the Minister of State's keen interest in this matter. We must give it immediate priority, with a view to establishing a future for that company in the long term.</P>
      <P>I understand there have been some difficulties in relation to the product that was to have been sold from this factory. There has been state of the art investment in the company but there is a need for further capital investment to re-establish and modernise a section of the plant. The company, which has a very well established Irish company as a partner, has invested between £9 million and £10 million. It is important for us to try to find a solution to this, given the substantial investment of private and State capital. In the region of £24 million to £30 million has been invested over the years in this by previous companies, Norsk Hydro, its partner and the State. We should ensure the company has an economic future. I ask the Minister of State to respond to this request.</P>

Ar 15 Márta fuair Údarás na Gaeltachta litir ó chathaoirleach Norsk Hydro Fuinnimh Teo a cur in iúl go raibh úinéir nua á lorg ag an gcomhlacht don ghnó agus gurbh fhéidir nach mbeadh dul as ach fógra iomarcaíochta a thabhairt d'fhostaithe uile an chomhlachta mura n-<Col N="1482" /> aimseofaí úinéir nua. Mar phríomhchúis don chinneadh a glacadh luadh an cúlú ar phraghasanna ola, petraceimicí, leasuithe agus alúmanam atá mar phríomhghnóthaí ag mátharchomhlacht Norsk Hydro Fuinnimh Teo ar an margadh domhanda. Tháinig an scéal seo aniar aduaidh ar an Údarás agus lorgaíodh cruinniú práinneach le hardbhainistíocht an mhátharchomhlachta chun an scéal a phlé.</P>
      <P>Bhí cruinniú ag príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis le hardbhainistíocht an mhátharchomhlachta san Ioruaidh ar 25 Márta ag ar cuireadh in iúl dearcadh láidir an Údaráis faoin gcaoi a rinneadh cinneadh &ndash; agus a cuireadh an cinneadh sin in iúl &ndash; faoi thodhchaí an chomhlachta in Maigh Eo thuaidh. Ba chruinniú deacair a bhí ann. Tá na himpleachtaí ag éirí as an gcruinniú sin á scrúdú ag an Údarás ach tá sé róluath fós ráiteas críochnúil a dhéanamh faoin gceist.</P>
      <P>Tá 43 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha ag Norsk Hydro Fuinnimh Teo &ndash; 39 i Maigh Eo thuaidh agus ceathair ina gcuid oifigí i nGailimh. Chomh maith leis sin, tuigim go bhfuil suas le 14 dhuine fostaithe ar bhonn conartha sna portaigh i Maigh Eo thuaidh. Ba thubaist é dá gcaillfí na poist sin agus déanfaidh an tÚdarás agus mise gach rud is féidir chun iad a tharrtháil.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh má chailltear na postanna sin beidh an tÚdarás ar lorg agus i dteideal aisíoc de £1.7 milliún de dheontais a íocadh le Norsk Hydro Fuinnimh Teo agus beidh mé ag cur ina luí ar an tÚdarás tionscal nua a aimsiú do Mhaigh Eo thuaidh leis an tairgead sin.</P>
      <P>The letter dated 15 March, which Údarás na Gaeltachta received from Norsk Hydro Fuinnimh Teo stating that a new owner was being sought for the company and that the entire staff might have to be made redundant unless a new owner could be found, came as a complete surprise to the organisation. No indication had been given to an tÚdarás that there was any difficulty regarding the viability of the plant. Indeed, an tÚdarás had been led to believe that all the technical difficulties had been overcome and that a superior product had been developed. The new product had actually just been launched on the market.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of an tÚdarás met with senior management of the parent company of Norsk Hydro Fuinnimh Teo last week in Norway to discuss the future of the plant. I understand it was a difficult meeting and that the implications arising from it are being examined by an tÚdarás. It is too early yet to issue a definitive statement on the matter. I assure the Senator I will be meeting with the employees of the company early next week to discuss the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House that every effort will be made by an tÚdarás to save the jobs in question &ndash; 39 at the plant in north Mayo and four in the company's office in Galway, in addition to 14 contractors employed on work on <Col N="1483" /> the bogs in north Mayo. I will give any assistance I can to an tÚdarás in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>As I said, an tÚdarás will be entitled to a refund of £1.7 million of grants paid to Norsk Hydro Fuinnimh Teo. I have impressed on an tÚdarás the importance of using this money, when it receives it, to find alternative employment in north Mayo. I fully appreciate that 40 to 50 jobs in that part of north Mayo is equivalent to 500 or 1,000 jobs in other parts of the country because of the scarcity of employment and the <Col N="1484" /> small population of the area, due to continuous unemployment and emigration over the years. The Senator can rest assured that my full commitment, and that of Údarás na Gaeltachta, will be given to doing everything it can to protect what is there and, failing that, to try to get alternative enterprises into the area, partly by insisting on a full repayment of all liabilities to Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.40 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
