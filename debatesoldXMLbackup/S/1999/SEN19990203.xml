      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make sufficient funds available so as to enable the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God to provide a range of day residential and respite services for all of the people with learning disabilities for whom they are catering.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide extra funding to repair the roads of north Kerry that were damaged due to bad weather experienced over the past few months.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to provide lottery funds to the national organisation </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> of the Pioneer Total Abstinence and Leisure Association.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to expedite the purchase of cultural, archaeological and historical site of Uisneach in County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to investigate the risk to public health from the air and water pollution at the Tailings Pond at Gortmore, Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make a statement on the continuing fodder crisis that exists in Count Clare and to totally review the current fodder scheme.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Costello and Kiely's matters <Col N="3" /> and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>There is a revulsion sweeping this country. It is hoped that the fullest possible explanation will be given of this decision so there can be no doubts about secret agendas or anything else behind it. Let us have the full truth on this matter. I believe I speak for all sides of this House.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Cathaoirleach's guidance on how to raise another matter. It concerns a man who last Thursday was asked to go to Harcourt Street Garda Station. There he was questioned, arrested and subsequently released without charges being made against him. However, while he was in custody and being questioned, the police phoned every newspaper office in Dublin and RTÉ to inform them that this person was being held there. His name went around the town very quickly and one newspaper named him. This man has not been charged with anything. A person has a constitutional right to his or her good name and character. This is not the first time this has happened.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I would like guidance on how I may raise this because I want to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House. The same happened in the case of the Hanahoe firm when the State was obliged to pay out a justifiable sum of money.</P>

      <P>Thank you. I would like to register my great disquiet at what is happening. When the Garda start taking shortcuts we are all in trouble. I would like the Leader of the House to raise this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; who must have the same feeling of disquiet as I about this &ndash; and see if he will speak to us in the House.</P>

      <P>After the Order of Business the Independent benches will go into conclave to reshuffle, reform and reallocate ourselves seats. We hope the new Labour Party will be pushed into a more independent line with Senator Brendan Ryan's arrival. I am sure I speak for all my colleagues on the Independent benches when I say whatever about his decision to go in a particular direction, we trust his judgment and wish him well. We have a long tradition on these benches of people moving out and back, and we retain the seats.</P>

      <P>The question of taxis and hackneys in Dublin and outside has been raised on many occasions. I would like a serious debate on the matter in this House. There should be a proposal to double the number of taxis and hackneys in this city and in other areas where they are needed. Consumers have been treated abominably on this issue. We should all support the matter being dealt with firmly. There should be a proper debate on the regulation, deregulation, change of rules and use of bus lanes for taxis and hackneys in this city and throughout the country in the interest of safety and security.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to introduce our new Member, another addition to the Labour ranks. Listening to Senator O'Toole's remarks, I hope it will not be long before other like-minded Independent Senators decide to join us. Senator Ryan has always been a very independent Senator. I always believed he was independent in mind, but a Labour man at heart. I am sure other Members will join me in welcoming a new member to the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>One of Senator Ryan's strong points was the degree to which he lacerated Fianna Fáil and the Government benches. I am sure he will be free to maintain an independent mind in that regard in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader indicate the corpus of legislation planned for the coming session? He has said on a number of occasions that approximately 40 per cent of new legislation is dealt with in this House. It is important that we are given sufficient warning of proposed legislation and I ask the <Col N="5" /> Leader for some indication of this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Item No. 3, in the names of Labour Senators, expresses deep concern at the doubling of the local authority housing list and at the 50 per cent increase in the cost of private housing since the Government was established. There is a need for an early debate on the housing crisis. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, stated recently that in his opinion there is no housing crisis. I am afraid he is the only person in the country who holds that opinion. He should come to this House at an early stage and back up that position. There is a major housing crisis and he should come to this House so that we can debate the matter and make our views and recommendations known to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to this House and demonstrate to us that it is his intention to introduce a charities Bill? He should do so sooner rather than later. If the agenda in the other House is full, we should tell the Minister that this House is capable of taking the Second Stage of that Bill. It is not acceptable that a sector which manages hundreds of millions of pounds every year should remain unregulated. There is an urgent need for proper legislation and regulation to maintain the integrity of that sector.</P>
      <P>I agree with the statement made by Senator Manning on the news that is emerging about the Adare murder. Murder is murder and there must never be a set of circumstances where that fact is open to negotiation or compromise.</P>

      <P>In the last term the Leader promised we would have a serious and meaningful debate on homelessness. In Dublin city centre there has been an increase of 37 per cent in the number of people sleeping rough and we are fast becoming a cardboard city. Can the Leader impress upon the Minister the need for emergency accommodation? This is vital. It is ludicrous that people continue to live in doorways. This is something for which we can make provision. I am very disappointed that we have not had the promised debate and I look forward to a positive response from Senator Cassidy.   </P>

      <P>I support Senator Quill's call for legislation on charities. It is very important that public confidence is restored in the system and that we protect the integrity of those who are doing very good work. I agree it is time we <Col N="6" /> brought forward the necessary legislation. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gives a positive response.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader arrange a debate on bank charges and interest? I have had many representations on this matter. I read with alarm that we have bank charges at the European level of 3 per cent, we have mortgages at 5 per cent, yet an individual with an overdraft is charged 12 per cent and someone with a credit card is charged 24 per cent. These are unacceptable interest rates. It is time we had a public debate on this matter and this House is an ideal forum to tease out where the profits are going and how ordinary customers are being fleeced.</P>

      <P>As this is the first debate of the new year will the Leader consider an early debate on child care? As we speak the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is receiving the report of the expert working group on child care. The report covers a major, significant and comprehensive examination of the whole area and includes a number of recommendations to deal with the crisis in the provision of child care right across the board. I ask the Leader to urgently place this issue on his list of priorities for debate in the coming session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of newspaper reports over the past few days about the situation in the Army and the possibility of downsizing it, I call for an early debate on it. At present this issue is being debated throughout the country. The Army as a body has been downgraded in the public domain and it is not what it was over the past number of years. It does not deserve the publicity it is receiving. In general 99 per cent of Army personnel do an excellent job for Ireland and in the international sphere. It is time we discussed their role in internal and international affairs. The Army is a very important body of people and it is not getting the type of publicity it deserves. Without the Army there would have been major problems. We are coming out of an era of violence along our northern borders. Without the influence of the Army and its assistance to the civil authorities &ndash; the Garda &ndash; there is no doubt we would have had major problems.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ensure we have a debate on the International Olympic Council and the organisation of the Olympic Games which has been taken over by people who are involved for monetary gain only? Such people have disgraced themselves and athletics. I am not referring to athletics at track and field level, but athletics in general.</P>
      <P>Eight years ago in this Chamber, I said that Mr. Samaranch was the biggest crook in the world, a remark I backed up with evidence. I also said the second biggest crook was Nabiola, the chief executive of the International Athletic Federation. At that time I suggested that the chief executive of the&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for an early debate on radon gas? I raise this matter in the context of the national radon survey published while the House was in recess. The fourth phase of that survey covers the Tipperary, Limerick and Clare areas and contains alarming figures. In each of the three counties concerned areas have been identified as having unacceptable levels of radon gas. Radon gas is associated with cancer. This House, in discussion with the appropriate Minister, could help to provide assurances for the people concerned.</P>

      <P>Does the admission last night on <i>Prime Time</i> by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, in relation to the Apple computer plant in Cork mean the Government was aware of what was happening before the staff or Oireachtas representatives in that region were informed? That is a sad reflection on the Government. A commitment was given by the company, no more than six months ago, to the continuation of operations at the plant in Cork and that is not now forthcoming. Is it possible that, as the relevant Minister is abroad, somebody can explain the company's commitment to the Cork plant to the House? It appears the Government was aware of the situation at that plant long before the 500 people who have been laid off. Information on this issue must be made available to the workforce.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate next week on the Government proposal to establish two regional authorities and the dissemination of funds? There will be major changes <Col N="8" /> in these structures in terms of disseminating European funds and the Houses should be able to debate the issue and have the Government's intentions explained to them. Can we have such a debate next week as there is a sense of urgency because the Government's views on this issue are moving fairly quickly?</P>
      <P>The Leader has received many requests today, but at some stage during the next few weeks will he arrange for the House to be updated on the Y2K bug preparedness, nationally, internationally and in European terms? This issue will impact on all of us. I would like the Minister to have another opportunity to come into the House and explain the current position and to answer questions and concerns from all sides of the House on this matter.</P>
      <P>I note the fodder cheques which the Minister for Agriculture and Food has disseminated to farmers. I thank him for the £300 we received and I thank God that we have enough fodder. There are others who could do well with such fodder. There are logistical difficulties and the amount involved is small. Thousands of farmers are suicidal as they watch their stock starve without any means of selling or disposing of cattle. I plead with the Leader to ask the Minister to immediately issue funds to the animal welfare societies in every constituency so that these organisations can provide emergency fodder in crises.</P>

      <P>It is important that the House debates the housing situation. There is a great need, but it is important that in our contributions we try to be as innovative and proactive as possible. Housing departments in local authorities are under enormous pressure. It is important that we recognise the pressure on staff and that extra training, office accommodation and all necessary resources are put at their disposal. I look forward to that debate.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on child care at the earliest opportunity. This is not solely a women's issue, but a society and family issue. It is vitally important that the House discusses the child care report as soon as it is published so that the Minister can take on board the appropriate comments and ideas of Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government when he expects to introduce the long promised legislation to revise the planning code? Over 12 months ago the Government <Col N="9" /> defeated a Bill in this House which would have allowed for some control on rogue builders. The problem is getting worse. The Minister promised legislation last autumn, but we have not seen that legislation.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader confirm that the Government will not introduce legislation to reform local government promised extensively by the Minister outside the Houses? The Minister has not been slow to articulate his views on how local government should be reformed, but he has been slow to put those views into legislative proposals. It is important that those who are putting themselves forward for election this year know what structures will exist.</P>

There have been leaks that the Minister is not taking on board the committee's recommendations. Publicans are unanimous that an extra hour's opening time should be given. I ask the Leader to inquire of the Minister when he will introduce legislation and if he will take on board all the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee in the draft legislation.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on bank charges, a subject I raised a number of times in the last session. Would it be possible for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to have an early debate on Northern Ireland? Many of us are concerned about the slow progress of the British-Irish Agreement, particularly as sectarian attacks appear to be beginning again. However, on a light note, a number of the monstrosities placed along the Border, the security checkpoints, have been removed in the past few months. This has enabled us to go on with our lives normally once again. Unfortunately, there is one area in south Fermanagh where they have not been removed, and this is probably the area which least needs them. I plead with the Minister to get the British authorities to remove them from south Fermanagh.</P>

      <P>Before Christmas I mentioned that the 1997 report of the inspector of mental hospitals had been published in good time and I asked the Leader if we could debate it in Government time. I would be glad if we could have the debate soon as the Minister for Health and Children said he would try to bring these reports forward as a matter of urgency. As this report has been brought forward in good time, perhaps the <Col N="10" /> Minister could come to the House and we could debate it for one or two hours.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Doyle in welcoming the fodder aid package announced by the Minister last night. I welcome the bringing forward of the REPS payments etc., also announced by the Minister. However, I am extremely concerned that the right people are not being targeted for this package &ndash; those badly in need will still not get enough. This is a major problem. I ask the Leader to tell the Minister for Agriculture and Food immediately the way to get this money to the people who badly need it is through the district veterinary offices, in co-operation with the local vets. That avenue has not been explored by the Minister. This scheme will be a disaster and will go to waste if he does not target it at the right people and this debate will go on and on.</P>

I also extend my good wishes to my friends in the Labour Party. However, I do not approve of the practice of people standing for election as Independents and then joining a political party. I have always held this opinion, including when it applied to old friends such as Mary Robinson, and I do not intend to deviate from it. It is not right. I wish the Senator well but I disapprove strongly of what he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be possible to have a brief discussion of item 36 on the Order Paper which relates to East Timor? There are interesting developments there at present but some of us are worried about the comments of Mr. Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister, which appear to be setting up a situation for the Indonesian authorities to provoke a civil war using the paramilitaries they have armed. In deference to the Cathaoirleach I will <Col N="11" /> not go into further detail but it is a serious issue and this is a time when Ireland could play a significant role.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Manning's comments about Garda leaks. They are intolerable and I hope our sentiments will be passed on. There have been a number of such leaks over the years and most decent gardaí deplore them.</P>
    <P>I join Senator Quill and others who called for legislation on charities. I have raised this subject on a number of occasions. It is impossible to go through Hibernian Way without encountering professional, paid collectors. Previously, a charity was given one flag day per year. Now, charities pay collectors to do this job aggressively. That is wrong and the system must be regulated. I understood from newspaper reports that Senator O'Meara had prepared a Bill on this subject.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Senator Lanigan's comments about the Olympic Games. It is obvious they were corrupt from top to bottom. God be with the days when they were run by decent people such as Lord Killanin. I have to laugh at Mr. Samaranch. He took the gay games to court and refused to let them use the word &ldquo;olympic&rdquo; in the title because he claimed it would bring the Olympic Games into disrepute. The Olympic Games started in Olympus in classical Greece and there was always a strong erotic element in them.</P>
    <P>Who does Mr. Samaranch think he is fooling? It is he and his crooked cronies who have brought the Olympic Games into disrepute. The gay games held in Amsterdam last year were an enormous success. They, unlike the corrupt Olympic Games over which Samaranch presides, upheld the ideals of the amateur in sport and of fun. Let the Olympic Games learn from the gay games.</P>

    <P>Senator Bonner asked for a debate on Northern Ireland and I agree with his request. It is contrary to not just the spirit but also the letter of the British-Irish Agreement that punishment beatings and other such exercises should continue. There was an explicit renunciation of violence and the threat of violence in the Agreement and that renunciation must be honoured if there is to be progress. Eighty minutes in Lansdowne Road last Saturday sent out a more positive signal of attitudes on this island. It also demonstrated &ndash; this is relevant to the Olympic movement &ndash;<Col N="12" /> that pride in one's place and one's jersey overcomes the deficiencies which money brings to sport.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate, at the earliest opportunity, on the insurance industry? I make these remarks as a result of two articles I read over Christmas. The first concerned motor insurance for which people are being asked to pay anything between £500 and £2,000. I respectfully suggest that if one company can offer a policy for £500 and another asks for £2,000, someone is being ripped off. Furthermore, with the huge increases in property prices, it is important that we advise the public to increase their premiums. People who insured their homes for £40,000 two or three years ago should now cover them for £60,000. If anything went wrong, they would be very disappointed with the pay out. I ask the Leader, therefore, to arrange a debate on the insurance industry as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I support Senators Doyle and Hayes in welcoming the £20 million for the fodder aid scheme.

      <P>It strikes me from the tone of the debate so far that some Senators are saying the Minister is incorrect to give money to the hard-pressed farmers while others are saying he is not giving enough. It indicates the level of knowledge about this problem. A sum of £41 million is being paid to farmers because of the fodder crisis. The farm assistance scheme should also mean an extra £45 million. Incorrect information is being given out. I would prefer if there was genuine concern about the issue. The feed compounders should be asked why they increased prices and the banks should be asked why they are not giving credit. I ask the Leader to convey that sentiment to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>

There are youngsters in jail for life for murders that were committed in far less understandable circumstances, such as fights in the street. They are quite correctly in jail for murder, but it is profoundly disturbing to believe there might be some other agenda involved here.</P>
      <P>There are many who would have had a <i>frisson </i> of eroticism at the verbal flagellation I just got from Senator Norris, but I would have thought it in the nature of independence to be allowed to make up one's mind and change one's perception of life as life proceeded. I did not realise that there was an invisible Whip on Independents. I thank all Members for what I think are genuine good wishes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for facilitating me by adjourning the House.</P>
      <P>On many occasions, Irish people have been appalled by the chilling reports we have received from around the world of terrifying acts of torture being inflicted upon countless men, women and children. The depth and scale of the pain and misery, which these reports have revealed, almost exceeds our comprehension. I know Senators will fully agree with me when I say that acts of torture have no place in a civilised society. The Government fully supports efforts to bring to justice those guilty of the heinous crime of torture. Given the commitment which this House has shown in defending and promoting human rights worldwide, I was glad to be able to initiate the Bill in this House and I have no doubt Senators will welcome this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill, when enacted, will enable Ireland to ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Against this background, the Bill creates a specific statutory offence of torture with a penalty of up to life imprisonment; allows a person to be tried here in relation to the commission of the new offence anywhere in the world; and prohibits the extradition of a person from this State where there are substantial grounds for believing that if the extradition were to take place the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
      <P>The background to the Bill is as follows. The United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 1984 and entered into force in June 1987. In September 1992 the Government authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for the signature of the convention on behalf of Ireland. Ireland signed the convention on 28 September 1992. There is widespread acceptance that Ireland's ratification of the torture convention is overdue and it was in that context that as Minister, I directed that this measure should be included as a priority in the very extensive programme of law reform which I have undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> For Ireland to proceed to ratify the convention, it is necessary to ensure acts of torture, as defined in the convention, are offences under Irish law. The main purpose of this Bill is the creation of a statutory offence of torture in line with that contained in the convention, thus facilitating our ratification.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory offence of torture in Ireland at present. However, the courts have held that the unspecified personal rights guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution include freedom from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment. It should be borne in mind that in the absence of a specific offence of torture, actions which amount to torture may also amount to other offences under our law, such as serious assault offences. In addition, in the context of extradition, it has been held that it should be refused if the court is satisfied, as a matter of probability, that a person would, if delivered into another jurisdiction, be subjected to assault, torture or inhuman treatment. Because these judgments have applied primarily to acts of physical torture it is not certain that acts or omissions which could amount to mental torture would be equally covered. In all the circumstances, it is therefore desirable to create a specific offence of torture which includes acts and omissions which inflict both physical and mental suffering and to provide appropriate penalties for them.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, and in line with the convention, torture will consist of the intentional infliction of severe pain and suffering, mental or physical, on a person for the purpose of obtaining from that person, or another person, information or a confession; punishing that person for an act which he or she, or another person, has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her, or another person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.</P>
    <P>However, it will not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. This too is in line with Article 1 of the convention. In view of the seriousness of the offence, a person found guilty of the offence of torture would be liable for up to life imprisonment. The Bill also contains provisions dealing with offences such as aiding and abetting or attempting or conspiring to commit acts of torture, as well as acts designed to frustrate efforts to apprehend and prosecute persons for an offence of torture. A person found guilty of such an offence will also be liable to life imprisonment. Proceedings for an offence of torture, which may only be taken by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, may be taken in any place in the State and the Bill will enable persons charged with the new offence committed abroad to be tried anywhere in the State.</P>
    <P>The creation of the new offence of torture necessitates the amendment of a number of other Acts. Accordingly, the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, is being amended to provide that the new offence of torture will not be considered a political offence and that extradition cannot be <Col N="19" /> denied on that ground. The Defence Act, 1954, is being amended in respect of the jurisdiction of courts-martial to deal with the new offence of torture. The Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is being amended in respect of the procedure in the District Court where a person is charged with torture and to provide that bail may be granted only by the High Court in such cases and, to give effect to the convention, the Extradition Act, 1965, is being amended to provide that a person will not be extradited to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Other provisions in the Bill deal with privileges and immunities for certain bodies which are established under the convention, the commencement of the Act, and expenses arising out of its administration.</P>
    <P>The UN convention imposes a number of further obligations on State parties which do not require to be included in legislation. For example, Article 10 provides that states parties will ensure that education and information regarding the prohibition against torture are fully included in the training of police, medical personnel, public officials and others who may be involved in the custody or treatment of any person who is subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment. These are matters that can be dealt with administratively.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the sections of the Bill. Section 1 contains standard provisions providing for certain necessary definitions. Section 2 is the central provision. It defines the offence of torture and sets out those categories of persons who may be guilty of torture. Under subsection (1), a person who is a public official and carries out an act of torture on a person will be guilty of the offence of torture. This subsection further provides that it is immaterial what the nationality of the public official is or whether the act of torture was carried out within the State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) provides that a person, other than a public official, who carries out an act of torture on a person at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official will also be guilty of the offence of torture. It is immaterial what the nationality of the person is, or whether the act of torture was carried out within the State or elsewhere. The practical effect of subsections (1) and (2) is that a public official, or person acting at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official, no matter what the nationality of either, who carries out an act of torture on another person, irrespective of where that act was carried out, will be guilty of torture under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 2(3), a person who commits the offence of torture will be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to life. This will make the offence an arrestable one and will put torture on a par with other very serious offences. Section 2(4) defines the terms &ldquo;public official&rdquo; and &ldquo;torture&rdquo;. It states that a public <Col N="20" /> official includes a person acting in an official capacity.</P>
    <P>The definition of torture, which follows closely that contained in the convention itself, contains a number of elements. First, it includes both acts and omissions by which severe pain and suffering are intentionally inflicted on a person. The pain and suffering may be either physical or mental. The definition further provides that the pain and suffering must be inflicted for one or more specific purposes: obtaining from the person, or a third party, information or a confession; punishing the person for an act which he or she, or a third party, has committed or is suspected of having committed; intimidating or coercing the person or a third party; or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.</P>
    <P>Torture does not include, however, any act arising solely from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful sanctions. It might be helpful to make the point that there might be varying views as to how precisely to define the offence of torture. However, primarily what is at issue here is to enable the State to ratify the UN convention and, in the circumstances, there are obvious advantages in adhering as closely as possible to the definition which the convention itself contains.</P>
    <P>Section 3 creates a number of offences other than the actual carrying out of acts of torture, but which contribute in some way to the offence of torture or are designed to frustrate efforts to prosecute others for the offence. Thus, any person, irrespective of nationality, will be guilty of an offence if he or she does any of the following: aids, abets, counsels or procures, within the State or elsewhere, the commission of the offence of torture; attempts or conspires to commit the offence of torture; or tries to obstruct or prevent the arrest or prosecution of a person for the offence of torture.</P>
    <P>As in section 2(3), a person who is found guilty of any of these offences will be liable to imprisonment for up to life. While I accept that it may be more usual in our laws to provide for lesser penalties for aiding and abetting, etc., the commission of an offence &ndash; rather than the actual carrying out of the offence itself &ndash; and given the particularly heinous nature of what can be at issue, I believe it is appropriate in this case to provide for the same maximum penalty.</P>
    <P>Section 4(1) provides that proceedings for an offence under the Bill can be taken anywhere in the State and may be treated as if the offence had been committed in that place. The effect of this will be that persons charged with the offence of torture or a related offence, which has been committed either in the State or abroad, may be tried anywhere in the State. Under subsection (2) of this section, a prosecution for an offence under this Bill may only be taken by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Section 4(3) is included to avoid multiple provisions in legislation relating to extraterritorial jurisdiction. Under section 38 of the Extradition Act, 1965, an offence committed abroad by an <Col N="21" /> Irish citizen is, in certain circumstances, an offence under Irish law. The effect of subsection (3) is that where an Irish national is accused of the offence of torture committed abroad, any proceedings will be taken under the Bill and not under section 38 of the Extradition Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the amendment of sections 169 and 192 of the Defence Act, 1954. Section 169 of the Defence Act, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, deals with the trial of certain non-military offences by court-martial. Section 169(3) provides that where a person charged under the section is convicted by court-martial of certain offences, for example, manslaughter, rape and genocide, that person will be punished accordingly. Section 5(a) amends section 169(3) by adding that where a person is convicted by court-martial of an offence under this Bill, the person will be liable to a penalty of up to life imprisonment, in the same way as a person is liable to that penalty if convicted in a non-military court.</P>
    <P>Section 192 of the Defence Act deals with the jurisdiction of courts-martial. Section 192(2) provides that a limited court-martial will not have jurisdiction to try certain offences, for example, treason and murder, and subsection (3) provides that a court-martial shall not have jurisdiction to try any person subject to military law for certain offences, for example, treason, murder, manslaughter, rape and genocide, unless the offence was committed while the person was on active service. Under section 5(b), the offences created by the Bill will also be excluded from the jurisdiction of courts-martial in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 6 involves a number of amendments to the Extradition Act, 1965. These arise on account of the requirement in Article 3(1) of the convention that no state shall expel, return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that that person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Accordingly, section 6 will add a further condition to the relevant sections of the 1965 Act to allow for refusal of a request for extradition where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person may be subjected to torture. Paragraph (a) will include a definition of torture in section 3 of the 1965 Act which will have the same meaning as it has in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) of the 1965 Act includes provision that a person shall not be extradited if there are substantial grounds for believing that, if extradited, his position may be prejudiced on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. Section 6(b) of the Bill will insert an additional subsection (2A) the effect of which will be that a person shall not be extradited if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>Section 33(3) of the 1965 Act provides that the Minister shall not make an order that a person is to be surrendered if he is of the opinion that it would involve transit through any territory where <Col N="22" /> there is reason to believe that his life or his freedom may be threatened by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. Under section 6(c) of the Bill this will be amended to state that the Minister may also refuse to make an order if there is reason to believe that the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>Section 44(2) of the 1965 Act, as amended by section 8 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, includes provision that a warrant issued in a place to which Part Ill of that Act applies shall not be endorsed for execution in the State if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person's position would be prejudiced on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. This is amended by section 6(d) to include the belief that the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>Section 50(2)(bb) of the 1965 Act, inserted by section 9 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, includes provision that a person arrested under Part III of the Act shall be released if there are substantial grounds for believing that that person's position would be prejudiced on account of race, religion, nationality or political opinion. This paragraph is amended, by section 6 (e), to include the belief that the person may be subjected to torture as a further ground for release.</P>
    <P>Section 7 amends the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, in two respects. Section 7(a) inserts reference to offences created by the Bill into section 13 (1) of the 1967 Act, the effect of which is that the District Court will not have jurisdiction either to deal summarily with offences created by the Bill or to send the accused forward for sentence in relation to those offences. At present section 13(2) excludes this jurisdiction in the case of offences such as treason, murder or genocide, to which will now be added the torture offences created by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 deals with bail in the case of treason, murder, genocide and certain other offences. It provides that bail may only be granted by the High Court in those cases. Section 7(b) inserts a new paragraph into section 29(1) of the 1967 Act to add the new offence of torture to those offences listed. As a result, bail may only be granted by the High Court in the case of a person charged with an offence under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 amends the First Schedule to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, to include the offences created by the Bill. The effect of this will be that these offences will not be considered to be political offences and that extradition cannot be denied, therefore, on that ground.</P>
    <P>Article 17 of the UN convention establishes a committee against torture to carry out the function of ensuring that states abide by their obligations under the convention. Article 21 permits the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> conciliation commission in appropriate cases. Article 23 states that <Col N="23" /> members of the committee and of the <i>ad hoc</i> conciliation commission shall be entitled to the facilities, privileges and immunities of experts on mission for the United Nations as laid down in the relevant sections of the Convention on the Privileges and lmmunities of the United Nations, which is incorporated in the Diplomatic Relations and lmmunities Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>Section 9 makes provision for the committee against torture, and any <i>ad hoc</i> conciliation commission established by the committee, to be accorded the appropriate privileges and immunities as are necessary for them to exercise their functions independently.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a standard provision, which provides that any expenses incurred by any Minister of the Government in the administration of the Act will, to the extent sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. The Bill may give rise to additional costs, for example, the costs incurred in prosecuting persons accused of offences under the Bill. In addition, the convention imposes obligations on states which have ratified it regarding expenses of the committee established under Article 17 as well as expenses incurred in connection with meetings of states and the committee. However, there are no grounds for believing at present that any substantial expenditure will arise.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is a standard provision setting out the short title of the Bill and providing for the commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks, I want to say that this Bill honours an important international obligation and, furthermore, it is a positive indication of the repugnance we feel at unspeakable acts committed most frequently by tyrannical regimes which are sadly still all too prevalent in the world today. I believe it is also a demonstration of our willingness to do all we can to ensure that the perpetrators of those heinous crimes are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>As recently as last December, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I am pleased that, because of the priority which I accorded the measure, it proved possible to publish the Bill prior to that anniversary.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, this Bill is being debated first in the Seanad. Given the excellent and well deserved reputation of this House for raising and advancing human rights issues, I look forward to a constructive and informed debate. As always, I will follow the debate with great care and interest and will take full account of all contributions. I thank Senators for their co-operation in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I welcome this Bill. It is progressive and in many respects it improves the convention. I particularly welcome the provision in section 2 that the convention applies not only to public officials but it estab<Col N="24" /> lishes the jurisdiction of the Irish courts over anyone irrespective of nationality or jurisdiction. It amends the Extradition Act, 1965, to prevent anyone from being extradited who would face torture by being returned to the country from which they fled.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the universal jurisdiction aspect and I sincerely hope universal jurisdiction will be expanded to other crimes in the International Criminal Court. I urge that the statute by which we could ratify the International Criminal Court be quickly brought before this House.</P>
      <P>Torture is one of the gravest violations of human rights and it demands from civilised society everywhere that effective means are in place to prevent it. Yet all over the world torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment are widespread. Torture is used by a large number of states to suppress what they consider opposition. It is used against minorities and vulnerable groups, such as land reform activists, spokespersons for urban poor, human rights activists and so on. It is particularly prevalent in many developing countries and countries which we would consider not developed where tyrants and dictators hold power. Sadly, it is also prevalent in countries in transition from dictatorship to more democratic and accountable forms of government.</P>
      <P>Technological advancement has given torturers new devices and methods which have not only refined physical torture in the sense that it leaves less evidence, but have also refined mental torture to a frightening degree. Despite all the condemnations, declarations and conventions in the past 20 years, the characteristics of modern torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment are very difficult to prevent or wipe out. The nature of torture and the torturer is to use physical and psychological pain on its victim to destroy the dignity of the victim. In the end even the torturer falls victim to his or her own acts. The mental equilibrium of the human being is not compatible with the systematic and organised use of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long ago as 1977 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights drew up its first two draft conventions against torture. For almost ten years these draft documents were debated, revised, obstructed and delayed in various other ways in the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations. Some of the chief obstructers, procrastinators and seekers of revisions to suit themselves were civilised nations such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Eventually the convention was adopted and opened for signature on 10 December 1986. It secured enough signatures to enter into force on 26 June 1987. Strangely, Ireland did not sign it until September 1992. I wonder why. Perhaps the Minister will explain the delay. A sufficient number of contracting states had signed by June 1987 for it to be <Col N="25" /> brought into force. However, Ireland did not sign until 1992.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this important human rights legislation is being introduced in this House and I thank the Minister for stating that this House has a good reputation on human rights issues. We signed the declaration in 1992 and effectively its conditions have been in force since then. Nevertheless, it has taken a long time to ratify the declaration by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I spoke about the widespread burgeoning nature of torture and associated inhuman and degrading practices throughout the world. This is documented in the Human Rights Watch Report 1998 and in the Amnesty International Report 1998. The Amnesty International report states that people were reportedly tortured or ill-treated by security forces and other state authorities in 117 countries. There are not many more countries in the world. Degrees of ill-treatment and torture vary greatly, from the horrendous to incidents that often go unreported because they are regarded as slight. Nevertheless, it is very worrying that the accusation of ill-treatment, degrading punishment and mental and physical torture can be laid in one form or another at the doors of 117 countries throughout the world. In some 41 countries, including the United States, torture or ill-treatment, lack of medical care or cruel or degrading prison conditions have been confirmed as, or suspected of, leading to deaths in custody. Disappearances were reported from 31 countries in 1997. Some included people who disappeared in previous years.</P>
    <P>Another frightening statistic in the Amnesty International report is that confirmed or possible extrajudicial executions were carried out in 53 countries throughout the world in 1997. There is no proof that the situation was any better in 1998, or that it will be any better in 1999. Interestingly, confirmed or possible prisoners of conscience were held in 87 countries, some very close to home. Usually these prisoners of conscience were conscientious objectors to military service and so on. In 34 countries, political prisoners were behind bars after unfair trials in 1997. China probably has the largest number of unreported unfair trials and death convictions following these unfair trials.</P>
    <P>People were arbitrarily arrested and detained, or in detention without charge or trial, in 53 countries in 1997. The death penalty is closely related to torture because death often follows torture. Many who are tortured in prison end up on death row and executed. In 1997 executions were carried out in 40 countries. Many were carried out in countries close to Ireland with which we have very close relationships. There are prisoners under sentence of death in at least 70 countries, which indicates how widespread it is in many countries. In other words, there is a provision in the statute books of all these countries for the death sentence, which I am pleased we abolished. Armed opposition groups committed serious <Col N="26" /> human rights abuses, such as deliberate and arbitrary killings of civilians, torture and hostage-taking in 31 countries. The so-called democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Columbia and others fall into that category. These were some of the countries looked at in relation to torture and cruel and inhuman treatment by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. India is a country with which we have a very close relationship and with which we claim to have a close affinity in relation to its independent struggle and so on. Thousands of political prisoners are imprisoned in India. Many are tortured or ill-treated and denied medical treatment. There are suspicions of deaths in Indian prisons of political prisoners or prisoners held for being politically dissident or for what are deemed to be religious offences. These prisoners died in prison as a result of ill-treatment in 1997.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Colombia, where hundreds of people were killed by security forces and paramilitary forces who had the support of the State. Torture in detention is routine in Colombia. I know that country is in a state of civil war, nevertheless, the convention states that no excuse can be made for the use of torture by any State.</P>
    <P>Death squads are another phenomenon throughout Central and Latin America. They are given full licence in Colombia to dispose of people who are regarded as disposable because they have committed an offence the Government does not like, and there is no court system to deal with these so-called crimes. Death squads are assigned to deal with these people, and they effectively dispose of them. Very often in Colombia the people who are so disposed of are community activists, human rights defenders and trade unionists, which is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The other major country which has a systematic State policy of torture and ill-treatment in its prisons is the People's Republic of China. Routinely thousands of protesters and suspected opponents of the regime are rounded up and held for months or even years without trial. Torture and ill-treatment is endemic in the system in China.</P>
    <P>In Chad, a very large country in central Africa, dozens of suspected opponents were extrajudicially executed in 1997. Security forces of the State regularly beat, tortured and ill-treated people who were detained. Many people who were detained were human rights activists and some were human rights lawyers.</P>
    <P>Brazil is also interesting. It is the largest country in Latin America, with a population of 700 million. In 1997 hundreds of people were killed by police or death squads. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, who are noted for the integrity of their investigative work, reported this fact, which is not often reported in the media. Brazil has close relationships with this country and is an enormously important country in the world. It is the eighth largest economy in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> I visited Kenya last year as an observer of their elections. During the election campaign pro-democracy supporters and journalists were beaten up and imprisoned. I know because several NGOs and other people who witnessed these acts told me about them. NGOs monitoring the conduct of the election were also harassed and intimidated by security forces in Kenya. Seventy-four people were sentenced to death. However, I have no report as to whether the death sentence was carried out because Kenya does not issue figures relating to the number of executions within its borders. I do know that at least 800 people have received a death sentence and are waiting for it to be carried out by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Added to all this are our new concepts of human rights. Some very respectable world leaders have evolved new concepts. For example, many people look to President Musevini of Uganda as a major new force for improvement and democracy on the continent. He and people like him now espouse the theory of non-party democracy, in other words, a single party government. This is a modern recycling of the old system of the single party government which usually had socialism as the economic basis of the state. President Musevini's new theory is to have capitalism as the economic basis for the state.</P>
    <P>African leaders talk about African solutions for African problems and it is often used as a guise that people prefer order to the quality of civil and human rights they enjoy. That is the basis of their theory and it is used to abuse the human and civil rights of hundreds of thousands of people in countries like Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, the Republic of the Congo and, sadly, that theory is spreading to Angola.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and thank the Minister for introducing it. I regret the statute for Ireland to ratify the International Criminal Court is not included in the schedule of Bills to be introduced in the current session. As the Minister knows the Statute of the International Criminal Court must be ratified by 60 countries before it can come into effect. I hope Ireland, with his co-operation, will ratify it this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House on our first day back. His presence is a clear indication of his huge commitment to this House. During 1998 he introduced approximately one-third of all legislation in the Oireachtas. This is an extremely important record. I would like to be associated with compliments to him for the huge workload he has carried out. I understand from our Leader that under this term many other Bills will be introduced in this House. About ten years ago I spent three and a half years here but, at that time, the introduction of legislation in the Seanad was an exception to the rule. It is very important to note that no fewer than 11 Bills were introduced here. This is great recognition for the House and it should continue. Furthermore, in relation to the work of this House it is <Col N="28" /> important to note that in 1998, the Seanad sat three days less than the other House. It is also important to indicate the major workload that the Seanad has engaged in during the past 12 months, and this will probably continue.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It ratifies the 1984 European convention and amends our legislation because &ldquo;torture&rdquo; or the statutory offence of torture was not on our Statute Book. This Bill will align us with European and other countries. It puts us in a position to ratify and bring our legislation up to date.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Connor that in many states in Asia, South Africa, South America and the United States torture still prevails. In this small Republic of Ireland we have a long established democratic system for which we are criticised occasionally but we are probably one of the showcase countries, not alone in Europe but in the world, where human rights are to the fore. As the Minister pointed out, under Article 40 of the Constitution inhumane treatment of prisoners, etc., is prohibited. With regard to prisoners and how they are dealt with, we have the judges rules which clearly set out guidelines for the interrogation of prisoners and the taking of statements, confessions, etc. Sometimes politicians of all creeds, denominations and political affiliations are criticised for our work in this little democratic country. In the broader picture we are a leading light for any democratic country on how we run our affairs. It may not be Utopia but our system of law and order is second to none in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It is mind boggling to read and see on television the horrific atrocities of torture and human degradation in places like East Timor, the African continent and eastern European countries, particularly what is happening at the moment, for example, the ethnic cleansing which took place in former Yugoslavia where people were systematically taken out because of their religion, colour or creed. If we read our history books we would be alarmed to discover that this happened in the 16th century when Cromwell existed but as we approach the millennium greater atrocities are occurring in Europe and all over the world. We have to address this issue.</P>
      <P>I know we are involved in a very important peace process at the moment but we must not forget that Irish citizens were tortured during the 1970s in Great Britain arising out of the Birmingham bombings. The Birmingham Six have since been pardoned but a great wrong was done. Confessions were extracted from Irish people because, at that stage, the end justified the means. However, that led to severe repercussions down the line for the British system of justice. The same concept can be applied to the Guildford Four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget that the torture of prisoners was also prevalent in the North up to two years ago. I am not sure how that relates to the current situation in the North with regard to punishment beatings, etc., but I hope this matter will <Col N="29" /> be resolved. It is something we must examine closely because the punishment beatings, knee capping, shooting, etc, that took place in the past 12 months despite the peace process should not be allowed in a civilised society. I hope the powers that be and the Government will try to address and resolve these matters.</P>
    <P>Torture is widespread in many Asian and Arab countries and in China, on all continents, except Australia and to a lesser extent Europe. Torture of political prisoners and the whole concept of discrimination and ethnic cleansing are widespread on many continents. This has been self evident in places like Chile, Brazil and Colombia and other countries in South America. It is regrettable that this is being allowed to happen in modern civilised societies at the turn of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I compliment Amnesty International on the work it has done in highlighting the incidence of discrimination and torture. I see no reason for the death penalty in America. Our decision to abolish it was, I think, correct. There is a song about man's inhumanity to fellow man which dates back to a certain war. That inhumanity remains prevalent. We witness on television scenes of torture, mayhem and genocide in countries approximately two hours flight from Ireland, which is very serious and worrying.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in essence, arises from the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, Degrading Treatment or Punishment adopted in 1984. As it stands, our legislation does not include a specific statutory offence for torture. The Bill creates a specific statutory offence of torture which carries a penalty of life imprisonment. That is made quite clear and succinct in the Bill. Another important aspect is that it allows a person to be tried for the commission of the new offence anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the extradition Act. If it can be established to the High Court, in an application for extradition, that the country to which the person is being extradited may invoke torture to secure a confession or conviction against that individual for any crime, there are grounds under this new legislation to prevent such extradition taking place. Extradition would be refused if a substantial case could be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also amends the Defence Act, 1954, which provides for a court martial for manslaughter, rape or genocide. Under the new legislation, if the offence of torture can be established &ndash; the Minister said it does not have to be a serving member &ndash; the life imprisonment aspect will be applied to the person so convicted in the same way as if it were in a civil court outside the court martial system. It also introduces changes in that any application in this regard must, in the first instance, be made to the DPP. Furthermore, any such applications must be dealt with by the High Court and not the District Court which indicates the gravity of the offence in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> Section 2 defines torture. It need not necessarily be physical torture; it can be torture by inaction or emotional torture. A person can be tortured by neglect. For example, if an official in a Garda station knowingly ignores the plea of a prisoner in need of medical attention or if he or she is treated inhumanely or degradingly, it can be deemed as torture. Such official may not have carried out an action of inhuman treatment, but may have turned a blind eye or acquiesced when another prison officer or garda did the dirty work.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Bill is the setting up of a commission. It is to be called the Committee Against Torture under the UN Convention and will be headed by a commissioner and monitored on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Many Members are more affluent in matters of foreign affairs than me. Senators Norris and Lanigan have for many years highlighted and spoken openly in this House of the problems abroad. This House has an excellent record in highlighting incidences of torture, inhumanity and degradation in places like East Timor, eastern Europe, South Africa and Asia. We are recognised as always being to the forefront in rejecting and objecting to what is happening.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill in this House and wish it a speedy passage. I am sure Senators will, by and large, accept the thrust of the legislation which is long overdue. It has been on the agenda since 1992 and is important legislation which will heighten our international status on matters of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Unusually and uncharacteristically I do not have too many specific points to make. I have just returned from abroad and I am hopping between this debate and several other meetings. I am sure the Minister is aware that two other human rights protocols are before the Committee on Foreign Affairs and I wish to get back to discussing those matters with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated in a press statement in December that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had prepared this instrument and that it would come before this House. It has long been of reproach to Ireland that, for various technical reasons, this is one of the protocols we have not signed. I reflect on an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 August 1997 which reported a man reasonably well known to Members, and who has appeared before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Sub-committee on Human Rights and on television on a number of occasions, Dr. Mohammed El Sader, as describing the failure to ratify the torture convention as despicable. Obviously, he has very strong feelings on this issue and one understands why because his is a voice to which it is important to listen. He was a victim of torture in Iraq and knows exactly what he is talking about. I am sure Dr. Al-Sader will welcome the fact that an offence of torture is being created in Irish statute as a result of this Bill and that we <Col N="31" /> will be able to bring persons accused of torture before the courts, no matter where the offence takes place. This is very important.</P>
    <P>We have long been missing an agency to deal with the victims of torture. There are numerous people in this country from Vietnam, East Timor and elsewhere who have been routinely subjected to the most barbarous forms of torture. As far as I am aware, there is no agency dealing with the traumatic impact of torture. Today we heard of a soldier who received £200,000 because of the traumatic impact of hearing a gun going off. I would have thought this was the kind of thing one would anticipate in the Army. If we are so delicate about the nervous disposition of Irish soldiers, we should at least accept that people who are victims of torture over a long period suffer physical stress and psychological trauma. If they come here as asylum seekers and are granted refugee status, the State has a responsibility to assist them in rehabilitation in every way, not just by allowing them reside here, but also by looking after the physical and mental wounds they have suffered.</P>
    <P>I am glad mention has been made not only of the interrogation procedures and methodology used by the British Government, which were found to constitute torture, but also of the torture inflicted by both sets of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. I wonder if any Government will have the guts to take up the possibility of arraigning those who have been involved in punishment beatings and shootings. These incidents sound mild until one sees photographs, such as those in the newspapers last weekend, of a man with two stumps where his legs had been as a result of one such beating. As far as I recall that was a case of Protestant paramilitaries attacking one of their own. The man's wife said his children could no longer bear to look at him &ndash; when they spoke to him they looked at her. This is happening in our own community.</P>
    <P>In the past week I have been made aware that even in the enlightened European community there is a degree of lack of sensitivity. I was made aware of a case in which the Swedish authorities attempted to forcibly repatriate a gay Iranian man to Tehran, despite the fact that his male gay partner in Tehran had been executed after being tortured by the Iranian authorities. We look to the Swedish Government as a beacon of liberal ideas, decency and tolerance, yet it was returning this man to Iran, presumably blissfully uncaring about the fact that he might be tortured and murdered.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of Mr. Mugabe who was given such a welcome in the O'Reilly Hall in UCD a year ago. I was reprimanded in this House when I described him as a dictator. However, let us consider what has been emerging in recent days where journalists who printed stories which appeared to criticise the Mugabe regime were taken out, half-drowned and had electrodes attached to them. The doctor who attended these men said in open court there were deep scorch <Col N="32" /> marks on their chests where the instruments of torture had been applied. Mr. Mugabe was hailed in Dublin as an emissary of light and democracy. We need to be watchful all the time because even those we suspect or believe to be our friends can be acting in a dangerous way behind our backs.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the United States. Last night I watched a television programme about the Cold War. There is no doubt the CIA funded the subversion of democratic regimes throughout Latin America. It knowingly funded torture and was aware of what was going on. It deliberately subverted the Allende regime in Chile. On many occasions I have drawn the House's attention to the scandal of an operation called The School of the Americas, where US Government money was used to educate people in methods of torture. We should speak to our friends as well as those we believe to be our enemies and try to ensure the spotlight of public opinion is brought to bear on these issues.</P>
    <P>I also wish to mention Indonesia. I know many of the Timorese people in Ireland. They appear outwardly cheerful but a number of them have witnessed their parents being butchered. This is often done as an example to villages and families. The authorities humiliate the parents or officials, reduce them from fully human status to a position of being intimidated, beaten and humiliated as an example to others not to follow their independent and democratic line.</P>
    <P>On the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; during the week it was interesting to hear a British comedian state that he used money to buy his way into an international arms fair and established a stall selling the PR expertise to evade difficult questions about arms purchase and torture. He managed to get a senior Indonesian general to admit on the record that it was part of the Indonesian Government's policy in areas such as East Timor and west Papua to engage in torture as an instrument of policy. That was a remarkable and interesting admission. The general also admitted that some of the hardware involved came from western European democracies which preach to others about human and civil rights. We have a considerable bag of worms to deal with when it comes to torture.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International is often sharply critical and keeps an observant, critical eye on all these issues. It is significant that it has welcomed this Bill because it applies to public officials and establishes the jurisdiction of Irish courts over anyone, irrespective of nationality or jurisdiction. The Bill also amends the extradition Act to prevent anyone from being extradited who would face torture. This must be contrasted with the behaviour of the Swedish Government in the case I outlined. The Government is now taking the issue of torture seriously. I also welcome the fact that the question of an application for bail is taken so seriously that it has to be referred to a superior court.</P>
    <P>However, the issue of mandatory sentencing has been drawn to my attention. I may be flatter<Col N="33" /> ing myself to believe the Minister would remember anything I ever said, but he will remember that I have a difficulty in principle with mandatory sentencing. It is better to allow some discretion to the court in terms of sentencing policy. The case has been made to me that one of the difficulties in the area of torture is that such mandatory sentences may not take into account the fact that certain people may claim, as part of their defence, that they committed offences of torture but under personal, mental or physical duress, including threats to their lives. In those circumstances, it seems there should be some degree of flexibility available to the courts.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a press conference which took place in November 1997 given by the Secretary General of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture, Dr. Geneske, who is now dead, where she said that member states of the UN should ratify and implement this convention. She said &ndash; and this is rather worrying &ndash; that the low priority given by the United Nations to the issue of torture and the plight of victims was shameful. It is noteworthy to observe that she did not stop at torture but also looked at the plight of the victim. I should have mentioned that my interest in this is partly because I was a patron of the now defunct Rescue Trust, as was my colleague, Senator O'Toole. It concentrated specifically on the area of caring for victims of torture.</P>
    <P>Dr. Geneske said that torture is used as a matter of routine by up to one-third of the membership of the United Nations &ndash; there is a Swiftian irony &ndash; and the primary aim of the use of torture is to break down the identity and personality of strong people who work for democracy. In other words, leaders' voices on behalf of the people are isolated and broken down by the application of torture. It is used as an instrument of power against those who want democracy and freedom in their countries. She said they take them in, break them down and send them back to their homes. These formerly strong women or men, maybe journalists, then become not so good journalists or human rights fighters. Dr. Geneske said they acquire psychological and physical problems although she added that the rehabilitation council now knew how to rehabilitate and help such victims. She also drew attention to the lack of support and resources for the medical professionals, some of whom were risking their lives to assist victims of torture.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his advisers will look carefully at rehabilitation and not just pass a technical measure allowing us to look good in the eyes of the world by signing up to this convention without doing anything practical. If we are serious about this problem, we must look at the question of rehabilitation and treatment.</P>
    <P>At the press conference, Dr. Geneske also referred to the plight of people from Latin American countries, to which I referred earlier. It is particularly horrible that some of the victims of torture who received treatment at the major international centre in Denmark reported that <Col N="34" /> daily they witnessed their torturers walking free on the streets. It must be an appalling prospect, having been subjected to this type of humiliation, pain and torture, to have to witness those who inflicted it on one walking free on the streets. Perhaps this Bill will go some way towards ameliorating this and ensuring that at least in Ireland victims of torture will not be compelled to witness the freedom of those who have caused them pain, humiliation and distress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I presume we are serious about our objections to torture and that we will implement the Bill, even if it causes us diplomatic problems. I presume that in the future, we will not balk at describing people like Mugabe as a dictator in that false polite manner to which this Chamber sometimes ascribes, but that instead we will look at what he is doing. On the next occasion Mr. Mugabe chooses to visit this country, perhaps under this Bill we will arrest him and ensure he pays the price for what he has exacted so mercilessly on some of his unfortunate former citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I commend him for introducing the Bill in this House and the Government for taking action to transpose this protocol into Irish law. It is time this happened. Torture has been a particularly objectionable feature of this century. It is a vicious and invidious form of violence and very often it goes unchallenged and unnoticed in many countries which would like to present themselves internationally as paragons of virtue. It is important that Ireland not only takes a strong moral stand in upholding human rights wherever there are violations but that it also takes an active part in ensuring the perpetrators of torture are brought to justice whenever the opportunity is presented.</P>
      <P>When this Bill is enacted perpetrators of torture will be dealt with in a decisive way, no matter where the torture takes place. This is a major advance for us in terms of how we view human rights. Victims of torture are often minorities and women. Mostly they are prisoners of conscience and good thinkers. However, because their thinking upsets the <i>status quo,</i> they can be the victims of sustained and vicious torture.</P>
      <P>The key point I wish to make has been hinted at by Senator Norris. This legislation seeks to define torture. I am concerned about the prevalence of punishment beatings in a part of my country. Whatever about a technical definition, by any standards, these punishment beatings must constitute torture in terms of what is inflicted on the victims and a whole community. A punishment beating can have a brutalising effect on a community and its young people who see this sinister and insidious form of violence. These punishment beatings are contrary, not only to the spirit of the British-Irish Agreements but to its text because the Agreement identified violence, from whatever the source or for whatever reason, as being contrary to its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> I would be assured if in the context of this debate we identified punishment beatings as a form of torture in the exact meaning of the word and if we sent a clear signal that punishment beatings are as unacceptable to us, citizens of a free sovereign State, as any form of torture inflicted in any other part of the world, whether it is Indonesia or the United States. It should be said clearly to the groups and organisations who continue to carry out these punishment beatings that they are not acceptable to us and that we are partners, in good faith, to the British-Irish Agreement. I want that message to be sent strongly from this House.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if, in the context of our deliberation of this Bill, we could succeed in defining punishment beatings as a form of torture. This low grade violence is a fall-out of the antics of the Provisional IRA and others for the past 30 years &ndash; the type of gangsterism which masqueraded as patriotism in this country. I am thankful we have come to terms with the main features of that awful period. However, there is a residue of violence which seems to be endemic in certain communities and comes from an identifiable quarter. We should do everything we can to make it known that it is not acceptable and it must be stamped out.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Bill is before the House. It is important that, as a country which has a good reputation, particularly as regards peacekeeping and peacemaking in recent times, we should seek to uphold and extend that reputation. That reputation should extend not only to putting the provisions of this Bill in place, but also to actively playing our part in peacekeeping operations in the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Leas-Chathaoirleach's comments at face value. It is strange to find myself making the equivalent of a maiden speech after 17 years as a Member of this House. However, this is my first time to speak as a representative of a political party. In the glorious days of anarchy on the backbenches, nobody represented anybody.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Amnesty International said that parts of it go beyond the necessary provisions of the convention and that is most welcome. While I do not wish to cavil, taking almost 15 years to ratify a UN convention on something as fundamental as torture does not leave us much space for self congratulation. The convention was passed in 1984 and Ireland signed it in the early 1990s. We are finally ratifying it now. Nevertheless, the ratification is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be a major cause of concern that 200 years since the Enlightenment, when the concept of the rights of man was articulated and the prin<Col N="36" /> ciple of human rights started to crystallise as a fundamental principle, and at the end of a century which could be characterised as a century of progress, Amnesty International can still report that 117 countries can be accused of practising abuse and torture against their citizens. That is an incredible number. It is not something in regard to which the west can claim moral superiority. We should remember that in the civilised west 50 years ago there was genocide on a scale which matched the ferocity of what happens now in countries at which we tend to look down our noses and at which we threaten to throw our weight because we do not like what they are doing.</P>
    <P>We are no different from anybody else. Given the political circumstances, attitudes and changes, there is no society which does not have people who are ready and willing to use the most appalling forms of torture to achieve political purposes. I agree with Senator Quill that the brutality of punishment beatings is one of many things that reproach people on this island.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is welcome, one should not get carried away in assessing its significance. According to Amnesty International's annual report for 1998, Turkey ratified this convention even before Ireland. I will quote a passage about Turkey from page 338 of that annual report which states:</P>
    <P>Hatun Temuzalp, a reporter for a left-wing journal, stated that she was tortured while held for interrogation at Istanbul Police Headquarters for seven days during March. Police officers insulted and threatened her, and pulled some of her clothes off. Her arms were tightly bound to a wooden bar and two people grabbed her, lifted her onto a chair, hung her up, and pulled the chair away. This happened repeatedly. After a period of intense pain she started to lose consciousness. A radiography report indicated a fractured shoulder blade. When brought before a judge, Hatun Temuzalp made a complaint of torture. She was released but her interrogators were not prosecuted.</P>
    <P>That is just one incident in the report. Turkey has ratified the convention and is an applicant for membership of the European Union. A subcommittee of the Council of Europe reported last week that Turkey is now entitled to be regarded as a fully functioning democracy. Now that Ireland is drifting towards membership of Partnership for Peace, it should be pointed out that Turkey is a full, active member of NATO. I would have expected a movement committed to peace and human rights would at least begin by ensuring the highest standard of human rights were upheld within the member states of such an alliance.</P>
    <P>In our country civilised law and Government are worth a great deal. However, they are not considered as worthwhile in other parts of the world, particularly when, according to Amnesty International, expediency rules. The 1998 session of the United Nations Commission on Human <Col N="37" /> Rights decided there was no need to investigate human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. However, the Amnesty International annual report shows that Saudi Arabia has ratified only one United Nations convention on human rights. We should not get carried away about the significance of these conventions. They are worthwhile in themselves and from our point of view, but they are not the beginning or end of anything.</P>
    <P>I wish to put a number of questions about the Bill's provisions. Section 2 defines torture and I doubt that anybody could dispute the definition. However, if it had been in force in 1972, the European Court of Human Rights would not have been able to avoid finding Britain guilty of torture after the introduction of internment. What happened then is defined in the Bill in terms which leave no room for equivocation.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned about the phrase, which is also used in the convention, &ldquo;. . . but does not include any such act that arises solely from or is inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions.&rdquo;  I am anxious to know what that means. I sought an explanation in the explanatory memorandum but found the same form of words. I then listened to the Minister's speech and heard him quote the same phrase. What does it mean? Can we be offered practical examples of its meaning? Is it an escape clause to allow people not to be squeezed on this issue? If it is, that is a pity.</P>
    <P>I accept that international conventions must be essentially about the lowest common denominator, but that does not mean we should include every element without some qualification. I await the Minister's explanation of the phrase. Given that the explanatory memorandum and the Minister use the same phrase, I am not sure anybody else understands its meaning. Does it refer to sanctions that are lawful under the convention, sanctions that are lawful in the state where it happens or sanctions that are made lawful by some extra body? What law is involved, national or international law? What is meant by sanctions? Do they refer to penalties or are we saying that even though torture is defined as an act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for the purpose of obtaining information from that person or punishing that person for an act, it would be possible for a country to ratify this convention and then chop off the hands of people who are convicted of theft because mutilation is acceptable as punishment? Are we saying physical castration as a punishment for sexual offences would be regarded as acceptable? Are we saying that, in a country which uses the death penalty, it might be against an international convention to inflict pain but perfectly legal to execute a person? If the world is developing an international code of conduct, it should not be tied up in a morass of vagueness, uncertainty and escape clauses. If there are less than complete enforcement possibilities, we should say so.</P>
    <P>We should be honest with ourselves and admit <Col N="38" /> this is a first small step on a journey which could take 50 years before there is genuine international consensus on the principle of not using torture in a way which would bite. Something as significant and historic as the European Convention on Human Rights, its extraterritorial enforcement, and the fact that we accept the jurisdiction of a non-national court over our exercise of human rights, is a real contribution to the evolution of human rights. It was very important and it was dealt with slowly and carefully. I am genuinely concerned that the beginnings of equivocation about Turkey could be the beginnings of a retreat from some of the high moral ground that convention has allowed us to occupy.</P>
    <P>Article 3 (1) of the convention states that no party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture. I understand the extradition Act is being amended to ensure that, but it is not just by extradition that people can be returned to countries where they might be tortured. They can be deported to countries in which they might be tortured. Can I have a categorical assurance from the Minister that, irrespective of the status of an individual in this State or whether he or she has applied for asylum, that individual will not be returned to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing he or she is in danger of being subject to torture? That means a person should not be returned to a country in which torture is endemic. It does not mean the individual has to prove to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he or she will be tortured, merely that he or she could be tortured.</P>
    <P>There are two countries in particular &ndash; Somalia and Nigeria &ndash; with which this State is going to have to deal in terms of our immigration and asylum laws. It is suggested in a spurious manner that because there is no effective state in Somalia one cannot talk about state practice. This convention is not just about the use of torture by the state, it is about the systematic use of torture in any society. I would like the Minister to make it clear that we now have a policy, irrespective of the circumstances of a person's arrival in this State and of the Dublin Convention, that we will not be a party to returning people to countries where torture is endemic. That is what the convention means, whatever the ratification procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the penalty for torture or the related offence of aiding and abetting is up to life imprisonment. The Bill states that the person shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for life. Is the penalty up to life imprisonment, a variety of penalties, or is it a mandatory life sentence? The Minister stated it is a penalty up to life, but the Bill does not leave room for flexibility. No matter what I think of torturers, I am not keen on mandatory life sentences. Nor am I keen on 81 year old generals, irrespective of their <Col N="39" /> past, being sent to jail. I am happy to have them convicted, but not sent to jail.</P>
    <P>Is it clear from this legislation that no such concept of sovereign immunity will apply to anyone arrested in this State on a charge of using torture? Is it clear that everybody, whether sovereign, government official or minion, is subject to exactly the same sanction in all circumstances where this convention applies and that torture is regarded as a breach of international human rights?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister state that acts of torture have no place in civilised society and that the Government fully supports efforts to bring to justice those guilty of the heinous crime of torture. It sounds laudable, but many of the speakers here have touched on what happens when torture becomes systematic in the State.</P>
      <P>We all know that terrorists, kidnappers, gangsters and dictators use torture and I condemn out of hand the torture used in the Six Counties by the paramilitaries. This Bill, however, refers to the torture which is systematic and acknowledged by the State as part of its apparatus for gaining information or detaining people. I want to confront the House with the reality of this. For example, under the terms of the Bill, and in line with the convention, torture consists of the intentional infliction of severe pain and suffering, mental or physical, on a person for the purpose of obtaining from that person or another person information or a confession; punishing that person for an act which he or she has committed or is suspected of having committed; intimidating or coercing him or her or another person or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind. That is a very wide-ranging definition. It is one of which I approve but does that mean the gardaí would be guilty of torture if they arrested people who were handing our leaflets in the street or if they strip searched them in a barracks? Would that constitute torture? It would according to this definition, even if the leaflets these people were handing out purported to support life rather than its destruction. We need to reflect on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill prohibits the extradition of a person from this State where there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the extradition were to take place, the person may be subjected to torture. In addition, in the context of extradition, it has been held that extradition should be refused if the court is satisfied it is a matter of probability that a person, if delivered into another jurisdiction, would be subject to assault or inhuman treatment. Does that refer only to particular cases or does it refer to the generality in that state? If it reflects particular cases, it is rather difficult to defend, but if it is a general statement, I do not believe we should ever extradite a person to the United Kingdom. I have said <Col N="40" /> as much for years &ndash; I would not extradite a dog to that country. I say this on the basis of a statement made by Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls. He stated:</P>
    <P>The public interest can sometimes be better served by imprisoning innocent persons rather than allowing a case to proceed which might undermine an institution of the state.</P>
    <P>He said that in 1983 when dealing with the Birmingham Six. We all know the tortures inflicted on the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and many others.</P>
    <P>It also means that if we ratify this convention, we may not extradite people to the Six Counties. It is well known that since the 1970s the RUC and the British Army have been routinely involved in the torture and ill-treatment of Nationalists. There is no doubt about that. In 1971, when 374 people were lifted and beaten up, the European Commission on Human Rights found the United Kingdom guilty of the torture of internees. This was later reduced by the European Court to inhuman and degrading treatment.</P>
    <P>It is widely known that for many years the British Army and the RUC have taken people to Castlereagh detention centre and subjected them to systematic torture through white noise and deprivation techniques, such as hooding. If someone is found guilty of a crime in this jurisdiction, are we to send them up there for a trial? We need to think about these things.</P>
    <P>If anyone thinks this is a thing of the past, it is not; that society is very violent. We know about the paramilitaries, but I refer to the Government attitude, as in the case of a Mr. David Adams who was arrested in 1994 because he is Gerry Adams's brother. He was seriously assaulted by the RUC; he was punched and rifle butts were driven into his body. His face was driven into the ground, resulting in damage to his face and teeth. He was called a Fenian bastard, and he heard one of the RUC men say he hoped he drowned in his own blood. After they punctured his lung he was brought to Castlereagh. He was brought past the custody sergeant, who later denied having seen any injuries, although a trial judge found that blood must have been pouring down Mr. Adams's face at that point. Against all regulations he was taken into a scene of crime room where officers took turns at aiming karate kicks against his leg until it broke. Mr. Adams heard the custody sergeant shout at his colleagues to avoid getting blood on the walls. Later, a doctor ordered that he be taken to hospital immediately. Half an hour later he was taken to hospital, where he remained for three weeks. No officer has been disciplined, much less charged with this criminal offence. Mr. Adams was recently awarded £30,000 in civil damages by the High Court in Belfast, but I believe the officers are still serving. The RUC has been condemned by the United Nations Committee against Torture and the UN Committee on the Child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> Is this legislation going to stop us from extraditing a terrorist or paramilitary to the Six Counties or the UK because this goes on? This does not just happen in the Far East or under dictatorships. Torture is practised systematically; as Senator Ryan said, it is practised in 171 countries, and that probably includes ours. France was famous for carrying out torture in Algeria and Egypt. The United States is the largest manufacturer of stun guns, electro shock weapons that are condemned by Amnesty International. They are ostensibly sold to guard cattle, but they are used as instruments of torture in other countries. We have a thriving industry in Ireland that exports what I term dual use electronic components that are part of the arms industry. Are we turning a blind eye to that? We should not &ndash; we should be aware of it.</P>
    <P>A great organisation that is doing something about this is Amnesty International. If it were not for that body I believe half of this legislation would not be in place. One can see how long it has taken us to ratify this legislation. However, that is no fault of our own, as one does not see people tortured or killed for their religious beliefs, such as Catholics in Pakistan, Muslims in Egypt, those who do not believe in the new Jewish State, Jews in other parts of the world, or, as Senator Norris said, homosexuals in strict Muslim countries. We know that but I am more concerned with my country, both North and South of the Border. If we pass this legislation, we will be eliminating torture on a systematic basis by Governments.</P>
    <P>Torture has never been the policy of any Irish Government, but we need only think of the &ldquo;Heavy Gang&rdquo; that was in operation for a while in the police. Nobody curbed them for a long time. Was that torture? According to the definition given by the Minister today it was. Will it be tolerated again? I do not know. When someone is subjected to interrogation for hours and hours on end, is that torture? The only way we will ever stop torture is by adopting the Amnesty International 12 point programme for the prevention of torture, which it promulgated in 1993. I will read them into the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The first point is the official condemnation of torture. It says that the highest authorities of every country should demonstrate their total opposition to torture &ndash; we are doing that &ndash; and should make clear to all law enforcement personnel that torture will not be tolerated under any circumstances. The second point concerns limits on incommunicado detention. People should not be held without being allowed to contact a lawyer or their family in order that they may be abused in some way when in detention. The third is that there should be no secret detention or secret centres where people are taken. Governments should ensure that prisoners are held in publicly recognised places and that accurate information about their whereabouts is made available to their relatives and lawyers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> The fourth point covers safeguards during interrogation and custody. There should be procedures for detention and interrogation. Independent investigation of reports of torture is the fifth point, and the methods and findings of such investigations should be made public. The sixth step is that no statements extracted under torture should be used in any legal proceedings, but that does not always happen. Some people are sensitive and may be tortured in a way that tougher people would pass off.</P>
    <P>We adhere to the seventh step, which is the prohibition of torture in law. We also adhere to the prosecution of alleged torturers and the principle that those responsible for torture should be brought to justice, which is the eighth step. However, the ninth step refers to training procedures. It should be made clear during the training of all officials involved in the custody or interrogation of prisoners that torture is a criminal act. They should be instructed that they are obliged to refuse to obey any order to torture &ndash; again I refer to the definition used by the Minister which is wide ranging and will present problems for interrogation by police forces.</P>
    <P>The tenth point states that victims of torture and their dependants should be entitled to compensation and rehabilitation. The eleventh step concentrates on the international response. Governments should use all available channels to intercede with other Governments accused of torture &ndash; Ireland does that well. The twelfth point relates to ratification of international instruments. All Governments should ratify international instruments containing safeguards and remedies against torture, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and its optional protocol which provides for individual complaints. Our work today is in line with that.</P>
    <P>We all agree that torture is bad, that it only happens somewhere else and that tortures should be punished. However, by ratifying this legislation we are saying that torture may be closer to home than we imagine. Torture is not just hanging someone upside down and beating them with sticks; it is much more subtle. As the Minister said, it can by psychological as well as physical. It can be intimidatory and achieved by putting undue pressure on people. I know of cases where people were told their families would be pursued if they did not say something when interrogated.</P>
    <P>If we pass this Bill we will be doing a good day's work. I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill forward so quickly, given that it had been neglected for so long. In his brief so far he has shown his willingness to tackle difficult issues and to produce legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the legislation and welcome it. It is unfortunate that we waited so long to do something so important. We always seem to be behind the door in committing ourselves to UN conventions we have signed. Nonetheless, the <Col N="43" /> Bill is welcome now that it is here and I compliment the Minister for introducing it &ndash; some of his predecessors could have done so but did not because it brings us into the global mainstream.</P>
      <P>I wish to have a few points clarified. I was assured by the officials that the Bill's definition of torture is the UN definition, which means there is no need to spend time looking at it. Perhaps he could give his view on the connection between section 2(4)(b) and section 6. Section 2(4)(b) provides that torture is an act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, either physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for any reason based on any form of discrimination. That is quite clear and previous legislation has defined what we, in this country, mean by &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;. A previous speaker mentioned discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Section 6(d) amends section 44(2) of the Extradition Act, 1965, to provide exemptions for people who may be subjected to torture. However, the explanatory memorandum states that an application for extradition shall not be signed if there are grounds for believing that the person's position would be prejudiced on account of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion or vulnerability to torture. That does not seem to provide for a person who may be tortured because of his or her sexual orientation, which could happen in certain fundamentalist regimes.</P>
      <P>The Bill's definition of torture does not include any act which arises solely from or is inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions. &ldquo;Lawful sanctions&rdquo; are not outlined or defined in the Bill, so perhaps the Minister could clarify what this means in the UN context. For instance, it is a &ldquo;lawful sanction&rdquo;, in as much as it is allowed by law in certain fundamentalist countries, to amputate the hand of a person who has been caught stealing. Stoning is also an accepted sanction for certain anti-social behaviour in some countries. Anyone in this Chamber would regard either of those punishments as torture. How would the Bill apply in the event of a person being worried about being found guilty of an act of larceny in another country where the sanction for that offence was the amputation of a hand?</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain why the terms &ldquo;public official&rdquo; and &ldquo;torture&rdquo; are not defined in the interpretation section but in section 2 &ndash; there must be a reason for that. &ldquo;Public official&rdquo; is said to include a person acting in an official capacity. That is vague &ndash; I do not know what &ldquo;an official capacity&rdquo; means and it is not explained anywhere. Does it mean acting on behalf of the State or an arm of the State? This is fundamental because a public official may be charged under this Bill, as may be someone acting at the instigation, consent or acquiescence of a public official. We therefore need to know what is meant by that phrase in this case and how far it extends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> Does it include, for instance, a Head of State on his or her own? Dr. Sheila Cassidy is well known to Irish people because she was tortured under the Pinochet regime in Chile and is very outspoken. In the event that it could be proven that public officials were acting with the acquiescence of the Head of State, to put it at its mildest, is the Head of State liable to be found guilty of torture under this legislation and the UN conventions? In Britain there is considerable debate about whether a Head of State can be found guilty of the crimes of the regime over which he presided. After the war it was found necessary to hang Lord Haw-Haw who was involved in propaganda, whereas it appears, under the nightmare scenario, that if the British had got their hands on Hitler they would not have been able to take any action against him. He might have been prosecuted in the Nuremberg trials but that is different. I ask that the position be clarified.</P>
    <P>The point was well made by a previous speaker about what is happening on our island. We heard extraordinary stories about the activities in places like Castlereagh during the last 30 years and one hopes we have moved on from that. We are also aware of official involvement in clouding investigations into those events, and official collusion to ensure the facts did not emerge. It is important that this Bill should also deal with people who colluded in some way in covering up torture. The Bill mentions those who aid, abet, counsel or procure torture but does not mention a person who conspires, after the event, to deny justice in the sense we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Those questions arise for me on a casual reading of the legislation and I would like to hear the Minister's response. I have been involved in Amnesty International and listened to the remarks of Senator Ryan and Senator Norris; that body's annual report is always hair-raising in terms of what we are prepared to put up with and tolerate. It also raises the question of where we stand on Partnership for Peace, which is a difficult issue, but there is no doubt that the world needs policing and we will have to find a way of doing it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could take on board something we should do more about, which is that many victims of torture turn up on this island as refugees and asylum seekers &ndash; not always as refugees as defined by the convention but as people who come to escape a regime. I will not rehearse the debate about how we should meet, greet and look after them because that is for another day, but the Minister should consider counselling, support and help for victims of torture. I have encouraged that for a number of years, without much success, but it is an important matter and we in the developed world should be supportive of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and I am gratified that it has at last been introduced. The Minister can take credit for that, particularly as many of his predecessors simply ignored the need for <Col N="45" /> legislation or did not act quickly enough. I hope the Bill will gain the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their kind remarks and I express my appreciation to those who contributed so constructively to the debate. Like many Members, I believe this is an important Bill and the tone and content of the debate was very constructive.</P>
      <P>Everyone will agree that even the eloquence of Senators cannot adequately express the total abhorrence we feel about the misery and suffering inflicted on the countless victims of torture. As legislators, we naturally wish to play our part in bringing to justice those who are responsible for these horrendous crimes. It goes without saying it is important that we are in a position as quickly as possible to ratify the UN convention by bringing forward this legislation. I am pleased to have been able to do so. There may have been some validity in criticising the delay in bringing forward the legislation, given that Ireland signed the convention in 1992. I can only say that, in the context of my extensive programme of law reform, I gave the legislation considerable priority and I am glad to be bringing it forward at this point.</P>
      <P>Examples were given during the debate of atrocities which have been committed in various parts of the world. The House will appreciate that, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it does not fall directly within my brief to comment on these matters but I assure Members that the concerns they legitimately expressed about specific international human rights issues will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>A number of the issues underlying the legislation have been highlighted by the Pinochet case. That matter was raised some time ago in the Lower House when the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out that abuses of human rights in any country are of concern to the entire international community. He reminded the Dáil that, during the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, Ireland strongly condemned the violations of human rights carried out by that regime. While the Minister believed that the perpetrators of all human rights abuses should be brought to justice, he indicated that this could only be done in accordance with the jurisdiction and laws of the country concerned or within the framework of specific international legal instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will understand why I am reluctant to comment on the case currently before the Law Lords. I understand that the central question at issue is one of whether, in light of international law, the individual in question has immunity against the extradition proceedings. While my officials will monitor developments in respect of that case in terms of the consideration of the legal issues involved, at this stage I would make the <Col N="46" /> point that, under Article 29.3 of the Constitution, &ldquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States&rdquo;. Obviously Irish courts would have regard to this in considering cases which may come before them where such considerations arise.</P>
    <P>To return to the more general issues raised by the Bill, the House may be aware that the Law Reform Commission in its report on non-fatal offences against the person stated that the creation of such an offence in domestic law would give concrete effect to the principle that torture constitutes a serious violation of the right to bodily integrity, which warrants special prohibition and punishment in the criminal law. It would also lend consistency and coherence to Ireland's condemnation of the practice of torture elsewhere. The commission recommended that consideration be given to the creation of a specific offence of torture, thereby also facilitating Ireland's accession to the UN convention. That is precisely what the Bill before the House does.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that criticism by us of the behaviour of other states in the area of human rights can sound hollow if our record in our own jurisdiction can be called into question. Like Senator O'Donovan, I believe this country's human rights record has been good not least because for over 60 years the citizens of this country have been protected by a bill of rights, namely, Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Significant developments are under way in respect of the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction &ndash; particularly, as Senator O'Donovan stated, in the context of the British-Irish Agreement. Under the Agreement the Government has undertaken to further strengthen the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction. Senators will recall from the Agreement that the Government's commitments in this regard extend to bringing forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights, drawing on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights. The question of incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law must also be further examined in this context. In addition, the Government has undertaken to establish a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that of the Human Rights Commission recently established in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department was assigned a lead role in respect of formulating proposals on these commitments. The latest position in this regard is as follows. The question of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into our law is currently being examined by a small group of experts from my Department, the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General. In this way it is hoped to examine the range of options open to <Col N="47" /> us, particularly in relation to the legal policy issues and the technicalities that inevitably will be involved in this complex area. The work of the group will have to take into account the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution as well as the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Group which are contained in its 1996 report. The work of the group is proceeding as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>Work on the establishment of a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland is continuing as a matter of priority. I hope to be in a position to bring heads of a Bill to Government in the near future. Draft heads of the Bill were circulated to Departments early last month. In this regard the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the Dáil on 2 December 1998 that the heads of the Bill, when approved by the Government, will be circulated to two Dáil committees &ndash; the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights and the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. I had hoped that this could be done before the Christmas recess but, due to the need for detailed consultation with Departments and detailed discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, this was not possible. I hope to be in a position to have the heads of the Bill approved by the Government very soon.</P>
    <P>While I am not in a position at this stage to provide details of my commission proposals, the Taoiseach has already indicated that, when established, the human rights commission should be a model of its kind in Europe. In this regard, my proposals are taking as their starting point the UN's Paris Principles which were adopted in 1993 as a blueprint for national human rights institutions. It is the Government's hope to create rather than follow the standards of best international practice in this field. I am confident that, when presented, my proposals will find broad acceptance both inside and outside the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the best traditions of this House's concern for human rights, today's debate has been extremely useful. As indicated at the outset, all the views expressed will be fully considered before Committee Stage to which I look forward. At this stage, however, I will refer briefly to a number of the comments made by Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor raised the issue of the international criminal court. The Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted at Rome in July 1997 must be ratified by 60 states before it can come into effect. More than 70 countries, including Ireland, have already signed the Rome statute. In regard to ratification, it must be borne in mind that this statute is a long and complex document with 13 Parts and 128 Articles, in respect of which no reservation was permitted. As a first step, these will require careful and detailed consideration to determine the nature and scope of <Col N="48" /> the legal and administrative measures which may be required to be adopted for the State to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute. The State may proceed to have it ratified when all the necessary legal and administrative procedures have been put in place. I am not in a position to say how long this process might take, but I assure the Senator it will be given a high priority.</P>
    <P>It is proper that I should congratulate Senator Ryan, not so much on his joining the new-old Labour Party, but on his appointment as the new-old Labour Party's spokesman on Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To move to Senator Norris's contribution, the Bill does not provide for mandatory sentences. The legal phrase &ldquo;shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life&rdquo; is a standard formula used where the intention is that the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. The term &ldquo;shall be liable&rdquo; does not mean a life sentence must be imposed. I do not blame Senator Norris if he was misled by the explanatory memorandum. It might have inadvertently given the impression the life sentence was mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris also referred to punishment beatings. While they do not come within the technical definition of the Bill, I agree a clear message should emanate from this House that punishment beatings are wrong. They should stop now. No man or woman has the right to be judge and-or executioner in such matters. I agree with the Senator when he deplores these barbarous attacks.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the phrase &ldquo;does not include any such act that arises solely from, or is inherent in, or is incidental to lawful sanctions&rdquo;. This, as the Senator pointed out, is taken from the convention. Imprisonment may, by itself, cause an individual severe mental pain and that is the type of exception which would be at issue. It would also be the case that the exception in question would allow states which still operate capital punishment to be party to the convention.</P>
      <P>Returning a person to a country, covered by Article 3, specifically refers to grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture. That seems to imply that this relates to a specific danger to a certain person; in those circumstances I do not believe the type of blanket assurance mentioned by the Senator would be at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the addition of the word &ldquo;torture&rdquo; to section 50(2) of the Extradition Act, 1965. I can confirm that the definition of &ldquo;torture&rdquo; which applies to the 1965 Act is the same definition included in section 2 of this Bill. <Col N="49" /> The Senator raised the question of the definition of &ldquo;public official&rdquo;. I am advised the drafting intention was to make this definition as inclusive as possible. It appears there is little doubt that a head of state of the type referred to by Senator O'Toole would be a person acting in an official capacity.</P>
    <P>I hope that covers the majority of the points raised. I again thank Senators for their tremendous co-operation on this important matter and look forward to Committee Stage in the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to initiate as a matter of urgency effective measures to:</P>
      <P>(1)eliminate litter pollution,</P>
      <P>(2)tackle the deterioration in water quality, and</P>
      <P>(3)expedite the objectives of the Waste Management Act.</P>
      <P>As a member of a party which is part of this Coalition Government, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to congratulate the Government, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, whose presence here I welcome, on the strides they have made in dealing with environmental protection. However, sadly I am not in a position to do so. That is why my party has tabled this motion. I wish to address the problems of litter, water pollution and waste management.</P>
      <P>Litter is the most malignant manifestation of our throwaway society. It is a blemish on our landscape, urban and rural, an impediment to economic growth and a huge drain on public resources. Local authorities are currently spending in excess of £30 million annually on litter control and the taxpayers and ratepayers who provide that money must be concluding that they are getting very poor value and a very poor return on their investment. That should not be the case.</P>
      <P>While there is modern, workable legislation on the Statute Book, it is only being sporadically enforced. The Government's response to this has been, at best, very weak and hesitant. It is 18 months since it took office, yet there is little visible improvement. A national clean-up week is promised for April 1999. While this is a good gesture it will not achieve lasting results. Why have we had to wait so long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to find models of good practice we need only look to the tidy towns and villages, <Col N="50" /> places such as Clonakilty and Kenmare, to see how they organise themselves and how they can achieve a total litter-free streetscape and environment. It should not take 20 months to put in place a clean-up campaign. Rooting out entrenched bad habits demands a much more comprehensive and sustained campaign. There must be a carrot and stick approach. A well planned programme of public education must be put in place, targeted at the public and at schools.</P>
    <P>The Government recently allocated £350,000 for publicity campaigns to deal with the litter problem to be divided between 27 local authorities. That is a derisory amount and cannot be expected to achieve the intended results. Responsibility for enforcing the Waste Management Act &ndash; good legislation which I worked hard on when I was a Member of the other House &ndash; is rightly delegated to the local authorities. However, they have been given no additional funding to implement this legislation and they have been promised no professional expertise.</P>
    <P>Most local authorities have litter plans in place, but their implementation falls far short of what is needed. The littered conditions of our streets is the verdict on their efforts. It is time to change tack. I call on the Minster of State to take the matter in hand and to ensure that the litter pollution legislation is rigorously and comprehensively enforced.</P>
    <P>The Garda is charged with responsibility for enforcing the law and this entails supplementing the work of litter wardens. How many gardaí take that part of their duties seriously? Has the Minister tried to enlist their help in dealing with the frightful scourge of litter? Has he advised them of their requirement to enforce the legislation in this area? If it was enforced with the same vigour as the laws on parking or drink driving we would have a different story. I would not be here this evening. Is not one law on the Statute Book as important as another? A law that is not enforced falls into disrepute. I ask the Minister to take a strong lead on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also initiate a well focused, sustained programme of public education. The Government and the local authorities, each in their own area, must give leadership. It takes strong, committed and passionate leadership to tackle this problem. I hope this will happen following this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minster must also consult with the Minster for Finance with the purpose of ensuring that tax penalties are put in place to discourage the use of disposable packaging, much of which ends up as litter. The use of plastic bags must be especially discouraged. When in Opposition, the Minister promised to tackle this issue but nothing has happened in the interim. I ask the Minister of State to ensure the matter is addressed from here on.</P>
    <P>The Government should implement a set of proper specifications for the reinstatement of works undertaken by or on behalf of all public <Col N="51" /> sector utilities. It must also ensure that it is a requirement of all future planning permissions for commercial developments that they should include properly positioned, maintained and serviced litter bins.</P>
    <P>In addition, it must be a requirement that those engaged in new road developments must provide for the disposal, collection and cleaning up of litter arising from their activities. This is very important. Millions of pounds are spent on road construction every year. When work is partially or fully completed a residue of cones, signs and rubbish is left behind. The contractor collects his money and leaves the mess for somebody else to clean up. That should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also ensure that national specifications for advertising hoardings are drawn up so that all named persons or organisations who engage in the illegal posting of flyers could then be prosecuted because they would be identifiable and traceable. In addition, all local authorities who are charged with responsibility for litter prevention and control must be required to put their houses in order and must adopt a quality control standard subject to outside verification in respect of all their operations. That is a very coherent list of items which, if put in place &ndash; and they can be put in place, there is no mystique about any of this &ndash; would make a huge difference and would certainly help eliminate the litter problem.</P>
    <P>A country that takes almost £2 billion annually from tourism and is dependent on tourism for its economic survival cannot afford to ignore the litter problem any longer. A country that depends on discriminating outsiders to eat its food grown in a clean environment cannot afford to ignore the litter problem any longer.</P>
    <P>With the kind permission of the Cathaoirleach I will share the remainder of my time with Senator Dardis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of the tidy towns stems from good local leadership and a sense of local patriotism. That can be instilled but will only happen if the leadership is there. The law on litter must be stringently enforced.</P>
      <P>On water quality, I am very worried about the constant deterioration in the quality of our drinking water. Unless something is done very quickly to arrest and reverse that process, very soon there will be signs up in tourist hotels stating that the water in the tap is not fit for drinking. I hope that will not be allowed to happen through our negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. It is reasonable to state that in respect of environmental pro<Col N="52" /> tection and the environment generally, I do not believe there is an issue in the public domain in Ireland which creates more rhetoric, more reports and destruction of the rain forests, in terms of the amount of literature distributed and less concrete evidence on the ground of anything happening to improve the situation before us, than this subject.</P>
      <P>In my lifetime there has been a continuing deterioration of our lakes, rivers and water quality, more litter on our streets, lanes and highways and greater problems in respect of ground water as a result of waste disposal. Yet we proclaim to be a green, environmentally correct isle that can be held up as a model to attract tourists and we claim to the world that our food is produced under the best conditions. I believe our food is of a very high quality and by international standards it is produced in a relatively unintensive way. We have a tremendous product in terms of the tourism package we promote. However, these are sensitive issues and if we continue along the road we are going, these two aspects of enormous economic benefit &ndash; they are not just of philosophical and aesthetic benefit &ndash; will be lost.</P>
      <P>The large multinational companies, such as Intel and Hewlett Packard in Kildare are attracted to Ireland not only by the favourable tax regime. Part of the reason they came was that they found an attractive environment which fit in well with the image of the companies they were trying to promote.</P>
      <P>I met one of the senior executives of Hewlett Packard while on holiday in the west. I did not know who he was and I met him by chance, and then he told me who he was. I asked him what he found distasteful about Ireland. He told me there were two things: one was litter and the other was smoking in public bars. We can probably do something about the litter but I suspect we will not be successful in eliminating smoking in public houses. Nevertheless this tells us something about what major international investors require. The surveys carried out by Bord Fáilte confirm that one of the enduring criticisms of visitors is the amount of litter on our highways and byways.</P>
      <P>It is not only the responsibility of Government or local authorities to correct these matters. Obviously somebody must clean up, but every citizen who is properly committed to his country has a responsibility not to throw material out of car windows and to ensure children do not throw rubbish away. Similarly the black plastic surrounding bales of silage should not be thrown indiscriminately around the country. We all have individual responsibilities in this respect and sometimes that is lost sight of in this debate.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on the matter on which Senator Quill concluded, namely water quality. There is potential for catastrophe in this area. Several Ministers apart from the Minister with us this evening &ndash; whom I welcome &ndash; have had to endure my angling odyssey around the country. I will now subject him to my angling odyssey around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> It began in Lough Ennell outside Mullingar, I had to leave because of the amount of sewage from a deficient treatment plant. The lake turned green. The fish were not killed but there was no fishing. Then I went to Lough Sheelin where the pig farmers had almost destroyed the premier wild brown trout fishery in Europe. I left Lough Sheelin and went to Lough Conn where there was eutrophication from two sources, agriculture and sewage. The same is happening in Lough Mask, Lough Corrib and Killarney. These are not isolated incidents. Similar things have been happening progressively over recent years.</P>
    <P>In the case of the River Liffey which flows within 200 yards of my house, Dublin Corporation abstracts 53 million gallons a day from the headwaters of the River Liffey in Ballymore Eustace. Dublin Corporation has permission to abstract 73 million gallons a day and in a recent document which came before the Mid-East Regional Authority, of which I am a member, it stated it was expanding the Ballymore Eustace facility. The mean flow in the River Liffey is 190 million gallons a day. It is now proposed to take half of the mean flow out of the river. People think it is scare-mongering to suggest that can have catastrophic environmental consequences. The evidence in our nearest neighbour is there to see. Rivers in England have gone dry and disappeared as a result of London's insatiable need for water.</P>
    <P>We all accept that much development is taking place and the population needs water. However, it is not acceptable for all that water to be abstracted from the headwaters of the River Liffey and 40 per cent of it lost through the system. That is not acceptable or prudent environmental management and this is within the responsibility of the State.</P>
    <P>There are alternative sources of water in the River Shannon and the River Barrow and in the aquifer under the Curragh plain. There are environmental consequences as well. When I suggested to the Kildare county engineer that water could be taken from the River Shannon he told me it was technically impossible. However, the report of Generale des Eaux carried out by engineers on the greater Dublin water supply states that it is possible to bring the water from the River Shannon to Dublin. With regard to the consequences in terms of acquiring land and the costs involved, the land is there and does not have to be acquired. It is the right of way along the canal which comes from the River Shannon to Dublin. The land is in public ownership already.</P>
    <P>We need to focus on whether we are really committed to improving the environment or whether we only want to talk about it and publish more reports. Dublin has to dispose of its waste but what do they do? They see the motorway running, which is a very convenient avenue, and look for the nearest point to dump their rubbish. Then they arrive in Kill, a village which won international awards and is the tidiest town in Kildare. <Col N="54" /> They are allowed to put rubbish into a landfill site beside the prettiest village in Kildare with a tributary of the River Liffey flowing almost in the facility. I do not understand how this is allowed to happen. This brings us to the European norm whereby the polluter pays; in this country the polluter does not pay. The polluter can put materials into the water, indiscriminately throw rubbish into landfill sites and not pay. Someone, somewhere, must eventually decide that we must pay. In the United States of America, where there is vastly more land and less people, they tend to do this, and it does cost. We must confront the issue sooner or later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this motion was tabled by one of the Government parties, my immediate thought was that I would hear nothing but praise. I was pleased to hear Senator Quill speak. In the words of Julius Caesar, &ldquo;She came to bury Caesar rather than to praise him&rdquo;. What she said is accurate. She referred to a number of issues which must be faced by everyone in Ireland. In the future we will not get away with what has been happening. She stated that £30 million is spent on trying to eliminate litter pollution. Yet there is no return. There is no additional funding for local authorities for the collection of litter. I recall a committee debate where it was stated that the Aran Islands are introducing a tax on visitors to pay for the disposal of waste on the islands. This is an indication that the Government is not giving enough money to local government to introduce a proper facility for waste management. We are now asking tourists to pay for this. I fear that tourists will be asked to pay for the disposal of the waste we produce. This country likes to be known as green and clean, but I am afraid we cannot claim that.</P>
      <P>One of my pet hates is plastic bags. There was a commitment to get rid of plastic bags and to introduce legislation to ensure we would not use them. This would not be difficult to introduce. It would take only a proper frame of mind for people to decide not to use plastic bags. It is easy to buy bags that can be reused for shopping or recycled. Plastic bags are not properly disposed of and can be seen along the roads and in hedges. They are not considered a problem once they go from one's backyard into a neighbour's backyard. I would like the Government to introduce legislation in this area as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quill stated that if people park their car illegally, they will be immediately fined. There is money to be made from people parking illegally, but there is not as much money to be made from imposing a fine on people who throw litter on the street. I brought up this point at a local government meeting in Galway and was told by the city manager that 25 people will appear in court in Galway in this regard. I ask the media to highlight this fact so that people will become fearful of throwing litter around and ending up in court. We must educate people to be responsible <Col N="55" /> for the cleanliness of their areas and for eliminating litter. In Galway we advertised for an environmental education officer. I am not sure how good he will be or if he will serve his full purpose, but it is a step forward.</P>
    <P>In regard to overall municipal waste management, and comparing us to other European countries, the Minister previously had a target of 20 per cent for the recycling of municipal household and commercial waste by 1999. I believe that has been increased to 50 per cent. I doubt if that target will be reached, but it is worth aiming for. The Netherlands recycles 10 per cent of its waste, Ireland approximately 5 per cent and France 2 per cent. The main means of disposing of waste is by incineration. Politicians are afraid to face up to this concept because they are afraid environmentalists will come down on them like a ton of bricks. We must accept that waste management will have to be addressed in whatever management structures are introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to fisheries and water quality. During a previous debate in this House, I asked the Minister to respond to a point concerning a complaint made to the European Union against the Environmental Protection Agency in Ireland by the Environment Watch Ireland group. Will the Minister of State tell us the Government's response to this complaint? The complaint concerned irregularities in the drinking water monitoring regime in Ireland. It was based on a number of issues. Environment Watch Ireland claims that, with regard to the monitoring of drinking water quality in Ireland, it lodged a formal complaint with the Commission on the following grounds. Based on the Irish Environmental Protection Agency's reports, The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland, published in 1993, 1994 and 1995, it is apparent that some local authorities in Ireland employ an unacceptably low monitoring frequency for most of the water supplies for which they are responsible. They give examples of Mayo, Leitrim and Cavan county councils who appear to monitor some group water supplies only every two years. This is not sufficient. It is its contention that this is an unacceptable and infrequent sampling method and it is in contradiction with the EU directives on member states' obligations to monitor drinking water on a more regular basis. The EPA report The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland 1995, states:</P>
    <P>As part of its normal surveillance programme for drinking water supplies Mayo County Council samples group schemes extensively every other year, so that the 1995 returns show a considerably smaller number of supplies examined as compared to 1994.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation in its document, Drinking Water Supply Surveillance, discusses the sample numbers and frequencies which range from three months to two weeks. The WHO <Col N="56" /> recommends that for a population of in excess of 50,000, sampling should be carried out every week and in the case of a population of 1,000 it should be carried out every three months. Local authorities who carry out sampling every two years do not meet the World Health Organisation's recommendations. On the number of samples taken, the Irish Environmental Protection Agency's reports The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland, published in 1993, 1994 and 1995, indicate that some local authorities in Ireland are taking an unacceptably and statistically unreliable number of water samples during each monitoring cycle of the most public supplies and group water schemes. It contends that the number of samples being analysed at such a low frequency cannot provide even remotely reliable information on water quality given the wide range of fluctuations and the number of concentrations that occur. For example, given that e. coli contamination can range from 0 to 100 colonies per 100 ml within a 30 day period, if there is an examination just once a year, or every two years, it is evident that fluctuations could occur. It is meaningless to draw conclusions about water quality based on one sample taken every year.</P>
    <P>According to the report, other bacteriological contaminants are not being examined. This is condemnation of the type and frequency of sampling which is being brought to the notice of the Commission. I asked for a response to this matter which I have not received to date. Perhaps the Minister of State will inform me of the changes being made in the frequency and type of testing that will be carried out in the future.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion raises issues of great importance to the optimal management of our environment and I welcome the opportunity to outline a number of specific actions being taken by my Department to tackle these issues.</P>
      <P>I would like to begin with the issue of litter. I fully admit that our litter pollution problem is a national scandal and is totally unacceptable. It is essentially a local and individual problem requiring responses from local authorities, businesses, community groups and individual citizens. I am determined to ensure that all possible realistic steps are taken to tackle this self-inflicted blight on our environment.</P>
      <P>As you know the primary management and enforcement response to the litter problem must come from the local authorities. The 1997 Litter Pollution Act empowers local authorities to take strong action against those who generate litter and requires a new and more structured approach to litter management planning. The Act's provisions are extensive and cover a wide variety of visually polluting activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many local authorities are beginning to use these extensive management and enforcement powers more vigorously. My Department has <Col N="57" /> been tracking the levels of effectiveness of their activities using regular statistical returns which clearly show that local authorities have stepped up enforcement.</P>
    <P>Statistics comparing the first six months of 1997 with the same period in 1998 confirm this. For example, the number of litter wardens in place increased by 125 per cent from 85 to 191 over the year. An equivalent pattern was seen in relation to the number of on-the-spot fines where the number of such fines levied increased by 224 per cent from 981 to 3,175. Prosecutions more than trebled to over 500 in the same period. Despite this clear evidence of substantial progress, I would be the first to admit that much remains to be done to eradicate litter.</P>
    <P>I have taken every possible opportunity to call on local authorities to make full use of their powers to take effective anti-litter action under the various provisions of the 1997 Act. Local authorities can also deploy some of the additional resources now available from the local government fund to bolster such activities. I have certainly stressed that to local management.</P>
    <P>Among of the range of anti-litter activities which we are currently either promoting or supporting, I would like to briefly comment on just two. The first is the imminent implementation of a national litter pollution monitoring system which has twin objectives, namely, to monitor and assess local authority performance in litter prevention and control and to correspondingly advise my Department of the need for supplementary action at national level. This system will continually monitor the extent of the litter problem and critically review the effectiveness of local anti-litter measures. In particular the system will help to identify particular litter blackspots and thus prompt local authorities to take the appropriate corrective responses.</P>
    <P>The other project which I would like to highlight is the forthcoming National Spring Clean 1999 programme initiated by An Taisce. This exciting campaign involves a broad based approach involving national and local government, an NGO and major private sector companies as co-sponsors. It will encourage people in groups from all walks of life to become involved in cleaning up their local environment. This project will focus national attention on litter in a high profile, sustained and co-ordinated manner across all sectors of society. I believe that the campaign has substantial potential to drastically reduce the level of litter pollution in this country and it deserves widespread public support and practical involvement.</P>
    <P>We have increased our funding for litter awareness activities to £526,000 this year and will be working with local authorities, business and the education sector to secure real action against litter across local communities. In particular, I am anxious to encourage greater involvement by the business community at local level as co-owners <Col N="58" /> of the problem and genuine partners in finding a solution.</P>
    <P>Social attitudes, public behaviour, our sense of civic pride, our welcome to tourists, the value we all place on a clean environment, all of these must come into play if we are to successfully eradicate litter. Public responsibility and enforcement and other measures by local authorities are the key to success.</P>
    <P>Turning to water quality, I want to emphasise that the bulk of Irish surface water is of good quality and is suitable for the most sensitive uses. The most recently published EPA report covering the period 1991-4 shows that 71 per cent of river channel length and 77 per cent of lakes surveyed came within the unpolluted category. Serious pollution had been reduced from about 6 per cent of river channel length over 20 years ago to less than 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Slight or moderate pollution arising from eutrophication was recorded in 28 per cent of river channel length during the period in question. This represents the biggest challenge in terms of water quality management in Ireland. Eutrophication arises primarily from excessive phosphorous loadings. Agriculture was identified as the single biggest contributor to phosphorous pollution levels with sewage and industry also significant contributors.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive national strategy to combat the eutrophication of rivers and lakes is being promoted by my Department. The primary objective of the strategy is to redress the deterioration in water quality caused by excessive inputs of phosphorus. The strategy sets out targets for the reduction in phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes. These targets were given statutory effect in July last year when I made regulations prescribing national water quality standards for phosphorus.</P>
    <P>I am also addressing the question of the phosphorus contribution from detergents. In this regard, I hope very shortly to finalise a voluntary agreement with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association. This will be designed to secure quantified reductions in the use of phosphate based detergents within a specified timeframe.</P>
    <P>A code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution from agriculture is being promoted by my own Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food. Nutrient management planning is now a requirement under REPS. Some 40,000 farmers currently participate in the REP scheme and it is hoped to extend the scheme to an additional 10,000 farmers by the end of 1999. Teagasc has significantly revised its guidelines for the application of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>These measures are already beginning to show results. In the last two years, it is estimated that there has been a 20 per cent reduction in the use of phosphorus chemical fertiliser, down from 62,000 tonnes per year to 50,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> My Department is engaged in a major investment programme to upgrade sewage infrastructural facilities throughout the country. Total investment under this programme is estimated at £1.3 billion up to 2005 and is substantially supported by EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. Last month the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, announced a record investment of £257 million in the 1999 water services programme &ndash; an increase of 50 per cent on expenditure in 1998.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the range of measures we are pursuing will lead to the reversal of past trends within an acceptable timeframe.</P>
    <P>The overall policy of the Government in relation to waste management is set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium and more recently Waste Management &ndash; Changing our Ways which was published in October last year. These policy documents are firmly grounded in an internationally recognised hierarchy of options &ndash; prevention, minimisation, reuse/recycling, energy recovery and environmentally sustainable disposal of waste which cannot be recovered.</P>
    <P>Giving clear and practical expression to the requirement of this hierarchy is a challenge for modern waste management. Changing our Ways provides a national framework within which the local authorities, and indeed the waste industry can plan ahead with confidence and achieve the objectives of the Waste Management Act. Although local authorities are vital to the achievement of our waste policy objectives, the participation of Government, industry and society as a whole is also essential.</P>
    <P>The key objectives identified in the policy statement are meaningful strategic planning on a regionalised basis; a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach which can deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets; greater participation by the private sector in the provision of waste services; an equitable system of waste charges which promotes waste minimisation and recovery and the further development of producer responsibility initiatives and the mobilisation of public support and participation.</P>
    <P>We are very conscious of the fact that waste services are the least developed of the environmental services traditionally delivered by local authorities, but we have a clear agenda for change and are pursuing it intensively. The completion of regional strategy studies and adoptions of waste management plans are well advanced and I expect that the planning process will be substantially completed by mid-1999; a system is in place for the licensing by the EPA of all significant waste disposal and recovery activities, including landfill sites; the infrastructure of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities for recyclables, including well equipped civic amenity sites, is being steadily developed with support under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99; we have also recognised that producer responsi<Col N="60" /> bility initiatives allow industry to use its expertise to devise workable and least-cost arrangements for waste recovery on a sectoral level. REPAK has planned substantial expansion in 1999; we have invited the construction industry to develop proposals for a producer responsibility initiative aimed at meeting ambitious recovery targets for construction and demolition waste &ndash; discussions have begun in this regard with one of the main representative organisations; the motor industry has also been invited to develop proposals on end-of-life vehicles while we have also had initial discussions with industry on waste electronic and electrical equipment; much more remains to be done in relation to waste recycling. While low population density and peripheral local and market limitations will always place a certain constraint on the achievement of high levels of materials recycling, we will be placing a particular focus this year on the necessary approaches to achieving our recycling targets and my Department has set up a specially resourced unit to pursue implementation of public private partnership arrangements in respect of waste and other major infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Across our agenda, whether in relation to litter, waste or protection and conservation of natural resources, public awareness and responsibility are critical to solving &ndash; and indeed preventing &ndash; environmental problems. We need to harness public concern in a positive, constructive and well informed way. I am developing a significant new and well resourced environmental awareness campaign this year, to promote more environmentally sustainable behaviour across society. I look forward to public support and participation in this regard. Litter, waste reduction and water protection will remain at the top of our agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his statement. I also welcome this motion because its aim is to draw attention to a horrific problem.</P>
      <P>I believe all legislation on the Statute Book should be enforced and fully implemented. I supported the passage through this House of what is now known as the Waste Management Act. I also remind Senators that legislation on its own cannot bring about change and that is suggested by the wording of this motion. To be fully effective legislation requires at least an acquiescence on the part of the general public, their positive support and in particular their enthusiasm. We have to work on their enthusiasm rather than holding the belief that by passing laws we can solve this problem. The Minister and other speakers have touched on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year and earlier I passed through Singapore and I was enthused by what I saw there. I know people criticise the place for various reasons and that they are very willing to accept authority but this was not about authority. I will briefly describe what happened. I flew by jumbo jet to Singapore and we arrived at the airport at the same time as two other jumbo jets. I thought <Col N="61" /> it would take an hour for us to get through immigration and collect our bags. When I arrived at immigration I was surprised to see how effective it was. All the immigration booths were open. We were welcomed, we were questioned and when that was over we were welcomed again. I was very impressed by the fact that as we arrived at the terminal our bags were already there. I was also very impressed at the way they handled customs. I particularly remember the tough looking Malaysian lady who said to me &ldquo;Are you aware at customs that the death penalty exists for the importation of drugs? Do you have any?&rdquo;  I was impressed by the point they made by these questions.</P>
    <P>What impressed me most was that, as I left the airport building, I was met by a man from my hotel who had been waiting for us and he held up the name of my group. Then he got his car and he asked what we thought of the airport. I said it was very good. He asked about immigration and I said it was perfect. He also asked if our bags reached the terminal before we got there and I said they had. Then he asked about the customs process. He then asked us if we noticed that when he met us he did not park at the kerbside because Singapore airport came second in the competition for the best airport in the world. He said that Singapore would win it that year and that they lost points the previous year at immigration, baggage arrival and customs and because people always double and triple parked and people were blocked and could not get away. The people of Singapore then decided that buses, taxis and citizens were not going to park at the kerbside. It seemed to me that this enthusiasm for solving the problem, for getting to the top and for winning was a national consensus. I am delighted to say that Singapore airport won the title of the best airport for that year. I was very impressed with their national commitment to solve a problem but we do not have that commitment. We must have a national commitment, regardless of the laws we enact. The Minister pointed out some of the steps that have been taken but we have a long way to go. It takes action to market this idea and to get young people involved. We must ensure every citizen is aware that they create litter, pollution problems and unrecycled waste and each individual can do something about it. How do we solve this problem? I am not sure that there is an easy solution to it but I do know that it will not be solved by enacting legislation and thinking we can move on to other business.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan mentioned plastic bags. This issue is very close to my heart because my company is continuously criticised about plastic bags. In my company we have discovered that different areas of Dublin and the country achieved much higher recycling results than mine. My company uses reusable bags. Senator Coogan is correct when he says that the solution is for people to re-use bags when they shop rather than looking for new bags each time. Unfortunately, a very large <Col N="62" /> number of customers misunderstand the problem. I meet a group of customers almost every week and listen to what they have to say about their shopping experiences. Invariably, someone will ask why the supermarkets do not do something about plastic bags. The answer is we cannot do anything about them unless we have the public thinking that way. In some of my shops two-thirds of the customers use reusable bags and in other shops not even 5 per cent do so. We must find a way to solve this misunderstanding. I know from meeting people there will always be someone who says they are all right because they recycle their bags by using them as rubbish bags and then putting them in the tiphead. We must get the message across that it is our citizens who pollute and create the problem and we are the ones who can solve it.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Act is very worthy one because it states that the polluter pays. This Act also has draconian powers. We are careful to state that we have these draconian powers but we prefer that people solve this problem on a voluntary basis. I accept that those of us in business are polluters and, with regard to plastic bags, it is the supermarkets that provide them. We are the polluters and now we have to pay for it and find a solution. Part of the solution is a mindset change on the part of the Irish citizens who say that we do not rely on the law alone and that the law is like a big sword hanging over our heads because if we do not manage to solve this problem it can be enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to REPAK, which faces great challenges. REPAK and others like it can solve this problem, but only if it gets the support of the nation. We must recognise that we as a nation need to change our attitude and the Minister should hold a strong sword over us and put great effort into explaining that we can solve the problem. If we take that attitude, we will solve it. It cannot be solved by law alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus cuirim fáilte freisin roimh an díospóireacht thábhachtach seo atá againn anocht.</P>
      <P>We have a very important motion before us tonight. The environment is of concern to us all and the Minister has a great responsibility in this regard. I welcome the initiatives he has taken to improve the environment in which we live.</P>
      <P>The motion tabled by Senator Quill encompasses a wide area of environmental issues. The elimination of litter pollution is something to which we, as a country, have aspired for many decades. It is only in the recent past that a committed effort to addressing the issue has been made. The initiative taken by the Minister last year to seek a strong commitment from county managers to tackle this issue at local authority level was long overdue. It has spurred action in some local authorities, but more needs to be done. Litter is a blight on our landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> Comparisons have been made during this debate between Ireland and other countries. If one travels throughout the European Union one is struck by the cleanliness of many of the cities and countries. Obviously there is a much higher public commitment to ensuring litter is controlled and not scattered everywhere, as tends to happen here.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Quinn's comments on Singapore. I visited Singapore towards the end of last year and was struck by its cleanliness and the pride of the people there. I spoke to a tourist guide who not only espoused great pride in their cleanliness and litter control, but in their enforcement of legislation. It is a small country like Ireland with a population of approximately three million people; it is a very cosmopolitan area. We could use it as a role model not just in this area, but in relation to issues of law and order, though one might not go as far as it in relation to some of the punishments. Singapore could act as a role model for us in many areas. It has succeeded and takes pride in the fact that it will maintain that standard. A significant comment made to me was that if it fails to keep the city as clean as it is, it will be just like any other location and will not be distinctive. Most people are attracted to the city because of the reputation that it has justifiably gained.</P>
    <P>We need to adopt the attitude of mind to which Senator Quinn referred. It touches the national psyche that we want to be litter-free; we want our towns, cities and countryside to look their best and we want to take pride in that. That will come about through education. Many schools have done tremendous work in this regard. Many local authorities have become involved in environmental programmes within the primary school sector and we in Wexford have promoted the Keep Wexford Beautiful campaign, with prizes for the schools which perform best over the year. That will percolate throughout the public. Many adults have told me they are being corrected by their children for not disposing of litter properly. We are making strides, but much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The tidy town's competition is one example of the effort being made nationally. A commitment is being made to improve our towns. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has taken over that scheme and competition which plays a vital role. I would not decry the need for enforcement in this area. I am not sure Senator Quinn was doing that. There is compliance with litter laws in areas with a good enforcement regime. We tend to treat enforcement, perhaps because of our history, as an optional extra. It should perhaps be the driving force, particularly for those who will not comply. It can be a major deterrent.</P>
    <P>The gardaí pay very little heed to the implementation of this type of legislation. They need to do more. As an alternative, we could have a <Col N="64" /> policing or rangers force within local government for the enforcement of traffic, speed controls etc. Monitoring of the litter problem is important. If local authorities were ranked on an annual basis it would spur them to perform to a much higher standard.</P>
    <P>I had much more to say in relation to water quality and waste management but my time has expired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to what may not be the most newsworthy debate, but it probably more topical and relevant than some of the issues we have discussed. I congratulate the Progressive Democrats, particularly Senators Quill, Dardis and Gibbons for tabling this motion which is very relevant.</P>
      <P>We will be judged on our appearance. While great progress has been made in the tourism area with restoration projects and tourism attractions, if we fall down on a reasonably easy matter to control we will fail. To date we have not succeeded. Senator Walsh mentioned the tidy towns and tidy district competitions. Some areas make tremendous efforts to obtain and retain awards, but there are, unfortunately, other areas where we fall down.</P>
      <P>The issue of enforcement has been mentioned. There is substantial room for improvement in the enforcement of legislation under the litter Acts. The Minister of State indicated there had been a large increase in the number of wardens. This seems to have come from a ridiculously low level of 85. Is that a national figure? I do not know how that figure is broken down by city and town.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is to be complimented on some of the measures he has introduced, but many local authorities are not taking this matter seriously. I recently walked along the seafront at Dun Laoghaire where litter has built up due to carelessness and disregard for the area. Those responsible are litter thugs who leave bottles, rubbish, cigarette packets and other litter along the seafront. Others decide they cannot wait for their refuse to be collected or do not have the initiative to bring their rubbish to a dump, but simply throw it over a wall.</P>
      <P>We have to improve enforcement. People have been convicted on a number of occasions. The sentence handed down in a recent case seemed over the top when someone was ordered to carry out a certain amount of community service cleaning up an area. We have all seen people throwing cigarette butts and other rubbish out of car windows. Litter is not the most serious crime, but we must act if we are not to be seen as a dirty society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I frequently visit a beach near Gorey in County Wexford. If people are intent on dumping litter, they will do so. However, there are practical measures which local authorities can take, such as providing a sufficient number of litter bins on beaches. They should organise competitions or local businesses could gain publicity by spon<Col N="65" /> soring litter bins. If bins are in place they should be emptied regularly. There is nothing worse than seeing litter which has fallen over the side of a bin because it is full. People who are genuine in trying to deposit their rubbish in a litter bin often cannot do so because it is full.</P>
    <P>Most Members are also members of local authorities. They know there is a certain amount of interest in this subject, but there is no local authority which cannot improve its performance in this area. Some can improve a lot. I would be interested to hear what is envisaged in the campaign being launched.</P>
    <P>We have concentrated on litter in this debate. Water quality and waste management are also aspects of this issue. Most of the large store owners in Blackrock, including Senator Quinn, provide an area in their carparks for recycling bottles, cans and other items. There must be more encouragement for such initiatives. Senator Quinn and the owners of other large stores such as Tesco and Dunnes Stores, should consider sponsoring competitions to make people more aware of waste management, litter, recycling and other such matters. People could be asked questions and there could be a free draw or points awarded.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome debate and we should return to this issue at a later stage. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State speaking about the spring campaign and the extra litter wardens. He might also consider a survey on how this problem is approached in local authority areas. We are all aware of some areas where there are particular problems, but these problems exist in all areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Progressive Democrat Senators on tabling this motion. This issue is worth serious consideration if we are to make tourism even better in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is a welcome motion and one which is close to my heart as I have discussed it on many occasions in my local authority. I am knowledgeable on what has and can be done to tackle this problem. I compliment the Minister of State on his efforts to deal with this issue and to enforce the laws on litter.</P>
      <P>Litter is a national disaster. One only has to walk along a street in any town or village to see the amount of litter dropped by Joe Citizen with total disregard for the environment. The Minister of State has made huge strides in enforcing the anti-litter legislation, as has been shown by the substantial increase in the number of wardens. The number has increased from 85 to 191 &ndash; by 125 per cent. That is a great plus about which I did not know. I welcome this increase as it is a great opportunity to provide litter wardens in each local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also said that prosecutions have trebled to over 500 in the same period; this is worthwhile information. We are active and the Minister of State is monitoring the prob<Col N="66" /> lem, even though he acknowledged that a great deal more needs to be done. I also welcome the two initiatives to be implemented this year, the national litter pollution monitoring system and co-operation with An Taisce to join with local groups for clean-ups. This is all worthwhile and we all agree progress is being made.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn used a phrase which reflects my thinking, that this is a &ldquo;national commitment&rdquo;. These are two words which should be borne in mind. In my local authority, in the environs of local schools, wardens are out at 12.30 p.m. and by 1.30 p.m. the place is littered again. I do not know whether the Department of the Environment and Local Government can do anything about this. An education programme is necessary. How best can we get young people and their parents to co-operate with the local authorities, the Department and any initiatives coming on stream to eradicate this problem? One can pump all the money one likes into this problem and give grants to local authorities, but if there is no local motivation nothing will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I will give another example. There are three takeaways in one part of my constituency. At 2 o'clock on Friday and Saturday mornings, the litter there is unbelievable. What can we do to eradicate litter at this stage? The gardaí have a huge role to play, although I do not know whether they can be used&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or whether we can bring in another force within the local authorities to tackle this issue. Young people aged 17, 18 and 19 years who have been educated and told they cannot litter the streets go to nightclubs and afterwards litter the streets. If one were with visitors, it would make one ashamed to pass through certain villages.</P>
      <P>There must be national commitment and motivation. The local authorities are doing a good job and I compliment my local authority which has introduced a new cleansing unit in its environment section to deal with this problem. It has subcontracted the job of cleaning and sweeping the roads to a private consortium. This is a big move and a programme has been initiated.</P>
      <P>However, it is a long haul. One of the first items on the agenda of every residents' association meeting I attend is the eradication of litter. I tell them I or the local authority cannot do any more, that the litter warden is present at the meeting and that all necessary facilities are available. However, we cannot sweep the street, when the next day it is back to its original littered state. We need an awareness programme. Perhaps we need more personnel rather than financial resources to get the information to the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our schools have reneged on their responsibilities. They have never discussed waste management or educated children about recycling supermarket bags or depositing our refuse in ways, <Col N="67" /> other than dumping it on the street for someone else to pick up. The responsibility is always passed to someone else. We are not taking responsibility for our behaviour when it comes to our environment. Responsibility and awareness could start at household level. In the home, parents and children can build up a concept of the environment. If one gets that right and the concept spreads to agricultural, commercial and construction areas, we can teach society it has a role to play in making our country look beautiful.</P>
    <P>We may be benefiting from the Celtic tiger but we are failing miserably in pride in our country. That is why I hope the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in conjunction with local authorities, can do more marketing. I do not know whether it will work and I know the Minister of State has done his best. However, one can throw all the money one wants at this problem which the Minister of State has done &ndash; but it still will not work. I hope a marketing programme can be implemented, in co-operation with all the groups interested in the environment who will make it work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important subject. A great deal of lip service is paid to solving the problems we are discussing &ndash; litter, waste, the quality of our water, etc. We are providing funds to deal with these problems. However, the amount of litter which accumulates daily is frightening. What seems to be happening is that the amount of litter is growing at a faster rate than the economy. What is going wrong?</P>
      <P>While our local authorities are doing a great deal of good work, I question whether they have a genuine commitment to solving the problem. As was mentioned by a number of other speakers, litter bins on a street or on the beach need to be emptied regularly. Practically in every street of every town, and at weekends in particular, the people go to the chipper late at night and their litter is strewn all over the streets. In most places, there is no collection of that litter until Monday. The bins are full and there is nowhere to put the litter, even if people are prepared to bin it.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on all of us to take this matter seriously. I do not believe we are doing so. Very few towns can hold their heads high and say they are proud of the way they manage their litter. There is no doubt that some are doing good work. However, there is another problem and one does not have to go any further than outside the front door of this building to see it, and that is chewing gum. A great sum of money has been spent putting down footpaths in every town but a great number of them are ruined by chewing gum. There may be no litter, but there is chewing gum. This is an indication of our attitude to the environment. That is why I said we are paying lip service to the problem. We all talk about wanting a nice environment, yet we throw chewing gum on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> I do not wish to dwell on the litter problem for too long as many speakers have discussed it. However, I wish to make some points about water quality and how the agricultural community can contribute towards ensuring that our water quality is maintained and improved. In the past 30 years, with the development of agriculture, there has been a huge increase in the use of fertilisers. While the farming community is very prudent in the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, its use of phosphates and potassium is less so. Phosphorus and phostphates are a huge problem for water quality. Farmers waste money every year putting these fertilisers on their land when they should, in the interest of prudent management of their farms, have a soil test carried out regularly to establish the quantity of these elements in the soil and whether it is necessary to apply them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of farming that is particularly important and which should receive more attention, particularly from the farming community, is that Ireland seeks to portray itself as a country which produces high quality foodstuffs which should command a premium on markets throughout Europe. The development of REPs is welcome as that, as well as extensification, is the future direction for agriculture. However, the current fodder crisis has demonstrated how appallingly we can behave on our farms when disposing of silage wrappers, bags and covers and fertiliser bags. They are strewn across the countryside. The law is in place, but the litter problem continues to exist. There is no commitment to cleaning up our act.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State quoted interesting figures on fines &ndash; I welcome the appointment of more litter wardens &ndash; indicating that the number levied had increased from 981 to 3,175. I would love to think these figures were indicative of our problem, but they are not. Everybody knows how dirty the country is yet there were only 3,175 fines.</P>
    <P>We try to promote this country as a tourist destination, but the first thing a tourist notices is hygiene. I acknowledge that the Minister of State has made great efforts to encourage local authorities to put litter wardens in place. However, more must be done because the problem is far greater than the figures indicate. That should also apply to rural areas. Anybody who has driven on our country roads will acknowledge that some farmyards are a disgrace. I am from a farming background and I am familiar with the filth and dirt one can encounter on farms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <P>And on building sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely. I have little time left, but perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be as liberal with me as the Chair was when the Leas-Chathaoirleach made his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference must be made to waste management. Our first priority should be to prevent <Col N="69" /> waste and reduce the amount being generated. Senator Quill referred to building sites. There are huge amounts of waste on building sites, yet a huge amount could be salvaged, particularly when demolition is involved. Salvage is big business and some operators make a good living from it. We are dumping the finest timber and fabulous brick and stonework into landfill sites.</P>
    <P>This country has been afraid to tackle one thorny issue in the context of waste management &ndash; incineration. We must discuss this option and decide whether we should choose it. We must clean up our country. We continue to produce waste which nobody wants. Everybody wants the country to be tidy, yet people throw plastic bags full of litter out of their car windows on country roads. They do not want their cars littered, but they do not appear to mind littering the countryside.</P>
    <P>The amount of litter being produced must be reduced and greater emphasis must be put on recycling. We must consider all possibilities for recycling and move away from the use of landfills. In any event, we will not be allowed to use landfills in the future so we must think seriously about incineration and how we will use it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Quill and her colleagues on putting down this motion. It is, and will continue to be, a matter of great importance for all local authorities. It is an issue which must be tackled.</P>
      <P>Last year, I and a number of local authority colleagues from Kerry went to Denmark to examine its waste management programme. We were highly impressed. A number of Senators referred to waste management and moving away from the use of landfills. That is the direction we must take. We cannot be afraid of incinerators or of making decisions which will get rid of the litter problem.</P>
      <P>The problem is increasing at an enormous rate. Travelling in any part of this country, one is confronted with placards and signs proclaiming &ldquo;No landfill wanted here&rdquo; and &ldquo;No dump here&rdquo;. There are community groups in every county dealing with this matter. Everybody wants to get rid of their litter, but nobody wants it in their backyard. However, we must face up to our commitments in this regard.</P>
      <P>We have much to answer for and much to do. There are not enough litter bins on streets. People cannot dispose of their litter with ease. In other cities, there are litter bins at regular intervals in every street. That is the first issue we must tackle. In Kerry last year I provided money for six litter bins in my village from my councillor's allocation. I considered it the best way to use the money. Three of them were placed outside the schools, one of which has 700 pupils. A number of Members referred to litter wardens. It might be a good idea to ask litter wardens to go to the schools to talk to the students about disposing of litter, rather than having teachers give these talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> In Denmark, waste management starts in the home and is taught to children from a young age. Each home has different bins in their yards for the different items of litter, such as glass and tin which can be recycled, items that can be used for compost and items that cannot be safely disposed of. The latter are generally disposed of in incinerators. Children are given this training from a young age.</P>
    <P>In this country, the philosophy appears to be that one should throw one's litter from the car window. More serious penalties will have to be imposed to deal with offenders. Last year, Kerry County Council carried out an anti-litter campaign. In one week about five truck loads of refuse were removed from the sides of the road. That took place before the summer season in an effort to clean up the countryside before the arrival of the tourists. It is hard to believe so much refuse could be collected from roadsides. Chip cartons and other food containers were obviously thrown from the windows of cars. The litter wardens should be on patrol and ready to take details about the offenders and their vehicles.</P>
    <P>I compliment the local authorities on their actions. Some years ago a constituent came to me to have something fixed up. He had dumped a bag of litter on the roadside in County Limerick, a litter warden went through it, found his name and address and he was duly prosecuted. The same is happening in other local authorities and it is high time it did.</P>
    <P>We should examine the idea of linking the duties of traffic wardens with those of litter wardens. Their powers could be expanded by the local authorities. Traffic wardens who walk around towns all day could also act as litter wardens for a small increase in salary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities and litter wardens have a large role to play in this area. Traffic wardens could also play a role.</P>
      <P>In relation to water quality, all the water in Denmark comes from deep wells. Their system is far more advanced than ours. All our drinking water is surface water, so we must be more vigilant than others about pollution from agricultural and industrial waste. I know of many industries, one or two of which I took on in my younger days in local authorities, which thought that because they were big companies they could instruct their employees to open up the waste water at night if there was a flood coming down the local river, letting the untreated water into the waterways. Thankfully, with more stringent rules for planning permission, many of those industries have had to install water treatment plants. These people have to be made conscious of their responsibilities because the number of fish kills over the years is a disgrace and we let many people away without challenging them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> There is much we can do. Under the recycling and incineration programme in Denmark, 7 per cent of the original waste material is all that remains to be put into landfill sites. This gives enormous longevity to the landfill sites. We should consider regional management structures instead of locally based plans. This is becoming very expensive and it will cost the local authorities a great deal to maintain landfill sites.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate and compliment the Minister and his Department on the work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the remarks made by Senator Kiely, in Nenagh the traffic wardens also act as litter wardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Really?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been doing that for the past six months and it has been a great success. Clearly, this is a possibility which could be examined by other local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am happy to speak about this issue because it gives me the opportunity to raise a number of environmental concerns which are particular to my area. I am from the Nenagh and Silvermines area where environmental issues have come to the fore in the past few months. Senators will have heard me speak on the subject of Lough Derg in the past, an issue of great environmental concern to us in north Tipperary. Environmental issues are now on the doorsteps of the Silvermines community. This is because of past events and potential future events, all of which are relevant to this debate. The potential future events are of particular relevance due to the proposal by the Irish subsidiary of a global company &ndash; Waste Management Ireland &ndash; to locate a superdump on our doorstep.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his recent predecessors on passing legislation which has had a beneficial effect on how we handle environmental matters. A few weeks before Christmas, I was contacted by members of the community who live beside the Tailings Pond facility at Gortmore outside Nenagh. The Tailings Pond is an area of 150 acres, 20 metres high, of toxic sludge left over from the mining at Silvermines by Mobil Ireland until 1982. This Tailings Pond was constructed without planning permission and without a licence. On a number of maps and documents the facility does not exist. It contains highly toxic material and from 1982 to 1984 it represented a considerable risk to the local community when, having dried out, highly toxic dust from it blew into the houses in the area. It required legal action to ensure that facility was vegetated and made secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks before Christmas an attempt was made to sell it and the new would-be owner put a JCB and a number of animals on the tailings pond, which caused a good deal of concern. The <Col N="72" /> local authority and the EPA acted very quickly, as did the environmental health officer and other agencies charged with responsibility under the Act to deal with this problem. I commend all the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>The EPA subsequently issued a report which contained a number of recommendations which are being acted on. I want to bring to the attention of the House one element of that report. Under a section of the Waste Management Act which came into operation only in July, the Tailings Pond facility was recognised for what it is for the first time under law &ndash; a waste management facility &ndash; and as a result the company which formerly owned it was shown not to have been able to sell it in the manner it did and, therefore, still has responsibility for ensuring the environment is maintained and the health and well-being of the surrounding community is secured.</P>
    <P>Highly pollutant leachate, which has still not been dealt with, is currently emanating from the site into the local river and adjoining water supply. That is only one example of past attitudes to the treatment of hazardous materials and how communities were treated by large industry. That has changed.</P>
    <P>Waste Management wishes to locate this superdump within three quarters of a mile of this site at what it has publicly referred to as the best site in Europe, a quarry, currently filled with water, located near a railway spur. It is, however, an entirely unsuitable site because it is wet, there is water streaming into it, and it is located on a limestone bed which geologists have told us makes it unsuitable as a dumping location.</P>
    <P>It is notable, however, that in reaction to this issue, people in other counties rub their hands in glee. The Silvermines problem is their solution. I know, from having spoken to colleagues in my party from areas such as Limerick, that the location of a major landfill dump in what would be considered a remote area with railway access would be the solution to their problems. I issue a warning that the determination of the local community to resist this is very strong and I am working closely with them.</P>
    <P>It is our intention in north Tipperary to encourage the development of tourism. The Shannon Development Organisation is developing a unique mining heritage site which is quite close to the proposed location, and obviously a dump would undermine the tourist potential there. It is our intention to maximise the tourism potential rather than benefiting from other people's waste. In that regard I agree with Senator Kiely that, while the question of waste management comes into sharp focus when someone proposes to put a dump in one's back yard, it is an issue for everyone, both individually and collectively. It is a disgrace that over 90 per cent of our waste is going into landfills when other European countries have reduced the amount of waste going into landfills to under 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> The question has been asked before: why is this the case? There is no reason genuine action programmes could not be put in place to encourage composting at home and recycling of all bottles, cans and paper. Based on the experience of the recycling project run by Tipperary County Council in Nenagh, recycling makes little economic sense at the moment as it is hard to sell recycled paper on the open market, but that is hardly the point. There will have to be Europe wide policies in this regard, as we are faced with a crisis. There is no clear action programme for this.</P>
    <P>I have read a lot of material from the Department of the Environment and Local Government on this issue recently, and it is vague and aspirational. Nobody could disagree with it. There are targets in it, but there is no way to show how those targets can be met. I would like real public education programmes to begin with and genuine incentives to recycle. Public education programmes on composting and genuine local community activities are the only way forward. We must set targets and meet them. There will have to be incentives built in and public education programmes in tandem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are up to our ears in rubbish. No matter where we look, whether it is the letters page of the national newspapers or the local environment, there is rubbish, rubbish everywhere and not a place to put it. I would like to hear from the Minister of State whether there is any attempt being made to have a co-ordinated policy in the waste management area. We hear about initiatives from councils coming together but, as has been pointed out, one county's problem is another's solution. The NIMBY &ndash; not in my back yard &ndash; syndrome seems to be operating in local authorities and there is a definite need to knock heads together.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why we do not have an incinerator. Are we now so politically correct that we are afraid to move even one inch on this, despite all the evidence from environmentally conscious countries, such as those in Scandinavia? We do not seem to be prepared to take the initiative.</P>
      <P>It is the old story of all politics being local; for example, Senator O'Meara mentioned the Silvermines. Leitrim and the west suffer from recurring bouts of illegal dumping. That has been pointed out by several speakers and, despite their best efforts, local authorities do not seem able to eliminate this problem. I suggest that local authority litter wardens are under-resourced. This is not a criticism, as the Minister of State and the Minister have taken initiatives in this regard which are beginning to bear fruit. However, we have only one litter warden in all of Leitrim for an area that goes from the Atlantic to the border of Cavan lengthwise, and whose predominantly rural topography includes hills, dales and lakes. People are dumping there at an enormous rate and the local authority cannot possibly address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> In our towns youngsters come out of school at lunchtime to go to the nearest takeaway, and they not only ignore the pleas of the owners &ndash; who are doing their best to keep their premises tidy &ndash; but positively enjoy seeing people come out to pick up their rubbish. I have suggested to our litter warden, Ms Caroline Matthews, who is very active and to whom I wish to pay tribute, that she take action. There will come a time in the not too distant future when prosecutions will be levelled at some of these teenagers. When they go back to their parents with a prosecution for dispersal of litter in their hands it might help to concentrate minds.</P>
    <P>What Senators have said is correct: there is need for a public education programme. We have an awful mindset regarding rubbish. How often have we seen people sitting in cars chewing sweets or eating chips and then nonchalantly tossing the paper out the window on to the streets of our towns and villages? I know that litter wardens in Dublin have prosecuted people for dumping cigarettes on O'Connell Bridge, and fair play to them. I wish the same attention was being paid to our rural areas.</P>
    <P>Our litter warden drew my attention to one of the greatest problems with litter in rural Ireland and I have written to the Department about it. As a result of the increasing trend among local authorities to franchise the collection of refuse, a levy is now placed on all collections. Heretofore, when the local authority controlled and was responsible for the collection and disposal of domestic refuse, there was an exemption system in operation with which most councillors would be familiar. A councillor would approach the county manager on behalf of somebody and ask that they be exempted from paying on the basis of hardship or some other inability. That is no longer the case in Leitrim, where the franchise holder, Mr. Joe McLoughlin, is doing an outstanding job. However, a two tier system is in operation there for old age pensioners and those who are unable to pay. I suggested that the Department subsidise local authorities to exempt old age pensioners and/or medical card holders.</P>
    <P>If one is living in a rural area all one's life, one is used to disposing of one's domestic rubbish at the bottom of the garden or &ldquo;out the back&rdquo;. The prospect of having to pay for someone to take away one's rubbish is a culture shock, particularly for the elderly. In addition, there are many elderly people living in isolated areas who find it difficult to pay between £80 and £110 per year, that is, an average of £2 per week for someone on a pension or a reduced pension. Perhaps the Department will take this suggestion on board and consider providing a subsidy that could be operated through the local authorities. It would encourage those who are disposing of rubbish to avail of the refuse service. It would also reduce financial hardship for those who are dumping their rubbish illegally in lakes, rivers and anywhere else a black plastic bag will go.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> The proliferation of plastic bags is another problem. When is a Government going to decide to abolish plastic bags? A wit in our area, Mr. Séamus O'Rourke from Carrigallen, tells a funny story about a farmer in a local shop who was given plastic bags by sales assistants at every turn &ndash; the meat counter, the vegetable counter, the checkout, etc. When he got home, he found the plastic bags were so knotted that he could not open them and, in the end, he threw not only the bags but everything he bought in the shop into the nearest river. I ask the Minister to consider some way of eliminating plastic bags.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address two aspects of waste management &ndash; the deterioration of our water quality and the need to expedite the objectives of the Waste Management Act &ndash; and I will be parochial in my remarks. Over 80 per cent of waterways in Cavan and Monaghan are polluted, the cause being over-intensive farming. Other Senators mentioned landfill difficulties, but the biggest problems we face &ndash; and potentially the greatest economic threat to the Border counties &ndash; are those related to our mushroom and poultry industries. The position is so bad that there is currently a blanket refusal of all applications for new units in both industries.</P>
      <P>In 1994 a delegation of local councillors went to Scunthorpe in England, where an incinerator for farm waste was in the middle of a housing estate. Whatever treatment method was used, there was no pollution or fumes from the incinerator &ndash; one would not know what was done in the building, it was such a clean operation. At that time, a private company in my area applied to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, as it was then, under the clean energy competition to develop such an incinerator in my county. Unfortunately the competition was won by a private company in Dublin, which to this day has not taken the matter further. We still have problems with farmyard waste, not to mention the waste from our cattle and pig industries &ndash; there is a high number of pig slaughtering units in our area, considering its size and we cannot even cope with the waste from our poultry and mushroom industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who wants to build a facility goes to Northern Ireland where he or she can get planning permission straightaway. For many years County Monaghan has been known for poultry and mushroom industries but there is now a block on such investment and on economic development in both Cavan and Monaghan. We have not been able to attract teleservices, etc; we are totally dependent on agri-business but the sector has taken a turn for the worse. We talk about strategies and a co-ordinated approach but unless action is taken at national level counties like Cavan and Monaghan have no future. In the past agricultural industries held the country together <Col N="76" /> but unfortunately they will go to the wall in coming years.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, perhaps in co-operation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, to consider an incinerator for agricultural waste in the Border counties. In Cavan and Monaghan alone there would be enough waste to maintain such a plant. It is an expensive operation but it is necessary and funding should be made available from some source.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who spoke to the debate; each contribution was excellent in its own way. It must be evident to the Minister that there is deep concern among Senators that stronger and more effective action be taken immediately to address the three issues set out in the motion. It is equally evident that any action he proposes to take will have strong cross-party support, which must give him much encouragement.</P>
      <P>As for the Minister's speech, I am marginally more encouraged than I was at the beginning of the debate. I took heart from his remark that he was developing a significant new and well resourced environmental awareness campaign this year; I ask him to fast-track that campaign. Every citizen must be required to take ownership of his or her litter and responsibility for its proper disposal but that will only happen through a campaign such as the one signalled by the Minister, and I welcome it. When that is in place, we must enforce the Litter Act because if people refuse to take responsibility they must pay the fine.</P>
      <P>Some extremely good ideas were suggested this evening and I have no doubt the Minister took note of and will implement them all. The problem is so stubborn that it demands not a piecemeal approach but strong, bold action and I strongly recommend the Minister do two things in particular. First, he should tackle the problem of plastic bags. Tomorrow he should announce that in one year's time there will be a reduction of 40 per cent in the number of such bags in use, in two year's time there will be an 80 per cent reduction, and the position will be reviewed then. That is not impossible, it has been done in other countries. Plastic bags are a scourge in many ways but I do not have time to illustrate them all. Second, he should consider eliminating phosphate based detergents. When we talk about sources of water pollution we mention agricultural and industrial sources but we never mention the pollution from washing machines and sinks. The Minister must announce that in three years' time no phosphate based detergents will be in use in Ireland. An alternative is available; it is an expensive commodity but if the commercial sector was told phosphate based detergents would be banned in three years, it would respond and the alternative produce would be on the shelves. If those two bold approaches were taken, people would realise the Department was serious about this issue, recognised the problem and knew it had to take a strong and unpalatable measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> In my introductory remarks I mentioned the need for proper specifications for the instatement of works carried out by public utilities and the residue of litter after new road developments; in his reply the Minister did not advert to these and other points I made. I will send him a copy of these points and ask him to consider them carefully. I did not make those points lightly, I put a lot of time and care into them and I ask him to respond to me at another time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace. Earlier, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, paid me the courtesy of informing me that he could not be present for this debate.</P>
      <P>I request that the Government provide funding of a capital and current nature so that the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God can provide the services it is seeking to provide to people with learning disabilities, those already in its care and those on waiting lists. Despite the funding provided by successive Governments, the situation continues to deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now more people waiting for residential, day care and respite services than there were between 12 months to three years ago. We are losing the battle in an area of absolute necessity in terms of the requirement to provide medical care and services. It is scandalous that this situation is beginning to deteriorate out of hand. I refer specifically to the service provided by the <Col N="78" /> Hospitaller Order of St. John of God, representatives of which have informed me that they are almost in despair with regard to how they will meet the demand for services.</P>
    <P>The order has proposed a reasonable programme for 1999. I wrote to the Minister in October following which I received an acknowledgement but no commitment. On 11 January last I was present with the Taoiseach at the opening of a playground centre when I was again approached by representatives of the order which led me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The order proposes to extend its existing residential and day care services, which currently cater for 430 people, to cater for an additional 200 people. That is its priority for 1999.</P>
    <P>The order informed me that at present the Eastern Health Board has in excess of 680 people in need of residential placement in 1999 but that the additional allocation by the Government will only fund 50 places. The situation is somewhat similar in respect of day service places where in excess of 300 people are in need of day care services but the allocation will provide funding for only 66 places. The situation is drastic and the waiting lists are growing rather than decreasing.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail because the Department is fully aware of the situation. Essentially, we are discussing providing capital and revenue funding for day services, respite services, and community respite services for fewer than 200 people. We are also discussing the 60 people waiting for residential placement, in respect of whom there is a proposal to build three group homes.</P>
    <P>The proposal has been with the Minister for a considerable period and the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God is extremely anxious that a decision will be expedited and that a commitment will be given to provide funding. In total, £1.5 million in current and capital funding would provide services for approximately 200 people. Those services are badly needed. In recent weeks the Minister referred to the budgets he has given to individual hospitals and the accountability and transparency he employs. I do not believe there is any area where money could be better spent than in the provision of services to people with learning disabilities. There is no organisation that is more transparent and accountable than the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God. I would be delighted if the Minister of State responded in a positive fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for raising this matter. The Hospitaller Order of St. John of God is one of a number of major voluntary service providers in the field of mental handicap. The order provides a broad range of services to persons with a mental handicap in three health board regions &ndash; Eastern, North-Eastern and Southern. At this point I pay tribute to the voluntary service providers in general and in particular to the St. <Col N="79" /> John of God Order in respect of its role over the years in the development of services and its advocacy on behalf of persons with a mental handicap, and their families.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001&rdquo;, which is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap. We are aware of the requirements it has identified and the amount of money &ndash; £63.5 million &ndash; which needs to be spent over the period 1997 to 2001.</P>
      <P>This year the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services in line with the needs identified in the assessment of need report. This £12 million is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>Additional capital funding of at least £10 million is also being made available to support these developments. This funding is part of the £30 million national capital programme for services to persons with mental handicap which the Minister for Health and Children put in place towards the end of 1997. The additional funding will provide approximately 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places, 200 new day places, health related support services for children with autism and the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements. It will also provide for additional specialist and other support services.</P>
      <P>The additional funding which has been provided in 1999 for the development of new day, residential and respite services has been notified to the health boards. Of this funding, £3.365 million has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board, with a full year cost of £4.61 million in 2000; £1.273 million has been allocated to the North-Eastern Health Board, with a full year cost of £1.595 million in 2000; and £1.575 million has been allocated to the Southern Health Board, with a full year cost of £2.01 million in 2000. Details of the precise services to be put in place in the health board areas from this additional funding and the individuals who will benefit from these services are agreed by the mental handicap co-ordinating committees. The regional planning committees in the three regions mentioned above include representation from the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God. I understand that the health boards are in the process of finalising their proposals in respect of the development of the new services in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the St. John of God and other <Col N="80" /> similar services, in addition to providing funding, it is also necessary to ensure existing services continue to provide an appropriate level of care for their clients. The changing age profile means the needs of many of those in residential care in particular have changed. There is an increasing need for more intensive levels of support as the number of persons terminally ill or suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other ageing problems increases.</P>
    <P>The 1998 allocation to the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God for services to persons with a mental handicap included additional funding of £250,000, specifically for service issues related to the changing profile of existing clients in St. Raphael's, Celbridge. The 1999 allocation includes £150,000 for the Eastern Health Board region, £400,000 for the north-eastern region and will meet identified needs in existing services.</P>
    <P>I understand during this month officials from the Department of Health and Children will begin a series of meetings with the various voluntary mental handicap agencies in the eastern region, including the St. John of God order, to identify priority issues within existing services which are of concern to them in the context of the transfer of responsibility for the direct funding of certain voluntary mental handicap agencies from the Department of Health and Children to the new eastern regional health authority in the year 2000. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, hopes to be in a position to continue to assist with these issues in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The funding provided in 1999 to the services of persons with a mental handicap will bring the total additional revenue and capital funding allocated by the Minister to £53 million and £59 million with effect from January 2000. It also underlines the Government's commitment to meeting the needs outlined in the Assessment of Need 1997-2001 within the specified timeframe. The Government looks forward to facilitating the continued development of these services in partnership with the health boards, the voluntary mental handicap service providers, including the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God, persons with a mental handicap and their carers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has done a fine job in obscuring the situation. Having listened to what he has said, I am none the wiser. He replied in general rather than specific terms. I am extremely unhappy that meetings are expected to take place some time in the future to identify priority issues within existing services which are of concern. This will involve the St. John of God Order. Some time ago the order identified needs and presented costings and plans. There is no sense in reinventing the wheel after the order provided the Department and the Eastern Health Board with the necessary information. I am disappointed I was not given a more positive response in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and thank him for taking this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter is due to the condition of the roads in the north Kerry region. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and Ministers of State, Deputies Dan Wallace and Molloy at the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the increased allocation of money this year through the National Roads Authority and through the discretionary and restoration grants. They must be highly commended, the increase must be welcomed by local authorities. I welcome what the Minister of State said about improving all county and non-national roads by the year 2006 and that primary routes will have proper standards by the year 2019.</P>
      <P>I was prompted to raise this matter because of the high level of rainfall in the county, particularly northern Kerry. Because of the high level of rainfall during the past 12 months there has been extensive flood damage. Roads which were repaired in recent years have been almost washed away. It has been reported that rainfall in the past 12 months was 25 per cent higher than last year. I assure the Minister that for every drop of rain which falls in this country, the west coast of Kerry gets the brunt of it. There are floods almost every day of the week. When there is heavy rainfall everyone knows the roads that will be flooded.</P>
      <P>I put down a motion in my council, but it asked me to raise the matter here because it is of the opinion that, as I am in a position of power, I should be in a position to address the problem. The council said that if money was provided, the flooding problem could be solved. As roads cannot be maintained in a proper condition unless they are drained, I ask the Minister to allocate a once-off grant to open up drains, trenches and new waterways so our roads can be in a reasonable condition.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new initiatives and incentives introduced by the Minister through the road tax. I am glad this money is being put into the roads and the rewards can be seen. I travel the length and breadth of the country, but I cannot understand why the roads in Kerry do not have as good a surface as those in other parts of the country. I appeal to the Minister for a once-off grant, particularly for northern parts of the country, which could be put to good use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated on numerous occasions that we will have to get matching funds in the future. We would love to be able to do this, but how can it be done? The tourism season in the north of the country is getting shorter, while the east and Killarney is definitely improving. Approximately £9 million has been allocated for primary routes this year, which will be spent in the east and around Killarney, the northern part of Kerry is being left aside. Visitors to our county have to use our roads and they are not getting a <Col N="82" /> good impression because of them. If every tourist was charged £1 or £2, this problem could be solved. Something must be done for the northern part of Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Kiely for raising this matter. I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who is unable to be in the House to respond to this item and asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Before turning to the specific case of Kerry, I will say a few words about non-national roads in general. As the Senator may be aware, the Minister issued the non-national roads allocation to local authorities on 1 February 1999. This involved an all-time record provision for non-national roads in 1999 of more than £237 million, an increase of more than £37 million, or nearly 19 per cent, on the original 1998 allocation figure of almost £200 million. In making this provision the Minister was fulfilling one of the Government's key commitments for non-national roads, namely, to ensure additional funding.</P>
      <P>The restoration programme, which began in 1995 and aims to restore the entire network of regional and local roads in county areas by 2005, continues to be the cutting edge of the non-national roads effort and the Minister increased the funds available for this programme by more than £20 million, i.e. from £118 million to more than £138 million. This will greatly increase the rate of progress being made in the restoration of regional and county roads to an acceptable standard.</P>
      <P>The 1999 allocations mean that, on average, county councils will receive £2,400 for every kilometre of non-national road. Furthermore, county councils will receive significantly increased grants for maintenance purposes in 1999. Maintenance grants under the restoration programme will increase by 36 per cent to £31.7 million, while discretionary maintenance will increase by almost 32 per cent to £12.8 million. This is further evidence of the Government's determination to deal with the problems of regional and county roads.</P>
      <P>Turning to the specific matter raised by the Senator, he will be aware that the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in its area is a matter, of course, for Kerry County Council, to be funded from its own resources, supplemented by grants made available by my Department. Kerry County Council has been allocated a total of £9.789 million for 1999, a figure which represents an increase of 12 per cent on the initial 1998 allocation to the council of £8.761 million. Total maintenance grants in 1999 to the council will increase by a massive 34 per cent to over £2.1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to which the various grant categories should be applied is a matter for Kerry County Council, subject to the general guidelines issued by my <Col N="83" /> Department. In this regard, my Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads 1996-9 specifically reminds local authorities that the cost of remedial works arising as a result of flooding and storm damage must be met from their own resources, supplemented by grants, and that they should set aside a contingency sum to finance any restoration works which may be necessitated by severe weather conditions. Kerry County Council will spend over £1.7 million in 1999 on non-national roads out of its own resources. Apart from the 1999 allocation to Kerry County Council for non-national roads, which is intended to provide for the special and ongoing needs of the council, there are no funds at the disposal of my Department from which a <Col N="84" /> further non-national road grant could be made available to the council.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that the foregoing represents a reasonable approach, given that Kerry County Council will have significantly increased grants available to it in 1999, including significantly increased maintenance grants. In fact, the council will have almost £11.5 million in total available to it in 1999 for non-national roads. Furthermore, I assure Senator Kiely that flexibility will by shown by my Department in considering any request from the council for necessary adjustments to its multi-annual restoration programme arising from storm damage to specific roads.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 February 1999.</P>
