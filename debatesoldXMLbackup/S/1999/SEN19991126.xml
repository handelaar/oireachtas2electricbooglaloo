      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999 (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to this side of the House. However, I would like to complain about what happened in the past week with regard to this Bill. We have accepted nearly 100 amendments from the Government, some of which we read in the newspapers prior to being brought into this House. We have not had an opportunity to table any written amendments and it is as if this Bill is emergency legislation. It might be an emergency for people who are awaiting housing but the truth is that this Bill will not go into the Dáil until at least next February. I am sure the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is aware of that. We have been brought here on a Friday when people have had arrangements made over the past week. That is not the way to conduct the business of the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been bullied through the House in the interest of the Minister without justification. It is the third largest piece of legislation to come before the House since the founding of the State and it is being rushed through in an extraordinary manner. Amendments have been coming in with no opportunity given to respond to them. I am also aware that it is intended to take Report Stage next week. During the debate on Second and Committee Stages the Minister indicated&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order for the business to be transacted properly we must have an opportunity to respond and to take on board the changes that will be made on Report Stage by the Minister. We need an opportunity to review those changes in case we want to table amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday most of what Senator Coogan said. We have communicated our views to each other. I hope today's business is conducted in a fashion which allows it to be done. We should assess our progress during the course of the day. That is most important at this stage. We tried to resolve difficulties during the week and it is now a matter of ensuring that this legislation gets due consideration today and next week.</P>
      <P>We have discussed credit unions on a number of occasions. There are some indications that the credit unions have European support for the Government's inclination to give them special tax treatment. In other words, they would be exempt from corporation tax. This is welcome news for anyone involved with credit unions. Can the Leader confirm this? Perhaps he could also arrange for the Department of Finance to come in here to explain to us what is happening in that area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill we are discussing, many people will have to avail of co-operative housing and the services of credit unions in the future. The fact that they can now be exempt from corporation tax is an important issue that we should look at.</P>
      <P>I know the Leader has been under pressure on the current issue but now that has been dealt with. We need to know what is happening with No. 4 of the Order Paper, the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which deals with masts. I raised this issue with him time and again and I am becoming deeply suspicious because I have not received an answer from him. Is there something happening on the Government end of things on this issue?   </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speakers. I am extremely disappointed with today's Order of Business. No prior notice was given that we would have a Friday sitting. The problem is that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is ordering our business rather than the House itself. That is where the precedent is being established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader did not order today's business. When he was put under pressure by the Minister it was then he ordered the business as it stands. I am not happy with this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven or eight Seanad Bills before the other House which have not been dealt with. There is plenty of work for the other House to deal with that has already been processed here. I have always commended the Leader on the good work he has done in getting fresh legislation into this House. It is initiated and dealt with here. However, there is not much sense in bringing legislation of this magnitude before this House if we cannot dispose of it properly. That is our problem. We have until 16 December and we <Col N="547" /> have no problem facilitating the Leader of the House in getting the Bill through by then. However, it will not be dealt with in the other House until well into the new year and, I have no doubt, until after Easter. I am not happy and I am opposed to the Order of Business as it stands.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate what I said yesterday about Northern Ireland. Tomorrow is D-Day and over the weekend we will know whether there will be peace in Northern Ireland before Christmas.</P>

      <P>I have participated in the discussion on the Bill for six days. It has been a fine example of parliamentary democracy. The Members present for the Committee Stage would have to acknowledge it has been constructive. Worthwhile amendments were tabled by the Opposition and Government sides.

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Defence to come to the House to discuss the problems in the Irish Red Cross, which, sadly, have been ongoing for the past ten years? Our reputation is being damaged in the international fundraising arena. As the staff have spoken openly about the problems, now is the time for us to discuss it. I was a member of the executive of the Red Cross and I raised this matter in the House.</P>

      <P>A pleasant element is always welcome and the Cathaoirleach invariably provides it.

      <P>Yes, it is intended to review progress at 1 p.m. I wish to enlighten Members as regards this Bill. We sat for two days on Second Stage of this Bill and this is the sixth day on Committee Stage, on which we have spent over 30 hours. Members are not being fair in their remarks. The Minister has been present for all of that time, which is his duty. However, he considers it a pleasure to be here. I was pleased this Bill was initiated in the House. Senators had better get used to sitting long hours on legislation. This is the business of the House and the future of Seanad Éireann. We are sitting three or four days a week and if Senators wish to finish early, they will have to sit at 9 a.m.&mdash;</P>

    <P>SECTION 79.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Government amendment No. 252a:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 85, subsection (1), line 12, after &ldquo;82(7)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or (8)&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 254t which makes certain changes to section 82. It changes the definition of affordable housing to include both lands or houses to be made available under subsection (7) and the new subsection (8) of section 82. I will explain the contents of those subsections when we deal with them later.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 252b, 252c, 252d and 252e are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 252b:</P>
      <P>In page 85, subsection (1), line 13 to 16, to delete the definition of &ldquo;eligible person&rdquo; and substitute the following definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;eligible person' means, subject to subsection (3) and to the regulations, if any, made <Col N="551" /> by the Minister under section 85(1)(b), a person who is in need of accommodation and whose income would not be adequate to meet the payments on a mortgage for the purchase of a house to meet his or her accommodation needs because the payments calculated over the course of a year would exceed 35 per cent. of that person's annual income net of income tax and pay related social insurance;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments relate to the change being proposed to the definition of eligible persons for the purposes of the affordable housing provisions in this part of the Bill. In the original text, an eligible person was defined as a person who could not obtain a sufficient mortgage to purchase a house on the basis of a loan of two and a half times the principal income plus once the subsidiary income, if any. However, on further consideration, this would create two wide a target group for eligibility and it fails to take into account the critical aspect of interest rates in determining affordability. Clearly, a house at any given price is more affordable to a greater number of people when interest rates are lower. Any index of affordability trends would take account of prices, interest rates and incomes.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, the definition of eligible persons is being amended to persons whose mortgage repayments would exceed 35 per cent of income net of income tax and PRSI. In the case of a two income household, one half of the second net income would be taken into account for the purposes of determining eligibility. This criterion captures the three critical variables and reflects local authority practice in determining eligibility under existing leases and shared ownership schemes.</P>
      <P>A household on a given level of income may need and be eligible for affordable housing in one area where prices are high while a similar household on the same income would not need or be eligible for affordable housing in another area where market prices were lower. For the purposes of applying the 35 per cent eligibility test, a mortgage is defined as a loan for 90 per cent of the price of a dwelling which meets the accommodation of the person or household concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 252d deletes the definition of relevant income as this is no longer required in the context of the new 35 per cent criterion. Amendment No. 252e makes provision for the treatment of second or subsidiary income in applying this eligibility test. One half of the net income, after the deduction of income tax and PRSI, will be taken into account in the case of a second income. This approach recognises that the economics of a two income household are different from those of a household where one spouse or partner earns an income and the other does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial circumstances of a household, other than income, must also be taken into account in determining eligibility. Relevant cir<Col N="552" /> cumstances would be where capital was available from the sale of another house, an inheritance or even, perhaps, a national lottery win.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's comments in respect of eligible persons and what constitutes a sufficient level of eligibility. The difficulty with what he said is that while mortgage interest rates are low at present there is a threat that they will increase. There is also a problem in terms of people's ability to come up with the initial sum of money or deposit required, which is usually set at £1,000. Unless a cap is placed on what constitutes affordability, in many cases people will find it difficult to qualify for a house if they are obliged to rely on two and a half times their income.</P>
      <P>By allowing half the subsidiary income instead of the entire amount, the Minister is casting his net in too constrained a fashion. I understand his concern that the provision might be too broad but there have been exorbitant increases in the price of houses. Unless we pitch the affordability of housing to a sufficiently low level, many people who need housing but who cannot afford a large mortgage will still face great difficulties.</P>
      <P>In terms of local authority shared ownership schemes, to which the concept of socially affordable housing will mainly apply, I had thought that the threshold was two and a half times the income of the main earner plus the entire income of the second earner. It would be reasonable to retain this threshold, particularly when interest rates are low, which would offer people on low incomes a realistic opportunity to enter the market.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendments will tighten up the provisions in the section because they could not be left as they were. The stipulation that the repayments on a mortgage must not exceed 35 per cent of a person's income is reasonable, as long as there is sufficient flexibility for other incomes to be taken on board in terms of paying off a mortgage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Chair's indulgence in respect of the debate on these amendments. I was prohibited from replying to them in writing when they were received because there was no time available to do so. In other words, they came in very late. If possible, a Second Stage debate would be more appropriate on these amendments. I wish to refer to what the Minister said. The Government and the Opposition are interested in ensuring that people go back to work. This is of interest at a time when unemployment is low and there is a need for people to go to work. However, this amendment prohibits people from going back to work.</P>
      <P>The Minister explained the revised definition, which the Department has drawn up, saying:</P>

    <P>The definition of eligible persons is being amended to persons whose mortgage repayments would exceed 35 per cent of net of income tax and PRSI. In the case of a two income household, one half of the second net <Col N="553" /> income would be taken into account for the purposes of determining eligibility.</P>
    <P>A single person with a gross income of £25,000 would be able to afford a mortgage of £87,000 and a married couple with one income of £30,000 could afford a mortgage of £120,000. However, if the couple had two incomes &ndash; one of £20,000 and the second of £10,000 &ndash; totalling £30,000, it only allows for a mortgage of £106,000. How did the Minister come up with those figures? We are trying to encourage people back to work. However, if the second earner in the household has an income of £10,000 they might as well not be working. There is no justification for this &ndash; it simply does not add up. If the total income of the household is £30,000, based on two incomes, the entitlement is £106,000, but if it based on one income it is £120,000. Perhaps the Minister would explain how he came to this conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to define the category of applicant that will qualify for affordable housing and this amendment has much to recommend it. One can argue about the detail of the figures and where the cut-off point is, but there is a significant aspect to this. Many local and national politicians have sought for some time that when people are assessed for qualification for a range of social and other services, the assessment should use net rather than gross income. It is good that this provision refers to net income, income subject to the deduction of tax and PRSI.</P>
      <P>The manner in which this amendment is constructed allows for the fluctuation of interest rates. It will be calculated according to the current interest rates. In addition, this is a scheme which will qualify and will probably be used extensively as part of the shared ownership scheme. The amendment also takes other income earners in the house into account. On that matter I ask the Minister to clarify whether the income of children of a couple who would qualify for affordable housing will be taken into account. That might create an anomaly because they may be there for a short period and may move out of the family home and seek accommodation in their own right. It could be a factor in disqualifying people who otherwise might qualify. It could also deter people from staying at home which, from a social point of view, might not be the right move.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a certain scope in it. Amendment 252e refers to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; take into account rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; take into account. The rest of the amendment indicates that the local authority may have discretion about which income earners will be included.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows we share his objective to make affordable housing available to people. This seems a better scheme than the social housing scheme, which was instituted some years ago in several areas of the city but appears only to help those who are on corporation housing lists. I share Senator Costello's concern about <Col N="554" /> interest rates but is the Minister wise to put in an upper income level for the primary earner? The Dublin Docklands Authority has a very imaginative scheme, of which the Minister is aware, and it operates an upper income level. Could it be indexed? We have seen the problems with inheritance tax which was not indexed. Would that be worthwhile?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members for their support for this amendment and this part of the Bill. The scheme applies to people who qualify under the shared ownership scheme, which was mentioned by Senator Costello and Senator Walsh. On the point about interest variations and rises in interest rates, the new formula is more flexible than the old one and it takes this into account. One of the reasons we have changed this scheme is that it gives us flexibility if interest rates rise to revise arrangements so that people will not be caught. The provisions mean that instead of having to change the Bill to change these criteria we can change the regulations. In keeping with other parts of the Bill, we are trying to be as flexible as possible because the housing market changes so quickly and needs change quickly. Senator Costello's concerns are addressed by the new formula which will allow for variations.</P>
      <P>On Senator's Coogan's point, the 35 per cent test does not discriminate against two-income households. There were some suggestions of that. At first glance it may appear to be harder on one-income families because a higher mortgage is affordable to them and they would, therefore, be excluded from affordable housing at a given price, whereas a two-income family on the same combined income would be eligible for affordable housing at the same price. It arises because only one half of the net income of the second earner is taken into account. There are good and equitable reasons for this.</P>
      <P>The economics of a two-income household are completely different in many respects from those of a single-income family because two people going to work involves additional expenses, for instance, travelling to work, eating out and, critically nowadays, child care and child minding costs. These eat into the income of a two-income household. It is still a factor, perhaps less so nowadays than in the past, that the second of two incomes is less secure on average and more vulnerable to changes in circumstances, such as the arrival of children. The formula now proposed is as close as we can get to a general formula for equal treatment of different income circumstances and it does not discriminate against two-income households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the loan amount affordable, a second income has never been treated on the same basis as the main income or the two incomes simply aggregated. By taking into account half of the second income, we are reflecting the reality of the situation and established practice by commercial agencies and public <Col N="555" /> bodies. The formula used which was quoted by Senator Coogan concerns the levels at which people will qualify on the index of affordability rather than mortgages as appears from the note. In the case of a couple with two incomes of £20,000 and £10,000 respectively, the maximum affordable loan would be £106,000. However, this section outlines when a person qualifies for the waiting list for affordable housing rather than his or her eligibility for a loan.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh asked whether the incomes of sons and daughters would be included in the formula. The formula could include such incomes if the individuals involved might reasonably be expected to reside with the eligible person and contribute to the mortgage payment. While it is a fair question, it is better to deal with this issue through guidelines rather than legislation. It is also probably better to deal with the upper income limit in guidelines and allow flexibility. Given the nature of house prices, if it were written into the legislation, it would be too rigid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sociologically, there are dramatic changes in dual income households in so far as the second income earner is staying in the workforce much longer than was previously the case. This is necessitated by the increase in house prices and the recognition that they need a house. People wait longer to have children and family size is reducing. The second income is almost as solid as the primary income. This change should be taken into account in the calculations. However, most households must have dual incomes in order to qualify for any State or private mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has changed the formula for eligibility from two and a half times the primary income plus once the income of any subsidiary income to two and a half times the primary income plus half the annual income of the second person. Normally, the second income is provided by a spouse or partner. For that reason, would it be better if the Minister reverted to the original guidelines where the full second income was taken into consideration rather than half of it? People work on community employment schemes for three years. If they are aged 35 or over they could be expected under the jobs initiative to achieve permanent social employment. Will such people be considered for affordable housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points of detail that must be carefully considered in the context of the guidelines that will issue. It is important not to be too prescriptive. The market has changed a great deal over the past four or five years and continues to do so. Everybody recognises that but it is important that such detail is included in guidelines because a more flexible approach can then be adopted. The manner is which the second income is treated reflects the policy of all com<Col N="556" /> mercial lending agencies currently and even local authorities treat it the same way. If the circumstances change the fact that the second income will be dealt with through guidelines rather than legislation will allow us to adapt the formula. The Senator is trying to ensure that we can adapt to changed circumstances and the new amendment reflects that. The section provides for the eligibility test for affordable housing and its calculation and not whether an individual will get a mortgage. I acknowledge Senator Coogan's comment that the second income is becoming a more permanent feature.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 253:</P>
      <P>In page 85, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)Where an application for permission in relation to a residential development involving more than 2 dwellings is made on or after the date of publication of the Bill for this Act, and has not been finally disposed of on the date of passing of this Act, it shall be lawful for the planning authority or the Board, as the case may be, if it decides to grant the application, to attach as a condition of the permission a requirement that the applicant or any other person with an interest in the land to which the application relates enter into an agreement with the planning authority concerning the development, for social or affordable housing, of land, which agreement may &ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)provide for any of the following:</P>
      <P>(i)the transfer to the planning authority of the ownership of up to 20 per cent of the land concerned, to be reserved for the provision of social or affordable housing,</P>
      <P>(ii)the making of arrangements for the applicant to provide up to 20 per cent of the land concerned for social and affordable housing in a manner satisfactory to the planning authority, or</P>
      <P>(iii)the payment by the applicant to the planning authority of an equivalent sum based on the value of the land with the permission less the amount of compensation which would be paid if the land were to be transferred, which sum shall be used for the purposes of a housing authority only or under this Act), and</P>
      <P>(b)identify the land to be transferred in accordance with paragraph (a), whether in one or more parts.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment and I would be delighted if the Minister considered it. It would change the timing of the Minister's proposal, not the principle of it. He outlines his housing strategy in this section in terms of how the 20 per cent social and affordable housing element will be implemented and the timescale that is required. The housing strategy must be prepared and then there must be a variation of the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to bypass that to an extent and fast-track this desirable proposal through the system much more quickly than the Minister has proposed. The timescale envisaged by the Minister is outlined in this section and sections 12 and 13. It <Col N="558" /> is difficult to envisage that a housing strategy would be in place in less than 12 months and a development plan would be varied in less than two years. The Minister can intervene at that stage and impose the adoption of the development plan. However, it will be delayed because it is in many people's interest that that happens. It will take three years to introduce variation into most development plans and thus provide 20 per cent social and affordable housing. Most local authorities have already had their development plans adopted &ndash; Dublin Corporation's was adopted earlier this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has new proposals in regard to the development plan. It must begin within four years and finish within six. He therefore envisages two years for it to be processed. The final stages might be dealt with within one year but a great deal of work will have taken place prior to that. The key is whether a mechanism can be provided whereby this eminently desirable principle can be adopted in a meaningful fashion and it will not be constrained by objectors or the planning process. At the same time I can appreciate that everything must be done in accordance with constitutional requirements. If we could, as we propose in the amendment, condition each new planning application before a new development plan is adopted, that would be the norm for the future but before that kicks into place we would have this window of two, three or more years whereby our hands would be tied behind our backs in relation to implementing this legislation. The benefit of the social and affordable housing is required now. We have the crisis and no measure that has been proposed, including the Bacon report and we have discussed it <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House and in the local authorities, has been effective. This is the only effective measure that will solve the problem in the long term but it will not solve it in the short term unless an amendment of this nature is accepted. I earnestly urge the Minister to take the amendment on board considering that the principle is excellent but its implementation may be delayed to such an extent that the benefits are not realised.</P>

      <P>I fully support the motivation behind Senator Costello's amendment but I wonder whether, in practice, it would achieve what we all desire, that is, the early implementation of these provisions in law and their application by local government. We cannot lose sight of the fact that local authorities will have a certain time lag in which to develop their own housing strategies properly and comprehensively to ensure the success of this section. The whole application of this section, which probably impacts most on the development of planning laws, goes to the heart of the whole ethos of what republicanism is all about and it is good to see the support for that in <Col N="559" /> the House. The early implementation of the Bill and its co-operative passage through the Seanad is what is called for. That is the route we should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply. The purpose of the amendment, as I understand it, is to expedite the principle of social and affordable housing. If that can be achieved ahead of the Bill I would support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the support I have received from Members for the principle involved in this section. It is something that has been spoken about by people from all parties and the Labour Party in particular has been trying to expedite that. If I could do what is proposed in this amendment I would have done it 18 months ago but unfortunately it cannot be done. I appreciate the support from all sides for the principles underlined in the amendment. Rarely has something so controversial had such all party support. It behoves me to acknowledge that and to thank people for it.</P>
      <P>My reasons for not accepting this amendment or, indeed, the proposal to take Part V out of the Bill and treat it separately, are strongly based on the legal and constitutional advice I have received. Depending on which side of the fence one is on, if one is a builder this is draconian, involving confiscation and so on but on my side and that of most Members of the Oireachtas, it is a measured social action to deal with a particular problem that affects a number of citizens. From all the legal and constitutional advice available to me, a housing strategy must be in place before the conditions for social and affordable housing can be realistically attached to planning permissions. You cannot, if you wish to remain within the parameters of the Constitution, apply these provisions in an arbitrary manner. They must be based on a reasonable endeavour to quantify and define the housing needs in a particular area for a start. That must be established. That is the aim of the housing strategy. Therefore, a local authority has to have a credible housing strategy before embarking on this and it has to be worked out by reference to perspective and existing housing circumstances in its area before the quota of social or affordable housing, to be applied in its area, can be determined. While everybody speaks of the 20 per cent social or affordable housing, that is an upper limit as is clear from the Bill. A local authority has to have a credible housing strategy and has to decide what percentage is fair and reasonable to meet the housing needs and circumstances in its area and also to ensure it has sufficient land zoned to cater for that demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill requires all future developments and plans to incorporate a housing strategy. In the case of an existing strategy, the procedures to vary the plan must be started within a year of the commencement of the Act. It would not be <Col N="560" /> realistic to require a shorter period of local authorities since the preparation of a housing strategy is very demanding and they must have a reasonable time to do a proper job. I am aware, and Members will be aware also, that local authorities have already commenced preliminary work on housing strategies in anticipation of the Bill being passed. Where there are difficulties I would anticipate and request Members to use their influence to ensure that all the preliminary work for the housing strategy is done during the passage of the Bill and finalised shortly after the commencement of the Act. A great deal of work can be done to put this in place much quicker.</P>
    <P>A further measure to ensure the provisions on social and affordable housing have effect as soon as possible is the amendment to section 83 which will put a time limit on permissions for housing development granted before the housing strategy is made and the relevant quota applied. Obviously this will be discussed later but it is an important provision which improves the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment to speed up the implementation of the housing strategies and the new time limit on existing planning permissions go as far as we can legally and constitutionally in giving effect to the provisions as rapidly and as urgently as possible. As Senator Walsh said, the best way to ensure the housing strategies and the Bill are in place is to expedite its passage through the Houses. In that regard I thank Members for the co-operation so far.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Minister has said he is sympathetic towards the amendment but that he does not think, on legal and constitutional grounds, it can be accepted. The Minister said he might request local authorities to get started on their strategies but the Bill seems to indicate that the strategy would commence one year from the passage of the Bill rather than publication of the Bill. It could take another six months before the Bill gets through the Dáil. Is there some way the Minister could be empowered to amend this section so that the one year provision could operate before the passage of the legislation in the expectation that the Bill would be enacted containing this 20 per cent provision? If there is a delay in enacting the legislation there may be no benefit from it. Applications for development will be introduced on all existing zoned land. Our present development plan finishes this year and I have no doubt that before our new development plan is in place every piece of land will be included under the old dispensation. This legislation will not be able to deal with that. There is a danger that the best of intentions may be curtailed because of difficulties with proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal and constitutional difficulties present a problem, but any development plan implemented to date would have had to consider the social agenda and appropriate housing strategies. They <Col N="561" /> may not have been as perfect as the very specific provision included in this legislation, which calls for a housing strategy and a variation in development plans. However, that is the new dispensation. Is it not possible that, pending the establishment of the new structures, existing planning applications would be treated under the 20 per cent affordable and social housing provision as local authorities review their needs? I am concerned to explore a way around this problem without leaving it open to developers to run a coach and four through it and have the provision effectively nullified by the time this provision becomes operative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following acceptance of the amendment the Bill will require that within one year of the commencement of the Act and irrespective of what development plans are in place, housing strategies must be agreed by local authorities and inserted into their current development plans. If local authorities are in the middle of compiling their development plans when the Bill is passed they can then insert their housing strategy into them.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the Bill was published I met with all local authority managers over a period of two to three weeks. I pointed out these provisions to them and asked them to start drawing up their housing strategies, especially those authorities with acute housing needs who need to use the provisions of the Bill. There is nothing to stop a local authority drawing up a housing strategy and engaging in all the preliminary work on demographics, housing needs, land availability, zoned land and so on. When this legislation is enacted, which it will be as soon as the Bill is passed by both Houses and signed by the President, the authorities can put the legislation before their elected members and proceed with varying their plans.</P>
      <P>Local authorities could have this strategy in place within a couple of months of the enactment of the legislation and I hope they will proceed on this basis because housing and affordable housing is the greatest social issue we face. I am confident local authorities are aware of this and that they will give it the necessary priority.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Senator's question on validating existing provisions, our advice is that the Bill must be in place before procedures to alter a local authority development plan or its housing strategy. These cannot be retrospectively validated, although it would be nice if we could do that. Having asked managers to look at drafting housing strategies, we have already started to look at guidelines and we will not wait for the Bill to be passed before submitting them to local authority managers. Even before the guidelines are in place we will assist in every way we can to give a general idea of the thinking and how it might be approached. I agree with the Senator on the importance of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments present the best possible legal and constitutional way we can proceed. I appreciate the Senator's interest and commitment <Col N="562" /> to this section. If we can find any way to expedite matters, legally and otherwise, we will do so. It is important that those Senators who are members of local authorities also ask these questions of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relevant to what we discussed earlier. There are a number of changes to subsection (1) designed to ensure that in general any development plan being made after the coming into force of Part V would include a housing strategy. However, where a local authority has already advanced its plan and review to the point where it has published final amendments, it will not be required to make its housing strategy before finalising the development plan.</P>
      <P>Second, all authorities must have their housing strategies prepared within one year, at most, and the procedure for consequential variation of the development plan commenced. Where a local authority may have recently adopted a development plan, it will have to set about compiling its housing strategy immediately Part V comes into force and revise the plan within a year. We are trying to ensure that housing strategies are put in place as quickly as possible following the passing of the Bill.</P>
      <P>A new provision is also provided in paragraph (e) to provide for the making of joint housing strategies between two or more authorities. For example, it might make sense for a county council and an urban council to come together to make a joint housing strategy which could then be reflected as appropriate in the individual development plans. It is also possible that the Dublin authorities could prepare a joint housing strategy given that they are currently working together in that context. As this paragraph now deals with the making of joint strategies, amendment No. 256d is a consequential amendment.</P>

      <P>This covers essentially the same ground we debated earlier. I am pleased to note the Minister's request to the local authorities. I have no doubt we will be doing the same thing. However, the development plan still has to be varied and one must go through the normal procedures of consultation, publication and so on. Will the Minister give me an idea of the timescale? Can it be fast-tracked in respect of the development plan? Dublin Corporation has adopted its development plan so we are not working on it at present. Therefore, we cannot simply insert the housing strategy but must go through the normal procedure of dealing with a development plan which can be cumbersome and time consuming. Can the Minister give us any succour on that point?</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that a planning authority in estimating the housing needs of its area should also have regard to its likely future needs. The needs study carried out under the Housing Acts will give the authorities the information on existing needs. Future needs can be extrapolated from these figures and also from population forecasts carried out, for example, in drafting the development plan or, indeed, the regional planning guidelines, particularly in the Dublin area. The other two amendments to this subsection are purely technical in replacing &ldquo;are&rdquo; with &ldquo;is&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;or handicaps&rdquo; are deleted following &ldquo;and persons suffering disability&rdquo; as they are superfluous.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has been specific here. One could have looked on the Bill as providing cheaper housing for families who do not have an adequate income to continue living in an area. I am glad he has inserted these provisions as they are extraordinarily important. The elderly, people with handicaps and so forth can be extraordinarily isolated in social strategies and sometimes get depressed because when we look at economic policy we do not consider frequently enough the social consequences. I compliment the Minister for including such provisions.</P>

      <P>This amendment arose from consultations and adds an additional clause to the paragraph to clarify that the assessment of social and affordable housing needs can be area specific and can differ from one area to another within the territory of the local authority. As this is relevant to the quota to be reserved for social and affordable housing, it is important to be clear as to the intent. Paragraph (b) is inserted by amendment 254c to permit a local authority when making an estimate of the need for affordable housing to confine it to the expected demand from first time purchasers even though the definition of eligible persons can go beyond first time purchasers. However, the vast majority of those qualifying for affordable housing will be first time purchasers. I want to make it clear that persons needing accommodation as a result, say, of divorce would not be excluded.</P>
      <P>In subsection (5)(a) a new paragraph is added by amendment No. 254e to provide that the rates of interest of a mortgage for house purchasers should be an issue to which planning authorities should have regard in making an estimate of the amount of affordable housing needed in the area. There is a consequential amendment to paragraph (5) to include rates of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the point that the planning authority may exclude eligible persons who own or previously owned a house. This is specifically in the context of separation. A person may have lived in a house that was previously in joint ownership. While he may find himself in different circumstances he would not be a first time buyer and would be in a difficult situation and may well be in need of affordable housing. Is the amendment specifically broad enough in that it states &ldquo;may exclude eligible persons&rdquo;? What guidelines is the Minister prepared to draw up to ensure that some people who are in need of affordable housing will not be discriminated against? These people will qualify for local authority housing lists, will be in need of and, in many cases, will expect to qualify for, social as well as affordable housing.</P>

      <P>The point I was going to raise was raised by Senator Costello. Are there guidelines on the possibility of exclusion or is it totally at the discretion of the planning officer? Senator Costello made the point where separated people may be in need of a house for either themselves and/or their children, even though previously they may have been householders. As this means they may be disbarred, will it be discretionary disbarment and, if so, on what basis? What guidelines does the Minister intend to draw up in this regard?</P>

      <P>The important word in many respects is &ldquo;may&rdquo;, not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Confining the estimate for affordable housing needs to just first time purchasers is purely a practical matter to avoid any challenges with regard to other groups being excluded. It does not affect eligibility. With regard to persons needing accommodation, I gave <Col N="567" /> the example of persons who had been divorced, they will not be excluded. In this case the discretion will rest with the members rather than individuals in the planning department because the housing strategy will be a document which will be approved by the local authority members.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a) In conjunction with the inclusion of the housing strategy in its development plan, a planning authority shall ensure that sufficient and suitable land is zoned for residential use, or for a mixture of residential and other uses, to meet the requirements of the housing strategy and to ensure that a scarcity of such land does not occur at any time during the period of the development plan.</P>
      <P>(b)A planning authority shall include objectives in the development plan in order to secure the implementation of the housing strategy, in particular, any of the matters referred to in section 80(3), including specific objectives in relation to the areas zoned for residential use, or for a mixture of residential and other uses, in the plan.</P>

      <Col N="569" /> (c)Specific objectives as referred to in paragraph (b) may be indicated in respect of each area zoned for residential use, or for a mixture of residential and other uses, and, where required by local circumstances relating to the amount of housing required as estimated in the housing strategy under section 80(4)(a), different specific objectives may be indicated in respect of different areas, subject to the specified percentage referred to in section 80 (4)(c) not being exceeded.</P>
    <P>(d)In order to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds, the planning authority may indicate in respect of any particular area referred to in paragraph (c) that there is no requirement for housing referred to in section 80(4)(a) in respect of that area, or that a lower percentage than that specified in the housing strategy may instead be required.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) is being strengthened to make it clear that the planning authorities are obliged, having done their housing strategy, to ensure that sufficient land is then zoned for residential development to accommodate the housing needs of the area over the planned period and also to ensure that a scarcity of development land does not occur, pushing up prices due to an excess of demand over supply. The local authority must ensure that the objectives of the development plan deliver on the implementation of the housing strategy.</P>
      <P>Particular reference is made to the aspects referred to in section 80(3), that is social housing needs. The need for a supply of housing which is affordable to persons on lower incomes, the demand for different sizes and types of houses and specific objectives can by applied in accordance with the housing strategy to residential or mixed zonings in the development plan. For example, a certain mixture of house types or sizes, a certain number of houses for first-time purchasers or a requirement that a stated percentage of land be reserved for social and affordable housing. The previous subsection (1)(a) has now been split into two and there is a consequential amendment, amendment No. 254m, to section 82(2) to replace the reference to section 81(1)(a) with section 81(1)(b). There is a change to paragraph (b), which will become paragraph (c), to make it clear that different specific objectives can by applied to different areas within the local authority's territory where this is indicated by the needs as assessed in the housing strategy.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provided that the provisions in relation to the implementation of the housing strategy did not prevent the development of land exclusively for social housing, and that is a clarification. Amendment No. 254i amends this provision to include affordable housing.</P>

One can only hope the national plan will help to take away some of the incredible burden of planning authorities in the Dublin region.

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. It is essential that there is an onus on local authorities to provide adequate suitable land for housing. In the past we have tended not to do that. I have some sympathy for Senator Joe Doyle and his colleagues in Dublin who were pilloried for many of the zoning decisions they made when, in fact, inadequate rather than too much zoning was the order of the day.</P>
      <P>I also support strongly the anti-segregation measures. There is a real need for social inclusion. I pointed out on Second Stage that in many public housing schemes there is a problem of anti-social behaviour. While the legislation exists, in practice very little effective action has been taken to remedy such anti-social behaviour. I have serious concerns that people who, over a period of 25 or 30 years, will have to pay a very high price to provide their own house &ndash; an achievement that everybody aspires to &ndash; will end up in a situation where anti-social behaviour in their housing estate is not being tackled. The Minister should insert in the guidelines some sort of provision that a local authority would have to take effective action. Therefore, the onus would be on local government and the Garda authorities to deal with instances of anti-social behaviour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised by Senators Joe Doyle, Ormonde and Henry about what might happen in Dublin. Those Members will be aware of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which examined the potential growth not just in Dublin city and county but also in the neighbouring counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow which were taken as a unit. The aim of the guidelines, which will be reflected in the local development plans, is for a more compact city. Local authorities in Dublin have come up with a common strategy to tackle the housing situation. Within the city area itself, the Bacon report and other reports from various professional bodies have advocated a greater use of brownfield sites and increased housing density as a means of trying to make the city more compact and ensuring that the urban sprawl does not continue. There are ways and means of trying to contain this. It is no longer sustainable to build houses in the Dublin suburbs or in Meath and Kildare at levels of four, five or six houses per acre. It just cannot continue. The strategic planning guidelines indicate the need for integrated measures, not just for housing but also for public transport. This is also catered for in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing strategies in Dublin will be matters for members of the city's local authorities. They will make policy decisions and the execution of policy will be a matter for local officials. It is vitally important that local authority members in Dublin and elsewhere should make themselves aware of <Col N="572" /> the necessity for higher density housing and sustainable development throughout the area.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their support for the social integration aspects of the legislation. As they will know, the bodies that have been most vociferous in their objections to the proposals in Part V of the Bill are the builders, developers and auctioneers who do not support the concept of social integration. My answer to that is to look at the alternative. Unfortunately, we have plenty of examples of it around Dublin and other cities. It was a mistake in the past and we should not repeat it in future. I have no doubt there will be some difficulties with this matter. The construction industry and the developers are more than welcome to talk to me about aspects of the legislation and its implementation, including the guidelines, provided they realise that I will not back off the principles in this section of the Bill &ndash; of obtaining affordable social housing and social integration.</P>
    <P>As Senator Walsh said, most of the anti-social behaviour we have in various parts of Dublin and in other parts of the country has arisen because we did not plan properly for socially integrated housing estates in the past. While there will probably be difficulties, this is the way to get to the root of the problem. There will be a greater enforcement of action against people who are anti-social if there is a better mix. Generally, two or three very anti-social people can intimidate other residents of a housing estate, but with a greater social mix I do not think that would happen. People would be more aware of their rights. I certainly think it will be a huge advance and something we will not see the benefits of for ten, 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's view on the concept of social integration. It seems that this will be worked out between the developer and the planning authority. That can vary from one area to another, however, depending on the personality of the planner. Will it be up to the developer to decide who will go into the affordable accommodation which is integrated into a housing scheme, or will the local authority decide? It is an important point because the developers would like to be able to make the selection. In the midst of a scheme of nice houses there may be ten affordable ones which will be integrated into the scheme, but it is important to know who will make the decision on allocation. If it is entirely a matter between the developer and the planner there is a weakness because the arrangement could be an <i>ad hoc</i> one, depending upon the personalities involved at a given time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully concur with what the Minister is recommending. In the past we zoned particular areas purely for social housing and what happened was very simple. A handful of people created a disturbance so the area became labelled. As a result, people who had a commitment to the community decided to move out, yet they <Col N="573" /> were the very people who would be able to build up a community spirit in the area. When a label attaches itself to a place it is very hard to shake off.</P>
      <P>As regards the percentages involved in social integration, it is hard to categorise but sociological categories exist for those on various incomes, the unemployed or unskilled workers. To what degree would integration occur and how? Houses do not make communities, so when a plan is being developed it is critical to recognise that for true integration to take place it is not enough to mix a certain percentage of social housing with private housing. The people living there will have to be integrated also and that must be taken into account in the plan. Whatever local authorities can do to enhance community spirit and integration should be put into place at the time. I am thinking of the provision of open space and its allocation, so that it is not segregated, with an open space at one end of a social continuum and another space at the other end. The result of that would be that people from one end would be segregated, or would segregate themselves deliberately. That must also be taken into account in the plan.</P>

      <P>My concerns are similar to those of Senator Coogan. I am not too sympathetic to those who are putting up the developments because we are talking about an upper limit of 20 per cent. No lower limit is being discussed so we could end up with it being one or two houses. That would be my concern. Like Senator Coogan, I would not like to see the sheep on one side of the green space and the goats on the other. Will any attempt be made to ensure there is some sort of integration? The fact that a percentage of a scheme is given over to social housing does not ensure social integration. Arising from what Senator Walsh said, there is a concern on this side of the House about adequate infrastructure. The lack of infrastructure such as schools, shops and so on has led to disaster in many large housing estates. I look forward to the Minister's comments on this.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Coogan. Some social housing schemes have set a fine example in including community facilities. What is envisaged in the Bill might contain something similar. It may not be necessary to specify it in the Bill but could be included in guidelines or in the development plans of local authorities. This has been a positive development for social housing.</P>

      <P>I was struck by what Senator Ormonde had to say. I had presumed that was being dealt with in the Bill and perhaps the Minister will clarify the method of allocating the 20 per cent of social or affordable housing. Will it be done purely in consultation between the planning authority and the builder or will local representatives have a role in it? We are discussing housing strategy but it is not clear how a planning appli<Col N="574" /> cation for an individual parcel of land will be dealt with or how the allocation of the 20 per cent of affordable housing will be determined geographically and in a manner which promotes social inclusion. These matters must be teased out. We want to build up cohesive communities which are not two-tiered. Senator Doyle cited the example of Pelletstown. An action plan was put together and approximately 40 of the 100 acres have been set aside for amenities. The development will take into consideration the Royal Canal amenity and the builder has agreed to this. This plan will be put to the local councillors who know the area and can judge whether it would work, rather than being agreed between the planning section and the builder. Can the Minister confirm that this method of agreeing a scheme is covered by this section? I am not sure it is.</P>

      <P>The local authority will decide on the allocation of affordable housing in accordance with the scheme of priorities decided by the members. Members have that reserved function and management will execute it. In drawing up and passing a housing strategy, members will deal with issues raised by Senators regarding the geographic location of affordable housing and so on. General housing strategy will be decided by local authority members based on the information available to the local authority.</P>
      <P>The allocation of the houses will be entirely a matter for the local authority, based on the ordinary social housing list and the list for this affordable housing scheme. The local authority and the developer will agree on the precise outcome under the terms of the Bill and having regard to the needs of the housing strategy. It is necessary to have some flexibility with regard to this but any decision made between the builder and the local authority, in an executive fashion, must be done in accordance with the housing strategy. That is why it is important that members who want to ensure there is social integration pay careful attention to what is presented to them for agreement. Management will provide a draft housing strategy and members can have an input into the strategy at that stage. If there is a dispute with regard to the exact land to be transferred it will be referred to An Bord Pleanála for decision. Everything will be done in the context of the general housing strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the points that have been very adequately made by Senator Walsh, Senator Coogan and Senator Costello about social integration and the importance of estate management. Senators Henry and Walsh will recall our long discussion at an earlier stage of the Bill about the necessity for adequate infrastructure. Provision for these facilities can be made in other sections of the Bill and does not need to be specified here. Senator Coogan also asked about the method of allocating the percentage of affordable housing. This matter and the question of estate management are catered for elsewhere in the Bill <Col N="575" /> or in previous legislation. Proper implementation will ensure proper social integration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are a number of very significant amendments to section 82, which is an obviously pivotal section in terms of the operation of Part V and delivering the policy objectives underlying this Part. A new subsection (3) is being inserted to enable the local authority and the developer to make more flexible arrangements for securing the provision of social and/or affordable housing in conjunction with the provision of private housing.</P>
      <P>Instead of transferring the land to be reserved for social and affordable housing to the local authority, with the authority contracting for the erection of the houses afterwards, there is now an express provision enabling the authority and the developer to enter an agreement which would result in the developer building the social and affordable houses at an agreed cost and transferring them to the local authority on completion. The cost of these houses would be based on the existing use value of the land or site, but the builder would be entitled to charge the full commercial price on the building and site development costs.</P>
      <P>This type of arrangement would, in some circumstances, be advantageous to both the local authority and the developer. The local authority would get the houses much more quickly than otherwise and the whole development could be built in a more coherent and integrated manner.</P>
      <P>It also holds out possibilities for builders to work with voluntary housing associations and bodies in putting together proposals that would meet the social and/or affordable housing requirements without a transfer of land to the local authority, but with the land being costed at existing use value. Some developers may prefer to work in this way, especially those who have experience of working with housing associations in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an additional element of flexibility, arrangements can also be made for the transfer of fully or partially developed sites to meet the social and affordable housing elements of a development. These could be transferred directly to the local authority or to nominated eligible persons who could then arrange to build for themselves. The <Col N="578" /> builder would be able to charge a commercial price for the development works carried out, which would have to be agreed with the local authority.</P>
    <P>However, all these alternative arrangements are entirely at the election of the developer, who always has the option of agreeing a straight transfer of the land. The wording of the section also makes it clear that the essential obligation which the local authority can enforce is the requirement to transfer land.</P>
    <P>There is a new provision urging the local authority, where it can do so, to indicate to the developer its intentions in regard to the type of housing it proposes to build on the transferred land. In fairness to the developer, he or she is entitled to know the kind of development a local authority has in mind, so that the impact on the overall development can be assessed.</P>
    <P>There is a new provision requiring the local authority to have regard to the views of the developer in relation to the impact of the agreement concerning the transfer of land or other arrangements on the development. This might include, for instance, such aspects as the viability and phasing of the development. It is important to stress, however, that this does not affect the requirement and the principle to transfer land but is, rather, in relation to the identification of the particular piece of land to be transferred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is proposing here does not undermine the principle of the allocation of up to 20 per cent for social and affordable housing, which is welcome, but is giving the option to the developer of building or making some other agreement rather than transferring the land.</P>
      <P>My only concern is that while the site will be taken at its pre-zoned, normal cost, the builder will have his profits after the cost of labour and materials. That seems to suggest the builder will be fully in the marketplace in regard to the premises he constructs. Profits on residential developments, particularly in Dublin, are exorbitant and do not relate to the actual costs of labour and materials. The marketplace is artificial in that respect.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that we will move away from social and affordable housing because, while the cost of the site will be anchored down and will not be the market price, which is welcome, the enormous cost of the house will not be very different. While the builder can subtract the site cost of £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000, it seems the profits on the sales in the current artificial market will militate greatly against any house returning to the local authority, a voluntary body which requested it or an individual on the register of those qualifying for a local authority house. The situation will be very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like a better formula. Rather than using the full profits in the marketplace, there should be an agreement, as existed in the past, whereby the building and labour costs would be <Col N="579" /> taken into consideration and a reasonable mark-up price would be set, giving a 10 per cent or 15 per cent profit. That would prevent inflated prices for houses which are being built for the benefit of the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for his support of this amendment, which is very important. He has made several statements about the necessity to put these social and affordable housing provisions into effect as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I take the point he made about profits. The easiest answer I can give is that if a builder wants to include an exorbitant profit in the price of the houses that will become available under this agreement, the local authority can tell him they are not affordable houses as far as it is concerned, there is no agreement and that he has to hand over 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the land. That is the only safeguard the local authorities have because they are not obliged to let the developer build &ndash; they have the call in that regard.</P>
      <P>I know there was some confusion about this, but if the land is signed over to the local authority and it arranges to build itself, the tender price includes profit. In essence, what is being cut out is the need to transfer the land. However, I take the point. The only straightforward answer I can give is that if the builder gets too greedy, which is not beyond the bounds of possibility in that profession, the local authority can say the houses are not affordable and that the objective is not being achieved. It can tell the developer to sign over the land and build the houses itself or to get another builder to do so. That is the safeguard.</P>
      <P>Many builders will value the opportunity to build the houses themselves, to have only one builder on the site and to be able to integrate the social or affordable housing on their own site rather than the local authority coming in to do so. This is a significant incentive for them not to try to extract the huge profits they are obviously extracting otherwise. The safeguard is reasonably good and this has the extra benefit of producing the houses perhaps quicker than if we had to go through the Land Registry, transferring land and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the portion of land to be dedicated to the local authority be determined if this route is followed? Sites will vary and some parcels of a landbank can be more difficult and costly to develop. Will the discretion rest with the local authority or the developer? This is an important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that houses would be transferred at the site cost which would have been the cost pertaining to the local authority which are agricultural prices, and then the full market value. I have difficulties in this regard and perhaps the Minister would clarify whether the price will be fixed. Gazumping is taking place because demand <Col N="580" /> is outstripping supply and house prices are going up by £10,000 or £15,000 within a few months. There is also a tendency for builders to let houses go at a lower price initially. I have difficulty with this proposal if the full market value is to be used. I support free market principles and market forces tend to regulate matters properly. However, there is a social aspect to housing and interventionist approaches are required in the current climate.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider reintroducing the certificate of reasonable value to control the price of houses? Certificates applied in the 1970s when house prices were fairly depressed. In the application of this measure, and it might be included in the guidelines, I hope that local authorities would apply the current market price they are paying for the development of similar size houses within their own jurisdiction rather than leaving it to the market value. That would help to keep prices down.</P>
    <P>Within the guidelines, housing co-operatives should be used and established as a conduit for the application of the principles involved. This goes to the core of this provision and much of what we are trying to do about the housing situation. This is an extremely welcome and well constructed development. My comments are geared towards the detail rather than the principle, which is first class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Walsh made many of the points I wished to make. I welcome the concept of the developer building and this will give an integrated look to new schemes. We have had experience of voluntary housing associations in south Dublin where there are many fine housing schemes in Clondalkin built on land reclaimed by the corporation. In Saggart the community council and local people are in discussions with developers as to how they can obtain affordable houses. This scheme is working well in conjunction with the local authority.</P>
      <P>One could highlight negative points about any legislation but I do not want to go down that road. However, if we stipulate that one in every ten houses in an integrated scheme would be affordable, would this lend itself to shoddy workmanship in order to keep the cost of the house down? Would a situation arise where one house would have three bathrooms while the house next door had only one? This is a fact of life. I am trying to think this through and we are going to be asked this question. What are the Minister's views on this issue? I have no difficulty with, and have always believed in, the village concept. However, some people will ask why they have only one bathroom while a neighbour has three.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I proposed that builders be given an opportunity of building for local authorities, and I am glad the Minister has introduced this amendment. The Minister has clarified that the local authority will have the final call if it is not satisfied with the price being <Col N="581" /> charged by the builder. In such situations local authorities can build the houses themselves.</P>
      <P>During the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation was high, local authorities encouraged small builders and gave them sites to build social and affordable housing. The concept of social and affordable housing goes back to that time. Local authorities designated small areas and produced houses at well below the normal price which were used to house people on lower incomes. I welcome the principle of social housing but we are only continuing a principle which was adopted years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the ideals and concept enshrined in this section. I am sure that local authorities will make a good case for builders as they have much expertise and experience. However, if the builder is restricted within the 20 per cent concept and his profits are small, is there a danger that the price of houses in the other 80 per cent would increase to make up the shortfall? People involved in the building sector have highlighted this danger. I hope this will not happen as local authorities have been generous to builders over the years, particularly in bad times. I hope we will not see an increase in the price of private sector housing as a result of the restrictions placed on builders due to the 20 per cent concept, which is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the construction federation will cry wolf. Some of its submissions on Dublin Corporation's development plan specifically requested that any reference to any social agenda be excluded as that was not the purpose of a development plan. They will try to raise as many fears as possible about the cost of other housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the safeguard is that the local authorities can say no thank you to developers if they impose an exorbitant rate. The Minister has made this proposal which gives the welcome option of transfer or allowing the developer to build. It is likely that most local authorities will choose the latter because it is simpler than bringing in a new contractor. All local authorities seek tenders from contractors nowadays. There would be little point bringing in a second developer or builder when there is a builder with the planning permission on site already. It will cut costs in the long term not to split a project 80-20 between two contractors. It would also be more desirable to have one builder build an entire project. I would imagine that the vast majority of developments will be done in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern remains about amendment No. 254n, the proposed (a)(ii)(II) which refers to &ldquo;the building and attributable development costs as agreed between the authority and the developer, including profit on the costs,&rdquo;. The first part of this provision refers to the building and development costs &ldquo;as agreed between the authority and the developer&rdquo; and it is a safeguard. However, the phrase &ldquo;including profit on the costs&rdquo; seems rather stark. Profit on the costs to the developer <Col N="582" /> means the market profits. Unless we constrain that in the legislation then that will be the interpretation. It will be difficult for the local authority and the builder to decide in advance the exact amount of profit because the market changes so much and building is generally not completed within a period of six months.</P>
    <P>We need to insert a provision on the lines of what Senator Walsh and others have said. He said that we should go back to the concept of a certificate of reasonable value which would be determined on the basis of examining the costs of labour and materials and adding a mark up on that. That was the old way of doing it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would examine this section again. Unless there is an agreement on the profit on the costs builders will argue strongly about them after projects have been completed. What happens if there is a disagreement about costs between the local authority and the builder after the construction has taken place? We must get a formula that will reflect a reasonable profit on the costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If Members look at the detail of this section again, most of the valid points and concerns expressed by Members are covered in it.</P>
      <P>With regard to price, Senator Ormonde's point about the danger of shoddy work on houses designated as social and affordable housing and Senator Costello's point, it is specified in this Bill that the agreement will be for a certain number of houses of a certain description at a stated price. When the agreement is signed the price, the type of house and all the details are fixed. As in a local authority housing scheme, even though the builder may say he is finished, the council will send a clerk of works or an engineer to check that building is up to standard before the houses are taken over by the local authority. There are safeguards in this.</P>
      <P>The price and description must be in the agreement. I think I dealt with the issue of profit. If a builder is looking for exorbitant profits it will mean his houses are not affordable. Therefore, the local authority will have to say to the builder that it will take the land instead and build affordable houses. That is the safeguard. It addresses the questions raised about people being gazumped, full market values and current prices. As Members know, local authorities have their own housing schemes and deal with builders on a regular basis. Therefore, they have a good idea &ndash; a better idea than most people &ndash; about the going rate for housing in a particular area. If a builder tries to get up on the local authority's back, so to speak, under this scheme it has the option to say that it cannot reach an agreement on the project, that the builder is looking for too high a profit and that the houses are not affordable, and it can take the land. This section adequately deals with the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator McDonagh's point about passing on costs, the same point arises. If <Col N="583" /> the local authority is involved in this business it will have a good idea of prices. There is no need for builders to increase the price of houses and take the level of profits that they are taking at present. I discussed this last week on a number of radio programmes. The other planning changes we have made, particularly the changes in densities, will more than adequately compensate builders. I have not noticed, unfortunately, that the price of new houses has been reduced in any of the new areas or any areas where increased densities have been granted.</P>
    <P>Despite what builders have said, and while it may not be widespread yet and they may not have reached sites where the increased densities have been given, increased densities are being granted. Last week I gave an example that up to the change in densities one would get, on average, ten houses per acre on 100 acres, taking into account differences between city and county areas. The increased density guidelines offer about a 33 per cent to 40 per cent increased density on a site. Therefore, on a site where there could have been 1,000 houses at ten per acre, with the increased density a builder can now build 1,120 houses on 80 acres &ndash; that takes the 20 per cent into account. That is sufficient compensation for builders. There is no reason for them to increase house prices.</P>
    <P>Last week builders made an attempt to frighten the public and to influence the debate that was taking place in this House, saying there would be a 24 per cent increase in house prices as a result of this Bill. There is no need for such an increase. It should not happen. House prices should be stabilised or even fall slightly in new housing estates. There is nothing in this Bill that will increase house prices. It is only the greed of builders that will increase house prices.</P>

The matter was raised by Senator Walsh. The critical term &ldquo;market value&rdquo; was not in the original Bill but it is included in the amendment. I have a vested interest in this matter because I have zoned land, as I have stated before. How is the market value to be established? Will it be established in the same way as in the case of motorway acquisitions? Perhaps the Minister would prefer to wait until we get to the amendment but I thought it would speed matters up.</P>

      <P>These amendments cover a fair amount of ground and I will try to get through them as quickly as possible. The only substantive change to section 82 relates to the resolution of disputes and is consequential on the additional options now introduced in subsection (3). The other changes are designed to improve the drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Any dispute that might arise in regard to the amount of compensation, such as for land transferred to the local authority and/or affordable housing, is a matter for an official arbitrator. Any other dispute would be referred to An Bord Pleanála for resolution, as we discussed earlier. It is only the local authority, developer or landowner who may refer such disputes to An Bord Pleanála, which we also discussed previously.</P>
    <P>Section 82 (5) provides that where land is transferred to a planning authority in accordance with subsection (3), the compensation to be paid is to be based on the existing use of land or, where the land was bought before the date of the publication of the Bill, the price actually paid, whichever is the greater. The amendment to subsection (5) is to clarify the definition of &ldquo;existing use value&rdquo;. The definition now proposed is the same as that in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. It is important that this Bill is in line with that. There is no policy change &ndash; it makes it clear based on precedence.</P>
    <P>In subsection (5)(b), the words &ldquo;legally enforceable agreement or&rdquo; are inserted before &ldquo;option&rdquo; for reasons of clarity. The only substantive changes to subsection 6 are consequential on the additional options in subsection (3) which we discussed. The amendments to subsection (7) are largely technical. The subsection sets out the use to which planning authorities can put any land transferred to them under this section. A new paragraph (b) is being introduced to subsection (7) which will place an obligation on the local authority to ensure the lands or sites transferred to them under this section are maintained in a proper condition and in a state that does not adversely affect other houses or lands in the neighbourhood. That was included as a result of observations we received.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) is a new subsection which is also consequential on the additional options introduced in subsection (3). It specifies that any houses made available under the second option must be used for the provision of social or affordable housing for persons eligible for such housing. However, the houses do not have to be transferred to the local authority. An alternative arrangement involving the transfer to an approved voluntary housing body will meet the requirements, provided the houses are made available to eligible persons.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) is also a new provision and makes it clear that if a local authority is in possession of land or houses as a result of the operation of this section and due to a fall off in the demand for social or affordable housing in a particular area such housing is no longer required, it may divert the land to other purposes connected with its functions, for example, as a community facility, library etc. and sell it, or houses, on the market. However, there is an important requirement to keep faith with the purposes of section 82 &ndash; where the land is diverted to another use, the money must go into a separate account to be expended on social and affordable housing. Simi<Col N="590" /> larly, if land or houses are sold, the proceeds must be treated in the same way. Subsection (10) provides that instead of a transfer of land, where it is not practical because of the size of the site, the planning authority may require payment of an amount of equivalent value. The first amendment clarifies the section and substitutes an amount for &ldquo;a sum equivalent in value&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment No. 255 is an alternative wording. The meaning of the subsection with my proposed amendment is sufficiently clear and, therefore, the Labour Party amendment is unnecessary. The same principle is conceded in this amendment. My second amendment to subsection (10) provides that where the planning authority and the person granted planning permission cannot agree the sum to be paid, the matter shall be determined by the property arbitrator rather than An Bord Pleanála. A dispute in relation to the amount to be paid would be more appropriate to the expertise of a property arbitrator.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments to subsection (11) is to bring the wording into line with other amendments to this subsection. The amendments to subsection (12) raise the exemption threshold. The original text provided that the provisions of this part of the Bill would apply to all developments in excess of two dwellings on 0.2 of a hectare. That is being changed to five units. This could be applied more easily having regard to the maximum quota of 20 per cent. The level of the threshold is now balanced having regard to all the interests involved. I realise that the existence of a threshold below which the requirements of this part do not apply creates a risk that developers will try to use the exemption to avoid the requirements of the strategy perhaps by breaking up sites. It is the obligation of Government to ensure that any loopholes are closed off. I hope to introduce an anti-avoidance amendment on Report Stage to ensure this measure is not abused. I have retained the threshold for housing development on 0.2 hectares or less of land. The exemption for reconstruction has been tidied up to ensure, for example, that a major apartment development cannot be considered a conversion by virtue of retaining a small portion of the walls of the old building.</P>
    <P>Subsection (13) is a new subsection dealing with time limits on planning permission. The amendment provides that planning permissions granted for residential developments on applications made after the publication of this Bill and before the incorporation of a housing strategy into the development plan will wither at the end of 2002 or two years after the grant of permission whichever is the later for houses not commenced by then. This would give builders a reasonable opportunity to build out permissions obtained before the coming into force of housing strategies under the Bill. It is desirable that all developments should be governed by the same rules as soon as possible both in the interests of equity between developers and the implementation of <Col N="591" /> policies underlying this part. The permission will cease to exist in relation to so much of the development as has not been commenced. Paragraph (b) provides that where part of a development has commenced, the developer is bound by the conditions of the planning permission in so far as they relate to the development commenced. Thus, if three-quarters of a development has commenced, a developer will be bound to complete the roads, open spaces, etc., for that part of the development as set out in the planning permission.</P>
    <P>This is a long amendment. The informal text, which has been circulated and which highlights the amendments to the original text, should be helpful to Senators. I believe the amendments strengthen and clarify the section, thereby making it much more effective.</P>

      <P>Suppose the building strategy is in place and by subterfuge a builder decides to stage his development by applying for permission to build four houses at a given time &ndash; 20 per cent of which would not be adequate to provide a house &ndash; is there any way of ensuring this form of staged development will not take place which would allow the builder to avoid providing the 20 per cent required?</P>

      <P>I was about to raise the same issue as to whether a builder could make separate applications and thereby seek to defeat the purpose of the legislation. The Minister has covered a range of issues, which I find confusing. My amendment No. 255 proposes to deal with what I regard as a major omission in the Bill where the developer can pay a sum of money rather than transferring 20 per cent of the land. It is not specified how this sum of money will be calculated. As the Minister seems to have adequately dealt with this issue, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>My point is that there may not be a disposal. Is it the market value on the day or the market value when the land was acquired which is applicable? This is a small technical but significant point. I understand what the Minister is saying about the arbitrator. I assume that would work in the same way as a motorway acquisition. In relation to Senator Coogan's point, could there be sequential developments of an area lower than the specified area, thereby unwittingly creating a loophole? I know the Minister intends introducing anti-avoidance measures and this is obviously an area where such measures would be required.</P>

      <P>If the land becomes surplus to local authority requirements for housing purposes as a result of market changes, the local authority will be in a position to use the land for community purposes and so on. Therefore, cost does not arise. If the land is sold, the money must be lodged in a special account. I appreciate that Senator Costello is withdrawing his amendment which is now incorporated in my amendments.</P>
      <P>There are no anti-avoidance measures outlined as yet because we are still working on them. I assure the House that anti-avoidance measures will be put in place to deal with the issues raised by Senators Coogan and Costello. My understanding of staged development is that full planning permission is granted for 200 or 300 houses. Staged developments of three and four houses will not constitute a loophole in the legislation. This will not be a method whereby developers can get round the provisions laid down in the legislation. Careful consideration is being given to anti-avoidance measures in order to close a variety of loopholes which it is anticipated could be exploited. I assure Senators that these measures will be considered for Report Stage, otherwise I will be back in this House after the Bill goes through the Dáil to ensure anti-avoidance measures are put in place. I will be pleased to receive suggestions from Members on Report Stage or later. There is no limit to the ingenuity of some people to discover loopholes.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 255 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 82, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose sections 82, 83, 84, 85 and part of section 86. I wish to voice my objections to these sections now and I will try not to repeat myself later.</P>
      <P>Members on this side of the House are fully supportive of the thrust of the Bill, namely, the concept of proper social integration. To date we have tried to be helpful in terms of making proposals and suggestions, many of which the Minister has either taken on board or placed under consideration for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>My concern, which I also voiced on Second Stage, relates to the constitutionality of section 82. Under Article 43 of the Constitution, there is a possibility that the section might be challenged. There is also a possibility that it could be challenged on the grounds of discrimination rather than those of property rights. My concerns in this regard have not been laid to rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has probably had long debates about this matter with people who are more familiar than I with the legal niceties of the situation. However, I have spoken to a number of people who believe that while builders might be more satisfied with the position following the introduction of the Minister's amendments, they may still <Col N="593" /> decide to mount a challenge to the section. There are a number of grounds on which they may do so. For example, 20 per cent of the allocation decided upon in a local authority's strategy plan may be given to one or two developers or builders. These individuals will be quite satisfied with the position but the developers who were not included may be disgruntled and they might decide to challenge the allocation on the basis that it was inequitable.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter which has given rise to concerns. Senator Walsh referred to housing co-operatives and I accept that these played an important role in the past. However, I had a discussion earlier today with a member of a housing co-operative which obtained land from a local authority and proceeded to develop it and he informed me that one of the houses built on that land was being sold for £228,000. In other words, the local authority provided a site which has increased in value to such a degree that the person to whom I spoke could become quite wealthy if he decided to sell his house.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of discussing housing co-operatives in depth because one of the regulations governing their establishment stated that if a house was built the owner could sell it immediately. I am not sure if that regulation remains in force but it was in force in 1969 when I benefited from being a member of a co-operative.</P>
    <P>If a developer decides to build 100 houses, 80 units for normal sale and 20 for social housing, the rules and regulations state that each house must meet the same standards of quality and I am sure every local authority will ensure that such standards are met. In that context, let us consider the case of a person with an income of £30,000 who decides that, with a good beneficiary mortgage and low interest rates, he or she can afford to purchase a house worth £150,000. When they move in they discover that the house next door is designated as socially affordable and it was bought for £80,000 or £90,000 despite the fact that the owner's earnings are only £2,000 to £3,000 less than theirs. That would not sit well with the person who paid the full price who might ask why they should not reduce their income in order to qualify for social housing. If they did so, they would become a net beneficiary in the future when, after the agreed term, they would be entitled to sell the house. That is one of the difficulties which arises in respect of this section.</P>
    <P>Developers sometimes have a tendency to inflate house prices and exaggerate the costs they incur. They have now threatened to increase the price of houses built for normal sale in order to cover the cost of selling 20 per cent of the land on which they are developing back to local authorities at agricultural prices. While they may not increase prices to the levels reported in the newspapers, etc., there is an opportunity for them to do so.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, particularly the question of constitutionality and a number of others, I am <Col N="594" /> concerned that the section will not work, that the Bill might prove to be too convoluted and cumbersome and that it will not achieve its aim. I suggest we adopt the proposals put forward by Senator Costello which are simpler, easier to understand and less convoluted than those contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On a radio programme last week, when asked why local authorities sold their land banks, the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, replied that he did not know. To find an answer he should cast his mind back to 1977 when, as a member of the then Government, he abolished rates on houses, an action which resulted in local authorities finding themselves strapped for cash. This was one of the major reasons they sold their land banks. They often sold their land in order that community halls or other facilities could be built, but the main reason was that they had no alternative source of funding. That is why we have arrived at the current impasse.</P>
    <P>I hope the provision succeeds but I fear it will prove unworkable and unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in section 82 are quite radical. However, the mere fact that they have received a great deal of support in the House is indicative of the need to tackle the problem of social inclusion in addition to ensuring that the largest number of people possible can afford to buy houses. I share some of Senator Coogan's concerns because a great deal of builders' and developers' money is riding on the implementation of these provisions. These people are doing exceedingly well at present and, apart from any pitfalls the section may contain, they may have been advised to delay the implementation because doing so might prove beneficial. In my opinion the Minister could introduce a number of measures which developers and others might consider before embarking on such a course of action.</P>
      <P>I suggested previously that, given the levels of profit involved, it would not be beyond him to introduce a special levy on house building and house sales. In that context, any property above a reasonable value would attract a levy of 50 per cent. A rising scale could then be used so that for every additional £10,000 on the value of a property, the levy would increase incrementally to 90 per cent. The money this would yield could then be used as a fund to help local authorities tackle the problem of social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The construction industry is probably the greatest beneficiary of our booming economy. I do not begrudge those involved in the industry their success because for many decades they operated on very low margins. However, housing does not only involve economic issues, it involves social and other issues and it must be dealt with in a way which ensures that the public good, not the interests of a particular segment of the commercial market, predominates. I hope people will reflect before embarking on the type of challenge to which Senator Coogan referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> I have no difficulty with people buying local authority houses or participating in housing co-operatives and subsequently gaining reward from being a beneficiary. Republicanism involves helping people to succeed in life and providing them with equal opportunities. Where this happens, we should applaud it rather than decry it. The more people we encourage to exercise their flair, imagination and ambition, the more our country and economy will prosper.</P>

      <P>We do not want this discussion to develop into a Second Stage debate. However, we are discussing an important principle, namely, whether this desirable and radical proposal is practical and whether it will prove workable in both the long and short terms. It is extremely beneficial on two grounds. First, it will provide a long-term solution to our housing needs and we will not experience crises in the future. Ironically, the only local authority that will not benefit from it very easily, as an individual local authority, is my local authority, Dublin Corporation, because of the shortage of building land. We can only deal with that in the greater Dublin context.</P>
      <P>The second benefit, to which Senator Walsh referred, is that it is a very useful instrument to tackle social exclusion. That is very important especially now as we are developing into a very prosperous society because there would be greater pressures to build up a two-tier society, which we have experienced in the past. One can see the pressures currently. It is important that we can build it into our legislative proposals so it is part of our policy on the development of this country. This legislation would do more than many other policy measures that might be introduced to effect that.</P>
      <P>It will be argued that it might be unconstitutional. Ironically, the Minister rejected my proposed amendments on fast-tracking this measure on the grounds that his amendment was stronger on constitutional safeguards and while my measure might be better when it comes to expedite it, his might provide a better constitutional safeguard, with which I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On alleged discrimination &ndash; there is discrimination countrywide. Senator Coogan said that some local authorities will take the full 20 per cent, others will not need it. There is greater density in one local authority than in another. As it stands, in terms of the way the building takes place and the density of the building, one could argue that a builder in Dublin would get a much greater density. On current height restrictions, currently applications for Smithfield involve 24 storeys, and some received by the Docklands Development Authority involve 27 storeys. This is an area of benefit to the builder due to the extra profits they are likely to make. Overall, this is in the common good and the public interest. That is the overriding feature of the Constitution and any challenge will reflect that. If that was not <Col N="596" /> reflected in any constitutional case taken, then let the constitution be changed.</P>

      <P>During this debate I have acknowledged the support for Part V and various sections of it. I ask Senator Coogan to reconsider his position on behalf of his party. With respect to the Senator, he cannot say that he supports our aims in Part V and then remove the only means we have in this section of attaining them. Section 2 is the linchpin of Part V. It provides a means of ensuring the aspirations of the development plans and that the housing strategies are achieved. Without section 82 we might as well scrap all of Part V. That is the effect of the Senator's amendment. I ask him to reconsider. How can one deliver housing on affordable terms to low or middle income households unless land costs are kept down? It is not possible. Unless this is put in place, housing will remain unaffordable for many people and prices will continue to increase because of exorbitant site prices and so on. Sites are not the only cost involved but if we do not do this, it makes a joke of the whole Bill.</P>
      <P>We can talk about the rights of individuals and society and the common good but we should never lose sight of the fact that a public body, that is the local authority, makes millionaires of people overnight simply by drawing a line on a map and rezoning a piece of property. That person, whether a developer or landowner, is made very wealthy by the actions of State, <i>via </i>the local authorities. There must be some moral responsibility held by people who receive windfalls from the State in that way to give something back. As the Senator knows, I am certain that this is constitutional because it meets the criteria for being fair, proportional and equitable but we will not decide that, the Supreme Court may decide it. I am advised that it is constitutional and I am satisfied that it is. As Senator Costello said, if the Supreme Court rules that the Constitution does not allow us as legislators to make decisions here that are clearly for the common good, that everybody in this House and in the country believes are right to ensure that people have a roof over their head, then I agree with Senator Costello that there is something wrong with the Constitution and we should do something about it, but this may not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coogan mentioned Article 43 of the Constitution. There are other sections in the Constitution, adjuncts to Article 43 being one of them, which refer to the common good, and under the Constitution, the right to property can be regulated by law. That is what we are doing. It is why Part V is so detailed and complex, as the Senator said, but it is complex because we need to be seen to be fair to everybody involved. We have a duty as legislators to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves. We have a duty for social order, equity and so on, but this must be balanced against the rights to private property. We have done that in this Bill. I respect the support I have received and I ask Fine Gael <Col N="597" /> not to call a division on this issue. It would be a severe embarrassment to the party at a later stage if they are seen to be opposing the only section that would provide the means by which social and affordable housing can be provided. I ask them to consider that before they call a division on this.</P>

      <P>The Minister has cited Article 43.2.2 which relates to the common good. If there is to be a decision on the question of constitutionality, it would be on Article 2.1 <i>v. </i>Article 2.2. However, that is for another day and not for us. I only raise it in the context that it may be challenged and as such we will not know where we stand on this Bill. There are a number of things I wish to examine before Report Stage and that is why it is critical to tease this out. I will set aside my opposition to sections 82, 83, 84, 85 and part of 86 and examine it again on Report Stage. There are a number of minor issues outside the constitutionality question which may cause a problem.</P>
      <P>I am willing to put them aside and examine them again on Report Stage provided, of course, it is not taken immediately. We want to examine this pivotal section, the most important aspect of the legislation. Much of the rest of the Bill consolidates older legislation.

      <P>The original text provided that where the purchaser sells the house within ten years he or she would be required to pay back to the local authority an amount equivalent to the local authority's equity in the property, that is, a percentage represented by the difference between the affordable price paid and the market value at the time of sale. That was abated by 10 per cent for ten years. Many of the comments on the Bill considered this to be an over-generous arrangement. On reconsideration, therefore, I now propose a full clawback on the local authority's equity on any sale within the first ten years &ndash; as suggested by some Members on Second Stage &ndash; and that the local authority's equity would then be abated at a rate of 10 per cent per year between the tenth and the 20th year. Therefore, after 20 years occupation, rather than ten as heretofore, the clawback would disappear. This is probably a more appropriate level of clawback and fits in with the usual mortgage term of 20 years. It is also in line with the amendment put forward by Senator Henry. Subsection (3)(c) is a new provision and provides that if house prices fall the clawback would not operate in a way that would result in the seller being left with a lesser amount than he or she paid at the outset. Members will agree that that is only fair.</P>
      <P>In paragraph (d) I have provided that in calculating the amount of the clawback, due allowance will be made for any material improvement made to the House. For example, if a householder builds an extension to the house the value of this will be deducted from the sale price before calculating the sale price on which the clawback is assessed. Improvement is defined to include extending, enlarging, repairing and converting, but it excludes decorating. The amendments to subsection (4) tidy the draft and contain no change of substance.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking these amendments on board. The reason for including them is to prevent opportunistic profit taking. I know that is not the intention of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> I take seriously Senator Coogan's remarks about these sections being subject to constitutional challenge. However, sometimes we incorrectly second guess constitutional challenges. For example, Senator O'Toole and I were sure that the Employment Equality Bill would fall on the grounds of religious discrimination, yet it fell on grounds which are virtually the preserve of the planning laws, namely that it put too much of an imposition on small employers to make access to their premises available to disabled people. It is sometimes hard to read the mind of the Supreme Court and we must wait to see what happens.</P>
    <P>I was very influenced by the Dublin docklands affordable housing scheme, which contains similar kinds of restrictions. This is a sensible provision because ten years is not a long period. I accept that people move around the country and so on, but these factors must be considered when they buy into what is a very generous scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of improvements to the house, the Minister has excluded decoration or any improvements carried out on the land, including the construction of a house. I understand why that should apply where a second house is built. However, would the construction of a garage be taken into account? A garden shed is a small matter, but a garage could be substantial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reason for this amendment. It is reasonably generous, although the person who buys the affordable house is only saving the difference between the market value of the site, which has escalated considerably in recent times, and, say, the agricultural value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>That is correct. It could perhaps mean £15,000 in a rural area. Apparently statistics indicate that the average person changes house three times in a lifetime. In view of this a period of 20 years is a little long and perhaps the Minister could reconsider that for Report Stage. I would have suggested a ten year discount from the end of year five.</P>

      <P>Part of the aim of this section is to encourage community stability, the decline of which is one of the most regrettable developments in the country. We should look carefully at what has happened elsewhere, especially in America, and note that other European countries are also trying to encourage community stability. It is desirable that people should be flexible and available to move around the country to various <Col N="600" /> jobs, but undoubtedly community life suffers greatly once there is not a certain amount of community stability.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important in this respect because it will give those who are the bedrock of communities a chance to stay where their parents and grandparents live. What has been described as the gentrification of areas such as Ringsend over the past number of years is an example. It is no joke to the people whose parents and grandparents have lived there for years to find that houses around the corner which perhaps ten years ago would have sold for £30,000, are now selling for £170,000 to £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of forbidding people to sell their houses. They can be sold immediately or after a couple of years. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that they cannot make a huge profit on the sale by cashing in on the scheme. If it is not handled carefully people could be asked by others to apply and move on after ten years, which is not a long period of time in inner city areas. We heard earlier about professional objectors. We could have professional purchasers if we are not careful. It is not a question of tying anybody into a dwelling &ndash; the provision does not prevent resales but it does prevent the making of huge profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry on the need for community stability. However, a point is reached where families find that a smaller house would suffice for their needs. We have encountered this in our local authority schemes. There is a fine balance here because this may become a disincentive for a family to move on when the children have moved out. Overall it could mean that the best use is not being made of the housing stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. We drafted the Bill with the idea of making the scheme apply for ten years with no clawback at the end of year ten. I was surprised at the number of submissions and comments we received to the effect that this period was too short. In common with others, this change was made in response to a huge number of suggestions for amendments to this section. I was surprised at the number of people who suggested that the initial provision was much too generous. On that basis, and on the basis that the docklands scheme will operate over a 20 year period, we have proceeded with this amendment. No matter what one does with a scheme of this kind, <Col N="601" /> one has to make a call in trying to get the right balance.</P>
      <P>The element of community stabilisation in the provision is very important. Nobody is prevented from selling their house, but we are tying to prevent people from making exorbitant profits. I see the relevance of Senator O'Brien's point with regard to rural communities. The period may be too long. However, the housing crisis is most acute in city areas. I had an opportunity yesterday or the day before to meet with some of the people from Eastwall who are facing the problem of not being able to afford houses in their own community and I do not want to contribute to or exacerbate that. We should not have an attitude that &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo;  should not be allowed to live in these communities as it is good for the communities but it is vitally important that there should be a mechanism to encourage people to stay there. As I explained to the group I met, it is not easy to say the sites or affordable or social housing in Eastwall should only be available to people living there, but we will try to facilitate them. It is important that a basic community fabric should remain and that &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; people have a chance of staying in their own communities.</P>
      <P>On balance, we probably have this right but in years to come it may need to be addressed by my successor. At this stage, it is better to err on the side of caution than live to regret it. If this condition is not inserted I can imagine the headlines in four or five years' time that people are moving out and making huge profits.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised the Minister has received a number of representations on this issue. The docklands authority includes some members of the local community and they did not oppose the 20 year provision because they have seen what has happened in local areas when local authority houses were built. When the houses were sold to the tenants nobody could have envisaged the rise in house prices &ndash; there was no clawback, which was a hot political issue. One such house was sold recently in my area for more than £200,000. Tenants are willing to sell these houses to the local authority but the local authority cannot afford to buy them because of the high prices. That situation should not be allowed to recur. That is the reason the Minister is receiving such representations. Local people want to close that gap.</P>

I would rather see the Minister taking a tough line now and worry about it down the road &ndash; please God I might be around to keep an eye on it. It is better to do this now and see how it works. If it proves to be appalling for people in ten or 20 years' time it can be changed.</P>

      <P>This amendment involves the deletion of the words &ldquo;an employee of the Board or of a person whose services are availed of by the Board by virtue of section 107&rdquo;. This relates to a person who is authorised by the board to act on its behalf. This person may become as important as the chairperson of the board or another member and a distinction should be made. The matter of applying the seal of the board is serious.

      <P>My amendment No. 263 goes a good way towards the point that is being made. It would provide that the President of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge will be on the nominating committee of the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála. Amendment No. 263 will include Irish language organisations among the bodies which can select persons to one of the existing panels for nomination to the board. That particular amendment will meet at least some of the concerns of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan's points are adequately covered by the existing provisions which allow panels to be drawn up with representatives from bodies interested in environmental matters and from bodies representative of local government. This last panel is a new one and I expect at least some of those bodies mentioned in Senator Coogan's amendment to be included in the regulations among the prescribed bodies. We are back to the point about perhaps dealing flexibly with this in regulations rather than it in law.</P>
      <P>The other amendment requests that the environment panel should also contain bodies concerned with the national heritage. That is a specific term which is used in the national heritage council legislation. It is not included in planning law and is not appropriate here. The existing term &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in its broadest sense is wide enough to cover the same organisations as the term &ldquo;national heritage&rdquo; encompasses. I am prepared to go some way to meeting what is being sought here. I am prepared, in regulations, to make the Heritage Council a nominating body for the selection of candidates to the board under the panel in section 91(1)(b). That should suffice to meet the concerns of Senators.</P>

I am also satisfied that those referred to in amendment No. 265 will come under the panel referred to in section 91(1)(b). If they can be included, I would accept that.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my other amendment was to ensure that the board would be large enough. I was seeking an increase in the numbers because they have so much extra work.

      <P>We are trying in this Bill to ensure the efficient working and streamlining of An Bord Pleanála and, indeed, all the planning procedures. One of the proposals, to which we will come shortly, is to allow the board by law to work in divisions. There may be a division working on infrastructural development and another one on housing. It is in the interests of the efficient working of the board. To change the quorum for these divisions from three to five would act contrary to that desire to streamline the procedure. It would obviously be a waste of resources as well as being very inefficient. In light of the further proposals contained in the Bill I would ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned earlier the efficient working of the board. I understand the board can deal with planning applications as they come and they are not prioritised, but it is necessary to do so. For instance, the ESB currently has two applications for new plants and urgency should be given to such applications in the public interest. If applications are taken as they come the most important ones could be left behind and delayed. The Minister should intervene to encourage the board to prioritise applications and deal with the most urgent ones first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some applications may be for quite small, uncomplicated and fairly straightforward developments. I do not know how the structure works, but perhaps there could be a small section to deal with those kinds of applications. Major developments that have implications could be dealt with by a more specialist group within the <Col N="608" /> section, although I am not sure if that is being done at present. That point might be examined. When applications come in there should be some way of screening and assessing the nature of the objections. There is an onus on us to try to eliminate the extortion of money from developers. That often occurs on the basis that the objection, by running its course, will be sufficiently inconvenient to force a developer to meet a request for funds in order to have the application withdrawn. We should try to eliminate that by tackling it in every possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The board can prioritise matters and, in a general sense, we can indicate to the board what it should prioritise. At the moment, appeals that have major implications for employment or for building projects of over 50 houses are being given priority by An Bord Pleanála. A difficulty arises if an application is before the board, such as the ones concerning power stations. Under what was section 73, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is precluded from interfering in any way in an individual application before the board. The board has regard, however, to national priorities, specifically the two I have mentioned. I will not comment on current applications and it would not be right for me to do so, but applications can be prioritised. There is no specialist group, as such, within the board at the moment, although we are trying to allow the board to work in divisions. The practical effect of this would be that certain people who are specialised in housing would deal with that sector while others would deal with other aspects.</P>
      <P>As regards screening objections, in the past the board has been a little too careful with the power it has concerning vexatious appeals. I would like to see the board using its discretion a bit more on that matter. If it is challenged and goes to the courts, at least it will establish what the board has to do. However, it cannot just do that on a willy-nilly basis; it must have a reasonable case for believing that something is vexatious. Senator Walsh has already made the point that nowadays, by obtaining a book on planning or development law, people can find some kind of organisation&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 268:</P>
      <P>In page 100, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)The Chairperson shall assign a member of the Board to review the file on every planning appeal, referral or other planning function of the Board and it shall be the duty of that Board member to prepare a report having read the full file particularly the inspector's report. This report shall summarise the planning issues and contain a recommendation for decision by the entire Board or any 3 members of the Board. After a decision on a planning matter is made the report and recommendation of the individual Board members shall be attached to the file and made available for public inspection.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is aimed at encouraging openness in the workings of the board. It desires the chairperson to assign work to various members of the board to ensure that all inspectors' reports are read by members of the board, and to have their comments placed on the file which will be made available to the public.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 269 seeks to ensure that &ldquo;the chairperson shall not request any inspector or a board member who has been requested to make a report and recommendation to the board to alter such a report or recommendation&rdquo;. The file should go straight to the board exactly as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would require a board member assigned to deal with a planning appeal to prepare a written report on the appeal for submission to the board, and that would be attached to the file. However, the files on practically all appeals requiring a formal board decision contain reports, including recommendations, from the inspectors. The file, including the report, is examined by a board member who presents the file to other members of the board. In light of experience there is no need for a further report from the board member presenting the file summarising the planning issues and containing a further recommendation for decision by the board. The procedure outlined in the amendment would be very bureaucratic and it is unnecessarily cumbersome. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 269 provides that a board member should not request an inspector to alter a report or recommendation. It is in line with existing practice that a board member does not request an inspector to change his or her recommendations, as such. This is obviously seen in cases where the board's decision does not follow the inspector's recommendation. I see no need for this amendment. In exceptional cases it might be necessary to alter a draft report in consultation with the inspector. For example, a report may inadvertently contain a factual error or even a sentence which is seriously indiscreet. That is a different thing, however, to altering a recommendation. It is important that these corrections <Col N="610" /> can still be pointed out and dealt with. Reports that are being prepared for Ministers and Departments often contain matters that are clearly incorrect and so an opportunity is given for people to correct them.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 271 is similar to that regarding the alteration of an inspector's report and would require that at least three board members would have read the report before a decision is made. I am satisfied that the present arrangements work satisfactorily and I do not wish to accept this amendment either. Approximately 10 per cent of inspectors' reports are not accepted. That is an indication that people are being allowed to express their views on reports and that no pressure is being put on them. The amendment seems to stem from a fear that someone on the board may bully inspectors into changing reports. There is clearly no evidence to support that. Inspectors are independent. The board, which has the overall responsibility for making decisions, should make them on the basis of the reports but should not slavishly follow them. Other matters must be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on Second Stage on behalf of the members of the Mid-East Regional Authority. They were overwhelmingly of the view that reasons must be stated. Amendment No. 274a appears to require merely a record of a decision and not the reasons for it. I assume parties to an appeal are told why a decision is made. I accept the Minister's point that the board should have the right to overrule the inspector. I would not remove that right. However, the case <Col N="611" /> of Arthurstown dump in Kill, County Kildare, for Dublin Corporation was controversial. In that case the inspector made a recommendation which was contrary to the subsequent ruling of the board. I do not object to such a ruling being made but there must be public access to the reason for it. Is the written record of its decision enough? Does it cover an instance such as the one I have cited? I cannot recall if the board came within the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act in that case. If information is accessible under freedom of information legislation that is satisfactory but it is important that people can find out why decisions are arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 270 would require a written record of all decisions of the board, including who was present and who voted for and against a particular proposal. It would allow a board member who disagreed with a decision to write to the chairperson and the Minister setting out why he or she disagreed with the decision. I have tabled amendment No. 274a which would require the recording of those present at a meeting and the numbers voting for and against each decision. I am opposed to naming those who vote each way. I do not think that would add anything substantial to our knowledge. It is not important for us to know who voted one way or the other and it might leave members of the board open to inducements and pressures. I cannot accept that members should be encouraged to write to the chairperson and I certainly would not encourage them to write to the Minister. I am not involved in these matters and I intend to remain so. I will be doing a favour for my successors in ensuring they do the same. The board acts as a collective decision making body and these two aspects of the Senator's amendment would encourage the breaking up of collective responsibility. Being a member of the Cabinet, I know how important that is. I cannot accept that this amendment is a good idea.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis may recall that subsection 39(9) states that a decision under that section or section 36 and the notification of the decision shall state the main reasons and considerations on which the decision is based, and where conditions are imposed on the grant of any permission the decision shall state the main reasons for the imposition of any such conditions, provided that where a condition imposed is a condition described in subsection (4), a reference to the paragraph of subsection (4) in which the condition is described shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of that subsection. If the board has an inspector's report which recommends on this and the board decides otherwise, this should be made clear by stating the reasons and considerations on which the decision was made. I think the Senator Dardis's point is met.</P>

      <P>Inserting this amendment would be inappropriate and contrary to the aim of the Bill, which is to deliver a very efficient planning system. In the past, the board has been able to make up to 98 per cent of its decisions within four months. It has not been able to maintain that level, but the level is picking up again. It fell behind in recent years because of the economic boom but it is now increasing. Some 60 per cent of its decisions in October were made within four months, compared with its lowest point of 40 per cent in May. As a result of a number of decisions we have taken over the past months, that performance will continue to improve very substantially. The improvements were due to increased staffing levels and increased incentives within the board for completing files. That seems to be working extremely well. I hope that percentage will increase substantially over the coming months.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh's amendment would not allow the board to extend the time period. While we would all like to agree with that proposal, it would not be practical in all cases, some of which become very complicated and can need outside consultants and wider consideration. It would not be a good move to totally shut off any extension. It also would not be practical in all cases. It is the board's aim, and mine, to ensure the highest percentage possible will be dealt with within four months. I am confident that will happen.</P>

We talk nowadays about the need to expedite decisions, and I welcome what the Minister has just said on that, and the need to be customer friendly. The 18 week period, which is one third of a year, is more than adequate. We <Col N="616" /> spoke in the discussion on amendment No. 165 about 21 days instead of eight weeks. I find it difficult to agree fully with what the Minister said. A great deal can be done within one third of a year. It is a long time for someone to wait and gives people time to make their case. I feel fairly strongly about this amendment because the period provided is sufficiently long, and I am inclined to press it.</P>

      <P>I understand perfectly what Senator McDonagh is attempting to do here, which is to give a greater degree of certainty to the applicant about the time he will have to wait. I do not disagree with the principle. However, some of the cases which come before the board are extremely complicated. We mentioned one earlier. I do not want to prejudice any outcome but applications concerning power stations do not arise very often and expertise may have to be sought from outside the board by employing certain consultants or where information needs to be gathered. The Tara Mines application in County Meath was very complicated and may have been the first application for mining in modern times. The expertise might not be readily available to the board and the issues could become very complicated. A strict 18 week deadline would mean that, in the end, the board would not have sufficient time to deal adequately with the application. It would then refuse the application to cover itself and suggest to the applicants that they resubmit. For those reasons it would not be wise to have an absolute cut-off but I respect the principle on which the amendment is tabled.</P>

      <P>Up to three or four years ago we were meeting the 18 week objective. Then all hell broke loose with the economic boom and the many resultant applications.

It is open to the Minister to prescribe the timeframe for particular types of planning classes.</P>

      <P>This is getting confusing. We are not going to extend the length of time to 26 weeks. I understand why that is so as people can often delay further if the length of time is extended. However, if the board does not think it is going to meet its target, it has to start writing to a large number of people. Perhaps I misunderstand the section. I have suggested an additional clause whereby, if more information comes to the board, it would not have to write to people if it was not going to give its decision within the agreed time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a prescribed period for the board in the sense that it is a strict limit and one has to get permission for extensions in the same way as the eight weeks for local authorities. This is merely an objective. The section begins:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Board to ensure that appeals and referrals are disposed of as expeditiously as may be and, for that purpose, to take all steps as are open to it. . . </P>
      <P>It further states that without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) it shall be an objective to secure every appeal if referral is determined within a period of 18 weeks. It is not the same legal obligation as applies to a local authority to make the decision within eight weeks. It is an objective that is an imperative. It is a target which, at the time, was deemed reasonable and will again be reasonable in light of the new staffing arrangements and procedures in the board. I would be reluctant to extend the period any further as one could end up continuously extending it. The 18 weeks objective is useful. It is also useful to have a degree of flexibility so that it can take longer in particular circumstances. The Minister retains the power to stipulate that decisions should be made within four or eight weeks or whatever for a particular application.</P>

    <P>It has to tell all those who have made submissions or observations to the board. That is an enormous amount of work. My amendment suggests that if new information comes to the board, it does not have to get involved in this process of writing to a large number of people. An enormous number of people may have to be written to if the board does not think it is going to meet its target date. Many staff members may be tied up writing to people telling them this when one might have a better chance of meeting that date if the board was not obliged to do so. I know the objective is to give people information and I am in favour of that objective. However, it seems that there is an incredible amount of scribing in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>Perhaps an easier way to approach this would be not to impose the obligation on the board to inform people if it is not going to make the 18 week target. That would be a simpler way out of this rather than extending the period. However, I am not sure that such a course of action would meet with universal approval in these days when there is a fixation with transparency, openness and accountability. I will look at this issue but I would not like to give the Senator a false impression. On a personal basis it would help achieve my objective of streamlining the process if the board did not have to notify people it was not going to meet the 18 week deadline. However, many Senators would criticise the Senator and me if we went down that route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirements of the planning appeals process have never required submissions made to the planning authorities to be passed on to the board when dealing with an appeal. This is because in many cases the points made at local authority stage are overtaken by events by the time an appeal gets to the board. Changes will have taken place or conditions may have been put down. The board reviews cases <i>ab initio</i> or right from the start and, therefore, it is up to the appellants and to persons making observations to make their views known to the board at appeal stage, otherwise the board will be lumbered with all sorts of submissions, some relevant and some not. This would not aid an efficient decision making process.</P>
      <P>For many years I was not aware that the full file is not sent to the planning appeals board. I discovered this about seven or eight years ago. The public probably do not know that. It should be examined from the local authority's point of view. Perhaps a note to this effect should be placed on the bottom of planning decisions being sent to people. As this amendment suggests, it is important for people to know about the process. We have struck the right balance in the legislation where it states that people should base their appeal on the most up to date information. The board should also only receive an appeal that has been based on the most up to date information.</P>

We have spoken about this before. The purpose of this amendment is to specify that the only parties to such a referral to the board will be the local authority or the party or prospective party to an agreement. The content of the agreement is not a land use decision. The land use issues will have been decided in granting the planning permission subject to entering an agreement in relation to the transfer of land. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that the only parties to a referral to An Bord Pleanála should be the parties to the agreement.

      <P>The fee is payable for the board's consideration on whether there should be an oral hearing. It is not payable for the hearing itself. On the basis of past experience, the proposed refund of the fee would be likely to lead to a significant increase in the number of requests for oral hearings because people would have nothing to lose by requesting a hearing. It is in the interest of an efficient planning system that appeals should be dealt with by written submissions where possible. As I indicated earlier in the debate, the fee of up to £20 is not meant to discourage people from making a submission to a county council.

      <P>Senator Doyle is correct. Re-introducing the Minister into the appeal system, even in a limited way, is no longer acceptable. The board is an independent appeals body and it is best qualified to decide on the appeals and referrals and whether it needs to hold an oral hearing on complex cases. The people who would support this provision would be the same people who would be down on my head or that of my successor's if I gave a decision which did not suit.</P>
      <P>The philosophy of this Bill is to expand the decision making and executive functions of the board while allowing the Minister and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to concentrate on policy. In addition, disregarding the fact that bringing the Minister back into the appeals process is not appropriate, my Department has not been involved in the appeals process since 1977. Therefore, it would not have the expertise to determine appeals of this nature. There is no doubt that were an additional appeals mechanism introduced, everyone would avail of it and that would cause inordinate delays. Even if we disagree on some of these amendments and approach, all of us are committed to streamlining the system and making it more efficient.</P>

In relation to oral hearings, the board's practice is that they can be and are conducted through Irish. Both Irish and English speakers are facilitated. The present practice is generally regarded as satisfactory.</P>

    <P>The wider issue of the use of both official languages of the State will be addressed in the Irish <Col N="623" /> language Bill being brought forward by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív. The issues raised by these amendments are better addressed in the context of that Bill rather than in a piecemeal fashion in a planning Bill. On that basis I ask Senators to withdraw their amendments. What is requested is already being met or should be met in another format in the Irish language Bill.</P>

      <P>My preference would have been to take the first amendment separately. While the Minister said that An Bord Pleanála &ldquo;can&rdquo; have these facilities in place, I would prefer the inclusion of &ldquo;must&rdquo;. They do their best to facilitate people but I know a person whose native tongue is Irish and demands to be spoken to in Irish did not have the full facilities made available and felt that was inadequate, which is why I am pressing for this amendment separately. The person was not convinced that the official with whom they were dealing understood them clearly and fully. Because of the technical nature of the submission, the official did not pick up on the nuances. The provision of a person with competent Irish is a fair and reasonable request. I would be satisfied if &ldquo;must&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;can&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Senator Coogan is right, it would be better to use the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;. He made a good point. Sometimes native Irish speakers, if forced to speak through English, which they know, do not pick up on the nuances. I have experienced this with elderly patients who were native Irish speakers. Sometimes one could not make oneself clear and having only a cúpla focail was a disadvantage when trying to get a detailed explanation from them. Senator O'Toole is not here so I can say it is a terrible indictment on our education system if there are not enough Irish speakers to do this. Perhaps the Minister will look at this between now and Report Stage. There will be 12 people on the board and a considerable staff &ndash; there should be enough people to recruit to conduct an oral hearing in Irish, if that is what people require.</P>

Section 34(5) deals with appeals to the board regarding the implementation of conditions which a planning authority can impose on a grant of planning permission. In this case the <Col N="625" /> board may convene an informal meeting under section 121. My amendment clarifies this which may have caused some of the concerns behind amendment No. 291. I am opposed to that amendment which could mean that the procedures which apply to oral hearings would have to be applied to meetings convened by the board to determine a dispute where there are matters to be agreed between the planning authority and applicant on foot of a planning condition.

      <P>In page 118, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Where the Board decides by a simple majority against the recommendation of the inspector, the Board will refer the decision, and all relevant information to the appropriate local authority where the elected members will decide to grant or not to grant <Col N="628" /> by two-thirds of the total membership, this decision to be made within four weeks.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this amendment which relates to cases where an inspector makes a decision and it is overruled by the board. This happens in about 10 per cent of cases. Often an inspector has better knowledge than the board about what is happening. What appeal mechanism is involved where the inspector's report is contrary to the decision of the board? My amendment proposes that the decision should be referred to the local authority which would decide by a two-thirds majority in favour or against the decision. In other words, that all proceedings, including the inspector's report and the board's agreement rather than its decision, would be referred to the local authority which would then make its decision. This may not be the best solution but where a contradiction exists there must be a better method than allowing the inspector to be overruled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to matters we discussed previously under various guises, that is, the role of the inspector <i>vis-à-vis</i> the board and appeals to the board. The board makes the decisions. The inspector merely investigates, draws up the report and makes the recommendations. As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, whether in respect of appeals about or objections to CPOs, motorway schemes, EISs, etc., I am responsible under the law for appointing an inspector or inspectors who, in turn, hold public hearings. In the case of the Dublin port tunnel, to which Senator Joe Doyle referred on the Adjournment on Wednesday evening, the two inspectors I appointed held hearings for 22 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspectors draw up a report and offer recommendations and I am obliged to consider the EIS, the various objections, their reports and transcripts of the hearings before making a decision. If I was not in a position to be able to say that I disagreed with their conclusion, there would not be any point in the law existing in its current form. The same position applies here.</P>
      <P>The inspector has a role to play. One of the documents to which the board must have regard &ndash; in 99 per cent of cases it does so &ndash; is the inspector's report which it overturns in only 10 per cent of cases. However, the inspector is only one aspect of the matter. The board must consider issues such as the proper planning and development of an area and national policy in relation to the particular type of development being undertaken in addition to the inspector's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To accept this amendment would give greater standing to one person who is being asked to advise the board than the three or more people who have been appointed to make planning appeal decisions. It would not prevent contro<Col N="629" /> versy because an appellant who agreed with the board against the recommendation of an inspector would feel very aggrieved if the local authority overturned the board's decision. In my opinion the current situation represents the best option.</P>
    <P>There would not be any point in the board existing if the inspector's word was law. The inspector should be allowed to investigate a matter, make his report and the board can make its decision on foot of that report. I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us envisage a case where the five members of a board decide three in favour of an appeal and two against it and the inspector's report was also against it. In such a case, a decision would be made on foot of a very small majority and it may not be correct.</P>

      <P>An Bord Pleanála is not a democracy, it is an appeals body which is charged with making decisions based on the facts before it. Similarly, the courts are not a democracy in a sense. If the Supreme Court makes a decision of this nature, the judges must also base their decisions and recommendations on the facts at their disposal.

      <P>The same position applies in respect of this amendment as applied to earlier amendments. An Bord Pleanála is currently governed by the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act which also requires a register of interests to be established and for disclosures to be made where consideration of a matter may conflict with the performance of functions. The ethics Act provides a wide definition of interests including, as Members are aware, gifts and travel expenses given to a person. However, under that Act, the level for declaring an interest such as shares in a company or a holding in land is set at £10,000 rather than £1,000, which is the case under the Bill. I will consider this again before Report Stage and decide whether it should be part of this or the other Bill. I am anxious to avoid making four or five declarations in different places because one can fall between two stools in doing so. One does not know then whether one has the declarations made. The provisions contained in the ethics Bill and in the electoral Act certainly caused me confusion.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty with the amendment given that employment in local authorities is usually on a permanent basis. Automatic suspension for five years could be unconstitutional, given its interference with the right to earn a living, especially if a conviction relates to a relatively minor transgression. Membership of the board or a local authority does not guarantee permanency. There are established mechanisms under local government law to deal with local authority discipline issues which can be invoked when an employee is convicted of an offence in this area. I ask the Senator, because of the constitutional implications, to withdraw that amendment.</P>

      <P>That may be his intention in this amendment, but the current discretion given to officers is very important. We are all aware of vexatious complaints and rows between neighbours. We do not want to draw the local authority or the planning authority into squabbles on minor matters, which can be raised to huge heights, just to get back at a neighbour. That would be the effect of this amendment. We have tried to ensure under the Bill that planning authorities must respond to genuine complaints. However, if the system is to operate effectively, it is important that planning authorities have some discretion to use common sense in the operation of these provisions. Most Members have witnessed examples of various stages of complaints under planning law, involving one neighbour trying to get back at another. We should try to keep local authorities out of that as far as possible.</P>

      <P>This amendment requires the manager to report on how the planning code is being enforced in the local authority area. It provides that the local authority annual report, which is prepared in accordance with the Local Government Act, 1991, should contain details of how the enforcement provisions are being applied by planning authorities. The report must be prepared by the manager before the end of June every year and submitted to members of the authority. It is also available to members of the public to inspect or buy. This new reporting requirement should give a very good idea of how each planning authority is responding to the new requirements under this Bill. It is part of the new spirit of transparency and the enforcement system which the Bill promotes. It is also an effort on my behalf to make sure the local authorities discuss important matters like the enforcement of planning laws and the performance of the manager and the executive of local authorities on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>I welcome these provisions, particularly those on enforcement, notices and managers making reports. On Second Stage I make the point that many of provisions in this Bill will create greater efficiency within the system, which is important, but the necessary resources will have to be provided. Enforcement has not been at anything near the level required in the local authorities with which I am familiar. Resources must be applied and in many cases an individual in the planning section should be dedicated to enforcement, rather than leaving it to the local engineer or planning officer, who are trying to meet deadlines for the granting of applications.</P>

      <P>This is an important matter, which I referred to on Second Stage. The personnel and resources allocated to enforcement are important. I do not know whether that can be done in the context of the area committees. The specific remit of area committees is based on constituencies. The Dublin local authority area is divided into five and each constituency has an area committee. It is more cohesive because the councillors represent the local area and are more focused in their work. If the secretariats serving such committees dealt with housing and planning in a similar manner and enforcement officers were specific to those areas there would be a direct link between the councillors, who are aware where enforcement is required, and officials, because it is not always brought to their attention. Perhaps something can be done in that respect to focus the system of enforcement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which councils throughout the country, but particularly in Dublin, are organising themselves into area committees will be a great help to local government administration and allow people to identify more closely with their local authorities. Specific provision is being made in the local authorities of which I am aware, including Dublin, for planning enforcement, housing, etc., by the area committees. It should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 307:</P>
      <P>In page 130, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)On conviction of an offence under section 139, the court may, in addition to imposing the penalties specified in subsections (1) and (2), order the person convicted to take the steps specified in the enforcement order to be taken.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the current law if a person is convicted of an offence of failing to comply with an enforcement notice the court may impose a penalty, which can be a fine or imprisonment. However, the person may pay the fine but not comply with the enforcement notice and the breach of the law will continue. This annoys everybody and has caused great problems for local authorities. In that case the only action the authority can take is to continue to prosecute for further offences or enter onto the land and undertake the work. The amendment would enable the court order to specify that the steps in the notice must be carried out by the convicted person, who would then be subject to the court order and in contempt of court if they did not comply. This would be another means of enabling local authorities to require compliance with the <Col N="636" /> order and should strengthen the law in this regard.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I referred to a lack of environmental strength in the Bill, about which I did not elaborate. Part X and other sections deal with environmental issues but there is a potential weakness with regard to the penalties associated with such issues. The penalties under this section are appropriate and are much stronger than those in the Fisheries Acts or associated environmental legislation. For example, a false statement could be provided for an environmental impact assessment under section 156 but because of the strength of the penalties this may be the appropriate section under which to deal with the environmental damage. Perhaps the Minister will look at this before Report Stage or before the legislation reaches the Dáil. Other examples include salmon passages which were built at Clohamon weir on the River Slaney or generating plants built on salmon rivers and if these were erected in defiance of planning laws, there should be a penalty to ensure that the environment is protected. The same applies to piggeries in the Lough Sheelin catchment area. Perhaps, the Minister will take this into account.</P>

If enforcement action has not been taken within that time, I doubt very much if it will be taken within ten years. There is no benefit in extending it any further and it should be noted that the period for taking action begins at the time at which the unauthorised development first comes to the notice of the local authority. Seven years is more than adequate. The development could be in place for four or five years and then come to the attention of the local authority, which then has another seven years to take action. A potential total of 12 years is long enough. I am particularly anxious that local authorities act much quicker in regard to unfinished estates and so on.</P>

The laws governing these sites <Col N="638" /> would be likely to preclude major development taking place in them. As I do not think the issue will arise, I consider the amendment unnecessary.

This guarantee of permission where the development is fully compliant with the planning scheme is an essential element for the certainty of the SDZ. Where a development does not meet the criteria or cannot do so by way of attaching conditions, the authority must refuse permission. There is no appeal to the board either way. However, as the planning scheme has already gone through extensive public consultation, with a possible appeal to the board, the planning issues will have been fully thrashed out in advance.

This is known as scoping; in other words deciding what the scope of the EIS should be. This Part of the Bill which transposes the directive into primary law for the first time already sets out this requirement on the planning authority. The Bill also states that regulations may be made concerning the making of a scoping request to the board when a planning decision which is subject to an EIA is appealed. However, in occasional cases the first time an EIS is requested can be by the board when it examines an appeal. This amendment makes provision for regulations to be made on the requirements on the board when a developer requests scoping by the board and brings the provisions into alignment with the rest of the section.

      <P>This section concerns environmental impact assessments of local authorities' own developments. Where local authorities intend to carry out a development which is subject to an EIA in its own area, the development must be approved by the board. Development in the local authority's functional area which is not subject to an EIA is, of course, subject to the requirements set out in section 163, that is, Part X, dealing with procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment clarifies that these provisions also apply to projects carried out on behalf of the local authority or in partnership with the local authority pursuant to a contract. This provision mirrors the existing provision in section 163 in relation to a local authority own development and is designed to facilitate development carried <Col N="641" /> out by public-private partnerships with local authorities. The amendment is needed to bring section 159 and 163 into line with each other.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the taking in charge of estates. It is a good section. It puts the onus on estates that are more than seven years old and provides that the council may be obliged by the residents to take them in charge. There has been a reluctance to do this in the past because of the inherent cost of bringing them up to an acceptable standard. It brings us back to enforcement and to ensuring that the development was undertaken in accordance with the proper planning procedures and the specification submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the section, but it is important that when an estate is completed an onus is placed on the developer and his professional agent to certify or, failing that, to pay a fee to the council to have it independently certified that the development has been undertaken in accordance with best building practice and the specifications. The purpose of this would be to ensure that the authority does not ultimately face a contingent liability. The cost of remedying some estates could be significant and authorities should be protected from that. The onus primarily should be on the developer to ensure schemes are <Col N="643" /> built in accordance with proper planning and other conditions.</P>

He is to be especially commended for a radical provision in the section to the effect that the local authority can be requested to act by a majority of the qualified electorate living in an estate, or that there can be a plebiscite There have been frequent calls for plebiscites of this kind at local authority level. As far as I am aware, they have been rejected in almost all circumstances. This is a novel and good approach. It is the essence of what democratic politics should be about.</P>

It is a far-reaching and radical measure and it will be welcomed by residents' associations. Has the Minister considered how to increase the bond on builders with regard to estates? The level of the bond subject to estreatment where an estate is not finished is small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments on this section. I know the issue is of great concern to Members on all sides of the House. On the question of bonds, Senator Walsh's suggestion can be dealt with either through the bonding system or by imposing specific conditions on planning.</P>
      <P>The bonding is entirely a matter for the local authorities. They should try and get it right. They got it badly wrong at the outset, when cash and insurance bonds were being put in place. That was because of inexperience and other reasons. In consequence, many of the older estates are suffering. However, since then, the practice has increased and has become much more scientific.</P>
      <P>There is now a deadline on the local authorities in that after seven years, at the latest, residents can make them take over the estate. That will make them act more carefully and ensure they have adequate bonds. The Department does not become directly involved in this, but it might usefully be taken up at local authority level. I am not sure that a bonding scheme ever becomes public in a local authority. It was certainly never discussed with members in my time as a local authority member. It might be a good idea to discuss it at local authority level to see if members have suggestions for improving it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been discussed to any great degree but the threat of confiscating or restricting the bond has been useful in getting builders to finish estates. In many cases, however, the bond is so small that it does not provide suf<Col N="644" /> ficient pressure to do so. Given the great increase in the value of property at present, there may be a role for guidelines from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Perhaps the bond could be index-linked to reflect increasing property values.</P>

The law in regard to compensation is fairly well settled. I would prefer not to upset what has already been clearly established in case law, otherwise we could do more harm than good regarding compensation. Senators will <Col N="645" /> remember the difficulties over this matter in local authorities. It has been fairly well settled at this stage and the amendment would not help the situation.

      <P>Will the Minister accept this simple amendment? The need for nature conservation is very important, but it is not covered by the terms &ldquo;outstanding natural beauty&rdquo; or &ldquo;special recreational value&rdquo;. Although we may feel that a bog is particularly lovely, other people may not think so. There are specific areas of nature conservation which are most important to maintain. While Senator Norris does mention areas designated under European or national legislation, I hope no one would think of doing anything with any such area. Perhaps the Minister would consider one or other of the two amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My early experience of bogs, which was of turning and keeping turf, did not exactly endear them to me. Over the years, however, I have come to appreciate the outstanding natural beauty of such areas. From the time I spent at the Office of Public Works, when it was in charge of natural heritage, I believe the proper way to protect our natural heritage is in appropriate legislation. A wide range of laws are in place, or are being put in place, which designate special areas of conservation and protection. For example, natural heritage areas are protected by the Wildlife Bill, 1999. It does not serve any useful purpose to restate these in this Bill when there are much better alternative provisions in Acts which deal specifically with these areas. I fear having references and desirable aims like these in separate Bills because at a future stage somebody will be smart enough to use conflicting legislation to evade their obligations and escape the full rigours of the law. With all due respect to these amendments, areas of outstanding natural beauty are better served by legislation that will be enacted specifically for them.</P>

      <P>In section 4 we dealt with a related issue concerning forestry. I do not disagree with the provision in the Bill that one can replant without permission, although the Minister said he would introduce regulations whereby permission will be required. One aspect of replanting needs to be considered, however, and that is that several <Col N="646" /> of the very large plantations planted in the 1960s went right down to lakeshores. I am thinking of Lough Currane near Waterville which is a premier sea trout lake, and several lakes in Connemara. The Minister should do something in the regulations to ensure that when replanting takes place there will be a barrier &ndash; which the Minister can specify &ndash; between the lake and the forest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point and one that I may be able to deal with by way of regulation.

These amendments arise from a major consolidation of local government law both in this Bill and in the proposed local government Bill. They are mainly technical amendments arising out of the reconciliation of the various land acquisition and disposal provisions in the two codes. We want to avoid as much as possible the duplication of provisions, something I mentioned on a number of occasions. <Col N="647" /> The main changes in these amendments provide that the disposal and lease of land provisions apply to all local authorities, not just planning authorities. In addition, the language in section 193(1) is clarified and the provisions of section 194 in relation to the disposal of land are extended to cover land appropriated under any enactment or otherwise acquired by the local authority, not just land appropriated under the planning Acts.</P>

      <P>These amendments are related to the transfer of powers of the Minister in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities and the approval of road schemes and related environmental impact assessments under the Roads Act. Sections 197 and 198 transfer all the Minister's functions in relation to the CPO and approval of roads schemes. Amendments Nos. 329 and 330 clarify the language regarding the transfer and make sure that this transfer of functions does not include the Minister's power to make regulations. Following publication of the Bill a doubt was expressed as to whether section 198 achieved its purpose of transferring all the relevant functions of the Minister under the Roads Act as it currently refers to functions relating to compulsory purchase of land or environmental impact assessment. Amendment No. 330, therefore, rewords the provision to clarify that all functions, save those related to the making of regulations, are transferred. Amendment No. 333 also proposes to clarify that references in relation to regulations to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; would be changed to &ldquo;the board&rdquo; in relation to all the transferred functions under sections 197 and 198 and not just to compulsory purchase of land and environmental impact assessment as is currently stated in the section. For example, this includes the approval of road schemes.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 331 is intended to clarify that sections 199 and 200 do not operate in conflict, which could be an interpretation taken from the present wording. Section 48, which we have already discussed, sets an eight week limit within which judicial review of certain decisions, including decisions by the board on the compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities under Part XIV can be sought. However, the Housing Act, 1966 currently provides that compulsory purchase orders come into force three weeks after the order is made unless a person applies to the High Court to quash the order. The Roads Act provides that a road scheme will come into operation after two months. These timeframes do not correspond with the times set out in this Bill and must be brought into alignment. Amendment No. 331 provides for new dates on which the orders will come into force to correspond with the changes made in this Bill. This amendment provides that where the Board makes a decision on a CPO relating to the Housing and Roads Acts, the order will come into force after eight weeks unless a challenge is brought, in which case it will come into force when determined by the court or after the challenge is dropped, as appropriate. As a consequence of these changes section 55A of the Roads Act, 1993 which was inserted by the Roads (Amendment) Act, 1998 is being repealed by amendment No. 356. However, a transitional <Col N="650" /> arrangement is necessary for any order made by the Minister before the repeal of this provision.

      <P>On Second Stage, I raised the issue of pop concerts and unauthorised events of that nature. This is a matter of considerable controversy in my county where a promoter sought to have a pop concert in Mondello Park. At the time there was confusion within the local authority as to whether or not permission was required. That matter has subsequently been dealt with in the courts. There is also a lack of clarity as to whether a section 4 motion could be moved and successfully upheld. I welcome what is taking place here. In his reply on Second Stage, the Minister said the Bill gave the local authority more power in this area and he was correct in that. This is an improvement on the previous situation. There are still some concerns in the county about this. A legal opinion was secured by the local residents group, which I have furnished to the Minister's officials. I do not intend, nor do we have the time, to go into it in detail. However, I ask the Minister to give detailed consideration to what is in the opinion, with a view to amending the Bill if that is required, either before Report Stage or before the Dáil considers it.</P>
      <P>One of the principal concerns is that the local authority could be catching up in trying to implement the law after the event was over. I realise notices can be served under section 211. There is also concern about whether people selling tickets would be regarded as part of the promoters, whether the performers at the concert would be liable to prosecution and so on.</P>
      <P>The detail is in the document which has been furnished to the Department. Perhaps, the Minister and his officials could give it detailed consideration so that we can allay people's very reasonable fears. I am not opposed to pop concerts. However, it was felt in this case that the infrastructure associated with the venue was not adequate to deal with the number of people who would attend.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if there is provision for the level of consultation that will take place &ndash; this relates more to section 209 than 208 &ndash; with the residents, who do not seem to be mentioned in the section, and the responsible statutory agencies. There is no provision for bringing them all together, perhaps under the umbrella of the local authority, so that everybody will be satisfied with the arrangements for safety, infrastructure and litter and the other genuine fears of local residents, as distinct from just the immediate neighbours. The whole surrounding area will be affected because we are talking here about concerts attended by between 20,000 and 100,000 people. For example, U2 promised to play a free concert in the Phoenix Park, which would have been attended by about 100,000 people. It was eventually cancelled because agreement could not be reached and there were no structures in place to arrange a meeting between the various agencies which could deal with the problems that might arise. I wonder if the regulations are specific enough to ensure consultation, which is imperative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the amendments to which I referred a few minutes ago. The major concern expressed by most people was about the need for the people of the area to be able to make a submission on the event which the authority would have to take into account. It was always my intention to make regulations to ensure people could make submissions. I am happy, therefore, to propose these amendments which will make that absolutely clear.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 334 clarifies that regulations on event licensing may provide for people to make submissions and observations within a specified period. New paragraph (g) will also ensure the planning authority may be enabled to ask for further information in relation to the application before making its decision.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 335 states clearly to what the authority will have regard when making its decision on a planning application. This will include any submissions made to it by third parties, as well as the result of consultation with bodies, such as the Garda, in relation to an application.</P>
      <P>A licence under this section can be granted for a once-off event, such as a concert in a park. They can also be granted for a series of events at a single venue, similar to a number of planning permissions which have been granted at sports grounds and so on. Amendment No. 336 would limit a multiple event licence to one year in duration, even if there were four or five events. Venues hoping to hold a number of outdoor events every year will have to renew their licence. This will allow the authority to review their arrangements for security, limiting inconvenience to local residents and so on, on a regular basis. This will prove to be an effective way of ensuring that these events, and the lead-up to them, are properly policed and looked after by organisers.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 337 seeks to make a small but important change. It provides that if a person gets a licence to hold an outdoor event, he or she will have to comply with all the other necessary regulations and laws, for example, getting the consent of the landowner, a drinks licence and so on. The same wording is used for planning permissions.</P>
      <P>These changes clarify the situation regarding the decisions on applications for events licences and meet the concerns expressed by Members about consultation.</P>

      <P>I have one slight query in regard to what constitutes an &ldquo;event&rdquo;. I know there is a definition at the beginning of the Bill, however, we have had various interpretations by promoters of concerts in Croke Park. An event may be a three day event. Are we talking here about a multiple of performances constituting one event or <Col N="654" /> does each individual performance constitute an event in itself? Where a multiple of events are permitted, promoters are inclined to extend the range for a week or whatever and regard it as a single event. They may then look for other licences at the same time.</P>

That would then, obviously, form part of the local authority's reckoning in relation to the event. It would not be possible for someone to apply for a one day event and continue it for two or three days. They will have to specify very clearly the number of days so the local authority can impose whatever conditions are necessary to safeguard local residents.</P>

      <P>This is a wonderful section if the Minister can get away with it. It is an all-embracing section under which neither the Minister, the local authority nor anyone connected with the local authority has liability, good, bad or indifferent, concerning a failure to comply with any function. Civil proceedings cannot be brought against anyone for contravention of the sections. It seems that natural justice would oblige the Minister to delete this section and that failure to comply with any function conferred on the Minister or a local authority by the sections we have discussed should involve provision for legal liability. This seems to give the wrong message to funfairs and events which take place in that we are attempting to eschew any legal liability on a statutory basis and we are promoting an anti-safety approach to events which, generally, are very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of this amendment is to ensure that neither the Minister, the local authority nor anyone else is an easy target, allowing promoters to shirk their responsibilities, and that if promoters fail to comply with any of the functions under their licence, neither the Minister nor the local authority can be enjoined. The Senator is reading the section incorrectly. The generality gives the local authorities a role in licensing outdoor events but it is up to organisers of such events to ensure that they are run properly. The State should not have to carry the cost where there has been a failure on the part of organisers to do so. The consequences of failure should be met by the organisers. I do not want the State or local authorities to be seen as easy targets and be sued if things go wrong, as there would be no obligation on organisers to ensure safety or to consider matters of public liability. I appreciate the concern expressed by the Senator, but he is misreading the section. I will see if we can make the section clearer, but we are trying to <Col N="656" /> ensure that organisers of events carry the can if they fail to carry out any of the functions or to comply with the licence issued by local authorities.</P>

      <P>I would appreciate clarification of this section. Section 214 states that no legal liability will lie &ldquo;by the failure to comply with any functions conferred by this Part&rdquo;. Functions are conferred on local authorities, but they may not carry out those functions comprehensively. Some damage may occur as a result of that failure. The Minister's intention is that the functions concerned apply to promoters when they obtain a licence. However, this section seems so broad that it also encompasses local authorities which have functions under this Part. The same seems to apply concerning subsection (2) &ndash;&ldquo;by reason only of the contravention of any provision of this Part&rdquo;. We need more specific reference to ringfence local authorities and the Minister.</P>

      <Col N="657" /> Government amendment No. 341:</P>
    <P>In page 182, lines 8 to 13, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)A person who has an interest in land and who intends to make a planning application may, with the agreement of the planning authority concerned (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), enter into consultations with the planning authority in order to discuss any proposed development in relation to the land and the planning authority may give advice to that person regarding the proposed application.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 223 introduced a new requirement on the planning authority to engage in pre-planning consultations with people intending to make planning applications. This will lead to an overall improvement in the standard of applications made and to a reduction in the number of requests for further information or deferment, and in the number of refusals. Some planning authorities are already engaged in this practise, which I welcome. These initiatives are similar to the planning clinics which are intended to assist people with the relatively complex requirements of the planning code. However, during the seminars I held on this Bill some people expressed concern that, under the Bill as drafted, anyone could demand a pre-planning meeting or consultations and that the planning authority would have to respond to that demand. This would be the case even in situations where people had no intention of making a planning application and no way of pursuing an application on the land in question as they did not own it. This could be a large drain on authorities and could clog up the system.</P>
      <P>These amendments provide that, to ask for a consultation, a person has to have sufficient interest in the land, must intend to apply for permission, and the type of interest in the land involved would be the same level of property interest required when making a planning application. Once the person has the necessary interest and the intention to apply, the planning authority cannot unreasonably withhold its agreement to have a pre-planning discussion.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 342 seeks to provide that planning authorities can fulfil their requirement to have a pre-planning consultation by specifying times and places where consultations will take place, that is by holding clinics. If they decide to go this route the times and places must be publicised. Local authorities are moving towards area-based communities and so on, and that would be helpful in that area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this section. The practice in Wexford for a long time has been to involve applicants in prior consultation and it has led to an improvement in the applications, which has assisted the planning process by making it more effective and efficient. I am aware of neighbouring local authorities which are disinclined to engage in similar consultation. However, it is progressive to introduce it across the board.</P>
      <P>I presume that under section 223(4)(b) planning authorities are not precluded from making appointments where they serve notice. In Wexford people must make appointments. A half day is set aside weekly and appointments are processed. If people turn up without an appointment for consultations at the times outlined in the public notice, are they entitled to be heard?</P>
      <P>It is good that provision is being made to deal with abuses that have come to public notice in recent times within the planning process. People will be guilty of an offence if they seek an inducement or obtain any benefit following consultation entered into or any advice given under this section. Is that qualification necessary? If people took an inducement in any other area of the planning process, they would be guilty of an offence.</P>

      <P>The local authority of which I am a member has a long history of pre-planning consultation. However, after applications were made, it also entered into consultations with local residents. Recently it has taken a strong line on this and there is now a cut off point. When an application is made it no longer receives representations from developers or the general public. Will the Minister extend such consultation to include residents' associations when planning applications are made?

If that subsection were included in earlier legislation, perhaps some of those who had to appear at Dublin Castle might not have had to do so. I introduced an amendment to the Kildare county development plan that planning authorities should prepare a small, helpful booklet which would provide general guidelines to people. It will speed up the process considerably because, frequently, in non-controversial cases, people make mistakes in their applications. It would prevent mistakes and make life easier for both the planning authority and the applicant.</P>

      <P>The pre-planning process outlined is welcome. However, the other side of the coin is neglected very often. The applicant seems to have unlimited access to the planning department and is able to ascertain residents' views but residents cannot obtain similar information about the applicant or the applicant is advised to devise a variation of the application which is then transmitted to the residents who might be affected detrimentally or otherwise by it. There is not any provision for consultation with other affected third parties and it is invidious that the only people invited to pre-planning consultations are those making applications. It should be widened and it is also dangerous that very often only one official deals with applicants. Undoubtedly, that is open to abuse. With regard to large developments, it is best to consult more people so that the current widespread perception that the planning authority is secretive and the applicant is the only person in the know is eliminated.</P>

      <P>The provision in section 223(4), which was referred to by Senator Walsh, is in addition to the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act. It is being included here because it is a safeguard for pre-planning. The Senator also asked whether a person must now go to a clinic rather than have the option of meeting planners other than through clinics. Amendment No. 341 provides that local authorities can arrange &ldquo;private&rdquo; meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>The provision does not prevent that but it is meant to give people notice about the consultations in terms of time, venue etc.. They can contact the planning office and receive such information. Senator Doyle asked, with regard to pre-planning consultations and the fact that only applicants are involved in pre-planning consultations, why residents do not have such a <Col N="660" /> right. The purpose of pre-planning is to provide an opportunity for the individual who intends to apply for planning permission to outline what he proposes and find out whether the local authority has requirements outside the norm. Very often as a result of the procedure the individual must adopt a totally different approach to the planning application that he intended originally.</P>

      <P>Yes, there is no merit in having people make their views known and, therefore, having a pre-planning planning procedure in place before an application becomes official. If the applicant wants everybody on board and feels it is necessary to inform residents and so on then he may outline the application and listen to their views. It happens in many cases, and it is wise to do that initially to try to reduce the level of opposition to an application before somebody decides to start a campaign against a planning application. There is not great merit in bringing in residents' groups and others for pre-planning consultations. It has not been part of the process up to now.</P>
      <P>We will recognise it because it will be good for the process and will speed it up in many cases. It will ensure there is an improvement in the quality of submissions made. A number of local authorities were seriously concerned at the standard of applications they were receiving and held full day seminars for architects, engineers, builders &ndash; anyone submitting applications. There was a marked improvement in the standard of applications. The section allowing for pre-planning should streamline the system. The public has rights as regards formal applications before the local authority which should be sufficient. Someone submitting a large planning application which is likely to be controversial would be well advised to engage in consultations with residents beforehand.</P>

      <P>As regards the provision on consultancy, Senator Dardis said a great deal of what is happening would not be happening if this provision had existed previously. The impression is being given that this is the panacea for all ills &ndash; it is not. It will drive it further underground. I am not sure that all the possibilities could be provided for in legislation. We spoke about developers and their ability to find loopholes. The Minister said that perhaps we would be better at it than them. Nevertheless, I cannot see any way of stopping it completely. There are a number of indirect yet legal ways around it whereby a person could get a donation. The public may get the impression that this will put a stop to it &ndash; it will not. However, it is a very good provision and I commend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not suggest that this will stop it. I do not think any legislation in respect <Col N="661" /> of any criminal offence will stop criminal activity. However, it ensures it is an offence, which is the issue. I agree with the Minister and disagree with Senator Costello &ndash; one cannot have consultations on the basis of what might happen. One can have consultations with the people promoting the development but one has to wait before it is put before the authority. In my experience, council officials are quite accessible and talk to groups. There is a proposal before Kildare County Council from a Bord na Móna led consortium to build a 400 KVA gas powered plant. The consortium consulted the local community, displayed the model and explained what it is doing to local representatives. By doing so, it had a considerable headstart instead of doing nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The position articulated by Senator Doyle and me is that the local authority will not consult local residents and will only do so with the applicant, either at a pre-planning or at a later stage. There is no provision in the legislation for wider consultation, which is a lacuna in the present process. This gives rise to rumours and concern about what is going on behind the scenes. People read about tribunals in the newspapers every day and say this is what is giving rise to them. I accept the point that this is not the appropriate place to make provision for it because a development may not go ahead. However, unless there is some provision for wider consultation, not just limited to the applicant, we will not get the best results. Perhaps the Minister will take this on board and find somewhere to include it.</P>

      <P>Elected representatives have the opportunity to raise concerns about planning at area or council meetings. There are specific planning committees, and more recently SPCs, in a number of local authorities. That is what public representatives are there for &ndash; to represent the views of the public. It would not be right and proper to start a discussion on an application with those making submissions, either for or against. Once it officially becomes a planning application, the only contact should be for clarification or to inform someone permission is refused. A local authority should decide a planning application on the grounds of good planning and sustainable development, not necessarily on the views of local residents who increasingly in many places do not want any development. I include myself in that &ndash; one would prefer if everything stayed as it was. There is a distinction between objections on genuine planning and development grounds and people objecting to a development because they do not want to be disturbed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical amendment suggested by the parliamentary draftsman to correct an inaccuracy. Section 243 begins by stating &ldquo;notwithstanding the repeal of any enactment by this Act&rdquo;. However, the codes of practice already drawn up relating to safety etc. at concerts were not based on any statutory authority. That authority is introduced by this Bill. The repeal of the <Col N="663" /> enactments will, therefore, have no effects on these codes and the heading of the section is inaccurate. For that reason, a new subsection will be created by this amendment, to remove the inaccuracy. No other change of wording is involved and there is no change in substance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments relate to the non-mandatory objectives to be included in the development plan. Amendment No. 350 seeks to provide that community centres are one of the types of community facilities necessary for the community and which the planning authority can facilitate through the development plan. While this is probably implicit in the Bill, it may be best to restate it. Members expressed this view during the Second Stage and Committee Stage debates. This will replace the current subparagraph (b) which refers to schools, crèches and other educational facilities. This is now a mandatory objective for the development plan under section 10 and no longer needs to be included here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 351 would add &ldquo;foreshore&rdquo; to the list of places to which the planning authority may preserve existing public rights of way. This is unnecessary because of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;seashore&rdquo; in paragraph 8. The word &ldquo;seashore&rdquo; under section 2 means the same as in the Foreshore Act, 1933, where it is defined as meaning the foreshore in every beach, bank and cliff and all sands and rocks contiguous to the foreshore. Public rights of way to the foreshore, therefore, are already included.</P>

This belongs to the State as opposed to the owner of the adjoining land. This is the distinction between the two.</P>

If there is a public right of way, <Col N="665" /> people should move to establish it formally in the county development plan.

      <P>The repeals under the Sixth Schedule allow two provisions of the existing planning Acts to remain on the Statute Book. The first provision is section 6 of the 1982 Act. This section gave retrospective authorisation to development granted permission by the Minister in contravention of the development plan following a court decision which declared that the then appeals body could not contravene the plan. The second provision in section 4 of the 1993 Act gave retrospective permission to all development carried out by the State following the Mullaghmore case which decided the State had to obtain planning permission. As these provisions had once-off effect, there is no reason to use them again or to contain them in a consolidated Bill. However, we were advised when drafting the Bill to leave the provisions on the Statute Book in case any doubt crept in about the validity of the developments authorised under these provisions. People could be concerned that the repeal of provisions could raise doubts about the continuing application of the provisions sought.</P>
