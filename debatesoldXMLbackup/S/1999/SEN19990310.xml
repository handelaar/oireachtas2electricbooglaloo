      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to keep open the Spa Road in the Phoenix Park for pedestrian use.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make funds available to ensure the immediate restoration and reopening of Nenagh courthouse, Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1, Report and Fifth Stages, item 1a on the Supplementary Order Paper, statements on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, and item 19, motion 32. Contributions of spokespersons on item 1a will not exceed 20 minutes and contributions of other Senators will not exceed 15 minutes. Senators may share time. Item 19, motion 32, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. We are happy to have been able to co-operate with the Leader in changing the Order of Business to facilitate the important legislation which will be introduced tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday a very important education Bill was initiated in the House. While I do not watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, being neither an insomniac nor the other type of person Deputy Rabbitte referred to as being the main viewers of the programme, I am surprised last night's programme did not carry a single item from yesterday's business in the House. The Qualifications (Education <Col N="698" /> and Training) Bill is substantial legislation initiated in this House and bringing about farreaching changes in the structure of third level education. It is of great interest to individuals and bodies around the county. It is regrettable that there was no coverage whatsoever of that item on last evening's &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree the Order of Business. Like Senator Manning, I was very surprised there was no coverage of this most important Bill on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. Indeed, <i>The Irish Times</i> had not space for it either and I regret this very much as it is most important legislation for learners.</P>
      <P>Yesterday a most important report on women's health came before the European Parliament. I congratulate the Irish women members for voting to discuss the report in its entirety. Can that report be discussed in the House at the earliest opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to raise the manner in which RTE covered yesterday's proceedings of the Oireachtas. In fact, what was announced last night was a Dáil report rather than an Oireachtas report. I was extremely disappointed that the Seanad was not covered. The nub of the issue is that the Seanad is covering a huge amount of legalisation which is initiated in the House and there does not seem to be anything like the same consideration given to such business. It is high time RTE examined what was happening in relation to coverage in this context. To leave out an entire day without any coverage or any excuse or explanation is not satisfactory. I ask the Leader to examine the matter and speak to RTE about it.</P>
      <P>Yesterday a very tragic shooting took place in the south inner city of Dublin in which one of the witnesses to a very serious manslaughter was effectively intimidated. Will the Leader speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to again looking at the 1997 criminal justice legislation which passed through the House and which is currently before the Dáil with a view to an amendment being introduced in relation to intimidation? The legislation covers the issue of drugs and it would be appropriate that it be examined in the Dáil, where it has been for the past 12 months, and that it come back to this House where an appropriate amendment could be inserted.</P>
      <P>The second Bacon report on housing seems very comprehensive and raises a number of serious issues. The report points out that 16,000 new houses will have to be built in Dublin and states that landlord-tenant relationships, which is a constitutional issue, will have to be addressed. Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue at which the Minister would attend? Could we also invite Mr. Bacon into the House to make himself available for a question and answer session to assist us in debating the important issue of private and public housing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senators' comments on the absence of coverage on RTE of yesterday's Bill which was initiated in this House. This was important legislation which was difficult to grasp. A lot of time was put into this Bill yet RTE showed very little respect for the debate. This was the straw which broke the camel's back. I discussed this with the Leader as we have spoken about this situation for a long time.</P>
      <P>We should have a full debate on the role of the Seanad in the eyes of the public and the media. I feel slighted by what happened yesterday evening which showed no respect for Senators. We can blow our own trumpets concerning legislation we have passed and spent hours preparing and still get slighted in this fashion. I am affronted by this and it is time to debate the role of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader promised a response when we called for a debate on regionalisation and the application for Objective One status. Will he provide that response particularly in light of EUROSTAT's comments? I am concerned that the 15 counties involved will be horse-traded in the context of discussions on Agenda 2000. Can we have the cards face up on the table?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's call for a debate on the second Bacon report. We need to ensure that more serviced land is zoned for housing by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to register a slight protest at the change to the Order of Business. I understood the House was to sit this morning. However, the Order of Business was changed at the last moment and we did not meet at 10.30 a.m. as we were told. I only discovered this as I was leaving my house this morning. That is a pity and it is down to bad management.</P>
      <P>I was sorry that the important debates in the House yesterday were not covered extensively in the media. This is astonishing and RTE should call the programme &ldquo;Dáil Report&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. There are two Houses of the Oireachtas. Senator Quinn will comment on the fact that there may have been coverage in some editions of newspapers. However, I saw no coverage in my copy of this morning's newspaper.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the serious issue of the shooting which took place in the south inner city. I stated the possibility that there might be some paramilitary involvement in this incident and that this might represent a breach of the ceasefire. Paramilitaries are trying to have it every way &ndash; to hold on to their guns and to intimidate witnesses. The guns are not silent, even in the South.</P>
      <P>In today's <i>Irish Times,</i> security correspondent Jim Cusack states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local Garda sources say there has been considerable involvement in the &ldquo;anti-drug&rdquo; movement in the south inner city in recent years, with particularly high-profile activity by republicans in the past year. They say intimidating and attacking suspected drug dealers is part of <Col N="700" /> a campaign to increase support for the IRA's political wing, Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>This is a most worrying thought. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should make a statement in the House on this serious matter.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Architectural Heritage Bill, I referred to the destruction of Turvey House. There was a report this morning that the file on the overnight demolition of this unique 16th century house is being withheld from the public by the Fingal County Manager. I am glad it has been released to councillors, but what does it say about freedom of information? Will we never get to the bottom of the continuing series of scandals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I again ask the Leader to arrange a debate on children. Additional funds are required for research into the health of children, still births and areas in the country where there are clusters of births of children with certain disabilities. This matter should be examined.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is present for that debate, perhaps the House could also discuss the regulations which are being implemented under the Childcare Act in relation to crèches. If crèches are not in a position to adhere to the regulations because of space or planning restrictions, it is vital that the regulations are re-examined and amended if necessary. There will be a serious crisis if crèches throughout the country continue to close down and parents are unable to find places for children in reputable child care operations. Perhaps the debate could also encompass the issue of adoption and particularly foreign adoptions. New legislation is due to be introduced in this area. I look forward to a debate in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the second Bacon report. While everybody agrees extra houses are needed, it is crazy to consider building more houses in Dublin without the availability of permanent sewerage facilities. Consideration should be given to building houses in towns which are in dire need of people to live in them. The number of children in schools in certain rural areas is dropping dramatically. A full debate on what is happening in this area is required and I ask the Leader to arrange it urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to re-examine Part M of the building regulations and to amend the wording to ensure compliance? The underlying philosophy of Part M is that where it is reasonable and practicable, all buildings should be accessible to people with disabilities. There is little adherence to this philosophy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>People who read newspapers on this side of the city obviously did not notice the coverage of the debate yesterday in the newspaper I read early this morning. Senator Kett and Senator Norris were mentioned. I am not making excuses but perhaps people on the north side get more sophisticated newspapers than people on the other side of the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ormonde said, this House does not get the coverage it deserves. However, sometimes we do not deserve coverage because when Bills are initiated in the Seanad, I am not sure that the full force of the House is brought to bear on them in terms of the input to debates. I was disappointed by the number who attended yesterday. Three Independent Senators spoke, but I was disappointed there was not more of an input from others.</P>
      <P>The impending trade war between the United States and Europe is one which concerns us, yet we have not had a debate on it. I am not sure a debate is the correct forum, and perhaps an alternative can be found. It is called the banana trade war, but it seems it will have huge implications for every business in Ireland involved in exports. I thought the debate on the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill would have given us an opportunity, but that has been postponed for some weeks. I am not of the same opinion as Senator Norris who said it is bad management to change things at the last moment. I accept the need to change the Order of Business to debate the British-Irish Agreement Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Costello's and Tom Hayes's remarks about the Bacon report. What Senator Hayes said is correct. However, it is a question of whether we will solve this matter immediately or spend a great deal of time debating it. There is a huge housing crisis. Let us stop talking and try to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the move of Senator Coghlan from the subject of Pretty Polly to Objective One status. We will probably hear about the second matter for the next three months now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Minister of State at the Department and the Government on their recent welcome initiative in the housing crisis. There is an aspect to it which the Leader might consider for debate in that there is a serious problem in local authorities with <Col N="702" /> planning. While the Minister has addressed the housing issue, he also needs to address planning. The collective thoughts of Members from their involvement with local authority members would be a welcome contribution to that debate. Perhaps the Leader would afford a half day's debate in which we could outline the difficulties in planning experienced by local authorities. Many of the issues and problems apparent at present result from copybook planners deciding what is in the best interests of the people rather than what is practical. Perhaps the Leader could couple the debate on the housing crisis with what I consider a planning crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's call for a debate on the European Parliament report on women's health in the European Union and urge that it take place soon.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to debate the EU landfill directive, especially in the context of a growing crisis in landfill and what the Minister proposes to do about it?</P>
      <P>Regarding RTE's coverage of the Houses of the Oireachtas, will the Leader inform us what progress, if any, has been made regarding the calls by Senators some months ago, myself included, to allow for more flexible and televisually pleasing coverage of the House in terms of the use of cameras?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a debate on the Bacon report commissioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. It should also be linked to a debate on transport and infrastructure. If we are going to debate housing and its location, we cannot do so in isolation. We must be aware of all the difficulties which face us. Others have made suggestions in that regard.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the women's health report which was placed before the European Parliament. That would be a valuable debate, particularly as yesterday was International Women's Day and we did not have an opportunity to mark it. It would be a fitting tribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the forthcoming report to be published on Aer Rianta and the Great Southern Hotels group. It has been raised previously by Senator Coogan. I am particularly interested in that report because the Shannon issue will emerge again, and this ties in with Senator Coghlan's call for a debate on regionalisation and what has been said about housing. In the light of bilateral agreements and the search for a strategic partner, it is essential that we would have the opportunity to debate the report.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Henry and Senator O'Meara in seeking a debate on the women's health report which was discussed in Europe yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="703" />
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I support Senator Norris's justifiable outrage at the shooting of a potential witness yesterday, which seems to be part of a trend on which the Government must act because we cannot have witness intimidation in a free society, it allows me to ask the Leader to convey an equal sense of outrage about the daily bomb attacks on Catholic families north of the Border which do not seem to be reported to any great extent other than in <i>The Irish Times.</i> The reason I raise this is that the House needs to constantly and repeatedly address this matter. We are supposed to be in a time of ceasefire and we are supposed to be good citizens. We are supposed to support both sides in the North in relation to the realisation of objectives which will ensure peace for all. There are daily attacks on vulnerable Catholic families for no other reason but that they are Catholics. Some of the stories one hears from north of the Border are heart-rending. I wanted to make the point and I hope the Leader will convey the sense of outrage which exists about this. Perhaps there might be an opportunity to address this matter in the context of tomorrow or Friday's debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate with the Minister on the implementation of the Waste Management Act, 1996. Considerable enabling powers were given to the Minister and local authorities in that Act to regulate waste management. Many of those, particularly those allowing local authorities to regulate private refuse collection services, have not been brought into effect. This is causing great difficulty for local authorities who must deal with the issue. I would appreciate an early debate on that.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the questions of housing, infrastructure and transport. No matter what happens as a result of the Bacon report, we will still have a situation where the average house price is such that a family would need at least an income of £35,000 to contemplate buying a house. There is a need to address the needs of those below that income bracket and those in the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>I also support the call by Senator Finneran for a debate on the planning laws. The Labour group produced a Bill last autumn 12 months which the Minister did not support because his own legislation was due to be introduced last year. In the absence of that legislation it would be useful to have such a debate.</P>
      <P>I support the calls last week and this week for a debate on the Government's regionalisation proposals. They seem to be debated in the media every day of the week without any opportunity for us to debate them. As a matter of correction, I was disappointed in RTE's coverage last night and this morning to hear it refer to any regional authority as a semi-official body. My understanding is that they are fully official under the 1991 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to discuss housing needs and the planning laws, particularly the planning laws in rural areas. County development plans have been produced and accepted by most county councils. Planning regulations for local people who wish to build in rural areas are now so restrictive that young people are unable to build houses on their chosen site. This is a sad development. Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House for a debate on planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in raising the issue of regionalisation and the dearth of information on the matter given to Members of the House. This morning, in the course of a discussion on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; radio programme about the Government's 13 or 15 county submission to the EU regarding Objective One status, I heard that certain areas in each region are to designated for special growth. For example, Sligo is to be designated as a university town and there are proposals to expand Athlone. This is laudable, but the information should be in the hands of Members of this House. I understand that these reports have been circulated to members of the regional authorities but, to my knowledge, not to Members of the Oireachtas. This is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>I have raised the question of the wildlife Bill twice or three times but I do not see it in the schedule of Bills to come before the House before the Easter recess. Can the Leader tell the House when it is proposed to introduce this legislation? Ideally, it should be initiated in this House and I advise that that be done.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, issued new directives relating to turf extraction and cutting on bogs which are controversial in my part of the country. Notwithstanding EU regulations on habitat, I cannot understand how any Minister could issue such regulations without having wildlife legislation passed by the Oireachtas. For that reason, I ask when will the wildlife Bill be introduced? Is it not beyond the Minister's power to issue such regulations when we have not passed a wildlife Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the efforts being made by the Government to address the housing crisis, I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on planning and I agree with Senator O'Brien's comments regarding planning in rural areas. Tomorrow we will debate Northern Ireland. In County Donegal many people believe that it is easier for someone from Northern Ireland to get planning permission than for a local applicant. I support the call for a debate on planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to Item 19, motion No. 17 regarding microwave emissions from masts. In Leitrim County Council and in other local authorities, planning permission for masts has recently <Col N="705" /> become a major item. Will the Leader arrange for the House to debate the question of microwave transmitters?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the issue of landfill dumps? Most Members of the House are members of local authorities and every local authority member realises that dumps are filling at an alarming rate. A local dump was a major issue in the recent by-election in Dublin North. I call for this debate because most of the material being dumped in landfill sites is recyclable. Perhaps we could propose the drawing up of legislation which would compel local authorities to provide recycling facilities. Some local authorities have bottle banks, etc., but that is only the tip of the iceberg &ndash; far more could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to something quite peculiar. This House passed the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill on 13 May 1998. It was supposed to be the Government's response to the drugs crisis but it is still on the Dáil Order Paper &ndash; as are four other items of legislation which were passed by this House &ndash; and we do not know when it will be enacted.</P>
      <P>The Leader might pass on some of his organisational skills to the Members of the other House and explain how to get legislation passed, particularly legislation that was a flagship item. The Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Bill has been on our Order Paper for some weeks, awaiting the Government's response to a series of amendments tabled by the Labour Party. Is the problem, as I suspect, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is too busy making an impression to deal with his primary legislative function?</P>

      <P>Can we stop pretending that the Bacon report has anything to do with the housing crisis? It is to do with the housing market. The real housing crisis concerns the people outside the market who cannot afford housing &ndash; that is called housing need. One of the ideological errors in which this State is now tied up is to believe that the market can meet those needs. They will never be met by the market. I invite the Members opposite to point out to the Minister for Finance that he had a £1 billion surplus, which he could have used to build houses for people who will never, under any circumstances, be able to afford a house.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Ormonde, Norris and Quinn voiced their disgust and distaste at the way this House was treated yesterday by RTE. I have been in touch with the office of the director general of RTE and I am awaiting a call from him tomorrow morning. I hope to summon the Leaders of the House to a meeting with myself <Col N="707" /> and the director general at the earliest opportunity to discuss this matter. I will be in touch with the Government Dáil Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, after the Order of Business to see if we can have an urgent meeting with the broadcasting committee to discuss the broadcasting of the Seanad. The legislation initiated in the House deserved recognition and the people want to know what legislation is being amended or introduced. I do not know who was responsible but I will find out and report back to the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senators Henry, O'Meara and Keogh called for a debate on yesterday's European announcement on women's health, I have no problem with that. Yesterday was International Women's Day.

      <P>I agree and I will have time left aside for it. Senators Costello, Coghlan, Hayes, Quinn, Finneran, Keogh, Gallagher, O'Brien, Bonner and Ryan called for a debate on the new Bacon report published yesterday. I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Taoiseach for bringing forward proposals for our consideration. I will leave aside a half day for this discussion. I look forward to worthwhile contributions from all Senators who are very anxious to have this debate. I will allow as much time as necessary for them to make their contributions.</P>
      <P>Senator Bonner called for a debate on masts; we can have a debate on that. Senator Glynn called for a debate on landfill sites and asked that time be left aside for that. Senator Ryan called for the other House to pass the legislation initiated in the Seanad. As the Senator knows &ndash; he has been here a long time &ndash; it is the business of the Government Chief Whip in the other House to process that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take exception the Senator's comment regarding the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In the past 12 months this Government brought before both Houses 52 Bills, more than double what his party brought through the previous year when in Government. Of those 52 Bills, 17 were from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been the hardest working Minister in the past 12 months for the amount of legislation he has introduced to address the promise he made in his programme for Government regarding zero tolerance he should be congratulated and commended. I stand four square behind him, and I am sure all fair minded Senators would agree. As I have often said, after the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, <Col N="708" /> Equality and Law Reform has had the busiest 12 months.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox called for a debate on children, adoption, child care and crèches. As I stated yesterday, I can have time left aside for this. Senator Kett called for a debate on Part M of the building regulations; time can be left aside for this. Senators Quinn and Ryan called for a debate on the impending trade war between the EU and the US and I will certainly leave time aside for this. Senators called for a debate on Aer Rianta and the Great Southern Hotel group. I will have time left aside for that. Senator Mooney called for a debate on the difficulties being experiences by both Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland. Time can be left aside for this. He pointed to the Catholic community in his remarks. The situation there is regrettable and the quicker it is resolved the better chance communities in Northern Ireland will have to enjoy the peace we all wish for and the ceasefire we hope will continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher called for a debate on the Waste Management Act, 1996; I have no difficulty with this. Senator Connor inquired when the Wildlife Bill will come before the House. I will inform him tomorrow morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 22, after &ldquo;archaeological,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;cultural,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It would not be profitable to rehearse previous arguments on this issue. I know the Minister is sympathetic to our general concerns and we made a fairly comprehensive case on Committee Stage. The Minister said she would consider the matter. However, following my accusations of inflexibility, she graciously agreed to another amendment. I hope she will find it possible to accept the addition of the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Events have reinforced our case, because since the last debate on the issue, the partial demolition of The Mullingar House has taken place. This is the fantasy location of Joyce's last and greatest novel, <i>Finnegan's Wake,</i> and the interior of the house has been completely gutted. It is not an <Col N="709" /> architecturally distinguished house and had no great historical connection. Its only real claim to be retained was that it occupied a central role in the imagination of James Joyce, who hardly knew the place, but where he chose to locate this extraordinary dream in which a drunken publican dreams the entire cultural, political, religious and sexual history of the world in a new language which Joyce invented out of 50 languages.</P>
    <P>This is an important location imaginatively, not historically or architecturally, and there is an interest in this otherwise undistinguished building throughout the world. It is important that buildings such as this are retained. The local community feels strongly about this issue. During a previous discussion I cited other instances, some with Joycean connections. I referred to Millbourne Avenue where another undistinguished house of no historical significance was located, except for the place it occupied in the imagination of James Joyce.</P>
    <P>I have been lobbied on this amendment by a number of leading groups in the area of architectural conservation such as the Georgian Society, An Taisce and the architectural faculties of universities. We should listen to these people, unless there is a cogent argument against doing so. The Minister said she did not think the amendment necessary. I am not of her view on this matter, but it is a possible view for one to take. While the amendment may not be necessary, it will do no damage and will satisfy the concerns of people like me and groups such as the Georgian Society, the architectural faculties of universities and An Taisce. It will make us feel that we are serious about entering into and sealing off that grey area in which damage may be done to part of our cultural life, simply because it falls between stools. It may be that the Minister's view is correct. Even if that were the case the addition of the word is not going to cause any damage and, if my view is correct, it will strengthen this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister graciously and willingly accepted an amendment on the last day on another important but not quite as important a matter. My friend and colleague Senator Henry challenged me when I said it was less important than this one. My reasons for saying that was that the amendment merely underlined things. It specified some of the functions to make it clear that we were including planning and development. Most people would assume these central functions would be outlined but it is no harm to spell it out. I am confident the authorities would have acted in the light that this was the intention. The amendment is reasonably clear yet we are trying to copperfasten it because there is a substantial grey area in the legislation. These anomalous buildings which do not have intrinsic merit but acquire it because they occupy a place in the imagination of a great writer should also be protected.</P>
    <P>Frescati House is an example of a building which might fall within the grey area. I remember it as a long, low, rambling villa, dating back to <Col N="710" /> the late 18th century, situated beside the sea at Blackrock. It was not first class architecturally but it had historical significance due to the sporadic visits of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Can the Minister include the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; because it would not do any damage and might help save some of the properties that fall into this grey area? </P>

      <P>Senator Norris did not do justice to what we said on Committee Stage when he said we covered this area fairly comprehensively. I thought we covered it very comprehensively. However, he has explained our concern once again which may seem ephemeral to some but is of great significance, particularly in a literary context. With regard to the amendment the Minister accepted &ndash; which Senator Norris did not consider so important but I did &ndash; about planning and development, I pointed out that this so frequently means knocking down premises. I also pointed out that my own abode achieved higher status in the city's listings because other examples had been knocked down. It is depressing to find that you are only being upgraded because there are so few examples of such architecture left in the city. Therefore, we are not being over fussy in asking the Minister to include the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; in this amendment.</P>
      <P>I remember the Frescati House in Blackrock very well. It was a beautiful house. Its connection with Lord Edward Fitzgerald should have saved it because every school child knew the story of his hiding out in Blackrock. It is important that we take these situations into account and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

Williams supermarket in Blackrock during my teenage years &ndash; I worked as a merchandiser for Laird's of Drumshanbo, which made Bo Peep jam &ndash; and I travelled there on a regular basis. I was aware of Frascati House, followed its progress and recall the controversy about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I bow to your ruling. I raised this issue because it was relevant. There has been a problem in Carrick-on-Shannon over the past number of years relating to the courthouse, which was declared an unsafe building by the Office of Public Works in 1994. This resulted in not only the council members and staff having to vacate the council chamber, which had been located there since 1899, but also the District Court.</P>
      <P>There was a big controversy surrounding the future of the courthouse. I am glad it is still there and that public money has been expended in recent years by the Department to ensure that the building has at least been made safe and I commend the Minister for that. The roof, which was in danger of collapsing, has been reinforced through allocations from her Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>The planning officer at the time, who is now retired, was not committed to the idea of the building being saved. He said it had absolutely no aesthetic or architectural merit. We, as the elected council members, argued that because the building had been there since 1810 and had replaced the previous one, it was very much bound up in the history of our county town and the wider history of the county and it would be an abomination if there were any suggestion that it be bulldozed and knocked. At that stage we were in the middle of a debate about the provision of a new civic office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Common sense prevailed and the building is still there. The civic office is being built on an alternative site, close to the old county jail, and there are plans afoot to enhance the courthouse building, of which the Minister will be aware because money is being sought from her. I raise this point in the same context as Frascati House <Col N="712" /> because I hope that the Minister will give us the necessary reassurances.</P>
    <P>Looking at comparative legislation in other countries, especially the United States, this Bill stands on its merits. It is commendable. I ask for reassurances, if they are needed &ndash; and the Minister is the best judge of that &ndash; that the examples which have been mentioned will be encompassed in the Bill. That would obviate the need for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's objective is to make this legislation worthy and to make sure that it will be improved by the work we put into it. That is why we challenge, question and query. We will not have another opportunity to do so in the near future as it is not often that a Bill such as this is introduced. The case made by Senators Henry, Mooney and Norris seems to be worthy of consideration. It may well be that the Minister has a definite reason to say that she cannot do this. If so, we will listen to her carefully. I urge the Minister to support the thinking behind the amendment because it is unlikely we will get another opportunity to address this. If we lose this opportunity, we will not be able to protect those cultural assets, monuments and buildings which are not included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment for the reasons outlined by Senators Norris and Henry. I was particularly struck by the relevance of their comments on Committee Stage when I read the weekend newspaper reports with regard to The Mullingar House. Definitions are important because at some stage something which should not happen will happen, something we do not like and something which may end up being challenged legally or otherwise. We do not want to be in a position where we will have to admit at some point in the future that if only we had included the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; we would have afforded protection to many buildings which were worthy of protection but which, for one reason or another, have now been lost. For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment. As Senator Norris pointed out, if he is wrong the amendment will not detract from the Bill but, if he is right, it will afford a substantial measure of additional protection to very important buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that everyone has a particular objective with regard to this section of the Bill. At risk of being a spoilsport, I have difficulty not just with the amendment but with the wording of the section as it stands. I believe there is one word too many included <Col N="713" /> already, namely the word &ldquo;social&rdquo;. I have no problem with the terms architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific and technical. However, I do not understand the intended meaning of the word &ldquo;social&rdquo;. Does it mean &ldquo;social&rdquo; in a Dublin 4 sense or does it refer to places where high standards of cuisine and conversation are in evidence? </P>
      <P>I have far greater difficulty with the word &lsquo;cultural'. Who is to define what the word means? Senator Norris cited the example of The Mullingar House, a pretty grotty pub which achieves its cultural importance not because of its intrinsic value but because James Joyce wrote about it in an extraordinary way. Where do we draw the line? I want to cite the example of one of my own local pubs, a number of which I share with Senator Henry. There is a pub located on the corner of Baggot Street which has changed names many times over the past 20 years. The poet Patrick Kavanagh frequently drank in this particular pub and was even more frequently barred from it. A particularly kind lady ran the pub and Patrick Kavanagh would invariably seek to re-enter the premises after a certain period of time. As he was approaching the pub from Waterloo Road he would hop into someone's garden and steal, borrow or purloin a few roses which were usually covered in greenfly. He would then write a verse of apology or evocation, wrap the roses in it and offer the flowers to the landlady. She would put the roses into a jar and throw away the verse. Had she kept the verses and thrown away the roses, the University of Texas would probably have paid her or her relatives handsomely for them. Can this pub be considered to have a cultural value because Patrick Kavanagh drank there, wrote an occasional poem there, was barred from it, re-entered it and so on? All the other words &ndash; with the exception of &ldquo;social&rdquo;&ndash; outlined in this section are precise but one person's definition of cultural value could leave someone else cold. We want to prevent barbarism and vandalism etc. but I cannot see any great merit in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things which strikes me from all the debates we have had on this issue to date is the near unanimity of the views expressed. I always find Senator Norris's arguments particularly persuasive. That arises to a large degree from the great work he has done with regard to conservation when it was not a particularly popular pursuit. We admire him for that.</P>
      <P>In normal circumstances, I would be in favour of the inclusion of the word 'cultural' if only to afford protection. However, if one considers the issue from a legal point of view, the inclusion of too many words might serve to create further confusion. The Minister will outline her own views on this matter shortly. It is difficult to strike a balance in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat saddened by the lack of publicity which sometimes attends a subject such as <Col N="714" /> this. When the legislation is in place, we will still depend to a large degree on local authorities and communities. A process of education is required in this respect although there is no doubt that there is immense goodwill.</P>
    <P>I recognise the reason for including the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in the legislation. An example was cited to me which I could not necessarily categorise as of either historical or archaeological value. However, it had a definite social significance &ndash; I refer to the bothán scór. When the little cabin in Cashel, once occupied by labourers who paid the rent with their labour, was restored by the local heritage society and opened to the public, huge numbers of people went to see it. They did not go specifically to see the building, rather they went because of the social background to the bothán. They identified with the deprivation which people suffered and the unique nature of paying the rent. People were also aware of the number of children who lived in the particularly small two room building. I welcome the inclusion of the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; to cover buildings such as the bothán scór. The local community in Cashel demonstrated considerable interest in the bothán scór.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am looking one step beyond the enactment of the legislation but I hope that the Department of Education and Science and the other Departments involved will make an effort to inculcate a curiosity and respect in young people in regard to their local heritage. I would like all local agencies &ndash; schools, local authorities and organisations &ndash; to endeavour to create a process of awareness with regard to local heritage. Over the past 30 or 40 years as I have travelled throughout Ireland, I have seen many fine buildings without roofs on them. The roofs were removed to avoid the necessity to pay rates on the buildings. There was no marriage between legislation on rates and the need to conserve or preserve our architectural heritage. We have come a long way since then and I hope this legislation will be relevant for everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on record my thanks to all Senators who have taken part in this debate. The debate gave very valuable insights and assisted me greatly in further considering the amendments. It is obvious from the debate and from contributions on all sides that people are not only interested and committed to heritage but that these views and ideas are held passionately. This gives us great reason to hope for the future, not just in terms of legislation but perhaps more importantly in terms of people's hearts. I thank the Senators for contributing today and on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>To put Senator Quinn's mind at rest I gave this matter tremendous consideration before coming to the House for Second Stage and in light of the amendments tabled today. It is not, therefore, a quick reaction on my part, but something which is well thought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> I feel I should also refer to Frascati House as I had the opportunity many years ago of horse riding in the grounds every Sunday morning. I, too, have an interest in that property and its history.</P>
    <P>I think all Senators accept that I am particularly interested in ensuring that the legislation is all inclusive and all encompassing. I have no intention of leaving out any terminology which I think would be of further assistance to or would strengthen the Bill. On giving the amendment every consideration, I am afraid I do not feel it would be right to accept it at the moment. We are referring in particular to the Granada Convention which, as I said on Second Stage, includes a very wide and internationally recognised definition in terms of what we wish to achieve through the protection of our architectural heritage. Not only are we covering all the likely scenarios raised in the debate under that convention, but we must also remember the sister legislation in this regard, namely, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998. The definition in that Bill is the same as that proposed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns raised, but the words used to describe cultural in, for example, Chambers dictionary, are artistic and intellectual or pertaining to artistic and intellectual matters. These are terms referred to under the terms &ldquo;historical&rdquo; and &ldquo;literary&rdquo;&ndash; these issues were addressed in the debate on Second Stage which I do not wish to regurgitate. The concerns expressed are incorporated in the Granada Convention and Senators need not express fears in the manner in which they did as the Bill will include the definitions and protection they wish to see afforded our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the fact that adding the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; may be somewhat excessive as he already believes there is at least one word too many in the definition. He specifically referred to the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; and suggested that it need not be included. If it is to be included he asked what the definition or meaning of &ldquo;social&rdquo; was in this context. Senator Ó Murchú gave very good examples on Second Stage and again today when he spoke about the bothán scór as one very important example of something included under the word &ldquo;social&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that I have given this a tremendous amount of thought. I am satisfied that under the definition in the Granada Convention all these matters are incorporated in the definitions included in the Bill. I hope Senators Norris and Henry will understand why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept the <i>force majeure</i> of the Government majority. I greatly enjoyed Senator Manning's contribution. I remember those days of Patrick Kavanagh, although I did not really know him. Amusing and whimsical as it was, nobody would seriously suggest that every pub in which Paddy Kavanagh or Brendan Behan <Col N="716" /> drank should be regarded as a cultural monument. The difference in the context of The Mullingar House is that it occupied a central position in the imagination of our greatest writer.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have missed Senator Manning's description of Paddy Kavanagh, his drinking habits and his wonderful technique. I agree that the woman proprietor of the pub made a great mistake in keeping the roses and throwing the poetry away. Perhaps she did not understand the value and meaning of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo;. Otherwise she would have kept the poem. I am afraid we may be holding onto the roses and throwing out another poem if we are not very careful.</P>
      <P>I accept there is a logic to what Senator Manning said, although there would be more logic if it was intended that simply by being mentioned every building would have to be retained. We are talking about an inventory of buildings, and I would like The Mullingar House, for example, to be reviewed to see what proper changes and amendments should be made and conditions applied, etc. As far as I can make out they went in and walloped the entire place, carefully keeping the facade so people would not notice as they went by on the bus. That worries me as it is possible that things of intrinsic interest in a Joycean sense were lost. I am not convinced that this matter is completely covered in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would not worry about the Granada Convention. Of course it is an important international instrument, but I do not think we should adopt the position that the intellectual exchange is all one way and that we must simply bow our heads towards the convention and think we could never improve on it. That smacks a little of the natural conservatism of legal advisers who always tend to say &ldquo;no, we do not want to take this extra step&rdquo;. It also smacks of a practice which I am glad to say is dying out but which was a strong element in Irish legislative proceedings and which involved looking for the nearest, usually British, precedent, copying it word for word and thinking we could not improve on it. The attitude was that if something was all right for the mother of all parliaments in Westminster, who were we to challenge it. In a way we still have that slightly subservient attitude in talking about the Granada Convention. It is not the Lord's Prayer or the Ten Commandments but the Granada Convention which was put together by many different countries. For that reason it may represent the lowest common denominator. There is no reason why we should not be able to improve upon it.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that Senator Manning felt there were too many words in the definition. Therefore, his agreement with the position adopted by the Minister is qualified. He thinks she was wrong to include the word &ldquo;social&rdquo;. Senator Ó Murchú made a very good case for the inclusion of &ldquo;social&rdquo;, indicating another grey area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> I do not intend putting the amendment to a vote because to do so would be fatuous and irritating. With a bit of luck if I sit down we might pass this Bill by 4 o'clock and move onto the next item, which would be in everybody's interest. I am sorry the Minister has not been more flexible. Perhaps there is a chink in her thinking on the matter. I imagine the same groups who briefed me will brief Members of the other House. Perhaps the Minister may be induced to examine the matter again following arguments put, I am sure not more passionately or cogently, but in a more skilful political manner in the other House. I hope this will be the case as I think we ought to include the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;. I do not have the reservations of others. There is a grey area but I accept that the Minister is unfortunately not going to accept the amendment.</P>

The implementation of most of the legislation dealing with this issue will be a matter for local authorities under the other Bill.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Seanad as ucht an deis labhairt leis an Teach tráthnóna maidir le ceist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta. Is maith an tráth é seo, tráth na Féile Pádraig, don Seanad a bheith ag cur na ceiste seo. Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt dóibh as ucht é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Is féidir linn pobal na tíre a roinnt i gceithre chuid: iad siúd ar cuma leo an Ghaeilge a bheith ann nó as &ndash; cuid bheag den phobal iad seo; an dara dream ná iadsan nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu ach atá báúil lei agus a mbraitheann gur cuid den oidhreacht í; an triú dream ná iadsan a bhfuil tuiscint agus léamh na Gaeilge acu ach gan cumas iontach labhartha acu; agus an ceathrú dream &ndash; is í an Ghaeilge an teanga a úsáideann siad ó lá go lá.</P>
      <P>Creidim go bhfuil bunáite an phobail sna trí dhream deiridh, sé sin, braitheann an pobal trí chéile gur chuid thábhachtach den oidhreacht choiteann í an Ghaeilge. Mar sin ba mhaith le daoine go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar chuid slán de shaol an náisiúin seo.</P>
      <P>Deirtear go bhfuil os cionn milliún duine sa tír seo san aicme sin &ndash; go bhfuil Gaeilge éigin acu, a thuigeann í agus go bhfuil cumas éigin cainte acu iontu. Tá dream ann a úsáideann an Ghaeilge go laethúil agus don chéad uair tá slat tomhais againn maidir leis an uimhir daoine atá i gceist ansin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má dhéantar coigeartú do ghasúir scoile a deir go labhraíonn siad Gaeilge chuile lá ach nach labhraíonn taobh amuigh den seomra ranga í, áir<Col N="719" /> ítear go bhfuil thart idir 115,000 agus 120,000 á labhairt go laethúil mar ghnáth-theanga. Tá suas le leathchéad míle eile a labhraíonn go seachtainiúil nó go míosúil í agus má chuirtear i dtéarmaí páirceanna peile é, tá lán Pháirc an Chrócaigh agus Bóthar Lansdún de dhaoine ann a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge go laethúil mar ghnáth-theanga.</P>
    <P>Don chéad uair faoi cheann cúig bliana beimid in ann a thriail cén méadú atá tagtha ar an líon sin daoine agus creidim gur méadú a bheas ann agus feicfimid freisin cén chaoi a bhfuil polasaí an Rialtais ag dul i bhfeidhm ar cheist na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>De bharr an duairceas a bhíonn ar dhaoine i leith na Gaeilge go minic, iad siúd atá ar a son agus iad siúd atá ina haghaidh, ba mhaith liom a rá anseo nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge i mbaol a básaithe. Is teanga bheo í ar féidir a úsáid i ngach réimse den saol idir theicneolaíocht nuachumarsáide agus na réimsí sin den saol a bhfuil daoine á húsáid lena n-aghaidh ar feadh na mílte bliain.</P>
    <P>Nil aon amhras orm ach go mairfidh an Ghaeilge agus go dtiocfaidh méadú ar an líon daoine a labhraíonn go rialta í.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na seoda náisiúnta is luachmhaire atá againn is ea í. Is díol spéise an méid spéise atá á léiriú inti ag ollscoileanna ar fud na cruinne ó tharla gurb í an teanga scríofa is sine san Eoraip atá fós á labhairt ag pobal daoine.</P>
    <P>Ócáid í seo a thugann deis dom cur síos ar a bhfuil ar bun i mo Roinnse ar son na Gaeilge ó ceapadh mar Aire Stáit mé, obair chun an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ní bhaineann an chéad ghné eile leis an nGaeilge ach baineann sé leis an nGaeltacht agus b'fhéidir go dtaispeánann sé an bealach chun dul chun cinn. Ba é an chéad chinneadh a rinneadh beagnach nuair a tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht ná Rannóg na n-Oileán a aistriú ó Roinn an Taoisigh isteach go dtí an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta agus Oileán. Bhí tionchar nach beag aige sin ar an gcaoi a rabhthas ag déileáil leis na trí cheathrú de phobal na n-oileán atá ina gconaí ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta. Go dtí sin bhí Roinn an Taoisigh ag plé leo trí Bhéarla. Go tobann bhí Roinn Stáit le hairgead ag plé le pobal na n-oileán trí Ghaeilge. Ar go leor bealaí eile, ó tharla go raibh cúram na Gaeltachta agus na n-oileán Gaeltachta ar an Roinn sin le fada an lá, luígh an socrú sin le réasún freisin.</P>
    <P>Ach is iontach go deo an tionchar atá ag an athrú seo ar an bpobal Gaeltachta. An té a bhfuil an sparán aige, bíonn tionchar aige agus ba trí mheán an sparáin a cuireadh an Béarla chun cinn cuid mhór sa chéad seo caite, Mar sin ní dochar ar bith go gcuirfí an Ghaeilge chun cinn ar an mbealach céanna.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuaigh mé isteach sa Roinn, chuir mé ar ais cuid mhaith de na scéimeanna Gaeltachta a raibh meas ag an bpobal orthu. Is minic a deir daoine liom, cén bhaint atá ag infrastruchtúr leis an nGaeilge. Ar ndóigh an dream atá ag cur seirbhísí ar fáil agus atá ag obair ar mhaithe leis <Col N="720" /> an bpobal de réir mar a fheiceann an pobal féin é, más Roinn Stáit le Gaeilge é, níl amhras ar bith ann go mbíonn tionchar nach beag aige sin ar intinn an phobail agus tagann an pobal leis an gcineál sin tuairimíochta.</P>
    <P>Le rófhada, bhí an Ghaeilge imeallaithe sa nGaeltacht ó lár shaoil agus chúraimí an phobail.</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas curtha agam freisin ar scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus arís, is le meas agus muinín an phobail i dtodhchaí na Gaeilge a thaispeáint a rinneadh é sin. Mar an gcéanna leis an aithbhreithniú atá beagnach críochnaithe ar na coláistí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor cainte le gairid maidir le bás na Gaeltachta. Bhí na daonáirimh go dtí seo bunaithe ar chumas labhartha na Gaeilge. Ó thús an chéid seo caite is é an t-iontas go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ann ar chor ar bith agus cé chomh seasamhach is atá sí ainneoin an brú eacnamaíochta agus an brú cultúrtha le fada an lá.</P>
    <P>Le gairid tá daoine ag moladh réitigh fíorshimplí ar fhadbhanna na Gaeltachta: ag iarraidh léarscáileanna a ath-tharraingt agus ceantair a chaitheamh amach as na Gaeltachtaí. Ach ní dóigh liom go bhfuil na daoine sin ag déanamh staidéar ar an figiúirí mar atá siad. Chuir mise an dua orm féin breathnú ar na figiúirí Gaeltachta agus bhunaigh mé an slat tomhais ar an méid daoine ar fud na tíre a deir go bhfuil siad ag labhairt Gaeilge. An áit ab fhearr ná Tiobrad Árann thuaidh, áit a deir 12 .9 faoin gcéad den phobal go labhraíonn siad an Ghaeilge go laethúil. D'úsáid mé an áit ab fhearr taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht mar shlat tomhais agus bhreathnaigh mé ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta bunaithe ar na ceantair toghcháin. Agus is beag ceantar nach raibh líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge os cionn an fhigiúir sin. I gcuid de na ceantair, go deimhin, ní raibh sé mórán níos airde ná é ach is beag ceantar a bhí chomh híseal nó níos ísle ná an cheantar ab fhearr taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid de na ceantair seo scoite amach &ndash; ceantair ar nós Ríon ó gCuanach a bhfuil 60 faoin gcéad den phobal ag labhairt na Gaeilge i lár an phobail sin; áiteanna eile ar nós Múscraí agus Ráth Cairn; agus áiteanna ar nós Uíbh Ráthach atá faoi ionsaí, agus nach dearnadh cóiríocht cheart le haghaidh scolaíocht iriamh ann. Fós feicimid i lár an cheantair sin go bhfuil 30 faoin gcéad den phobal &ndash; dhá oiread an uimhir is airde taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht &ndash; a deir go labhraíonn siad Gaeilge go laethúil.</P>
    <P>Ainneoin easpa pleanáil cheart teangan sa nGaeltacht, bhí tionchar nach beag ag an aitheantas Gaeltachta ar an nGaeilge a choiméad á labhairt sna ceantair sin. In ionad a bheith á gcaitheamh amach, ní mór dúinn treisiú ar ár n-iarrachtaí teangan agus forbartha sna pobail seo.</P>
    <P>Ní ar an bpobal atá an locht má tá meath ag teacht ar an teanga. Feidhmíonn an pobal de réir brúanna a thagann ón taobh amuigh. Tá cuid mhaith brúnna ag teacht ón Stát féin ainneoin Roinn na Gaeltachta a bheith ann. Tá an Státchóras trí chéile neamhairdeallach ar riachtanais na gcainteoirí Gaeilge. Níl le déanamh agam ach <Col N="721" /> breathnú ar mo cheantar féin áit a ndéantar plé leis an bpobal ag an iliomad seirbhísí Stáit le dream gur fearr i bhfad an Ghaeilge atá acu ná an Béarla, trí Bhéarla. Is léir an tionchar atá aige sin ar an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Tá brúnna ann ó na meáin chumarsáide, tá easpa fostaíochta ann a bheadh bunaithe ar an nGaeilge mar acmhainn ag cur as don nGaeltacht. Tá dianobair ar siúl agam féin agus ag mo Roinn chun pleananna gearrthéarma agus fadtéarma a réiteach le pleanáil eolaíoch teangan a chur ar bun agus freisin leis an teanga Ghaeilge a úsáid mar uirlis forbartha sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag plé le Ranna Stáit eile le bheith cinnte má tá muide ag plé le hábhair sa Ghaeltacht trí Ghaeilge nach mbeidh na Ranna Stáit eile ag brú scéimeanna den chineál céanna trí Bhéarla sa Ghaeltacht. Molaim an Rannóg Spóirt a tháinig ar chomhréiteach le deireadh le mo Roinnse go bhfágfaí cúrsaí spóirt agus caithimh aimsire sa nGaeltacht faoi chúram na Roinne s'againnse seachas faoin Roinn sin ó thaobh deontais chaipitil de.</P>
    <P>Tá socrú den chineál céanna déanta leis an Roinn Fiontair agus Fostaíochta &ndash; is í Roinn an Gaeltachta agus ní na CB a bheith ag plé le pobal na Gaeltachta maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá gach cosúlacht ann gur cuma le cuid de na comhairlí contae stádas Gaeltachta a bheith ag ceantair taobh istigh dá gcontaetha. Agus má leanann cuid de na comhairlí contae leis na polasuithe pleanála atá acu, go mór mór iad siúd a bhfuil Gaeltachtaí acu ar imeall bhailte móra. Is féidir leo an Ghaeltacht sin a scrios nuair nach gcuirtear cúinsí pleanála san áireamh i gcúrsaí pleanála.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag déanamh teagmhála leis na comhairlí contae agus ag cur ar a súilibh dóibh gur orthu a bheas an milleán agus an fhreagracht má chailleann ceantar stádas Gaeltachta de thoradh easpa pleanála.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte gur dearmad nó neamhaird a bhí i gceist sna cásanna sin seachas plean meáite ar thaobh na gcomhairlí agus beidh mé ag súil le gníomh.</P>
    <P>Beidh mé ag leagan amach critéir teangan agus sainmhíniú d'úsáid na teanga sa Ghaeltacht amach anseo. Beidh mé ag rá leis na pobail go bhfuil na spriocanna teanga sin le baint amach agus nach bhfuil bunús go fadtéarmach le ceantair a bheith taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht muna bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt iontu ná mar atá á labhairt taobh amuigh de. Beidh cinntí le déanamh ag na pobail sin a dteastaíonn uathu fanacht taobh istigh den teorainn.</P>
    <P>Beidh mé ag déanamh preasráiteas faoi seo níos déanaí tráthnóna: tá sé i gceist agam coiste comhairleach a bhunú d'óige na Gaeltacht agus is í an aidhm a bheas aige ná comhairle a chur ormsa mar Aire Stáit ag deireadh na Mílaoise seo agus ag tús na Mílaoise nua céard a ba cheart a dhéanamh leis an nGaeltacht a fhorbairt mar Ghaeltacht. I measc na dtéarmaí tagartha a bheas acu beidh riachtanaisí teanga na Gaeltachta le béim faoi leith ar mhúineadh na teanga i measc <Col N="722" /> na n-óg; na meáin chumarsáide agus riachtanaisí daoine óga; riachtanaisí oideachais sa Ghaeltacht; conas daoine óga a spreagadh chun páirt ghníomhach a ghlacadh in imeachtaí pobail; agus na seirbhisí agus deiseanna fostaíochta atá riachtanach le daoine óga a spreagadh le fanacht sa nGaeltacht. Freisin, beifear ag féachaint cad é an bealach is éifeachtaí chun cabhair Stáit a thabhairt d'eagrais Ghaeltachta go mór mór ó thaobh struchtúrú agus airgeadú. Beidh na hógeagraíochtaí san áireamh ach ní bheidh sé dírithe orthu siúd amháin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam mar sin glúin óg de mhuintir na Gaeltachta a thabhairt isteach in obair na Gaeltachta. Ag éirí as moltaí an choiste seo a bheas ag feidhmiú i gcomhairle liomsa beimid in ann aghaidh a thabhairt ar an todhchaí agus fios againn go raibh an dream is tábhachtai ar fad páirteach san obair.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí reachtaíochta, is é an t-aon Bhille a bhí ar na bucáin nuair a tháinig mé isteach mar Aire Stáit ná Bille Tithíochta (Gaeltachta). Ó shin i leith tá trí Bhille nua á réiteach, ceann amháin a bheas faoi bhráid an tSeanaid amárach agus beidh tuilleadh le rá agam faoi ar ball beag.</P>
    <P>Is é an Bille is mó agus is tábhachtaí a thiocfaidh ar aghaidh i gcúrsaí teanga ná Bille na Gaeilge, a thabharfaidh stádas reachtúil don teanga, stádas a bhí i gceist i gcónaí de reír na forála sa Bhunreacht ach nár cuireadh ar fáil go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá Bille nua Údarás na Gaeltachta le teacht go gairid mar aon le Bille Foras Trasteorann atá mar shlánchuid de Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille Teanga, tar éis go bhfuil seasamh bunreachtúil ag an nGaeilge mar an phríomh-theanga agus an chéad teanga oifigiúil, is féidir a rá go fíreannach dá dtiocfadh stróinséar isteach sa tír go mbeadh iontas uirthi nó air gurb amhlaidh atá. Tugann roinnt eagraíochtaí aitheantas di ach is minic nach ndéantar na rudaí is lú agus is simplí ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Ní féidir cur ina luí ar chuid de na heagrais Stáit go bhfuil sé de cheart ag muintir na Gaeltachta rudaí ar nós comharthaíochta dhátheangach a bheith acu.</P>
    <P>Beidh Bille Teangan ann agus beimid ag teacht i dtreo atá coiteann i dtíortha mar an Bhreatain Bheag agus Ceanada agus do leor de thíortha na hEorpa, sé sin, go bhfuil aitheantas oifigiúil agus reachtaíocht dá bharr ag níos mó ná teanga amháin. Go speisialta, caithfear cosaint a thabhairt don teanga is laige de na teangacha sin in aon tír amháin.</P>
    <P>Is eisceacht muide. Táimid gar do Shasana ach faraor géar nach mbreathnaímid go minic ar chás na Breataine Bige. Ní ghlacaimid leis gur féidir le pobail dhátheangacha a bheith ann agus nach fadhb ar bith gach comhartha phoiblí a chur suas sa dá theanga oifigiúil. Is minic nach dtuigeann daoine go mba chóir foirmeacha caighdeánacha a chur ar fáil sa dá theanga. Beidh cumhachtaí sa mBille seo a chinnteoidh go dtarlóidh na rudaí seo agus nach gcaithfidh lucht na Gaeilge a bheith ina gcancaráin ag iarraidh bunseirbhísí agus go <Col N="723" /> mbeidh an rud go léir oibrithe amach ar bhealach meáite réasúnta.</P>
    <P>Ar an dtaobh eile de, beidh an Bille seo réalaíoch. Ní éileoidh sé seirbhís trí Ghaeilge ó chuile státseirbhíseach. Dá bhféadfaí é sin a chur i bhfeidhm ní bheadh aon ghá le Bille Teanga mar chruthódh sé go raibh chuile dhuine dátheangach.</P>
    <P>Beidh pleanáil cheart i gceist anseo agus cuirfear na seirbhísí ar fáil sa chaoi is go mbainfear an leas is fearr is féidir as an nuatheicneolaíocht.</P>
    <P>Má scríobhaim chuig Roinn Stáit ar bith, ba chóir go mbeadh dream ann go lárnach, ar fáil ar ríomhphost, a bheadh in ann litir ar bith a aistriú go Gaeilge don té nach raibh Gaeilge acu agus go bhféadfadh an té a bheas ag freagairt na litreach an freagra a chur ar ais chuig aistritheoir chun go mbeadh leagan Gaeilge ar fáil don comhfhreagraí. Rudaí nach raibh indéanta fiche bliain ó shin, tá siad thar a bheith indéanta anois agus níl móran costais ag baint leo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le fógraí taifeadta ar eitleáin agus ar fóin níl aon chúis nach mbeadh siad dátheangach. Pléifidh mé na gnóthaí seo go mionn uair eile.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh an fhoras trasteorann, tá ríméad orm gur roghnaíodh an Ghaeilge mar cheann de na chéad sé fhoras a bhunófar in éineacht leis an Ultais. Is maith go raibh an Ghaeilge mar dhlúthchuid den Chomhaontú ar Aoine an Chéasta, agus go mbeidh aitheantas ag an nGaeilge nach raibh aici ó Thuaidh go dtí seo agus b'fhéidir nach raibh aici ó Dheas ach aon oiread. Molaim chuile dhuine a bhí páirteach san obair sin.</P>
    <P>Athróidh sé seo saol na Gaeilge faoin dtír. Níor aithin an Ghaeilge riamh aon teorainn agus don chéad uair go hinstitiúideach beimid in ann ag an leibhéal is airde Rialtais ar an dá thaobh den teorainn, ceist na Gaeilge a tharraingt le chéile faoin aon chaipín amháin.</P>
    <P>Tá imní ar chuid de na heagrais ach sílim nach gá é. Deis as an nua í seo agus muide a chreideann in athaontú síochánta na tíre, ba cheart go bhfeicfimid go gcaithimid a bheith groíúil sna réitigh a dhéanfaidh muid. Trí obair in éineacht lena chéile, éireoidh linn cuid de na haidhmeanna comónta atá againn a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tá an Roinn páirteach freisin in iomairt Cholmcille agus tá spéis faoi leith agam féin ann ó tharla go bhfuil sé ag déanamh rud nach ndearnadh ón séú céad déag. Go minic déantar dearmad go raibh Gaeilge caighdeánach á labhairt ó thuaisceart na hAlban go deisceart na hÉireann agus a bhí iontuigthe do na pobail sin go léir go dtí an t-am sin. Trí iomairt Cholmcille beidh nasc nua á cheangail againn lenár gcairde Gaelach in Albain agus molaim an díogras atá siadsan ag caitheamh leis an iarracht seo agus go mór mór an tAthair Brian Wilson a thionscnaigh an iomairt.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú as cuimse tagtha ar chiste na Gaeilge agus ainneoin an rud a deirtear sna meáin, ní chuirtear aon phingin ar ais sa Státchiste as an gciste sin. Tá tacaíocht leanúnach á tabhairt do Raidió agus do Theilifís na Gaeilge agus fás ag teacht orthu. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil clár cuimsi<Col N="724" /> theach á leanúint ag an Rialtas i dtaca le pobal na Gaeilge de.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate, particularly as Seanad Éireann had the foresight to have this debate around St. Patrick's Day because at this time of the year we are all the more conscious of the importance of our separate identity.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made in the past that those of us who spoke Irish felt that those who did not speak Irish were less Irish in some way. I reject that argument. However, there is no doubt that the weakening of any aspect of our identity, that is music, games, culture, art or language, on a corporate or national basis &ndash; not on an individual basis; not to measure one against the other but on a national basis &ndash; is not the loss of the individual but the loss of our nation. It is important that we debate these issues because in this world of mass consumerism we must work at the protection of diversity, identity and culture because it is through those values that we get satisfaction out of life.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, as ucht am breise a thabhairt dom agus gabhaim buíochas le Seanad Éireann &ndash; an áit a tháinig mé don chéad uair mar Bhall den Oireachtas &ndash; as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar a bhfuil ar bun ag an Rialtas maidir leis an nGaeilge and leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. Bhí mé ag éisteacht go géar leis na rudaí tábhachtacha a bhí á rá aige. Labhraím anseo in áit an tSeanadóir McDonagh nach bhfuil in ann bheith i láthair.</P>
      <P>Caithim tréimhse gach bliain i nGaeltacht Chiarraí agus is breá liom an áit. Caithim cuid mhaith ama ansin ag caint leis na daoine atá ag dul in aois anois, cosúil liom féin. Tá an Ghaeilge beo láidir i nGaeltacht Chorcha Dhuibhne agus is é mo thuairim go mairfidh sí amhlaidh. Ar ndóigh, admhaím nach bhfuil eolas ná taithí agam ar na Gaeltachtaí eile.</P>
      <P>Tuigim na fadhbanna atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Tá pobal na Gaeltachta suite i bhfad ó na bailte móra, áit a bhfuil na postanna. Is í an Ghaeilge agus cultúr na Gaeilge an t-aon rud atá acu. Ó bunaíodh an Stát tá sé mar pholasaí ag an Stát agus ag an Roinn Oideachais, ach go háirithe, an Ghaeilge a chothú agus cabhrú leis na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Déantar sin trí dheontaisí a thairiscint chun tithe a thógáil agus ar fáthanna eile. Rud fiúntach é sin a choimeádann an Ghaeltacht le chéile agus níl aon easaontas idir na Páirtithe ar an gceist sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>San am atá thart, bhíodh fadhb mhór ag daoine óga nach mbíodh in ann postanna a fháil sa Ghaeltacht nuair a d'fhás siad suas. Bhíodh orthu imeacht go dtí na bailte móra nó thar lear agus is minic nach mbíodh Béarla maith acu. Ní minic a tharlaíonn a leithéid anois. Tá Gaeilge agus Béarla ar a dtoil ag na páistí Gaeltachta a bhfuil aithne agam orthu. Rud maith é seo agus tá súil agam go mairfidh sé amhlaidh. Níl fáth ar bith nach mbéadh Béarla agus Gaeilge ag gach éinne <Col N="725" /> ag fás aníos, is cuma an sa Ghaeltacht nó sa ghalltacht a thógtar é. Daichead bliain ó shoin tugadh na &ldquo;Connemaras&rdquo; orthu siúd nach raibh ach Gaeilge acu agus bhíodh sé an-deacair ar na daoine sin postanna a fháil. Sa lá atá inniu ann tá Gaeilge agus Béarla ag aos óg na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Cuireann an Ghaeltacht an bóthar idir an Daingean agus Trá Lí i gcuimhe dom. Níl feabhas ar bith tagtha ar an dá rud le daichead bliain ach tá siad ann i gcónaí agus táimíd fós ag caint mar gheall orthu. The Gaeltacht reminds me of the road between Tralee and Dingle. The road has changed very little over the years. It needs a great deal of investment but small pieces of essential maintenance are done to it every year and so it survives.</P>
    <P>People in Gaeltacht areas are, in general, located on the west coast and physically isolated from the commercial activities of cities. Many difficulties are associated with that economic situation. In the main, young people are obliged to leave Gaeltacht areas to get jobs. Successive Governments have helped to maintain Gaeltacht communities. They have strengthened them and preserved the traditions of the communities in so far as the people in those communities wished while modernising them at the same time. The provision of special grants for the establishment of industry in Gaeltacht areas is a good and proper policy. It is a great advantage to someone such as myself to visit the Gaeltacht and to hear Irish spoken.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the tremendous work of Raidio na Gaeltachta in keeping the small rural and often isolated Gaeltacht communities together. Raidio na Gaeltachta was well in advance of other local radio stations. No matter where one is in the country one can tune into the station and hear the local news from one's own parish. Raidio na Gaeltachta has kept communities alive and has proved a very useful investment.</P>
    <P>I am not so convinced of the effectiveness of Teilifís na Gaeilge. Although I watch the station, the people I speak to in the Gaeltacht very rarely do so. In one sense, Teilifís na Gaeilge has isolated Irish from the wider community. I would prefer to see more investment in Irish language programmes on RTE than in Teilifís na Gaeilge. Gaeltacht communities will live regardless of Teilifís na Gaeilge. Local radio is helping to keep them alive. I would like to see more mainstream Irish language programmes on the RTE channels while I accept that there is a very important role to be played by Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>In my experience, young people do not watch Teilifís na Gaeilge. They watch MTV and every other station in preference to Teilifís na Gaeilge. The State might consider investing in cultural activities in Irish for young people. I am afraid Senator Ó Murchú may not agree with me but I am convinced that the State should spend money promoting today's popular youth culture and modern dramas in the Irish language. We must catch the eyes and ears of young people.</P>
    <P>We must promote a broader definition of Irish<Col N="726" /> ness and of Irish culture than the old traditional one. We must bring the Irish language and culture to young people so that ceol agus caint as Gaeilge will not be out of place on MTV. Irish must be a living language with meaning for young people. This need not detract from the traditions of the Gaeltacht and of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember the days of an Ghaeilge éigeantach, or compulsory Irish. We knew that we would fail the leaving certificate if we failed Irish. This had a negative influence on teaching Irish. Many people turned against the whole idea of Irish as the traditional language of the country. Changes in education have been good and positive in that regard. There is now far more respect for the teaching of Irish and Irish studies and culture. We must have confidence in our culture and traditions because, while they are unique and attractive, we cannot impose them on people &ndash; they must want them.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-tábhachtach béim a chur ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge sna bunscoileanna agus teangacha seachas Gaeilge agus Béarla a theagasc sna bunscoileanna freisin. Sin é an sórt saoil a bheas ag na daoine óga agus molaim go ndéanfaí iarracht ar sin. Thabharfadh sé níos mó eolais do dhaoine óga ar fhoghlaim teangacha.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the views, which may not be part of the mainstream. I am very committed to the idea that the Gaeltacht will live and that the teaching of Irish and the future of our culture is in good hands. However, we must change how we look at things. Part of the problem has been that we have become too insular in our views, too isolated from mainstream thought and, in particular, too far removed from young people.</P>
    <P>I support the allocation of as much money as possible to the Gaeltacht. However, we need a change in policy direction. Perhaps it is happening as I speak &ndash; I am not up to date with every movement in this area. I live and work in an east coast, urban, working class environment where people have no real interest in Irish. When those children are at school and being prepared for jobs, they must be given something that is tangible, real and meaningful in their lives. Irish must be made tangible, real and meaningful to them.</P>
    <P>D'fhiafraigh an Seanadóir McDonagh dom cúpla focal a rá ar a shon agus tá mé chun iad a léamh anois don Teach. When it comes to solving the decline of the Irish language, many say it would be helpful if more devolution and power were given to Údarás na Gaeltachta. Conradh na Gaeilge has promoted the idea of cuntóirí scoile, where Irish speakers would be employed to assist teachers in Gaeltacht schools, giving teachers more time to deal with new children in the school who mainly use English. There has been an influx of people into the Gaeltacht, which is a good thing, but many of them do not have great language skills. The provision of cuntóirí scoile, as proposed by Conradh na Gaeilge, would help greatly in that area. There is a need for much heavier investment in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> A bill of rights would be of enormous benefit, as would conducting State services through Irish, which would enable people to conduct their daily business through the medium of Irish without any difficulty. At the moment, services are not provided through Irish and people do not have the time or energy to look for them.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to Irish at the moment. Irish language activists were greatly concerned by the recent survey which showed that less than one-quarter of the Gaeltacht population now lives in areas where Irish could be regarded as the dominant community language. The author of the recent report, Mr. Donacha Ó hEallaithe, is now spearheading a campaign to examine the boundaries of existing Gaeltacht areas. Several people are working towards forming a lobby group in regard to Irish in Gaeltacht areas and they are particularly focusing on a realistic redrawing of the boundaries. At present, areas are included in the Gaeltacht where no more Irish is spoken than in north Tipperary or Leitrim. There are areas in Galway city, and east of the city, which are designated as Gaeltacht areas, although Irish is no longer spoken there.</P>
    <P>This Gaeltacht designation means that people there are entitled to vote in Údarás elections, the body responsible for the industrial and economic development of Gaeltacht areas. In Galway city and places such as Claregalway about 10,500 people are entitled to vote in the Údarás elections, which is more than the population of the entire Munster Gaeltacht. According to the author of the recent report, that is not democratic.</P>
    <P>However, despite the lobby groups' call for a new Gaeltacht and a deferral of the Údarás elections until the boundaries are redrawn, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, insists on going ahead with the elections under the present circumstances, stating that the redrawing of boundaries in isolation would not benefit the language and would have an adverse effect on families in Gaeltacht areas who speak Irish. Accordingly, there will be no boundary changes before the coming Údarás elections. The Minister of State says that other issues, such as planning, the provision of State services through Irish and a co-ordinated linguistic policy, need to be addressed to protect Gaeltacht regions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day has a great deal of work to do. The motion currently in circulation throughout the councils of Ireland, which calls on the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass legislation, such as a bill of rights for the Irish language, that would give practical effect to the constitutional status of Irish and would recognise, secure and strengthen the rights of Irish speakers, should now be brought on the horizon.</P>
    <P>I believe the Gaeltacht is alive and well and will continue for generations. The State supports have been helpful, positive and constructive. I welcome and support all the activities in that area. However, we must radically reappraise <Col N="728" /> some of activities in regard to Irish culture in its broadest sense. We must invest much more money into attracting new ideas and developing modern, mainstream television programmes, which would bring alive young people's culture in Irish. Young people are moving on and the old ways are long gone. We must move with them, if we are to protect the future of our traditional language.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit inniu agus roimh na rudaí a bhí le rá aige. Is duine é a sheasann an fód i gcónaí ar son na Gaeilge agus a thugann dea-shampla ina shaol agus ina shaothar ó thaobh cur chun cinn na teanga. Is beag duine a thuigeann an dúshlán atá romhainn tír fíordhátheangach a dhéanamh d'Éire ach tugann sé spreagadh agus dóchas dúinn i gcónaí.</P>
      <P>Bhí mé im' thimire do Chonradh na Gaeilge le linn m'óige: thaisteal mé Contaetha Port Láirge, Loch Garman, Chill Chainnigh agus Thiobrad Árann theas ar feadh roinnt bhlianta. Ag an am bhí díospóireacht fhiachmhar ar siúl maidir leis an nGaeilge. Bhí daoine ann ag iarraidh atmasféar diúltach a chruthú ina leith agus daoine eile a bhí dearfach. Ach tháinig maitheas as mar bhí ar dhaoine féachaint ar cad é a bhí san oidhreacht teanga seo, an raibh dul chun cinn á dhéanamh nó an raibh gá ar bith leis an teanga, an raibh sé ag cabhrú nó ar cur bac linn mar náisiún agus b'fhiú an díospóireacht a bheith ann.</P>
      <P>Tá athrú mór tagtha ar an saol anois agus an-deathoil le sonrú i measc an phobail. Is annamh a chloistear focal diúltach i leith na Gaeilge anois ach ní hionann sin is a rá go bhfuilimid ag baint gach tairbhe is féidir as an dea-thoil sin. Buaileann an Seanadóir Farrell liomsa sa Teach beagnach chuile lá agus ceistíonn sé mé maidir leis an nGaeilge ar an bhfocal seo nó siúd. Ní bhíonn an freagra agam i gcónaí ach bíonn díospóireacht eadrainn gach lá a chruthaíonn gur teanga bheo í an Ghaeilge; nílimid ag caint faoi stair a thuilleadh ach faoin teanga mar atá sí inniu. Táimid ag iarraidh foclaíocht nádúrtha a fháil ar na hathruithe atá tagtha ar an saol.</P>
      <P>Tá an-chuid rudaí ann le tríocha bliain a thugann an-dóchas dom. Is cuimhin liom nuair a chéad bunaíodh Raidió na Gaeltachta bhí daoine den tuairim nach raibh ann ach tacaíocht béil agus nach seirbhís phroifisiúnta a bheadh ann. Ach chruthaigh Raidió na Gaeltachta go bhféadfaí seirbhís phroifisiúnta a chur ar siúl chuile lá. Agus bíonn díomá ar dhaoine nach féidir leo níos mó tairbhe a bhaint as mar tá a fhios acu gur seirbhís ar ardchaighdeán í.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom a bheith ag obair sa chomhairle contae i gCluain Meala aimsir na Nollag fadó agus bhí geamaireacht as Gaeilge ar an teilifís a bhí ar fheabhas. Agus nuair a bhí sos tae againn an lá dár gcionn san oifig bhí daoine ann a dúirt go raibh an gheamaireacht ar fheabhas ach gur trua gur i nGaeilge a bhí sé. Ba chruthú é seo go raibh dul chun cinn á dhéanamh mar bhí daoine ar bheagán Gaeilge ag rá go raibh rud éigin á <Col N="729" /> chailliúint acu toisc nach raibh Gaeilge acu agus go raibh ardchaighdeán ag baint leis.</P>
    <P>Tá ardmholadh tuillte ag RTÉ freisin. Le fada bhí na heagrais Ghaeilge i gcónaí i ngleic le RTÉ ó thaobh easpa Gaeilge ar an stáisiún. Agus is minic go ndearna RTÉ iarracht feabhas a chur ar an scéal agus is minic eile go raibh cúlú ann,</P>
    <P>Má fhéachaim siar ar chláir cosúil le Buntús Cainte agus Labhair Gaeilge Linn ba chóir aitheantas a thabhairt gur chabhraigh na cláir sin chun feabhas a chur ar Ghaeilge na ndaoine a bhí báúil leis an teanga. Níor leor an dea-thoil gan an t-oideachas sin.</P>
    <P>Ní bhfuair Liam Ó Murchú riamh an creidiúint a bhí ag dul dó as Trom agus Éadrom. B'eisean an duine a léirigh an brí a bhí le dátheangachas. Is cuimhin liom a bheith ar an traein maidin amháin agus rinne mé comhrá leis an bhfreastalaí mar gheall ar Throm agus Éadrom an oíche roimhe sin. Dúirt duine amháin leis an duine eile, &ldquo;An raibh tú ag féachaint ar an gclár sin aréir? An bhfaca tú riamh a leithéid de bhainisteoir bainc agus duine mór le rá eile &ndash; agus bhí siad ag caint as Gaeilge ar an gclár?&rdquo; Cheap siad beirt go raibh set-up éigin i gceist ansin. An rud atá i gceist ansin nach na Gaeilgeoirí a bhí ag caint Gaeilge ach gnáthmhuintir na tíre agus bhí daoine eile in ann iad féin a aithint sna cláir sin.</P>
    <P>Molaim an clár Féach le Proinsias Mac Aonghusa freisin. Bhí cúrsaí reatha á phlé ansin le déanaí &ndash; ní ceist na Gaeilge ach gnáthchúrsaí an tsaoil &ndash; sin dul chun cinn. Ba chóir dúinn a bheith an-dóchasach as na hathruithe sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Teilifís na Gaeilge, is féidir a rá go bhfuil sé nua-aimseartha cé go bhfuil fadhbanna ann maidir leis an tseirbhís a ghlacadh. Cailíní breátha, áille atá le feiscint ar na cláir agus TV3 ag feitheamh chun iad a ghoid. Thuig lucht bainistíochta Theilifís na Gaeilge go gcaithfí daoine óga cumasacha a earcú agus tiocfaidh feabhas diaidh ar ndiaidh ar an lucht féachana. Bhí sé de mhisneach againn méid áirithe airgid a chaitheamh le seirbhís den tsaghas sin a chur ar fáil le cruthú go rabhamar dáiríre ó thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. Molaim gach duine a bhí páirteach san éacht sin.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir an Ghaeilge a lua gan an Ghaeltacht a lua freisin. Is eol dom gur thug chuile dhuine anseo cuairt ar an nGaeltacht ag am éigin. Níor bhuail mé le héinne riamh a thug cuairt ar an nGaeltacht nár tháinig ar ais le hionspioráid &ndash; b'fhéidir nach raibh níos mó Gaeilge acu i gcónaí dá bharr ach thaitin sé leo a bheith ag caint faoina seal sa Ghaeltacht. Mar is cruthú an Ghaeltacht gur féidir tír dhátheangach a chur chun cinn &ndash; ní fiú a bheith ag caint ar leabhair nó ar phleananna. Infheistiú sa nGaeilge is ea an t-airgead a tugadh do Theilifís na Gaeilge agus do ghnóthaí eile agus aon laghdú a thagann ar an nGaeltacht, is laghdú é ar an gcúis féin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go gcuirfear béim níos mó ar an nGaeilge go háírithe i gcás daoine fásta agus go dtabharfar cuairt ar an nGaeltacht chun Gaeilge a fhoghlaim díreach mar a théitear go dtí an Fhrainc nó an Ghearmáin chun a dteangacha siúd <Col N="730" /> a fhoghlaim. Caithfear féachaint ar an nGaeltacht mar thobar na Gaeilge, tobar eolais agus oideachais.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhí an feachtas ar siúl anseo mar gheall ar dhul isteach san Eoraip bhí mise ar duine de na daoine a chuir ina choinne. Bhí mé i mo sheasamh ar ardán lá agus beirt eile liom agus é ag cur fearthainne agus seisear ag éisteacht linn. Bhí faitíos orm go gcuirfeadh an Eoraip isteach ar ár bhféiniúlacht náisiúnta. Tá mé sásta a admháil go raibh mé mícheart sa mhéid sin mar éinne a chuaigh ag taisteal ar fud na hEorpa riamh thug siad faoi deara nach í an tír seo amháin a bhí ag iarraidh a teanga féin a chothú agus a fhorbairt &ndash; má fhéachtar ar an obair atá á dhéanamh ag Rialtas na Fraince agus na milliún punt atá á chaitheamh acu chuile bhliain ar fud an domhain le cinntiú go mbeidh an stádas céanna ag an bhFraincis is atá ag an mBéarla. Tá an scéal amhlaidh leis an nGearmáinis agus thuig na daoine óga Éireannacha nárbh fhadhb í seo a bhain leis an tír seo amháin ach go raibh sé ann ar fud an domhain. Agus nuair a tháinig na daoine óga sin ar ais go dtí an tír seo bhí meas níos mó acu ar an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go bhfuilim mícheart sa mhéid seo ach shíl mé i gcás na gcomharthaí bóthair móra atá le feiceáil gurb í an Eoraip faoi ndear an Ghaeilge a bheith ar na comharthaí sin. Ní amháin an Ghaeilge a bheith ann ach méid na litreacha. Is cuimhin liom blianta fada ó shin nuair a bhí an-chuid daoine ag déanamh argóna le cinntiú nach mbeadh aon chúlú ann ó thaobh na gcomharthaí a bheith as Gaeilge chomh maith le Béarla agus b'fhéidir as Gaeilge amháin sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá siad dátheangach anois agus tá comharthaí dátheangacha le feiscint freisin ar na traenacha agus ag na haerphoirt. Cén chumhacht atá ag baint le seo? Conas is féidir le duine freastal ar scoil ar feadh 14 bliana agus Gaeilge a fhoghlaim don am sin agus gan é a bheith de mhisneach acu dhá abairt Ghaeilge a chur le chéile? Sin í an cheist i gcónaí. Bíonn sé de mhisneach ag daoine a gcuid Fraincíse a úsáid tar éis dhá bhliain. An freagra atá agamsa air ná gur thug na daoine óga faoi deara tar éis teacht as an scoil nach raibh an timpeallacht féin ag tacú leis an rud a bhí á dhéanamh taobh istigh den scoil. Ní raibh comharthaí le feiscint sa dá theanga.</P>
    <P>Sna caogaidí tháinig foireann rugbaí go hÉireann ón mBreatain Bheag agus is cuimhin liom gur athraíodh na teidil ar na scannaín i bpictiúrlanna Bhaile Átha Cliath go dtí an Bhreatainis mar ómós do na cuairteoirí a bhí sa chathair. Go dtí go ndéantar an rud céanna in ómós do na daoine a bhfuil clann á tógáil acu le Gaeilge agus go bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil 25 faoin gcéad den phobal ag rá go bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus go mbeidh an húdáráis éagsúla sásta aitheantas a thabhairt do na daoine sin trí Gaeilge a chur ar fáil dóibh, beidh sé i gcónaí deacair aon dul chun cinn a dhéanamh sna scoileanna amháin.</P>
    <P>Ábhar dóchais eile is ea na gaelscoileanna, <Col N="731" /> ceann de na rudaí is mó a tharla don Ghaeilge sa chéad seo. Chruthaigh siad arís go raibh tuismitheoirí ann a raibh muinín acu as a bhféiniúlacht féin agus a raibh an Ghaeilge ag teastáil acu dá bpáistí agus a thuig go mbeadh oideachas d'ardchaighdeán le fáil acu trí mheán na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím le gach éinne a raibh baint acu leis an ngluaiseacht sin. Ní hé amháin go mbeidh na scoláirí sin ag teacht ar aghaidh le Gaeilge ach tá súil againn go mbeidh seirbhísí le fáil acu sa mheánscolaíocht chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Tá baint ag na tuismitheoirí leis an bhforbairt sin, a chruthaíonn go bhfuil an-dul chuin cinn go deo déanta.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir gluaiseacht na Gaeilge a fhágáil as an áireamh agus dála gach gluaiseachta bhí sé seal thuas agus seal thíos. Bunaíodh Conradh na Gaeilge breis is céad bliain ó shin agus má bhreathnaítear ar an dearcadh a bhí acu ag an am ní dóigh liom go bhféadfaí a bheith chomh dóchasach ó thaobh na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre. Ach ó am na Young Irelanders ar aghaidh isteach go dtí bunú an Chonradh thuig siad má bhí aon bhriseach ann sa leanúnachas go mbeadh glúin ann nach mbeadh aon tuiscint acu ar an mbrionglóid mhór seo a bhi ag na laochra ag an am úd. B'shin gurb ionann anam na tíre agus an Ghaeilge. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an manna sin chomh faiseanta anois ach go bunúsach bhí an ceart acu. Na daoine a chuir suim sa Ghaeilge, chuir siad suim sa tír i gcoitinne agus bhí siad lánsásta ag an am íobairt a dhéanamh agus gan aon rud pearsanta a fháil as.</P>
    <P>An Conradh a thug an dea-shampla sin agus ó shin tá eagrais bhreátha eile tagtha ar an tír agus ní fhéadfaí iad go léir a lua. Ach táimid faoi chomaoin acu, cuid acu a dhéanann obair speisialta, cuid eile a mbíonn cúram níos fairsinge orthu.</P>
    <P>Caithfear féachaint ar scileanna agus ar stíl nua. Ní aon mhaitheas a bheith ag cloí le modhanna oibre ná le fealsúnacht a bhí ann caoga bliain ó shin. Aon rud atá beo, tá sé ag athrú agus is fíor sin faoin nGaeilge freisin. Más féidir an teicneolaíocht nua a úsáid le ciall is féidir dul i bhfeidhm ar an-chuid daoine eile.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil an tAire chun coiste comhairleach don óige a bhunú. Sin ceann de na rudaí is fearr a chuala mé le fada an lá. Lig dóibh a gcuid tuairimí féin a thabhairt agus labhairt ar a son féin. Is féidir linn a bheith cinnte má gheibheann siad an seans go mbeidh siad chomh ciallmhar céanna le haon aos óg eile dá raibh. Bhí cuid againn anseo inár ndéagóirí nuair a thosaigh muid amach i ngluaiseachtaí agus is cinnte go mbíonn fuinneamh ar leith agus dóchas ag an aos óg. Ní bhíonn siad chomh coimeádach linne.</P>
    <P>Is féidir leo freisin dul i bhfeidhm ar a aois ghrúpa féin, rud atá deacair do dhaoine fásta.</P>
    <P>Anocht sa Dáil beidh díospóireacht ann ar an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ó Thuaidh agus ar an bhForas Trasteorann don nGaeilge. Molaim an tAire agus an Rialtas de bhrí gur thug siad tús áite don nGaeilge nuair a bhí na gníomhaireachtaí seo á gcur le chéile. Dá dtiocfadh sé níos <Col N="732" /> déanaí déarfadh daoine nach raibh an gradam céanna ag an nGaeilge is atá ag ábhair eile. Tá an Ghaeilge mar shnaidhm eadrainn agus ní bhaineann sí le haon pholaitíocht ná haon traidisiún ar leith. Is féidir leis na hAondachtóirí a bheith dílis don seanoidhreacht mar tá sé i bhfad níos sine ná aon deighilt pholaitiúil a tharla ina dhiaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Is féidir leis an nGaeilge an dá thraidisiún sa tír seo a shnaidhmeadh le chéile. Ócáid stairiúil í seo sa Seanad inniu nuair atá cúrsaí Gaeilge á bplé trí Ghaeilge fad atá athaontú na tíre ó thaobh na Gaeilge ag tarlú freisin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé dáiríre faoin obair atá idir láimhe aige. Má deirim aon ní nach bhfuil go hiomlán dearfa, is chun cabhrú a deirim é.</P>
      <P>I gcás na nGaeltachtaí, tá sé in am do dhaoine an seanrómánsaíocht a fhágaí taobh thiar díobh. Is cuimhin liom mo chéad chuairt ar Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne i 1971. Bhí sé lán  de dhaoine breátha le Gaeilge mhilis ach ba é an méan aoise ná 70, gan ach leanbh nó dhó san áít. Bhí an áit go hiontach mar iarsma &ndash; ní raibh sé chun leanúint leis mar phobal tar éis b'fhéidir deich mbliana eile ach amháin gur tháinig athrú i bhfoirm tionscail, a thug seans do dhaoine fanacht ann. Inniu níl an Ghaeilge chomh milis is a bhí &ndash; tá sé measctha le Béarla; tá daoine ann nach labhraíonn Gaeilge a thuilleadh nuair nach gcloisfí ach Gaoluinn fiche cúig bliain ó shin ach tá sé i bhfad níos tábhachtaí go bhfuil an pobal beo agus tá seans anois don Ghaeilge sna pobail sin.</P>
      <P>Go dtí sin bhí baol ann go mairfeadh sé mar Ghaeltacht go dtí gur cailleadh an duine deireanach agus ansin go mbeadh radharc iontach ag stróinseírí a thiocfadh ar laethanta saoire agus gan le clos ach a dteangacha iasachta siúd.</P>
      <P>Tá athruithe tagtha ar na Gaeltachtaí, athruithe nárbh fhéidir a sheachaint. Má bhí forbairt eacnamaíochta le teacht ar na ceantair sin ní fhéadfaí é a dhéanamh gan cuidiú ó dhaoine gan Gaeilge. Tá rudaí tar éis tarlú iontu nach dtaitníonn le daoine atá ag lorg iarsmalann sna Gaeltachtaí. Is cuimhin liom fear breá Gaeltachta ag rá le Gaeilgeoir as Baile Átha Cliath nach raibh sé sásta fanacht in áit nach raibh teilifís, pictiúrlann, carr nó meaisín níocháin aige chun cabhrú le Gaeilgeoirí Bhaile Átha Cliaith seansaol nach raibh oiriúnach dóibh ach a bhí oiriúnach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a choimeád beo.</P>
      <P>Tá sé in am dúinn an seanrómansaíocht a fhágáil taobh thiar dínn. Is cuimhin liom go bhfágtaí na sméara dubha ar thaobh an bhóthair i gCorca Dhuibhne mar nach raibh dóthain daoine óga fágtha san áit. Is maith go bhfuil sé sin go léir athraithe anois. Baineann na deacrachtai atá an nGaeltacht anois le saol an duine bheo agus ní le saol an phobail mhairbh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfear a admháil go bhfuil sé an-deacair teanga lag a threisiú. Ní heol dom ach dhá thír inar déanadh an éacht sin &ndash; an Iosrael áit a raibh teanga ag teastáil chun an pobal a aontú agus féin-mhuinín a mhúscailt iontu agus an Fhionnlainn atá ina sampla breá dúinne. Sa leab<Col N="733" /> har iontach a scríobh an tOllamh Joe Lee fé stair na tíre seo rinne sé cur síos ar an easpa muiníne a léirítear trí laige na Gaoluinne in Éirinn. An chomparáid a dhéanann sé ná idir an tír seo agus an Fhionnlainn agus deir sé go raibh céatadán níos ísle den phobal ag labhairt Fionlannais i lár na haoise deiridh ná mar a bhi ag labhairt Gaeilge sa tír seo. B'é an tSualainnis an teanga ba láidre agus d'éirigh leo é sin a athrú ionas gurb í an tSualainnis anois teanga na mionlachta sa tír sin agus an Fhionlannais an phríomh-theanga. D'éirigh i bhfad níos fearr leo ó thaobh na heacnamaíochta freisin agus tá sé suimiúil a thabhairt faoi deara go bhfuil ag éírí leo fós agus go bhfuil an mobile phone manufacturing firm is mó ar domhain bunaithe sa tír sin agus an teanga aisteach sin nach dtuigeann éinne eile agus a bhfuil siad an-bhródúil aisti, tá sí ag gach éinne sa tír mar aon le teanga nó dhó eile.</P>
    <P>Is féidir é a dhéanamh ach caithfear a bheith dáiríre faoi. Tá rudaí déanta againn in ainm an teanga a chur ar aghaidh agus níor éirigh leo. Is fiú taighde domhanda a dhéanamh ar an tslí a thagann leanaí as an mbunscoil tar éis deich mbliana a chaitheamh ag foghlaim na Gaoluinnne ar feadh deich n-uaire sa tseachtain, daichead seachtain gach bliain, agus an deireadh níl siad ábalta comhrá simplí a choimeád ar siúl as Gaeilge. Sin ceann de na teipeanna is mó ó thaobh oideachais i dtír ar bith agus ba chóir an chúis atá leis a fhiosrú. Nuair is féidir le páistí óga teangacha iasachta a shealbhú, cén fáth nach feidir leo an Ghaeilge a shealbhú tar éis an méid sin ama? Is minic a bhuailim le múinteoirí bunscoile nach bhfuil in ann comhrá Gaeilge a choimeád ar siúl liomsa agus ní ró-thapa a labhraím agus ní ró-chasta an foclóir atá agam. Níl an chuid is mó de mhúinteoirí bunscoile na tíre seo in ann comhrá Gaeilge a choimeád ar siúl.</P>
    <P>Má tá daoine ag múineadh Gaeilge nach bhfuil in ann í a labhairt, cad a dhéanfaidh siad? Leanfaidh siad le litriú, le léamh agus le rudaí eile ach ní bheidh siad in ann an rud is tábhachtaí a dhéanamh, sé sin, Gaoluinn a labhairt le leanaí sa chaoi is go labhróidh na leanaí as Gaoluinn. Tá ag teip ar an gcaiteachas ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge sna bunscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Sna gaelscoileanna, tar éis bliain amháin, tá leanaí in ann comhrá den chaighdeán a d'oirfeadh don aois sin a choimeád ar siúl as Gaoluinn. Má táimid dáiríre faoin mbunsprioc, an pobal a bheith compordach leis an nGaoluinn, caithfear féachaint ar an gceist seo.</P>
    <P>Tá gluaiseacht na Gaoluinne nó establishments na Gaoluinne ann agus ní dóigh liom gurb ionann dearcadh na establishments seo agus maitheas na Gaoluinne. Caithfear a thuiscint nach ó ghluaiseacht oifigiúil na Gaoluinne a tháinig an chuid is mó de na gaelscoileanna ach ón gcosmhuintir in áiteanna cosúil le Baile Munna lena n-éileamh do chóras oideachais lánghaelach. Is beag cabhair a fuair na daoine sin ag an am, is cuma cén Rialtas a bhí i gcumhacht. Bhí státseirbhísigh ann a dúirt leo &ldquo;You are not serious. You working-class people wanting a school through Irish amháin, <Col N="734" /> you must be joking.&rdquo; Agus baineadh an-gheit as na daoine siúd.</P>
    <P>D'éirigh linn cuid mhaith rudaí a dhéanamh. Tá níos mó Gaoluinne ag níos mó daoine sa tír seo ná mar a bhí 70 bliain ó shin. Ach má fhéachtar ar an méid airgid atá caite againn air, ní go ró-mhaith a d'éirigh linn.</P>
    <P>An rud is measa a rinneamar ná coinníoll a leagadh síos go raibh Gaoluinn ag teastáil ó gach duine a bhí ag dul ag obair sa chóras poiblí, ach amháin do Bhaill an Oireachtais. Dá n-athróimis an rud ar fad agus a rá go bhfuileamar chun gnó an Oireachtais a dhéanamh trí Ghaoluinn agus gan aon bhrú a chur ar éinne eile, d'athrófaí an scéal ar fad. Ach b'fhéidir nach mbeimis in ann é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá an-mhímhacántacht ann i leith na Gaoluinne &ndash; agus ní hé an tAire atá i gceist agam ach teorainneacha na Gaeltachta. Tá argóint déanta ag an Aire gur fiú seans amháin eile a thabhairt do na pobail atá in ainm is a bheith ina Gaeltachtaí athrú teangan a chur chun cinn. An dea-shampla is fearr atá againn ná go bhfuil athrú ag teacht ar Ghaeltachta na Rinne, athrú beag, lag ach athrú fós féin. Ní ró-mhaith an chomhartha é do na daoine a labhraíonn Gaoluinn sna Gaeltachtaí go mbeidh toghchán ann d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go mbeidh daoine áirithe i gcathair na Gaillimhe ag vótáil ann agus daoine eile nach mbeidh. Muna bhfuil an tAire sásta teorainneacha na Gaeltachta a athrú, sin cúis amháin nach cóir an toghchán sin a reachtáil ar an lá céanna leis na toghcháin áitiúla. Má bhíonn toghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta ann ar lá leo féin, ní vótáilfidh iontu ach muintir na fíorGhaeltachta agus ní bhacfaidh na daoine atá in ainm is a bheith ina gcónaí sa nGaeltacht leo.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ar aithne agamsa sna Gaeltachtaí a gceapann go bhfuil na toghcháin seo á reachtáil ar an lá céanna chun vóta níos mó a fháil ó na Béarlóirí. Sin a tharla an uair dheiridh nuair a chaill daoine cumasacha neamhspleácha a suíocháin agus go raibh an lá leis na Páirtithe móra, go mór mór i gcathair na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Mímhacántacht eile é an curaclam Gaoluinn céanna a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht, i ngaelscoileanna agus i scoileanna eile. Níl ansin ach dallamullóg á chur againn orainn féin. Ní hionann iad na leanaí sin ó thaobh na Gaoluinne de.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh le mo leanaí féin a bhfuil Gaoluinn réasúnta maith acu go mba chóir an Ghaoluinn den taobh tíre ina bhfuil an leanbh a mhúineadh don leanbh sin &ndash; Gaoluinn na Mumhan i gCúige Mumhan agus mar sin de. Agus ní mhúinfinn an caighdeán dóibh go dtí go bhfuil siad ábalta í a labhairt. Baintear an-gheit as leanaí na ngaelscoileanna nuair a théann siad go dtí an Ghaeltacht don chéad uair agus cé gur dóigh leo go bhfuil cumas maith Gaoluinne acu ní thuigeann siad focal thart orthu. Ní mór an chabhair dá bhféin-mhuinín é sin.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí áirithe le déanamh fós. I gcathair Chorcaí, caithfear Teilifís na Gaeilge a lorg i measc na gcainéal eile ar an multichannel toisc go bhfuil caineál Gearmánach ann a chuireann por<Col N="735" /> nography ar fáil go déanach istoíche. Ba chóir go mbeadh Teilifís na Gaeilge i measc na bpríomhchainéal agus d'fhéadfaí é sin a dhéanamh le reachtaíocht.</P>
    <P>Anois go bhfuil an oiread sin airgid ag an tír ba chóir níos mó cabhrach a thabhairt do Theilifís na Gaeilge chun cláir eile a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá an teanga ag athrú sa chóras tráchtála sa Ghaeltacht &ndash; tá sé deacair anois ar dhaoine dul isteach i dteach tábhairne agus deoch a lorg as Gaoluinn &ndash; in áiteanna i gCorca Dhuibhne ní thuigtear Gaoluinn agus níl sé sin go maith don turasóireacht.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go n-oireann an t-atmasféar sna pubs agus sna caféanna ach oiread. Ní theastaíonn ó thurasóirí Atlantic 252 a chlos ann. Tá tithe samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht &ndash; agus tá ceann acu agam féin &ndash; ag cur an-bhrú ar phobal na Gaeltachta. Moladh amháin atá agamsa &ndash; agus ní dóigh liom gurb é seo polasaí mo pháirtí, ach is cuma faoi sin &ndash; má tá daoine ag tógáil tithe samhraidh tá siad ag baint úsáid as seirbhísí, ag úsáid talún agus ag cur brú ar dhaoine atá ag iarraidh clann a thógaint.</P>
    <P>Mar sin is é mo mholadh ná gur chóir go mbeadh cáin ar thithe samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht, timpeall £500 sa bhliain ar gach tigh samhraidh. Ba chóir an t-airgead sin a úsáid san áit in a bhfuil an tigh samhraidh chun láithreacha tí, seirbhísí scoile agus mar sin de a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Thiocfadh cuid mhaith airgid isteach as a leithéid fiú amháin i gCorca Dhuibhne, áit a bhfuil eolas maith agam féin air. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ceart nach bhfuil rud mar sin á íoc ag daoine gur féidir leo íoc as, daoine go bhfuil dhá thigh acu.</P>

      <P>Is é an córas atá againn sa Tigh seo ná gurb urlabhraí an pháirtí an dara urlabhraí ó thaobh an rialtais. Táim an-bhuíoch don Seanadóir an seans seo a thabhairt dom mar tá an t-am ag sleamhnú.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom fíorchaoin fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit. Chuir sé áthas orm éisteacht leis an díospóireacht a bhí ar siúl sa Tigh le beagnach dhá uair anuas agus éisteacht leis an líofacht Ghaeilge atá sa Tigh le linn dom a bheith ag obair i mo oifig.</P>
      <P>Is ceart agus is cóir go mbeadh díospóireacht mar seo againn go háirithe sa Tigh seo agus Seachtain na Gaeilge ar siúl amuigh ansin i measc an phobail agus sinn ag iarraidh ar an bpobal breis Ghaeilge a labhairt. Bheadh sé an hait go deo muna mbeadh iarracht níos fearr á dhéanamh againne chun Gaeilge a labhairt an tseachtain seo go háirithe agus gan amhras gach seachtain i rith na bliana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táimid ag druidim i dtreo dheireadh na haoise seo agus is ceart agus is cóir go ndéanfaimis meastachán ar cad tá bainte amach againn le linn ha haoise seo. Conas tá staid na Gaeilge anois agus cad is cóir a dhéanamh chun staid na Gaeilge a leathnú a\gus sinn ag dul i dtreo na haoise nua? Measaim go bhfuil sé tráthúil a leithéid sin a <Col N="736" /> dhéanamh agus is dóigh liom gurb é sin an saghas machnaimh atá á dhéanamh againn anseo tráthnóna inniu.</P>
    <P>Chomh fada agus a thuigim an scéal tá an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laige agus tá an Ghalltacht ag dul i dtreise. Tá ceist an dátheangachais i bhfad níos láidre anois ná mar a bhí sí tráth. Sin rud an-mhaith ar fad. Is céim í sin atá bainte amach ag gnáth-mhuintir na tíre seo. Is é sin go bhfuil an dátheangachas i réim anois agus go bhfuil cumas cainte sa dá theanga ag i bhfad níos mó daoine anois ná mar a bhí tráth.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go mbeadh mórtas orainn go bhfuil an méid sin bainte amach againn. Is trua, áfach. go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laghad. Cad is féidir linne a dhéanamh anois chun tabhairt faoin cheist sin agus chun teacht i bhfóirithint ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun an Ghaeilge a dhéanamh níos treise sa Ghaeltacht? Muna bhfuil an Ghaeltacht beo agus bríomhar ní bheidh an teanga sa chuid eile den tír mar sí an Ghaeltacht príomhfhoinse agus tobar na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Fadó scríobh an file Seán Ó Ríordáin &ndash; fear a raibh an-chumas scríobhnóireachta aige agus an-bhá aige don Ghaeltacht &ndash; alt san <i>Irish Times</i> agus an príomhsmaoineamh a bhí san alt sin ná seo: muna bhfuil an Ghaeltacht láidir ní bheidh an Ghaeilge láidir, nó beo nó bríomhar sa tír seo. Réitím leis an tuairim sin.</P>
    <P>An rud is ceart dúinn a dhéanamh anois ná iarracht níos láidre a dhéanamh chun cúrsaí eacnamaíochta sa Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn mar muna mbíonn fostaíocht ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht beidh an Ghaeltacht á thréigint ag daoine óga ag dul go háiteanna eile sa tír nó thar lear. Má thréigeann an t-aos óg an Ghaeltacht cad tá in ann dí? Sin an chéad phointe gur mhaith liom féin a dhéanamh. Caithfimid iarracht i bhfad níos feárr a dhéanamh chun níos mó fostaíochta a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht i dtreo is gur féidir le daoine óga a bhfuil togha na Gaeilge acu fanacht sa Ghaeltacht, a gclann a thógaint sa Ghaeltacht agus traidisiún na Gaeilge sa teaghlach a chur chun cinn ó ghlún go glún. Tá sé sin an-tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Ní leor go mbeadh daoine mar sinne ag dul uair amháin sa bhliain go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus an-spraoi a bhaint amach agus ansin imeacht as go ceann bliana eile. Ní leor é chun an Ghaeltacht a choimead beo. Is cabhair é don Ghaeltacht gan amhras mar d'fhéadfá a rá go gcuireann sin cúpla pingin isteach sa Ghaeltacht. Agus is cabhair é don Ghaeltacht nuair a bhíonn leanaí óga ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht i rith an tsamhraidh gach bliain chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim, ach ní leor é. Caithfear fostaíocht fad-téarmach a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Táimid anois, nó tá an rialtas seo go háirithe, ag druidim i dtreo an réigiúnachais. Is maith an polasaí sin i leith na Gaeltachta agus i leith an choda eile den tír atá taobh amuigh de na bailte móra. Má chuirtear an polasaí sin i bhfeidhm agus má thugtar ardú céime don infrastruchtúr &ndash; na bóithre, taisteal agus access agus mar sin de &ndash; bheadh dóchas agam go dtiocfadh feabhas ar an <Col N="737" /> gceist agus go mbeadh deis ann an Ghaeltacht a láidriú arís &ndash; ní amháin don Ghaeltacht ach do mhuintir na tíre tré chéile. Is iontach an rud é do dhaoine mar sinne nach bhfuil comhnaí orainn sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ann dúinne chun dul ann, feabhas a chur ar ár gcuid Gaeilge agus teangbháil a dhéanamh len ár dteanga dhúchais féin, cumarsáid a dhéanamh ní amháin leis an teanga labhartha ach le litríocht agus filíocht na Gaeilge chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeilge sa bhfaisean arís. Nuair a bhí mise óg bhí boladh an bhochtanais ag baint leis an nGaeilge agus bhí dearcadh ag an-chuid daoine mura raibh cumas cainte agat sa Bhéarla second-class citizen a bhí ionat. Tá an-athrú dearcaidh i leith na Gaeilge imithe i bhfeidhm sa tír seo le fiche bliain anuas agus is maith an rud é sin. Is rud faiseanta anois a bheith líofa sa Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá na cláracha Gaeilge ar an teilifís spleodrach, beo agus bríomhar. Cuireann líon na ndaoine óga atá ag plé leis an nGaeilge ar Theilifís na Gaeilge agus ar stáisiúin eile gliondar croí orm. Mar sin mheasfá go mbeadh sé níos fusa don ghlúin seo an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a chothú agus a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Feachtas eile atá imithe chun cinn go hiontach le blianta beaga anuas ná feachtas na ngaelscoileanna. Is iontach go deo anois líon na bpáistí óga atá ag freastal ar ghaelscoileanna. Rud ar mhaith liom a chur os comhair an Aire ná páistí a bhíonn ag freastal ar ghaelscoileanna ar feadh, b'fhéidir, ocht mbliana &ndash; go minic ní bhíonn meánscolaíocht tré Ghaeilge ar fáil dóibh. Is mór an laige é sin sa chóras oideachais. Ní bhíonn an leanúnachas ann agus is mór an caitheamh amú an méid sin ama a chaitheamh sa chóras oideachais ag foghlaim tré Ghaeilge muna mbíonn an leanúnachas ann. Cuirim é sin os comhair an Aire mar sprioc.</P>
    <P>Ós ag caint ar oideachas atáimid, tá easpa téacsleabhar tré Ghaeilge ann, go háirithe sna hábhair teicneolaíochta agus eacnamaíochta. Sin laige an-mhór sa chóras oideachais. Tá sé an-deacair ar mhúinteoirí teacht ar théacsleabhair nua-aimseartha agus caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin laige sin.</P>
    <P>Is iontach ar fad líon na dtuismitheoirí atá sásta anois oideachas tré Ghaeilge a lorg dá gcuid leanaí. Tugann sin an-mhisneach dúinn.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt don Ghaeltacht arís, measaim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh Gaeilge ag daoine ar nós dochtúirí agus daoine eile sa chóras poiblí a théann isteach ag obair sa Ghaeltacht. Ach ní mar sin a bhíonn sé uaireanta. Sin laige an-mhór. Ní ceart go mbeadh daoine sa chóras poiblí ag dul isteach sa Ghaeltacht chun slí bheatha a bhaint amach muna bhfuil Gaeilge líofa acu agus é ar a gcumas an Ghaeilge a labhairt gach lá. Tá sin an-tábhachtach freisin.</P>
    <P>Is trua nach bhfuil ach an t-aon pháipéar laethúil amháin ann go mbíonn aon Ghaeilge le léamh ann agus is é sin an <i>Irish Times. </i>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an <i>Irish Times </i>ní <Col N="738" /> amháin as ucht an méid Gaeilge atá ann ach an saghas Gaeilge atá ann freisin. Táim ag smaoineamh ar Liam ó Muirthile ach go háirithe agus ar an intleacht atá ag an bhfear sin. Is iontach go deo na rudaí a scríobhann sé sa pháipéar sin. Muna mbeadh sí le léamh sna páipéirí bheadh sé an-deacair an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo. Is mór an trua é ach chomh fada agus is eol dom is é an <i>Irish Times </i>an t-aon pháipéar laethúil amháin go mbíonn an Ghaeilge ann go rialta. Is mór an trua é nach ndéanann na nuachtáin náisiúnta eile iarracht níos fearr chun beagáinín Gaeilge a fhoilsiú chun freastal ar na daoine a bhfuil meas acu ar an nGaeilge agus ar mhaith leo beagáinín léitheoireachta a dhéanamh tré mhéan na Gaeilge lá i ndiaidh lae.</P>
    <P>Is iontach an rud é go bhfuil Teilifís na Gaeilge ann agus ag feidhmiú fé mar atá sé. Ach níl sé chomh héasca sin ar an-chuid daoine teacht ar an gcainéal sin agus ba mhaith liom go ndéarfadh an tAire é sin le Cathal Goan nó le pé duine atá i bhfeighil an stáisiúin sin. Bhí an scéal níos measa nuair a thosaigh an stáisiún ach tá sé ag dul i bhfeabhas anois. Tá sé níos éasca domsa anois teacht ar Theilifís na Gaeilge ná mar a bhí sé nuair a thosaigh sé. Ní ceart aon bhac a chur ar an access agus ba cheart go mbeadh muintir na tíre seo in ann teilifís tré Ghaeilge a fháil.</P>
    <P>Measaim nach bhfuil an méid céanna Gaeilge ar theilifís RTÉ is a bhí tráth ach ní féidir liom a bheith cinnte faoi seo mar ní bhíonn mórán ama agam a bheith ag breathnú ar an teilifís. Is mór an trua é sin. Nuair a bhí an díospóireacht ar siúl maidir le Teilifís na Gaeilge a bhunú dúirt mé lá i ndiaidh lae nach ceart go mbeadh aon laghdú ar mhéid na Gaeilge ar RTÉ nuair a bheadh an tseirbhís nua ar fáil. Public service broadcasting atá i gceist anseo agus má tá laghdú ar mhéid na Gaeilge ann ba cheart don Aire dul chun cainte leo agus a rá leo go ndúrathas é sin sa Tigh seo inniu le linn Seachtain na Gaeilge 1999. Ba cheart don Aire a rá leo go bhfuil díomá orainn gurb amhlaidh atá an scéal. Tá dualgas orthu ar a laghad an méid Gaeilge a bhí ann tráth a chur ar fáil. Muna mbíonn Gaeilge timpeall orainn sna meáin chumarsáide, sna nuachtáin agus eile, ní bheidh sí beo sa tír seo. An laige is mó a bhí ann tráth ná go rabhamar ag brath ar an gcóras oideachais chun gach rud a dhéanamh agus tá sé faighte amach againn anois nach féidir leis an gcóras oideachais gach uile rud a dhéanamh. Déanann siad a ndícheall, God knows.</P>
    <P>Is mór an t-áthas atá orm go bhfuil an saghas seo díospóireachta ar siúl anseo an tseachtain seo agus go bhfuil an-chuid tuairimí ag teacht ó mhuintir an Tí seo maidir le conas is féidir an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo. Ta dea-thoil á léiriú ag muintir an Tí seo i leith na Gaeilge. Níl ach cúpla rud sa tír bheag seo gur fiú a choimeád agus a chur ar aghaidh go dtí an chéad ghlúin eile &ndash; an ceol, an fhilíocht, an litríocht agus an teanga agus go minic is ionann iad sin go léir.</P>

      <P>Níl Gaeilge líofa agamsa ach creidim sa seanfhocal &ldquo;Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste ná Béarla cliste&rdquo;. Ba mhaith liomsa freisin fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo. Nuair a bhí sé féin agus mé féin mar Sheanadóirí ar Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge chuireamar cúrsa Gaeilge ar bun chun cabhrú le Teachtaí Dála agus Seanadóirí a raibh suim acu sa Ghaeilge. Chomh maith leis sin chuireamar córas aistriúcháin ar fáil sa Teach seo agus d'oscail an Taoiseach ag an am, Cathal Ó hEochaidh, seomra na Gaeilge. Bhí téipeanna agus taifeadtaí agus leabhair Ghaeilge ar fáil ann. Cad a tharla do na háiseanna sin? Iarrfaidh mé ar bhaill na gcomhchoistí na hábhair seo a fháil agus a chur ar fáil do Bhaill na dTithe seo a bhfuil neart Gaeilge acu agus a dteastaíonn uathu Gaeilge níos fearr a labhairt.</P>
      <P>Bhí suim mhór agam féin sa Ghaeilge le fada an lá. Nílimid chomh patriotic sa tír seo as we would like to believe. Cén fáth nach bhfuil brat na tíre ag eitilt i ngach scoil náisiúnta sa tír? Ba chóir é a ardú gach maidin agus é a thógáil síos gach tráthnóna.</P>
      <P>Have we any love for our national flag or do we treat it as just another something?</P>
      <P>Féach trasna ar mhuintir na Breataine. Tá a mbrat siúd ag eitilt ar gach scoil Breatainneach. Is amhlaidh in a lán tíortha eile. We must first have a love for our flag. National schools must engender the meaning of the flag in young people and fly it during school hours. There is some antipathy towards the national flag. Is brónach an scéal é.</P>
      <P>An bhfaca sibh foirne ó thíortha eile nuair a thagann siad anseo chun cluichí a imirt? When foreign national anthems are being played at soccer, rugby or American football matches, teams stand to attention and sing. Irish teams do not do so. Watch our teams. Seasann siad le lámh anseo is ansiúd agus focal ina mbéal acu. Not one of them opens their mouth to sing. Very few national schools teach the national anthem. Cén fáth? Tá sé in am é sin a thosú. It is time we made it clear to schools that they should teach pupils to sing the national anthem. Foreign teams stand to attention and sing their national anthems. I appeal in particular to the GAA to pay greater attention to this issue and to ask teams to learn and sing the national anthem. If the GAA does not give the national anthem a place of honour on auspicious occasions then how can we expect others to do so?</P>
      <P>Tá an Ghaeilge níos láidre ar fud na tíre anseo ná mar a bhí sé le fada an lá. Cloistear an-chuid daoine ag labhairt cúpla focail. Deir daoine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge an-deacair le foghlaim ach ní fíor sin.</P>

    <P>Tháinig bean ón mBreatain a bhfuil seacht nó ocht teanga aici go Conamara chun Gaeilge a fhoghlaim. D'éirigh lei agus anois múineann sí Gaeilge i gConamara. Nach dtaispeánann sé sin <Col N="740" /> go bhfuil rud éigin mícheart le muintir na tíre seo?</P>
    <P>Is mór an trua go bhfuil an teanga ag dul i laige sa Ghaeltacht. Níl a fhios agam cén fáth. Fuair mé mo chuid Gaeilge féin i nGaeltacht Chontae na Mí. Bhí mé ansin ar feadh deireadh seachtaine ceithre bliana ó shin agus bhí Gaeilge le clos i ngach áit agus chuidigh daoine liom sna siopaí Gaeilge a labhairt. Ach nuair a bhím i nDún na nGall nó i gConamara nuair a labhraím i nGaeilge faighim freagra i mBéarla. They have no time for people with broken Irish. English is the rule of the day.</P>
    <P>Tá sé in am deontais a thabhairt do dhaoine ar fud na tíre chun monarchana agus mar sin de a thógáil agus fostaíocht a chruthú áit a mbeidh an Ghaeilge in úsáid. The language would flourish more quickly if we paid grants to people outside Gaeltacht areas who were prepared to create employment and make use of the Irish language. It is not right that Gaeltacht areas receive so many grants while not promoting the language as they should be doing.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Raidió na Gaeltachta ach nílim chomh sásta sin le Teilifís na Gaeilge. Labhartar an Ghaeilge go han-tapa agus gearrtar na focail ionomarca. Is maith an Ghaeilge atá ag an Seanadóir Quill. Labhraíonn sí Gaeilge simplí. Cén fáth nach féidir le muintir na teilifíse labhairt ar an gcaoi chéanna? For too long they have been giving the impression that Irish was difficult like Latin.

    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to carry out a review of the operation of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, with particular reference to its effectiveness in eliminating the practice of below cost selling and the practice by some supermarket chains of absorbing VAT in order to gain competitive advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of reviewing legislation is important. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State have <Col N="741" /> at all times accepted that fact in legislation they have brought before the House, and they have often outlined the ways in which legislation and its implementation would be reviewed. It is important as a matter of principle that the effectiveness of legislation is reviewed to ensure it continues to perform the task for which it was enacted.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, covers all goods with the exception of fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh and frozen meat and fish, intoxicating liquor and other household goods ordinarily sold in grocery shops. The order prohibits practices such as below cost selling and &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money and provides for controls on terms and conditions of supply. I will deal in detail with those later.</P>
    <P>It was intended that the Restrictive Practices Act and its associated orders would be revoked when the Competition Act, 1991, came into effect. However, the only element of the restrictive practices legislation which was retained was the groceries order following lobbying from the retail grocery sector and the industry. The groceries order is considered controversial and there are two differing views on it. One is that it is harmful to consumers by restricting competition and that it has been set up to deal with a problem which does not exist. The opposite view is that it has protected small retailers and corner shops and has not allowed the dominance of the market by the large multiple chain stores. I can see value in both arguments.</P>
    <P>Small retailers and corner shops are invaluable in terms of their contribution to society. The convenience and flexibility of running to a shop around the corner two or three minutes from the house to buy a pint of milk or loaf of bread or something else which has run out is invaluable. The fact that one does not have to queue at a checkout for five or ten minutes is often invaluable, especially as we get busier &ndash; we often run in for milk or bread in the morning before the children go to school or late at night to prepare lunches for the next day.</P>
    <P>The corner shop is a valuable part of the community. It is where many people go on Sunday after Mass to pick up the newspapers and catch up on the local weekly gossip. People often go there to buy their lottery tickets. People see the local shop as a centre for the community. One of the faults found with newer housing estates is that there is no local centre where people can congregate and communicate. The corner shop is a vital part of the fabric of society. It also affords an opportunity for people to become self-employed by setting up small businesses. It is an economic necessity in terms of the employment it provides and the flexibility and service it gives to people who shop there. It is a vital component in society and also for competition in the trade. It keeps the larger retailers on their toes.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the functions of the groceries order. There is a ban on below cost selling, which is the sale of groceries below the net <Col N="742" /> invoice price. There is ban on &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money, which is the payment to a retailer by a supplier for stocking the supplier's good. Suppliers must also maintain published terms and conditions of supply and maintain a register of supplementary terms. Retailers may not receive any benefit from a supplier for advertising the supplier's goods and retailers must pay their suppliers on time in compliance with the supplier's published terms of credit. A supplier cannot discriminate for or against any retailer in the terms and conditions under which goods are supplied and a supplier cannot attempt to coerce a retailer in any way by threatening to withhold supplies or by any form of discrimination.</P>
    <P>I wish to touch on a number of those points. I do not intend to discuss the issue of &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money. It is under investigation by the Director of Consumer Affairs. If the Director of Consumer Affairs or a tribunal, for example, is asked to conduct an investigation, they should be let do their work. We need to be wary of the area of net invoice price and below cost selling. Since the takeover of the Quinnsworth chain by Tesco, much of the distribution is imported directly from the UK. It is possible for large multiples with a base outside of the State to set the invoice price outside of the State. Then the organisation may import those goods for a price which would be below the price which would be put on the invoice in this country. That is something of which we need to be wary. No doubt the Department and the director will be keeping that in mind.</P>
    <P>One other vitally important aspect of the groceries order is the fact that large purchasers must adhere to the published credit terms of small businesses and suppliers. Anybody who runs a business knows that cashflow is one of the most vital issues. One can be making a great deal of money in terms of profit but one's business will not be able to survive if the cashflow is not properly managed and if one's creditors are too large.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of complaints under the groceries order but few have ended up in court. There have also been complaints recently about the practice of selling three for the price of two in some of the larger supermarket chains. While that may have something to do with low cost selling, it is also important to remember that the rights of the consumer are at stake. Often a consumer chooses to go to a large supermarket to get value for money. It is vitally important to maintain competition and not to take away the opportunity for consumers to buy their weekly or monthly groceries at a fair and competitive price.</P>
    <P>The order was last reviewed in 1994 and 1995 and it has continued in existence since then. However, in 1996 the Competitions and Mergers Review Group was set up and it is currently reviewing the position of the groceries order as part of its work. Its terms of reference are to review and make recommendations on a number of areas, and it will be reporting back to the Minister later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> The group is also reviewing the effectiveness of the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996, including the structures and methods of applications. The group is also reviewing the position of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, particularly the below cost aspects of the order, and it will make the appropriate recommendations for the future.</P>
    <P>The reason for the motion is to focus attention on the importance of the review of this legislation, highlighting the importance of making sure there is not another price war in below cost selling and the practice of selling VAT free goods does not start in Ireland, particularly following the big change where many of the UK multiple stores entered the Irish market. Our purpose in tabling this motion is to ensure the protection of the jobs of the people working for suppliers and supermarkets in the industry in Ireland, to protect the rights of consumers and to ensure, where possible, that any savings which can be made through national distribution and large stores will be passed on to the consumer, but not to the extent that they will force smaller organisations and shops out of business.</P>
    <P>Competition is vital in this business. The culture of allowing enterpreneurs and small shopkeepers to open up and maintain businesses is also vital, as is the availablity of choice to all consumers. Between these three concepts lies the answer to what is necessary to make sure that this important trade is regulated and nobody loses out. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for coming this evening to hear the debate and look forward to what he and the Members have to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I compliment my colleague, Senator Cox, on outlining the motives behind the motion and on her lucid explanation of the various aspects. The groceries order is not as simple and straightforward as it seems, especially as, over the past ten years and since the order was introduced, this country has undergone a sea change in the retail trade. We are now coming closer to the traditional shopping concepts of mainland Europe as ever larger multiples enter the Irish market cornering ever larger percentages of the retail market to such an extent that the independent retailers, especially those represented by RGDATA, have had to quickly assess their position in the marketplace. In many cases retailers have taken the most logical direction, which is to merge or become involved in large distribution outlets where they can compete effectively with manufacturers and product sellers for product lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while the motion centres on the below cost element of the retail trade, this is also an opportunity to raise other issues which the Minister might address. For example, there is a worrying indication that the initiative taken by his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and <Col N="744" /> Local Government, last year to cap the size of retail outlets may be changed. In fact, the cap may be removed. That would result in a flood of international multiples, which are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see which way the Government will jump, arriving in Ireland to the detriment of the retail sector in general. I have always subscribed to the view that bigger is not always better. At the same time that particular philosophy is tinged with the reality that in the marketplace it is market conditions which invariably dictate whether anybody operating in the retail sector survives.</P>
    <P>We are in a market environment which unfortunately has become more cutthroat. This is especially the case in the grocery market where there is fierce competition to such an extent that companies are now allegedly operating dubious standards, in some instances perhaps sidestepping the law without actually stepping outside of it to maintain or protect their market share. I am not pointing the figure in any one direction because that is a matter for the Director of Consumer of Affairs to sort out, but most of us in this House should be concerned about what protective vehicle is in place for the consumer. Are these practices inhibiting the development of fair and free trade, and will they ultimately affect the retailer?</P>
    <P>In the context of bigger not being better, what would happen in Ireland if there were free and unfettered market conditions, if the groceries order was not in place and if there was no Government watchdog such as the Director of Consumer Affairs? Not only would avarice abound as people in the retail sector stampeded in an effort to make more money but, worryingly, under the guise of what is best for the consumer there would be a rapid diminution and an eventual elimination of competition. In such a scenario, which could be reached quickly in Ireland, one would end up with four or five major multiples controlling the grocery business. At that point we would see a cartel in operation and prices would inexorably start to rise. In addition, suppliers would find themselves being put on the wrong foot and being told that their goods would not be put on the shelves if they did not play ball.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would agree that there should be a healthy, vibrant independent sector. It is not in the best interests of the consumer that there would be a proliferation of multiple, super or hyper stores which would be allowed unfettered access to this market without some form of Government control. That is being said by someone whose political philosophy is that Government intervention should be at a minimum. I have always subscribed to the view that Governments should not be involved in businesses that do not concern them. In this instance, the interest of the consumer is paramount. Over the past number of years and at present, retail multiples have made commitments to protect the traditional suppliers of Irish manufactured goods. The reality is very different. One of these multiples <Col N="745" /> is importing English-made sandwiches. Bread has been the staple food for generations in Ireland. Yet, sandwiches are being manufactured in the United Kingdom, imported into this country and sold in a multiple supermarket in Dublin. This beggars belief.</P>
    <P>Are Irish consumers aware that every time they buy something that is not Irish made they threaten Irish jobs? The Government cannot say this because to do so would breach the spirit of EU treaties. However, I make no apology for saying that we should buy Irish whenever we can. I do not denigrate the manufactured goods of any other country. I merely suggest that Irish consumers should be conscious of the need to buy Irish, especially if the Irish product is as good as the imported one or superior to it.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Director of Consumer Affairs are to be commended for ensuring that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order is protected, strengthened and implemented effectively because it is not acceptable that goods which are being, and have traditionally been, manufactured in Ireland should be imported by retail multiples, reneging on guarantees given to Irish suppliers. If this is allowed to happen, the brave new world which was promised to Irish consumers will be under severe threat. I have no sympathy for such firms because they are not interested in Irish jobs, Irish consumers or the Irish market. They are interested only in profit.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in seconding the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. It is timely that this subject should be debated. All parties are <i>ad idem </i>on the vital national need to retain the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order. The Opposition agrees with the thrust of the motion. However, I am slightly confused to see that the motion calls for a review of the operation of the order when, in a written reply given yesterday to Deputy Owen in Dáil Éireann, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs. I am informed by the Director that ten cases have been investigated and a further three breaches of the Order have been taken to court since the Order's commencement. There have been over 60 complaints received by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>I have received no submissions calling for the abolition of the Groceries Order.</P>
      <P>The Groceries Order is currently being reviewed by the competition and mergers review group whose final report I expect to receive later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The groceries order is the last of the orders made under the Restrictive Practices Acts. All of the other orders and the Acts were repealed when the Competition Act, 1991 was introduced. The 1987 groceries order and the statutory mechanism to enforce it have been retained by successive Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. <Col N="746" /> The order has been retained because of perceived shortcomings in the Competitions Acts, 1991 and 1996 in preventing the abuse of market power by the large food multiples. In that regard, I concur with Senator Mooney's remarks.</P>
    <P>Approximately £5 billion is spent on groceries annually in Ireland. Expenditure on food covered by the groceries order accounts for approximately 25 per cent of average weekly income and up to 64,000 jobs are directly affected by the order. What happens in the grocery trade is of direct importance to the public. The order was introduced following the demise of H. Williams in 1986 when price wars between Dunnes Stores, Quinnsworth, Superquinn and H. Williams had exacted a heavy toll on retailers and suppliers. Suppliers, in particular, had to deal with demands for &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money, the abuse of credit terms and pressure for increased off-invoice discounts. Key lines were sold below cost by some of the grocery retailers but losses made on these lines were recouped from other lines in the shops.</P>
    <P>The order was retained because of perceived shortcomings in the new Competition Act, 1991. First, it was felt unlikely that any supplier would take an action against one of its main customers under the Competition Act, 1991. Second, it was felt that the public interest element concerning the affairs of the grocery trade required some impartial and consumer-led enforcement. Third, none of the practices banned by the groceries order are prohibited by the Competition Acts without a finding of dominance on the part of the retailers concerned. At present none of the retailers operating in Ireland are dominant in terms of their market share and without the 1987 groceries order they would be free to engage in demanding &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money, selling below cost and abusing suppliers' credit terms.</P>
    <P>Our colleague, Senator Quinn, recently argued that the groceries order places Irish retailers at a competitive disadvantage because it does not apply to retailers with a head office outside the State. On this basis, he has called for the abolition of the order and its replacement with the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that, as a matter of law, Senator Quinn is wrong in his assumption. The order applies to grocery goods sold in the State, regardless of where the head office of the retailer is located and contains a provision in Article 17 to facilitate the enforcement of the order in respect of goods imported into the State. Once the retailer has an operation in the State the order applies. If Senator Quinn was correct in his assumption that the absence of a head office in the State brought a retailer outside the scope of the groceries order then surely the same argument must apply in respect of the Competition Acts. Senator Quinn's position is illogical and wrong in law.</P>
    <P>Of course, bigger foreign retailers will get better terms. This is a function of their size and not of any ability to circumvent the groceries order. It would be contrary to EU rules to prevent foreign <Col N="747" /> retailers from availing of economies of scale on a European level. However, in respect of grocery goods obtained for supply to the Irish market foreign retailers must have regard to the provisions of the groceries order, 1987.</P>
    <P>This order does not contravene the EU single market. The European Court of Justice recently ruled, in the Keck case, that measures such as the groceries order did not contravene the single market rules if they apply equally to goods from all member states.</P>
    <P>Central Statistics Office figures since 1987 show that the goods covered by the groceries order have increased in price by well below the rate of inflation. They also show that many of the goods that are excluded from the order have increased at a rate close to, or higher than, the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The order ensures, therefore, that consumers are not subjected to predatory activity, such as below cost selling, and that suppliers do not have to deal with additional costs from &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money and the abuse of credit terms. The order inhibits the market power of the multiples in a market where none is deemed to be dominant under competition law.</P>
    <P>The groceries order protects fair trade. It has greatly helped to keep down food prices. Items covered by it have risen in value by 16 per cent less than those not covered. For example, tea is covered but fruit and vegetables, which are not, have risen greatly in price. The order provides for greater investment in the trade generally. It provides a certain stability for suppliers and manufacturers who know that new products can be brought to the market without getting caught up in a price war.</P>
    <P>All the small independent grocers are providing good quality shops. There has been an investment of £500 million in the development of smaller shops over the past ten years. Their existence is providing more competition.</P>
    <P>The Irish market is, as Senators have said, undergoing major changes due to the threat from outside multiples. Now is not the time for change. We are concerned with price, quality and consumer choice. No one wants a policy of social exclusion, which would be the result of wiping out the smaller shopkeeper.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Mooney about the damage which will be done to the heart and fabric of our towns if we allow these large shopping conglomerates to exceed the cap. I believe very much in the need for the cap. The joint committee on which Senator Cox and I have the honour of serving made a unanimous recommendation to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that the cap is too generous &ndash; we recommended a cap of 2,500 square metres rather than the existing level of 3,000 square metres.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned about provincial <Col N="748" /> Ireland and our towns and villages. In Britain, 42 per cent of villages no longer have a food shop.</P>

      <P>Tá mé lánsásta bheith anseo chun freagra a thabhairt ar an tairiscint seo. Tá mé anseo in ionad an Tánaiste, an Teachta Harney, atá an-ghnóthach le hobair Rialtais agus in ionad mo chomhghleacaí eile, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Kitt, atá thar lear ag cruinnithe idirnáisiúnta.</P>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, came into operation in December of that year. In the past few weeks one could be excused for thinking that the order only deals with support money &ndash; or &ldquo;Hello Money&rdquo; as it is more popularly known. That aspect of the order has certainly received a good deal of publicity, following allegations that a supermarket chain was demanding support money from suppliers before goods from that supplier would be placed on its shelves. However, all I will say about that this evening is that the Director of Consumer Affairs, who reports to our Department, is investigating the allegations and will decide what action, if any, is necessary when she has assembled all the relevant facts.</P>
      <P>In reality, the groceries order deals with many aspects of the trade in groceries. The order, of course, bans below cost selling, which is the sale of groceries at a price which is less than the net invoice price, and price fixing. The order deals with terms and conditions of supply, including credit terms. It bans discrimination by a supplier, either for or against any retailer, in the terms and conditions under which goods are supplied and it prohibits retailers from receiving benefit from a supplier for advertising that supplier's goods. Matters such as the unjustified withholding of goods, arbitrary discrimination and boycotts are also outlawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The groceries order has always been somewhat controversial legislation, as it essentially seems to represent interference by the State in free competition in an important market sector and to set that sector apart from all other trade sectors. As opposed to that, the grocery trade is very important for consumers and, of course, for those who participate in the trade. Those who want the order repealed argue that it restricts competition, tries to deal with a problem that does not exist and is harmful to consumers. Those in favour of the order claim that it has contributed to a reduction in the dominance of the large multiples <Col N="749" /> and has helped independent retailers to compete with the multiples on a fairer basis.</P>
    <P>Despite this controversy, I understand the Director of Consumer Affairs has not received any submissions asking for its removal. In fact, the only submissions which the director has ever received about the order have been campaigning for its retention. Similarly, our Department has not received any submissions looking for the deletion of the order from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Since the order came into effect, I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs has received over 60 complaints about alleged breaches of the order. Over half of these related to &ldquo;below cost&rdquo; selling, which involves the sale of groceries at a price which is below the net invoice price. The net invoice price, in turn, is defined as the price exclusive of any allowance or refund given on return to the supplier of the goods container and excluding any discounts, rebates or other deductions from the sum due to the supplier. This is one of the areas highlighted by the Senators and I can say it is one where the Director of Consumer Affairs has been particularly vigilant over the years.</P>
    <P>The work of the director in regard to the investigation of below cost selling has resulted in three court cases against retailers where the court found in favour of the director. In several other cases the complaint was settled before matters actually came before the courts. In many instances, of course, the intervention of the director was enough to rectify the situation without the necessity of further action.</P>
    <P>The question of supermarket chains absorbing tax in order to gain competitive advantage is also an issue that has been raised in the context of the groceries order. This practice could result in selling below cost and lead to a breach of the order. I am sure the Director of Consumer Affairs will investigate any specific cases which Members of the Oireachtas or any consumer might bring to her attention. Members can be assured that any complaint brought to the attention of our excellent Director of Consumer Affairs will be assiduously investigated and she will arrive at a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and virtually all the ministerial orders made under that Act, with the sole exception of the groceries order, were repealed with the coming into effect of the Competition Act, 1991. Thus, the groceries order was retained as it was. It has been reviewed on two occasions: first, in 1993 and latterly in 1995, when it was continued for another two years.</P>
    <P>The groceries order is currently being reviewed by the Competition and Mergers Review Group set up in 1996. The terms of reference of this group require it to make recommendations designed to further improve the competition regime in terms of its legislative provisions. The groceries order is also included in its remit. I understand the group is currently proceeding with its work on this and associated competition <Col N="750" /> law matters. It hopes to have its work in this regard completed later this year and will report and make recommendations in these important areas, including the groceries order. In this regard, the review group has received a significant number of submissions from interested parties. I intend to include the various contributions of all Senators for consideration by the review group.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to Senators Cox, Mooney and Coghlan for their very detailed, up to date and informed contributions. They are obviously very much in touch with the commercial environment, particularly with the choice required by the nation's consumers. The Government wants to ensure that competition exists and that opportunities exist for the small, independent retailers and multiples to co-exist and to provide consumers with a choice. We want to ensure that goods are sold to the consumer at a reasonable price without any latent or hidden illegal deductions. Our Department and the Director of Consumer Affairs will investigate any allegations brought to our attention.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister of State said about his intention to bring the views of this House to the attention of the review group. That, in itself, answers the motion. As with any motion before the House, its value is often in the debate it generates, which is sometimes broader than the issue. It sets the scene and often gives Ministers and Departments food for thought and ideas to formulate legislation and reviews of legislation.</P>
      <P>Some points were raised with regard to the size of retail outlets and there was concern that the cap would be removed. As Senator Coghlan said, we would be very concerned about that. The message from this House and from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business is very clear &ndash; that should be avoided if we do not want to follow trends in the UK and France. Senator Coghlan said that 42 per cent of villages in the UK have no food shops. That is not the type of country we want for many of the reasons outlines earlier.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the need for consumer protection. It is very important. At all times our concern must be for the protection of the consumer. The consumer is the person who buys the goods and who supplies the goods. We are all consumers. It is a steady chain and if one link breaks it will not augur well for society as a whole. We do not want any diminution of competition in this country. It is very important to retain the current level of competition and to ensure we look after the consumer at all times. The consumer will benefit from continued competition. However, if we enter a trade war nobody will benefit in the long term. As I said, the concept of society as a chain is important, and it is important that we do not break any links.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To refer back to a point of Senator Mooney, promises are made by organisations entering this country. We must be very careful and vigilant of <Col N="751" /> this &ndash; this is part of the job of the Director of Consumer Affairs. It is not good enough for companies to enter Ireland, as if on a white horse, while making all sorts of promises about goods being bought from Irish suppliers and there being few foreign inputs. If companies make promises they must keep them.</P>

      <P>Most companies in Ireland operate properly. If companies are not operating properly or have broken promises, I would like to see them taken to task. I would like to see every non-Irish good on a supermarket shelf that can be replaced by an Irish good, so replaced. I make no apology for that. It can support Irish jobs and maintain our economic growth and our society. Irish jobs are important to Ireland and our society is important. We must look after our own. If we do not look after our own in the European market, nobody else will do so. This starts from ensuring we protect Irish jobs and consumers. Where opportunities exist to make and keep profits, we must keep them in the country. Ultimately, it is the people of Ireland who benefit.</P>

      <P>This is a simple matter but it is exercising the minds of many residents in the vicinity of the Phoenix Park and around Dublin city. The proposal to close Spa Road in the Phoenix Park is a result of the worthwhile and desirable decision to upgrade the National Zoo by linking it with some of the lands of Áras an Uachtaráin and, thereby, overlapping into the area currently covered by Spa Road. The proposal is to incorporate Spa Road into the new development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new safari-type zoo is desirable so animals can live in more natural surroundings than the restrictive and constrained surroundings in which they are currently kept. However, Spa Road is a lovely little road inside the walls of the Phoenix Park. It comes up from the junction of Infirmary Road and North Circular Road and runs behind McKee Barracks. There is an entrance for motor traffic from that junction and a pedestrian entrance further along. Clearly it is used a lot and enjoyed by many local residents and people from <Col N="752" /> all over the city who go there, particularly on a Sunday afternoon.</P>
    <P>Opposition to its closure has come from the residents of Blackhorse Avenue, North Circular Road, Navan Road, Infirmary Road and Oxmantown Road, the people who would be most affected by the closure of Spa Road. Ideally the road should be kept open to both commuters and pedestrians, but if it is not possible to keep the road open to motorists, it should at least be kept open to pedestrians. I believe the road will enhance the new development, because the area bounds the extension that is envisaged and it would be an opportunity for the public to walk in the vicinity of the new zoo. It could be incorporated into the development without interfering with the road itself.</P>
    <P>The wish locally and citywide is that Spa Road in the Phoenix Park will be retained while the development proceeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Seanad as ucht an rún seo a chur síos. Táim anseo in áit an Aire de Valera atá gafa sa Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would like to say from the outset that the Minister has every sympathy with the thrust of the motion tabled by Senator Costello who seeks to retain the Spa Road in the Phoenix Park as a pedestrian route. I am pleased to have this opportunity to elaborate on her position.</P>
      <P>On examination of the Office of Public Works' proposals for the extension of Dublin Zoo, it became clear that closure of the Spa Road was envisaged as the road divides the existing lands of the zoo from the additional lands of Áras an Uachtaráin, which it is proposed to incorporate into the zoo.</P>
      <P>Traffic management policy for the Phoenix Park is set down in the Phoenix Park management plan which was adopted by Government in 1986. Under this plan, it has been the longstanding policy of the Department to close roads in the Phoenix Park to through traffic on a phased basis. The purpose of this is to reduce the accident rate and enhance the visitor experience by eliminating traffic in areas of the park, thus achieving a more peaceful atmosphere in those sections.</P>
      <P>To date, the road closures introduced have been very successful in terms of creating a safer and more tranquil environment for all park users. Closed roads include the Odd Lamp Road, Furze Road, Khyber Road and the Lower Glen Road. In light of this longstanding policy, the Minister is supportive of the proposed closure of the Spa Road to through vehicular traffic. However, she supports the objective of keeping the road open for pedestrian and cyclist use. She is aware also that there is concern among local residents about the proposed closure of a section of Spa Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the response of the Department under the public consultation process on the zoo proposals, the Office of Public Works has been <Col N="753" /> informed of the Minister's views on Spa Road. She has suggested to the Office of Public Works that further consideration be given to the feasibility of accommodating pedestrian access and a cycle way through this road. The Office of Public Works will have to consider the operational and financial realities in the overall context of the development of Dublin Zoo. It must be acknowledged that the achievement of such an objective is likely to have logistical and financial implications, as a means would have to be found to secure the zoo adequately while at the same time providing some form of access for the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister is expecting a response from the Office of Public Works within the next few weeks and she hopes to be in a position to make a final decision on the subject soon after. The outcome is somewhat uncertain at this stage, but the Minister will be happy to inform the Senator of the final decision in the matter. Mo leithscéal ar son an Aire arís.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with this important matter. I assume he has good news for me.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that Nenagh courthouse has been closed since 8 February resulting in considerable problems for members of the public and users of the courthouse. The courthouse is a very fine building, as are many courthouses throughout the country. It dominates Banba Square in the centre of Nenagh and is a building of considerable historic, architectural and heritage importance. However, the condition of the courthouse has deteriorated to such an extent that it is no longer suitable for public use. The Department found the building to be unsafe and took the initiative to close it to protect public health. This is very serious given that the county council, who currently has administrative offices in the back section of the courthouse, has indicated its intention to move out of the building into new county council offices in Limerick Road, Nenagh. This raises concerns for the future of the building. In fact, one public official mentioned selling the courthouse and turning it into a hotel. However, I and others are determined this will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>North Tipperary County Council has stated that it is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide funds for the refurbishment and restoration of the courthouse, and I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify the matter. I have received correspondence also from the Tipperary and Offaly Sessional Bar Association expressing their concern about the matter and stating that it is their opinion that lack of funds is not the problem; the problem seems to be spending the funds. I would appreciate if the matter could be clarified because it is of considerable importance to the people of Nenagh. This afternoon I spoke to a barrister from the midlands who informed me that there is <Col N="754" /> a similar problem in Portlaoise and that the courthouse in Longford has been closed for two years. I understand from other sources that there has been a local agreement in relation to Longford courthouse.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record that it is the unanimous view of the local community whom I consulted &ndash; even if the county council did not &ndash; that this building be retained in public hands and not be sold for commercial purposes or to fund the building of new county council offices. That would be an outrage and will be strongly resisted. I know I speak for the community in Nenagh when I say that it would be outrageous if a public building of this stature is sold and turned into a commercial operation in order to fund the expansionist mentality of the county council officials. Finally, this very fine building is badly in need of restoration and my question is who will carry out the repairs?</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Meara said it was necessary to close the main entrance and the Circuit Court room at Nenagh courthouse as a result of the dangerous condition of the ceilings in these particular areas of the building. The District Court continues to sit in the courthouse at present with access through the county council office entrance.</P>
      <P>It was reported to my Department in early February that a portion of the plaster had fallen from the ceiling in the Circuit Court room. My Department immediately asked Tipperary North Riding County Council to appoint an independent structural engineer to investigate the matter and to report on the condition of the courthouse. The structural engineer examined the courthouse in conjunction with my Department's architect on 8 February and a decision was made on the same day to prevent access by the public to the main entrance hall and the Circuit Court room on the grounds of public safety.</P>
      <P>My Department has commenced consultation with Tipperary North Riding County Council regarding the actions to be taken to address this serious situation which has arisen. Arrangements are being made to hold the next sitting of the Circuit Court in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>Given the extent of the problems identified by the structural engineer it is evident that the best solution to the problems which have arisen lies in the full refurbishment of Nenagh courthouse. My Department had always intended to refurbish Nenagh courthouse when it was vacated by the county council staff but this would not have been for another couple of years. As the Senator is probably aware the county council has plans to move its offices to a new site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to act more quickly than previously planned. My officials will meet county council officials in the near future with a view to progressing the refurbishment of the courthouse so that the current difficulties can be addressed <Col N="755" /> and to provide upgraded facilities for all court users in the Nenagh area.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that my Department recently carried out works on the Roscrea courthouse. It would be wrong to have a beautiful courthouse in Roscrea and not to have one of equal merit in Nenagh.</P>
    <P>I understand the Senator's concern with regard <Col N="756" /> to turning Nenagh courthouse into a hotel. Years ago it was not unusual for people to turn hotels into courthouses but I assure her that Nenagh courthouse will be refurbished at the earliest possible date and I will keep her informed of developments.</P>
